	<P>I have received notice from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health to clarify his position on the commitment entered into with the WHO in 2003 on implementing  the Vision 2020 strategy; to outline when he proposes to set up a national co-ordinating committee to develop and implement a national vision policy, strategy and plan and who will be on that committee; and if he can confirm the commitment to support the campaign of the Vision Impaired Service Alliance regarding service provision, research and support for visually impaired people in Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister of Health to review the case for the provision of diabetic pumps and the appropriate backup staff for children with type 1 diabetes in County Galway.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Marc MacSharry  of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister of Education and Skills to address the issues faced due to increased pupil numbers and the lack of teaching posts at Gaelscoil Chnoc na R&eacute;, Ballydoogan, County Sligo.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to review the deplorable conditions at Scoil Ghorm&aacute;n Naofa, Castletown, Gorey, County Wexford; and to make a statement in relation to the prospect of a rebuild or refurbishment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill 2011 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 5 p.m., if not previously concluded; No. 2, motion for earlier signature of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions <Col N="896"/>(Resolution) (No. 2) Bill 2011, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 1; and No. 16, motion No. 6, Private Members&rsquo; business, to be taken at 5 p.m. and conclude not later than 7 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Can we have an immediate debate on the issue of Aviva?  For more than two months now, my colleague, Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, has flagged this potential issue.  I called for a task force to engage with all companies supported by Enterprise Ireland and the IDA throughout the country in order to anticipate any issues or difficulties they might have and to put forward help and suggestions to ensure their continuity here and the protection of jobs.  This was clearly ignored.  Our information outlines the fact that the Minister was informed last week  &mdash; unfortunately workers had to read this on Twitter yesterday evening and in today&rsquo;s headlines &mdash; that up to 1,000 jobs would be lost at Aviva throughout the country.  This is catastrophic news for those families, for Dublin city, Cork, Galway and the other parts of the country that will be affected.  We needed to get in to do a pre-emptive strike and to engage with these companies to ensure they had adequate supports and that jobs were protected.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">It is no consolation to the families involved or to Ireland that this morning in Manchester the head of branding at Aviva, Ms Susan Helmont, will give a presentation on the secret of the company&rsquo;s success.  One wonders if, within the secret of that success, is the fact that the company gets the naming rights to the Aviva Stadium for &euro;40 million when the people of Ireland invested &euro;191 million.  I ask the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, to give an explanation immediately on whether he engaged with the company over the past number of weeks, the suggestions brought to the company to protect the jobs and how in God&rsquo;s name any Government can preside over a company that talks about the secret of its success in Manchester on the same morning as it is telling 1,000 families in Ireland that they are no longer required to contribute to the success of the company.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I apologise for raising health issues because I know that we have a debate on 27 October but this is too big an issue to confine to one debate.  This morning we heard reports that we will subcontract the management of hospitals in HSE West to a private consultancy firm.  Can the Leader seek clarification on how much this will cost the health service?  Will other staff and management be sidelined while consultants come in to do their jobs?  Is there a redundancy package if they are surplus to requirements or incapable of doing their jobs?  What hospitals are directly affected?  The people of Ireland are entitled to know whether the HSE, which is responsible for more than 50% of the tax take of this country, is about to give that money to management consultants to tell us how we should be doing a job that professionals in the health service should know how to do.  If they are not doing it correctly, why are we hanging on to them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>We all share Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s grave concern for the families and workers to be affected by the proposed and expected major lay-offs in the Aviva company.  The unemployment fall-out from the fiscal and banking mismanagement in this country and elsewhere has not fully washed through the system.  For many families, the worst is not over yet and they face the prospect of having no job coming up to Christmas.</P>
        <P>We must be horrified for the families affected by the Priory Hall fiasco.  That situation is only the tip of the iceberg regarding the issue of dodgy house building by cowboys in this sector.  There has been much handwringing by many of the stakeholders in this sector, including the Construction Industry Federation and others, who say that it has nothing to do with them. <Col N="897"/> I do not agree and I would like to have the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Penrose, in the Chamber to hear his proposals on tightening up in this area.  This is another example where light touch regulation has landed us in a fine mess, similar to the light touch regulation in the banking system.  I was horrified to learn recently at a local authority briefing that only 15% of all construction projects are inspected by planning enforcement officers from local authorities because the industry is supposed to be self-regulatory.  That system does not work in banking or construction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, for his genuine effort to engage with turf cutters around the country to solve the issue and to strike a fair and reasonable balance between turf cutting for domestic use and the important issue of conservation and preservation.  I appeal to those who represent large turf cutting contractors to engage in a genuine and meaningful effort to solve the problem.</P>
        <P>We all agree that press freedom and fair comment are cornerstones and fundamental values in our democracy.  Fair comment in the public interest is a pillar of a real republic.  I was shocked to learn at weekend of the <i>de facto</i> sacking from Today FM of the prominent press man, Sam Smyth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a matter for the Order Of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is, and I will tell the House why.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That is a private contract and we cannot have the Senator naming individuals on the Order of Business.  Does he have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>What I am addressing is not a personal or private matter and I do not seek to single out any proprietor or an individual journalist.  There is a fundamental matter of press freedom, freedom of speech and fair comment in the public interest, no matter who it concerns.  Everyone in this country would be a lot poorer if we did not have an unhindered press.  We must also deal with the issue of proprietorial interference.  This week, the director general of RTE, Noel Curran, made a significant keynote speech assuring the public that investigative journalism will be one of the key cornerstones of RTE&rsquo;s remit.  I call for a special debate with the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to discuss media ownership and control at the earliest possible juncture so that we can hear the legislative proposals he has and so that the Seanad can have an early input into the proposal and the legislation.  This is a fundamental matter for democracy and a national issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senator Whelan&rsquo;s call for a debate on media ownership.  I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s publication by the HSE of a series of reports undertaken by the national review panel for serious incidents and child deaths.  This report details the circumstances of child deaths and serious incidents involving children and young people.  The first annual report of the national review panel was also published yesterday and it provided an overview of the work carried out by the group since its establishment in 2010.  It is the first of what I hope will be an annual report.  The report highlighted a number of deficiencies in the current child protection system, including several breaches of Children First guidelines, inadequate supervision of practices in the HSE and family services in a number of cases and the absence of a standardised method of assessing the needs of children and young people who come to the attention of social services.  The report also exposed the need for specialist training for social workers to improve investigative skills and to assist in engaging with hard to reach families.  It also highlighted the need to develop additional protocols for children who abscond <Col N="898"/>from care and the very real need for after-care support as children make the transition to adulthood.  I fully support the review panel&rsquo;s recommendations.  The reason I am raising this in the House is that report raises the question of whether we need greater scrutiny, which I feel we need.  I am concerned that the report of the national review panel states its workload is virtually impossible to carry out owing to the number and breadth of inquiries it must instigate.  Every one of those inquiries is a child death or serious incident.  This is not just a pile of paper, each one represents a child.  It has been reported that the panel was asked to review 51 cases, including 35 deaths, since its establishment in March 2010.  It is imperative that the panel is adequately resourced to ensure the timely, proper and full investigation of these cases.  Each and every childhood counts and key lessons can be learned from the reports, which will inform policy and child protection and welfare and prevent future child deaths.  These lessons must be seized on.  I call on the Leader to request the Government to entrust the receipt of these reports in full to the Joint Committee on Health and Children in order that it will facilitate appropriate scrutiny of the child protection systems within the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I express my agreement with comments about Aviva this morning.  Two important fixtures face the Irish football team and one of them will take place in the Aviva Stadium.  It will stick in the craws of many people to attend fixtures at a wonderful national arena at a time when there does not seem to be a commitment to this country on the part of the company whose name is on the front of the stadium.</P>
        <P>Already this morning, certain vested interests have sought to criticise the decision of the European Court of Justice, which has restricted the patenting of a stem cell research technique, which involves taking stem cells from a human embryo and destroying human embryos in the process.  This decision by the European Court of Justice is very much to be welcomed.  It is clear from the wording and language that the decision was taken with human dignity very much in mind.  Nor have the voices expressing concern about what was proposed to be permitted been solely religious voices; the challenge was originated by Greenpeace.  This shows there are people of diverse religious and philosophical perspectives in our society who place great store in protecting human life in its early stages.  One of the more manipulative dimensions of this debate is the broad and exaggerated claims for future cures which are linked with embyro-destructive research.  The reality is that much of the progress and potential can be associated with induced pluripotent stem cell research, which does not involve the destruction of early human life.  Patenting is important because the only thing worse than the exploitation of human life is the privatised and commercialised exploitation of human life.  We should all regard this decision by the European Court of Justice as a good news story.  I hope the Government will always consider it part of its mission to join the ranks of those focusing on adult stem cell research and the promising moves being made in that direction in the search for the cures and treatments we all desire for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join Senator Marc MacSharry and other speakers in voicing my concerns about the name of our national football and rugby stadium.  Unfortunately, we all seem to have taken quickly to referring to it by its new name.  If Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s figures are correct, we have more of a right to call it Lansdowne Road Stadium than Aviva does to call it by its new name.  I cannot understand why we all &mdash; I include myself in this &mdash; took to the new name so easily.</P>
        <P>Solutions must be found to the situation at Priory Hall.  The provision of hotel accommodation for residents is an acceptable temporary measure, but it will not do in the long term.  As Senator Mark Daly argued yesterday, we must demand that NAMA jump into the breach rather than asking or hoping that it will.  I urge the Government to apply sufficient pressure to <Col N="899"/>the agency in this regard.  It is somewhat ironic that NAMA would not take this approach automatically given that it is developers who make up the sum total of its clientele.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to consumer rights, I welcome the measures unveiled yesterday by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  Building upon the recently passed EU consumer rights directive, the Minister announced a range of initiatives which will serve to offer further safeguards to consumers.  The ban on excessive payment fees, for example, will apply to online transactions and booking fees.  This is particularly pertinent in regard to Ryanair and other airlines which have made a point of charging fees far in excess of transaction costs.  Under the new provisions, retailers, both online and offline, will not be permitted to charge a payment fee in excess of the cost of the transaction.  This is a positive move which will remove any ambiguity in respect of the process.  However, we should bear in mind recent reports of an 800% rise in the cost of card processing faced by some retailers as a consequence of the change from Laser to Visa debit. </P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and I wish to highlight the issue.  These enhanced consumer rights are a positive development.  Of particular interest is the ban on pre-ticked boxes.  For instance, when booking a flight online the option for purchasing travel insurance is often preselected.  Older people in particular may not be aware that they are being charged for such options.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Such issues should be raised by the Senator in the relevant debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to the House to discuss these and other issues?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse the points made by Senator Jillian van Turnhout on the report published by the national review panel for serious incidents and child deaths.  It is a well researched document which retains the confidentiality of those involved.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on this report so that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, can outline her response?  The public service recruitment embargo should not apply in respect of social workers.  The question of how an 18 year old can be released from State care without support must be addressed by the Minister.  The HSE cannot bear full responsibility in these matters; the Government and all Oireachtas Members have a role to play.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I compliment RTE and presenter &Aacute;ine Lawlor, in particular, on their excellent documentary on the President, Mary McAleese, and the support given to her throughout her presidency by her husband and our colleague, Senator Martin McAleese.  It was a great tribute to her presidency.  We are not permitted to say much about this, but I fundamentally disagree with Mr. Diarmaid Ferriter that the role of President is primarily one of leader of trade missions.  As a former Minister of State with responsibility for trade I realise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not comment on the role of the President.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Cathaoirleach that I do so on a very complimentary basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>It is nice to hear something positive for a change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed.  Ms McAleese is a great example to us all and has been a credit to the country for the past 14 years.  She has achieved everything she set out to do.  She certainly has been instrumental in leading trade missions; that is part of her duty and I hope <Col N="900"/>the next President will be as active.  However, she will be a hard act to follow in all aspects of her role and if some of the candidates had viewed this documentary six months ago, they would not be in the field.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Senator have anybody in mind?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to welcoming Ms McAleese and her husband, Senator McAleese, back to their family home in Cootehall in County Roscommon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>Up Roscommon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We in County Roscommon are very proud that the President and her family will be living there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join other speakers in voicing my concern at the loss of 1,000 jobs at Aviva.  Together with colleagues, I raised the issue three or four weeks ago.  It has taken the company that length of time to announce the bad news.  The situation has been speculated about, including on Twitter and Facebook, for weeks, which is most inappropriate.  For a company of Aviva&rsquo;s size to behave so deplorably is extremely regrettable.  I call on the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to articulate the concerns of this House to the company management.  I also call on the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, to see whether it can reconsider its arrangement with Aviva in terms of the naming of the national football stadium.  Surely there was another organisation willing to come up with the sponsorship money.  I encourage the FAI to break its contractual arrangements with Aviva and to enter into negotiations with another, more ethical, corporate sponsor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It would take a crane to remove the sign.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I am confident there will be plenty of volunteers.</P>
        
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Yesterday I raised the issue of the unfortunate situation in north Dublin.  It has come to may attention that there may well be other such developments in this city whose status will be adjudicated on in the courts.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Willie Penrose, to the House in order to ascertain the extent of this problem?  These difficulties have arisen because the building regulations that were in place for the last ten years were not enforced.  While developers secured planning permission on the basis of their adhering to all the regulations, the inspection process completely collapsed once the developments were completed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The sad reality is that many of the dodgy engineers and architects who signed off and certified these buildings are now out of business.  Who will ultimately be responsible for the bill?  It is completely unacceptable that it should be the taxpayer.  This is an extremely serious issue, with thousands of houses throughout the State constructed in a questionable manner.  There are blocks of apartments and other developments throughout this city and in the other major cities where the building regulations were severely compromised. </P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>On the matter raised by our colleague, Senator Conway, it is time to bring back the snag man for both individual purchases of buildings and housing and where <Col N="901"/>the State purchases properties on behalf of individuals.  Most builders hate the snag man but he does a valuable service for the consumer which has been missed.</P>
        <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his intervention in an issue we raised here yesterday, namely, the 9 foot high sea wall in Clontarf.  The Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il that it is visually appealing for people to be able to see the bay and to have a levee of that scale would cause people to feel rightly aggrieved.  He called for compromise on the issue but as I stated yesterday, the compromise exists in that those who travel the coast road from Dublin to Howth are aware that after the Clontarf wooden bridge there is an area of mudflats, which is a ready made reservoir for the water which now floods Clontarf and cannot get out the mouth of the harbour between the two lighthouses when the tide is coming in.  It requires Dublin Corporation to breach a causeway to allow the water to flow out.  There is approximately four or five miles of capacity to take the water that now floods Clontarf.  The late Se&aacute;n Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus raised this issue many times and it has now come back as a live issue.  I ask the Leader to thank the Taoiseach for his helpful intervention and press the alternative Sutton Creek proposal to relieve that flooding on the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo Senator Conway&rsquo;s sentiments.  I did not realise until yesterday that one of the victims of the recession was Proctor &amp; Gamble because Fairy liquid was used in the building of most of the buildings in this country.  That lasts about ten years and therefore many of them will crumble and fall down.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was delayed getting here yesterday when I am sure the issue of the Keane report was raised because I was with one of the unfortunate victims with which the report deals.  There is an interesting document floating around the House, the Proclamation, which perhaps some of us should read.  It states that Ireland should cherish all of its children equally.  We are not doing that.  When I read the Keane report last week I was fuming.  It was defended in the D&aacute;il yesterday to the effect that it is intended to send our children and their parents to the poorhouse; we will give them a council house. That is a great cure for the problem after we fattened the bankers by giving them &euro;70 billion and let off the biggest borrowers and developers. We did not ask them to pay anything back but rather let them get off scot free. We are paying salaries of between &euro;150,000 and &euro;200,000 to some of them to keep their businesses going. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>We are giving them &euro;700 million next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is more money.  Senator MacSharry brought a Bill before the House recently on mortgages on houses.  It was a good Bill that required some touching up.  We have a responsibility to all the people of this country and to the 30 children who sat in the Gallery a while ago to work together to find a solution.</P>
        <P>Another Bill came before the D&aacute;il yesterday and I have a question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry.  Another good Bill came before the D&aacute;il yesterday from the Fianna F&aacute;il grouping.  Last night, Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy invited representatives of NewBeginning to give us a briefing in the Seanad but unfortunately not all of those whoshould have been present were present.  I suggest that representatives of New Beginningbe invited to this House if it is possible; I do not know if the rules allow for that.  I suggestwe invite all the representatives of those groupings and sit down together for a discussion.  I <Col N="902"/>would love to see Mr. Keane come into this House and defend that raim&eacute;is he published last week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I was challenged in the House last night by Senator Byrne &mdash; we were all challenged &mdash; on whether we had the courage to state that and stand over it.  Yes, I have the courage.  As a member of my party and a Member of this Seanad I will not put up with that.</P>

        <P>I ask that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, be asked to come into the House to discuss the issue of our natural resources.  We have had Laurel and Hardy politics in these Houses in recent years regarding our natural resources of oil and gas where successive Ministers wrote away our finite natural resources, which are worth a huge amount of money to us.  Previous Governments did that and this Government is following through on the same policy of handing over our natural resources to big businesses.  We are hand-wringing around the Aviva issue but it is obvious that both the previous Government and this Government are in cahoots with big business and instead of standing up for the people of this country are standing with the people in big business.  The Minister&rsquo;s decision to issue an additional 13 licences for exploration in the oil and gas basins off our west coast is scandalous when one takes into consideration that an Oireachtas committee is supposed to be discussing the licensing regime to be put in place.  We are giving away the family silver before we discuss the rules on that.  It is a scandal.  Ba cheart don Aire teacht isteach <Col N="903"/>anseo agus m&iacute;ni&uacute; d&uacute;inn c&eacute;n f&aacute;th go bhfuil s&eacute; ag lean&uacute;int leis an pholasa&iacute; n&aacute;r oibrigh roimhe seo.

	<P>Increasingly lately we hear of the exorbitant fees that are being skimmed off people who have saved for pensions.  We are aware of the crisis in the pensions industry but we have learned that the charges can be as much as one third of what hard-pressed people have put aside in pension funds.  I read that the Taoiseach referred to that, which I welcome, and that we will have a report on pensions from the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, which will lay bare the hard facts and the rip-off taking place in the pensions industry.  I ask the Leader for a debate in this House on the pensions crisis once that report is available.  I am aware Senator Barrett took part in a debate on this important subject last Sunday in Kenmare.  There is so much concern about the issue it would make a worthy debate to have here as early as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Whelan made an important contribution.  I support his call for a debate on the ownership and control of the media in Ireland.  It is not that long ago that we were all convulsed with what we heard from the <i>News of the World</i>.  We saw something happening in that case that indicated there was not due vigilance and monitoring.  That went probably to the highest office in the land, and we have seen since resignations of senior people.  The paper has closed down and the reverberations will be felt for a long time to come.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland has been exceptionally well served by the media.  They have made an important contribution to the cultural, social, economic and political life of the country.  They have turned many a stone that needed to be turned.  On the other hand, they ruined many a character of innocent people, Fr. Reynolds being the most recent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course.  I was delighted the director general issued another apology three days ago on that issue.  That was the right thing to do but what I think&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, I ruled on this issue last week.  I ask you to refrain from mentioning that case.  It is before the High Court and Standing Order 47 specifically relates to it.  I ask you to refrain from speaking on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>What is important when we come to discuss the media in Ireland, is that we consider the monopolies that are developing.  I can recall that when local radio was being established it was intended to give a voice to each community.  Monopolies have since developed and we have seen ownership from what could be considered a monopoly creeping in to local radio.  We have seen local newspapers being bought by agencies outside this country &mdash; my own area being an example of that.  If this is the case, why are we not having a debate on the issue of responsibility of monopolies?  Nine or ten years ago we were particularly worried about this issue and since then much has happened that should not have happened.  I would like the Minister to come to the House to debate this issue very shortly.  I think it is not just for the good of the country but in the long term it will benefit the media.</P>
      </Speaker>
       <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Less than a month ago, on 21 September, Aviva issued this statement: &ldquo;Aviva is committed to Ireland, where we have had a business for over 100 years.&rdquo;  Today, we find out that 950 employees are to be let go.  Quite a number of those employees <Col N="904"/>work in Knocknacarra, Galway.  I would like the company to think of its employees and their families.  Aviva still wants the people to buy insurance from it and for that it should show loyalty to the people who work for the company.  I request the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton to write to all the companies in the country who trade here about the manner in which they deal with employees and give notice of redundancy.  The very least people deserve is forward planning and time.  I am not at all happy with the manner in which Aviva has treated its employees.</P>
       <P Just="Left">Second, I wish to raise the issues of helping people with mortgages to hold on to their homes.  Yesterday, New Beginning and others who are proposing solutions to help people keep their homes made a very interesting presentation to members in the AV room.  I am quite disgusted with some of the proposals in the Keane report, which I think is fit for no more that 5% to 10% of people who cannot be helped in any way.  The majority can benefit from some forward planning and restructuring, and avail of non-court based approaches.  That is the reason I did not support the Bill from the other side of the House.  We need solutions that do not rely on the courts.  New Beginning and others have made great proposals.  We need to show leadership in this House.  We must have a debate in the Chamber.  I ask the Leader to invite Deputy Michael Noonan, the Minister for Finance, a good man who can empathise with others, to listen to other solutions, besides the Keane report, that will help people to keep their homes.  The Keane report is not an adequate response and it is letting us down.  We are far better than that.  Will the Leader consider also a means to facilitate whereby those who come up with other solutions can be heard in this House?  That would be a brave new step for this House.  We must help people to hold on to their jobs but most especially to hold on to their homes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>On Monday I got a call from &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
	<P>We normally ring it when we have late night sittings</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Was it the acting President?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason I bring it up is that it was a call inquiring about the health of my mother-in-law.  Her 102nd birthday was due to fall on 10 November and the President wanted to know to which address she should send the letter of recognition.  Unfortunately, my mother-in-law died a few months ago and I was able to tell them that.  This is a reminder of what we are able to do if we commit ourselves.  President Mary McAleese has not just given a very generous gift on each 100 year birthday but has put in motion the marking and recognition of each subsequent birthday, a token that my mother-in-law got last year.  Mrs Grace Prendergast was looking forward to her 102nd birthday, but unfortunately it was not to be.</P>
        <P>Some months ago there was talk of whether we need a President at all.  It is a reminder of what we can do, if we can manage to recognise the benefits of the institutions we have and the people we elect who are able to make of those institutions something that can be of significant benefit to the community as President McAleese and other Presidents have done.  It reminds me of this House because at the same time we were talking about the need for the office of the Presidency, the question cropped up as to whether we need a Seanad.  I think it is fair to say that the Presidency has earned the respect of this country.  If we are to maintain this House, and I really believe in this House, it is up to us to do something about it.  It will not just happen.  The onus of responsibility is on us to do something.  I am not sure but I understood that there was a process in being to see how we could manage the affairs of this House.  I am not just talking about reform of the Seanad because we have had plenty of that before but I am posing <Col N="905"/>the question of what we in this House will do.  The Leader has done a very good job since he came in here.  I believe the value of the Seanad is being recognised.  We have not gone nearly far enough and can do much more.  If we are still around as a forum in years to come, it is in our own hands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I had signalled I wished to raise the issue of pensions.  Senator Paul Coghlan just mentioned the rip-off pensions.  A third of the pot of a person&rsquo;s pension is at risk of being totally diluted and eaten up.  The figures are startling.  On Monday night, RTE did a programme on pensions.  People are absolutely shocked to learn that one third of their money is swallowed up in a black hole.  In actual fact the Irish pensions industry could be swallowing up to &euro;1 billion a year in fees.  A research specialist in NUI Maynooth had to spend several years trying to figure out the actual fees being charged and an economist has spent a couple of years trying to set up his own pension pot without being ripped off in fees and has still not figured it out.  I ask the Minister for Social Protection to investigate what the Pensions Board, a statutory body established in 1990, is doing.  One of the remits of the Pensions Board is to protect the interests of pension scheme members.  I ask you.  Here we are in 2011, 21 years since its establishment in 1990, and it took a television programme, a specialist in Maynooth, an economist and a television presenter to tell us that a third of a person&rsquo;s pension is being ripped of.  I have asked for the issue of pensions to be put on the agenda, in addition to ask the Pensions Board to carry out its remit and to research where the people&rsquo;s money is going.  It is said that &euro;1 billion a year is paid in fees, which is a total rip off.  I am asking the Leader to invite the Minister to the Chamber to investigate the hidden costs and the charges applied by companies and to advise people on the best offers in pensions.  At this stage we have to do it if we are concerned about society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be grateful if the Leader could find out from the Minister for Health if it would be possible to clarify the lead up to, the circumstances of, and the implementation of a decision to bring in a firm of private management consultants to run the hospital services in Galway and Limerick.  This is a fundamental shift in the way a large part of the acute hospital service will be run and co-ordinated.  I have a perspective on this and would be anxious to have the opportunity to discuss it with the Minister, if possible.  In a few months it will be the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i>.  The <i>Titanic</i> analogies are done to death when discussing the health service, but in the health service geographical area in question where the waiting list for some outpatient appointments can be up to two years and which is desperately short of all the specialists needed to implement the services, the idea that the right way to fix the system is to bring in more managers is similar to bringing in a new organisation of coxswains on the sinking <i>Titanic</i> to man the few lifeboats that remain to ensure that the 700 rather than the 2,200 patients can access lifeboats in an orderly fashion.</P>
        <P>Clearly, a more fundamental shift is necessary in how the health system is run, managed and led.  I ask the Minister to consider the possibility that, perhaps, what is needed is not new management, but new leadership.  We must develop a new culture of leadership with professional technical management, rather than having a culture where, in a leadership vacuum, the leadership is provided by technical managers who do not have the vision of what the health service should be.  I do not believe the new managers coming in, although I wish them well in their thankless task, will necessarily bring the skill set that is required.  We need something much more fundamental.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by my colleague, Senator Healy Eames, for a debate on the Keane report.  I understand we are due to have a debate next week.  In light of Senator Quinn&rsquo;s comments about the future of the Seanad and how we conduct our business, <Col N="906"/>would it be possible to structure that debate in such a way that there is a commitment that the contributions will be very precise and will actually be used in building on what the Keane report can do and in which we can channel to the Minister the contributions to the debate of organisations such as New Beginning?</P>
         <P>The Minister has said that the Keane report is part of the process, a beginning as it were.  In that regard I welcomed it as a contribution to how we can work together to improve the plight of those who are suffering and struggling with their mortgages.  Members of the House must find a way, perhaps with the assistance of the Leader and the Minister, to ensure that those contributions are made as specific parts of that process.  Time is not on anybody&rsquo;s side in this.  The people who are struggling are doing so on a daily basis and they cannot wait for us to pontificate.  Perhaps we can find a way in that debate for, in the future, conducting very precise contributions.  Is some slight alteration required to do that?  Forgive me for not knowing the answer at this point but is there a specific way in which we can contribute on that day?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the call by Senator Whelan for a discussion on the role of the media in the State.  Often when such a call is made, politicians are accused of being opposed to freedom of speech.  However, the opposite is the case.  The point being made, which I would also make, is that the monopoly a certain number of individuals have of the media in this country and abroad is a contradiction and does not allow proper freedom of speech.  It is not inclusive and diverse opinions are not allowed because of the class of people that is represented by some of the people who own the media in this country.  If we have a discussion on the media, we should include both the public and private sector State broadcasters as well.</P>
        <P>I also support the calls for a discussion on the Keane report.  I offer my sympathy to the people in Aviva Insurance who have lost their jobs.  Senator Mulcahy gave a powerful speech this morning about unfairness in society generally and referred to the Keane report.  As I pointed out yesterday, a single unguaranteed bondholder will be paid &euro;700 million on 2 November and &euro;1.2 billion next January from money that we are borrowing from the IMF and the European Central Bank to pay back unguaranteed bondholders.  Politicians on the other side of the House tend to drop their heads and sigh when I raise these issues, perhaps because I raise them continuously.  However, I do so because they are the most important issues facing this State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are to have debates on the Keane report and other matters but, as Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said, at the same time we are giving away the family jewels through privatisation of State assets and giving away money we are borrowing to bondholders who speculated and gambled.  As these are unguaranteed bonds, there is no moral or legal responsibility on the State to do so, yet that is what the Government is doing.  That is two-faced, to be frank.  There is no point in saying anything else.  We cannot on the one hand say we must do more for people who are struggling to pay their mortgages if, on the other hand, the Government is writing a cheque for &euro;700 million to a bondholder to whom it has no responsibility.  The figure is absolutely shocking but that is what this Government is doing.  It is following in the footsteps of the previous Government.  Again, I call on the Leader of the House to have a discussion on this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcomed the efforts of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to develop a plan for the south east, in which he will examine job creation and bring forward plans in that regard.  When that plan is developed, he should bring it before the House.  I am sure that many of the issues that are relevant to the south east and Waterford are also relevant to regions throughout the country, and many of the issues dealt with in that report will be relevant to what we must do to support job creation not just in the south east and <Col N="907"/>Waterford but throughout the State.  Let us be honest, the recent jobs initiative by the Government has failed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in deploring the awful job losses we heard about this morning in Aviva Insurance.  All Members must deplore what we have seen happening recently not only in Aviva Insurance, but in many other companies in this country.  The last people who appear to be given consideration when major decisions are taken are the employees.  Consider the means by which employees find out what is happening.  They hear about it in the media or read about it on Twitter.  Unfortunately, I had the unpleasant task of being involved in the closure of an enterprise some years ago.  At all times the main consideration was ensuring that the employees were the first to know and were made aware of what their entitlements would be.  It is particularly regrettable that a company which we regarded as our own, which has been established for almost 100 years in this country and has a stadium named after it, would treat people in this way.  I ask that we have a discussion with the Minister about the Aviva Insurance situation and about how some of the multinationals are conducting their business in this country.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader arrange a discussion with the Minister for Justice and Equality about a report in the newspapers this morning relating to the involvement of organised crime in smuggling cigarettes into this country?  It is believed that many people who were involved in the drugs trade have switched to smuggling cigarettes because, first, one is less likely to get caught and, second, if one is caught, the penalties are far smaller.  Only 34 people, a startling figure, have been prosecuted for cigarette smuggling in this country despite the fact that hundreds of millions of euro in revenue have been lost.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>The serious issue of the involvement of organised criminals such as former drugs barons and drugs lords in the cigarette smuggling business requires an urgent discussion with the Minister for Justice and Equality.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other Members, I call for a full debate on the Keane report.  This report is a good first step in dealing with the issue of mortgage arrears.  It deals very well with the problem of those who cannot pay their mortgages, such as those who have sub-prime mortgages, and suggests ways they can keep their houses.  However, it deals less well with those who are trying to pay their mortgages but simply do not have the full amount to do so at present without sacrificing, for example, requirements for young families.  I thank all those who attended the meeting in the AV room last night.  I am pleased that representatives of New Beginning will appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform later and rather than making this a knockabout issue, if we all work together in the House, we can make progress and solve the problem.  In supporting others who called for a debate on the Keane report, will the Leader arrange a calm debate in order that we can make progress on the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like to raise the issue of banking institutions that take proceedings against individuals or companies and that hide behind the law when they have difficulties dealing with people.  I refer, in particular, to those who are sent in to retrieve assets.  It has been brought to my attention in the past few days that some of these people, who are hired on behalf of lending institutions, have criminal records.  This was touched on previously and it is crucial, given the financial difficulties faced by people, that the Minister for Justice and Equality ensures that anyone operating on behalf of a lending institution should be correctly licensed to do so.  Such licensing was introduced in recent years for staff performing <Col N="908"/>security details for night clubs and so on.  Those who enter the premises of individuals and companies being pursued by financial institutions must be correctly vetted and must not have a criminal background but I am led to believe this is happening.  Will the Leader bring this to the immediate attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality? If not, people will be hurt. A number of assault cases are before the courts. The notion that lending institutions supported by the State are facilitating the hiring of people with shady backgrounds or a criminal record is outrageous. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senators MacSharry, Healy Eames, Noone, Conway and others raised the Aviva announcement.  All our thoughts were with the hundreds of workers and their families on hearing the news earlier.  The job losses are yet another consequence of the collapse of the economy in recent years.  As a result of the contraction in the domestic economy, the insurance market has declined by more than 30%.  This is part of the legacy the Government has inherited and the Government parties are keen and committed to address this legacy.  They have started to tackle the crisis by restoring confidence and competitiveness in several areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the past few weeks the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has been in continual contact with the relevant State agencies on this issue.  He has met global management of the company and spoken regularly with Irish management of the company in an effort to minimise job losses.  The company has signalled the potential to grow new jobs in another area over a two year period and the IDA is working with it to deliver on that potential.  Subject to the conclusion of the negotiations between the company and the workers in the coming six months, the full support of the Government and its relevant agencies will be at the disposal of those affected by today&rsquo;s announcement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In contrast to other recent job losses, there will be a six month period of negotiation and I note the company&rsquo;s ambition to achieve many of its targeted reductions through voluntary redundancies.  Job losses will begin in April 2012 and take place over a two year period, which at least provides the workers with time to plan and the Government with an opportunity to seek replacement jobs.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry also raised questions for the Minister for Health.  I remind leaders of the groups that I wrote to them a few weeks ago seeking the submission to my office in writing of questions to the Minister by today.  I hope I will have the questions that we can pose to him next week.  Perhaps the issue raised by Senator Crown can be posed as a question to the Minister then.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Whelan, Noone, Barrett, Conway and others raised the Priory Hall issue again saying it might be the tip of the iceberg.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will be in the House soon to deal with this matter and the issue of building regulations, on which many Members have sought a debate in the past few weeks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We all join Senator Whelan in wishing the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht well with his proposals to solve the problems of turf cutters and I hope an amicable solution will be found for all.</P><P Just="Left">Senators Whelan, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and others called for a debate on media ownership, fair comment and so on.  I will endeavour to have the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in the House in early course to deal with that matter.  Many Members have raised the issue in the past few weeks.  The Minister was in the Chamber only last week but he is willing to return. </P><Col N="909"/>
        <P>Senator van Turnhout referred to yesterday&rsquo;s report on the deaths of children in care, which makes serious reading.  She made a good suggestion that the report be submitted to the Joint Committee on Health and Children to be debated at length.  I will make representations in that regard to ensure it will happen.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullins&rsquo;s comments on stem cell research and the EU Court of Justice will be welcomed by most.  Senator Noone raised the issue of consumer rights and the reforms announced by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which will be welcomed by all consumers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Barrett commented on the Priory Hall case and suggested that the snag man should be brought back.  That is needed, as the role of the snag man vanished during the Celtic tiger years.  The Taoiseach announced yesterday that the OPW will listen to further proposals regarding the situation in Clontarf in the next few weeks and I hope alternative proposals will be submitted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Mulcahy, Healy Eames, O&rsquo;Keeffe, Jim D&rsquo;Arcy, Cullinane and others called for a debate on the Keane report.  We had a good meeting in the AV room yesterday regarding the New Beginning proposals.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have said that the Keane report is only part of the process.  I have arranged a debate on the report next week and hope, as Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe stated, that specific proposals will be made when Members make their contributions and that they will not digress into other areas.  We should stick specifically to proper proposals and concise contributions on this important matter.  We will have a debate for an hour and a half or two hours next week.</P>

T&aacute;imid beirt sl&aacute;n &oacute;n uile bhuairt agus &oacute;n uile ghalar ar maidin.  I welcome the Bill as a step in the right direction in preventing a future collapse of the financial sector, such as we have seen.  It is of hugeimportance that the country finally has a bank resolution scheme that is consistent with international standards set out by the Financial Stability Board and the Bank for International Settlements.</P>
        <P>Despite welcoming the broad thrust of the legislation I have concerns regarding the protection of consumer rights in the liquidation process put forward by the committee.  My amendments have to do with the role of the Financial Services Ombudsman as a guarantor of consumer rights.  At the forefront of the resolution of financial institutions should be the protection of taxpayer interests and consumer-depositor interests, namely, the taxpayer, for two reasons.  It is essential that the rights of the deposit guarantee scheme are upheld and important that the resolution process is mindful of the taxpayers&rsquo; and consumer-depositors&rsquo; interests in the longer term.</P>
        <P>In the years following the onset of the financial crisis, consumers have been suffering from a double hit on their interests.  Not only has taxpayers&rsquo; money been used to prop up financial <Col N="911"/>institutions in Ireland, but these same financial institutions have proceeded to increase bank charges and withdraw viable overdrafts.  The situation cannot be allowed to arise again where ordinary consumer-depositors are to face the brunt of the consequences of collapse, which was no fault of their own.  It is important that the consumer-depositor has an independent watchdog, in the form of the Financial Services Ombudsman, to guard against this terrible injustice arising again in any future resolution measure taken to protect the financial stability of the banking sector.</P>
        <P>The equivalent legislation in the United Kingdom, the Banking Act 2009, provides for an individual to be appointed from the independent financial services compensation scheme which was created to provide a compensation fund of last resort in instances of financial crisis.  It is similar to our deposit protection scheme.  While I acknowledge that the operation of the deposit protection scheme is the responsibility of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, I feel, nonetheless, that the independence of the Financial Services Ombudsman in the process would be of considerable importance and of relief to consumers and depositors.</P>
        <P>The role of the Financial Services Ombudsman, according to its website, is as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Financial Services Ombudsman is a statutory officer who deals independently with complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers that have not been resolved by the providers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If a financial institution enters a resolution process under this Act consumer-depositors will be confused and worried about their rights and deposits.  Consequently, the financial institution in question will be inundated with inquiries relating to the protection of deposits which, given the nature of the situation and strain on resources, may be difficult to respond to rapidly.  As a consequence, it is possible that complaints and queries will go unresolved by the financial institution under resolution.  Thus, when the resolution occurs the Financial Services Ombudsman should be central to the process to ensure that the rights of the consumer are upheld and that his or her inquiries are rapidly dealt with.</P>
        <P>It is with this in mind that I propose this amendment to section 80 of the Bill to bring the Financial Services Ombudsman into the process.  The amendment changes the wording of the section so that the liquidator of an authorised credit institution has the two objectives of working in conjunction with the bank and the ombudsman.  The effect of the amendment is to bring the ombudsman into the process.</P>
        <P>In order to ensure the fulfilment of these objectives I also propose an amendment to section 83 that as soon as practicable after the court makes a winding-up order pursuant to section 216(1) of the Act of 1963 in relation to an authorised credit institution, the bank, ombudsman and Minister shall each nominate one individual who shall comprise a liquidation committee.</P>
        <P>These amendments are essential to protect the interests of consumers-depositors at a time when they will feel vulnerable about the safety of their money.  It is vital that they know there is an independent individual advocating and upholding their rights in the resolution of a financial institution.  The likelihood is that the financial institution under resolution will have its resources stretched to the limit to comply with the resolution process under the Act, so it is important that the ombudsman be kept regularly informed by the liquidator as to the progress of the resolution.  By allowing the ombudsman to nominate an individual to the liquidation committee, as proposed in the second amendment, this objective of keeping the ombudsman regularly informed will be achieved.  This will enable the ombudsman to keep consumers-depositors updated on the process and help to alleviate their fears that their money is under threat.</P><Col N="912"/>
        <P>The alleviation of consumer-depositor concerns will ultimately serve to reduce the likelihood of a run on the banks and to fulfil the broader aims of the Act in upholding the financial stability of the banking sector.  This is an important point.  We all want to prevent the scenes that occurred in the United Kingdom after the Northern Rock debacle when worried individuals queued to withdraw money, increasing the danger of financial collapse.  It is with the prevention of such a spectacle in mind that I suggest taking advantage of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s experience and thereby ensure the protection of consumers and depositors with an independent watchdog in the shape of the Financial Services Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will look favourably on this proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for his good wishes and raising these relevant points in order that we can discuss them in some detail.</P>
        <P>To put matters in context I will, first, set out how the modified liquidation provisions will apply.  The insolvency of any body corporate will normally result in that body being wound up in accordance with the Companies Acts.  Winding up, or liquidation, will continue to be an important tool available to the Central Bank and in many cases will be the appropriate means of resolving the crisis in a particular distressed institution, liquidating the credit institution, paying off its creditors with available funds and letting losses lie where they fall.  The State will not invariably step in to bail out or pump funds into an insolvent body.  This is, of course, subject to the existing guarantee that depositors hold to be repaid up to &euro;100,000 of the funds they have on deposit from the deposit guarantee scheme.  In that context, it is important that where, for example, a bank is being wound up, the liquidator and law relating to liquidations will work with and not against the deposit guarantee scheme.  Therefore, an important aspect of a successful special resolution regime for banks is the facility to allow an institution to be wound up while minimising the impact of the winding up on depositors eligible under the deposit guarantee scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 7 of the Bill, accordingly, provides for a modified liquidation procedure which requires a liquidator to prioritise eligible depositors&rsquo; access to their deposits over the usual objective of ensuring the best return to all creditors.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The insured depositors may be paid from the deposit protection scheme or their deposits may be transferred to another institution.  In place of the more usual committee of inspection, a liquidation committee, comprising nominees of the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance, will be established to monitor the liquidator&rsquo;s process in achieving this prioritised objective.  Once this objective has been achieved, the liquidation proceeds as normal.  Where a liquidation committee considers the liquidator&rsquo;s process is not proceeding satisfactorily, it can, under section 280 of the Companies Act, apply to the court to determine any question arising in the winding up.</P>
        <P>Section 80 of the Bill sets out the two objectives of the liquidator in the winding up of an authorised credit institution.  The first objective is to facilitate the Central Bank in ensuring that each eligible depositor receives the prescribed amount payable from the deposit guarantee scheme.  In the event of a conflict, this objective takes precedence over the second objective, which is to achieve the best results for the institution&rsquo;s creditors as a whole.  Section 83 provides that the liquidator and the Central Bank shall co-operate in the pursuit of these objectives.  It also provides that a liquidation committee should be established as soon as practicable after the making of a winding up order to ensure that the liquidator properly carries out his or her functions under this Part.  Such committee will be composed of two persons nominated by the Central Bank and one person nominated by the Minister.</P><Col N="913"/>
        <P>Amendment No. 2 would require the liquidator to work in conjunction with the ombudsman as well as the Central Bank to facilitate first, the Central Bank in ensuring that each eligible depositor receives the prescribed amount payable from the deposit protection scheme and, second, in transferring that amount from the deposit protection account to another authorised credit institution or to a credit institution approved by the Central Bank or to hold that amount on behalf of each such eligible depositor.  The role of the Financial Services Ombudsman is to deal independently with complaints from consumers in respect of financial service providers.  The ombudsman has no role in the administration by the State or State agencies of the deposit guarantee scheme.  The ombudsman has the power to award compensation against financial services providers and his or her decisions are binding on the financial institution, subject to the right of an appeal to the High Court.</P>
        <P>Given this appeal role of the ombudsman, it would not be appropriate for him or her to be involved in the liquidation process for a credit institution.  The ombudsman has no function, role or power, nor should he or she, in the liquidation of authorised credit institutions.  The deposits of eligible depositors are guaranteed up to the prescribed amount.  I am satisfied as to the adequacy of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions in this area, which will require the Central Bank and the liquidator to work together to ensure that each eligible depositor receives the prescribed amount payable from the deposit guarantee scheme.  Consequently, I am not in a position to accept the amendments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>Sections 91 and 92 provide that the Central Bank may direct an institution to prepare a recovery plan setting out actions that could be taken to facilitate its survival and recovery.  Some credit unions are already in negotiations in regard to, to use Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s term, &ldquo;the mother ship&rdquo; taking weaker credit unions under its wings.  Will the recovery and resolution plans tool be used to address the problems of credit unions?  We have been told that currently 27 credit unions require immediate attention.  Have recovery plans in respect of these 27 credit institutions be drawn up or will it be a case of slash and burn?  Will this facility be used to assist credit unions to survive?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Recovery and resolution plans allow the Central Bank and authorised credit institutions to identify possible actions that could be taken where an institution is experiencing difficulties.  Such plans are prepared in advance of any difficulties and facilitate contingency planning by the institution and the Central Bank.  The recovery plan is prepared by the institution and submitted to the Central Bank for assessment.  It outlines the actions that an institution could take to address possible difficulties.  The resolution plan is prepared by the Central Bank on the basis of the information received from the institution and sets out the Central Bank&rsquo;s contingency plans for the resolution of the institution concerned.</P>
        <P>The preparation of such plans should facilitate speedy action by the institution and the Central Bank if any difficulties actually arise as a plan of action will already have been prepared.  Where a special manager is appointed, he or she may be tasked with implementing a recovery plan for the institution.  That is the general position of happens between the bank and institution.  The bank and institution as a matter of routine rather than when a storm blows put in place contingency plans.</P>
        <P>The Bill, in terms of focus, has implications for credit unions, including credit unions that are failing or are likely to fail.  There is a broader but separate question in regard to the structure of the credit union sector in the future.  This incorporates issues such as consolidation, hub and spoke arrangements and shared services, on which the Senator touched.  The Senator will be aware that the Commission on Credit Unions interim report, published last week, makes recommendations to the Minister on credit union regulations, governance and stabilisation among other things.  The next phase of the commission&rsquo;s work will deal with restructuring.  I <Col N="915"/>mentioned on the last occasion I was in this House that the commission is continuing its work and that we expect a final report some time around Easter, which report deals with the restructuring of credit unions.  The commission will make recommendations on the possibility of voluntary consolidation or restructuring of the credit union sector over time, recognising the need to maintain local presence and taking into account the not-for-profit mandate, the volunteer ethos and community focus of credit unions.  The commission will have due regard to the need to protect depositors&rsquo; savings and financial stability.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank&rsquo;s proposals on the possible restructuring of some credit unions will be examined by the commission and recommendations will be made to me.  There is no intention to rush.  The next step will see the Central Bank putting its restructuring plans before the commission, which will analyse and study them and, as a result of this information, make recommendations in its final report.</P>
        <P>The commission will examine the option for groups of credit unions to share services on a formal basis.  It will also examine the extent to which this model is appropriate.  It will consider which services are most suitable for delivery by a separate entity, for example, purchasing, auditing, compliance, credit control, legal services, marketing, human resources management, administration and training.  Progress in the introduction of modern information technology and management information systems in credit unions will also be examined.  The process is well under way and we have had the interim report.</P>
        <P>The next part of the commission&rsquo;s work is an examination of restructuring.  One will not wake up some morning and find that the bank has moved in on credit unions.  It is being processed through the commission and there will be a full report that we can discuss in or around Easter.  The only exception to this is if a credit union, for reasons about which we are not currently aware, is on the verge of collapse and the bank must move as a matter of emergency.  The restructuring of the credit union as a whole will be filtered through the commission and the commission&rsquo;s advice will be taken on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The commission will report by Easter.  Is it envisaged that legislation will provide for the recommendations or will they be dealt with via regulations from the Central Bank?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The interim report, which was published last Friday, set out the governance of the credit unions.  This matter will require legislation.  Under our memorandum of understanding with the European authorities, we are committed to publishing the legislation before or just after Christmas.  This will be processed in the normal way.</P>
        <P>The restructuring of the credit union movement will not require legislation.  In effect, this Bill empowers the bank to engage in restructuring.  Further legislation will not be required.  However, the discussion between the commission and the bank will result in a final report from the commission in or around Easter.  It will make recommendations to the Minister and the bank on the methodology of the restructuring.  If legislation is required, we will legislate, but I do not envisage a second Bill other than the governance legislation that I mentioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister envisage that a recovery plan will be an option in respect of any of the 27 credit unions we have been told are at serious risk?</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned special managers.  I discussed this matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, yesterday.  Under the Bill, someone appointed as a special manager must, in the opinion of the Central Bank, have &ldquo;the requisite knowledge, expertise and experience of the financial services sector to be the special manager of that credit institution&rdquo;.  Is it possible that former bank managers will be appointed to these roles?</P><Col N="916"/>
        <P>I have a query on the constitutionality of the imposition of special managers.  Where a special management has the &ldquo;effect of suspending the rights and powers of shareholders and members&rdquo; and general meetings will only be convened at the special manager&rsquo;s direction, is there a question of shareholders&rsquo; property rights being affected?  Will this provision be challenged on constitutional grounds?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Every Bill approved by the Government must be signed off by the Attorney General.  By definition, a Bill cannot be published if the opinion of the Office of the Attorney General is that it is unconstitutional.  Constitutional proofing of this Bill has been done and the Attorney General has advised that the powers of special managers are constitutional.</P>
        <P>As to the special manager&rsquo;s qualifications, it is obvious that he or she would not be someone just in off the street who knew nothing about finance.  It is up to the Central Bank to decide on an appropriate person.  Such a person would need to know something about the management of a financial institution.  A successful manager of a credit union would probably be an appropriate special manager, were such a person available.  People&rsquo;s backgrounds would not rule them in or out as long as they had particular skill sets.</P>
        <P>Of the 27 credit unions mentioned in the interim report as being impaired in one way or another or having inadequate reserves, the bank rather than the Minister is the regulator of the financial institutions, including the credit unions.  It is up to the bank to decide what move it will make and when.  In the normal course of events, my Department will be informed of anything that will occur.  This time last year, my predecessor got fairly clear signals to the effect that the bank was about to move quickly to assist credit unions, but nothing has happened to date.  The situation that emerged in the interim report did not seem to be as bad as suggested by the rumour mill.  There is some urgency about some credit unions, but there is no immediate plan for the bank to go into any one in particular.  The bank is examining the 27 unions&rsquo; situations carefully, paying particular regard to the at-risk cases at the bottom of the scale.</P>

        <P>Sections 92 to 101, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 102</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 102 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding sections 102 and 103, the limitations on judicial review and the right to appeal are restrictive.  Leave to seek judicial review must be made to a court within 14 days of the notification of a decision.  However, leave for review may be granted thereafter <Col N="917"/>if the court is satisfied that &ldquo;there are substantial reasons why the application was not made within that period&rdquo; and &ldquo;it is just, in all the circumstances, to grant leave&rdquo;.  Additional to the tight deadline in which an applicant must seek judicial review, the court must also be satisfied in every case that the application raises a substantial issue.  There is a very narrow window for an appeal or for a judicial review.  Does it need to be this tight or can the Minister explain why this provision covering the right to appeal is so heavy-handed? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The right to appeal is contained in this section and it is an important right.  It is important to balance the challenge with the need to ensure that the resolution of an institution in difficulty can take place efficiently and effectively.  A delay in implementation could undermine the usefulness of the resolution.  Therefore, the Bill provides definite lines of challenge within the procedures for the making of orders and allows for judicial review and appeals.</P>
        <P>However, the timeframe for all sources of challenge is limited to ensure that resolution measures can be implemented in a timely manner to avoid uncertainty regarding outcome for all shareholders, including depositors.  There is a right of appeal but the window to appeal is short because the Central Bank will not be moving in to resolve an institution unless there is a major difficulty.  Resolving it is not open-ended from a time point of view; it must be done pretty quickly.  If one reflects on the events of the past 12 months, one will find situations where from newspaper reports it appeared the courts were being used to obstruct the authorities in taking action in certain cases.  It is a question of balancing the right of appeal with the efficacy of the intervention.  The balance here is about right.</P>

I share the concerns Senator Sheahan mentioned concerning the general principle of laws restricting people&rsquo;s right to appeal and the right to a judicial review, but I accept what the Minister said.  There were circumstances where the vacation procedures were used rather strangely I think to outsiders.  We asked the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, about it yesterday and raised those concerns about the two sections.  There is a certain reluctance to note that people have rights to a judicial review and rights of appeal to the Supreme Court.  While appreciating all the Minister is trying to do in this legislation and how important it is, infringing on those rights is something for which I would have less than a wholehearted appetite.  In general what the Minister is doing is welcomed.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, reported to the Minister yesterday that we said we wished we had all this in place five or six years ago and that many of the difficulties that arose since then would not have occurred.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>While the restriction is to 14 days for making the appeal, once the appeal is made it is in the hands of the courts.  It does not have to be out in 14 days, once the court takes possession of the appeal, then the court owns the process.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P>Sections 103 and 104 agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 105</P>
        <P Just="Left">Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 105 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The section states, &ldquo;The Bank may, after consultation with the Minister, issue a code of practice . . .&rdquo;.  While that is good, I notice that the equivalent Act in the UK, which is self-proclaimed to be ahead of international best practice, does not have a role for the <Col N="918"/>Minister in any of this.  The reporting takes place between the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the lead up to the crisis the forbearance shown by the banks was a major contribution to the crisis that we are in.  Because the act must take place before a financial institution is considered insolvent, with the Minister having a responsibility here, there could be a political danger that he could be seen to have been involved or charged with causing the crisis.  That happened in the Washington Mutual case in Seattle in 2007 where the regulatory authorities intervened, as they should do under the American legislation, to act before the bank became insolvent.  This was latterly construed to have precipitated the crisis in the first place.  I wonder if the role of the Minister here could lead to a secondary act of forbearance.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s opinion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is section 106 that the Senator is addressing.  That section states &ldquo;The Bank may, after consultation with the Minister, issue a code of practice ...&rdquo;.  It is the bank that issues the code of practice, not the Minister, but there is consultation with the Minister.  Normally I find in legislation such as this when one is dealing with the bank or the regulator that while the policy is being decided there is consultation with the Minister but once the policy is put in place in law the bank or the regulator is independent in the exercise of its functions.  Therefore, it is that procedure.  It is not the Minister who issues the code of practice, it is the bank.</P>
        <P>The section states, &ldquo;The Bank may, after consultation with the Minister, issue a code of practice relating to the operation of this Act including the exercise of any powers under this Act.&rdquo;  It is reasonable that as the Minister is the proposer of this legislation, regarding codes of practice that would run from it that are being put in place by the bank, there would be consultation with the Minister in advance since the Minister is the proposer of all the legislation.  It is like the metaphor of the cow and calf &mdash; the code of practice is the calf.  If the Minister is the proposer of the legislation, then he has a role in subsidiary legislation like codes of practice but once they are established, he is out of the picture and the bank acts independently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Are codes of practice and guidelines any use to us if they do not have the force of law?  On the one hand, we have laws, statutes, ordinances but if there are not strict definitions of a code of practice and the penalties for adhering to them, and the same applies for not being guided by guidelines, do they help?  Is this a kind of mangerialism creeping into the law and does the fact that they are in place amount to &mdash; to use the methaphor &mdash; a hill of beans?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The code of practice, I understand, would have the force of law.  We are enacting the section here, so the section has the force of law.  It is the section which empowers the bank to issue the code of practice; therefore, the code of practice has the force of law also.  There is legislation which defines that; I am informed it is the 1971 Act that gives the force of law to codes of practice that run from sections of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of mortgage arreas, which we discussed this morning, comes to mind and there is a code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  While the codes of conduct are statutory under the Act that the Minister mentioned, I do not believe they are not open to interpretation.  If the Central Bank deems that one follows the code of conduct, I do not believe a court can take issue with an aspect within the code of practice other than the Central Bank saying that as far as it is concerned the broad thrust of the code of practice has been followed.</P><Col N="919"/>
        <P>I agree with Senator Barrett&rsquo;s point that we need to be much more prescriptive with banks than we are, including in this instance.  The light touch regulation of the past and the promixity of the Central Bank, the banks and credit unions and so on has not served us well.  We should look at, as was suggested by the Senator on the other side, making things a little more definite in terms of procedures that need to be followed.  I am not sure that the Central Bank should take absolute control.  In this instance, I would take a little more comfort if the Minister had a little more input.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators will be familiar with legislation going through.  The primary legislation sets out the main principles but often matters of detail are dealt with by empowering the Minister to issue statutory regulations or, in this case, codes of practice.  The reason is that there are issues of detail not appropriate to primary legislation, but also there are unforeseen circumstances which are better dealt with either by regulation or code of practice.  However, because the code of practice has the force of law, the bank could not act in an arbitrary fashion.  Once it applied the code of practice in one set of circumstances, it would have to be consistent because precedent in law would take over.  As the code of practice is implemented and applied, to use a layman&rsquo;s term, it firms up and the bank would be wrong in law to act in an arbitrary fashion, and in my view, the bank could be challenged in court if itdid.</P>

        <P>Sections 106 to 109, inclusive, agreed to.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 110 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>Could I have clarification on the common bond?  The Bill states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Where the engagements of a credit union (in this subsection referred to as the &lsquo;transferor credit union&rsquo;) are transferred to another credit union (in this subsection referred to as the &lsquo;transferee credit union&rsquo;), the common bond of the transferee credit union is taken to include the common bond of the transferor credit union and the rules of the transferee credit union are amended accordingly, on and from the date on which the transfer takes . . . [place].</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Seemingly, the section, to which Senator Sheahan refers, refers to non-residents.  It is the common bond between two credit unions and it is an appropriate mechanism for that situation.  I have been reminded that there is a Bill on Second Stage, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011, which we will be debating here shortly and which will protect whisleblowers in financial institutions. </P>

        <P Just="Center">SCHEDULE 1</P>
        <P Just="Left">Question proposed: &ldquo;That Schedule 1 be Schedule 1 to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>This relates to the provision of information by the financial institution.  I refer to the case of Mr. Eugene McErlean who seemed to run into trouble with the authorities <Col N="920"/>for blowing the whistle on overcharging in a credit institution some years ago.  Does the Minister see any role, under Schedule 1 or, for that matter, any other section, for stating explicitly any provisions on protecting whistleblowers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to introduce legislation to deal with the protection of whistleblowers but this would not be an appropriate vehicle for it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Seanad for co-operating so effectively in getting this Bill through all Stages today.  In particular, I thank the Acting Chairman, Senator Leyden, and all the Senators who contributed to the short debate.  All the salient points were touched on and I appreciate that very much.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for taking time from his busy schedule to come here rather than dispatch one of the Ministers of State.  It is considerate and shows great respect for the House, and we appreciate it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Naturally, we on this side of the House supported the Bill.  Almost word for word, notwithstanding the amendments to do with the credit union, Fianna F&aacute;il had put it forward in February.  We are supportive of it and the Government&rsquo;s ongoing efforts.</P>
        <P>As the Minister is here and there is a debate ongoing in the other House on the Keane report, and while I am absolutely convinced of the political and personal commitments of all parties in both Houses to do something of a radical nature in the context of mortgage arrears and the personal debt crisis, I would ask that issues contained within the Family Home Bill 2011 and the proposed Debt Settlement and Mortgage Resolution Office Bill 2011 which is being taken in the D&aacute;il on Private Members&rsquo; time, be taken on board and that, for once, to quote Senator Barrett, the metaphorical backstairs in the Department of Finance and Government Buildings for bankers and developers can finally be removed.  We should not fear the reaction from the markets, the troika, the IMF or anybody else in taking radical steps to support the families of Ireland in the same way that we, as a nation, have accepted the support of the IMF and EU in extending our mortgage period in terms of our debts and reducing our rates of interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for attending.  He attends this Chamber regularly and it is appreciated by all concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The metaphor involving a horse and the stable door was used yesterday.  The horse has run over the hill and died of old age at this stage.  Unfortunately, the legislation was not in place when it was required.  It goes back to that fateful night of 28 September 2008.  As I mentioned yesterday, the Minister was the only person in those nocturnal debates who raised the question <Col N="921"/>of whether this was a liquidity crisis or a capitalisation-solvency crisis.  To all our dismay, he was correct in identifying that issue but, unfortunately, the correct information did not come at that stage through the Government and the political process.  If the correct information had come at that stage, I do not believe the blanket coverage would have occurred in the same manner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is complex legislation and I am glad it is done.  I hope nobody in this or the other Chamber will ever have to go through such processes.  The vehicles are now there through legislation to ensure that the people of authority use their authority to deal with whatever crises occur.</P>
        <P>I want to touch upon one final point.  I am minded of a point made by the Murphy commission on confidence in those who are in the office rather than confidence in the office itself.  I identify Professor Honohan and Mr. Elderfield as two in whom there is a great deal of confidence but I do not know for certain that the same confidence has yet been regained in the positions that both gentlemen currently hold.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister and his officials for attending the House.  This is a very important Bill and, as others have commented, if it were not for the crisis that occurred in 2008, we would never have faced this.  Whether the Bill is ever used or is ever necessary, it is on the Statute Book and that creates confidence among the financial institutions that we now have a mechanism to deal with distressed institutions.  The Labour Party supports this Bill.  We had a good, brief debate and I would be grateful if all such debates in this Chamber were as brief and concise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As a result of the Minister&rsquo;s work and endeavours, we now have a very well capitalised banking system that may become a model for other countries.  I say this having met some members of the troika in Kenmare at the weekend and others in Trinity College on Monday.  What we have done may well be a model for others and credit is due to all concerned on that.  I thank the Minister and wish him well with this and with his other endeavours to set the country back on the right financial road.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for this legislation and all his help throughout this process.  In 1980, when auditors were auditing credit unions, the first thing they did was to ask for all the relevant information regarding loans and those who provided them &mdash; directors, managers, supervisors, staff and voluntary tellers.  In 1980 auditors were seeking that information from credit unions and it is unfortunate we did not have this type of auditing in our banking system.  We would not be where we are if we had.</P>
        <P>Credit unions lost &euro;50 million with the recapitalisation of the banks and this loss has not been fully resolved.  Some credit unions did not accept the 20% proposal and the offer on the table now is &euro;1 per &euro;1,000.  Some say the &euro;50 million was lost as a result of bad investments, but some credit unions were sold bonds that were proven not to have trustee status.  The issue should have been teased out fully and it is unfortunate it has come to this.  I hope it does not cost the amount suggested by the Minister&rsquo;s officials of between &euro;500 million and &euro;1 billion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill is concerned with the &euro;50 million that was lost in some of the investments and there is also special mention of investment advisors.  I hope the advisers appointed will be more prudent than the ones engaged by the credit union movement down the years, who lost a lot of money.  I take on board the statement made by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, yesterday that the same prudential systems should be in place for credit unions as for banks.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe.  Will the senior Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, be in attendance?  This is an important matter not only for the people of D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill in Cavan, but also for the four other barracks mentioned in the motion.  If he will not be present, I would like to know why he is not in the Chamber.  I am disappointed that he is not in the Chamber for the beginning of this debate as he regularly attends when he deals with his briefs in the Departments of Justice and Equality and Defence.  I would like to see the Minister here before the end of the debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Fianna F&aacute;il Senators tabled this motion to highlight the imminent danger to the future of five Army barracks in Clonmel, Kilkenny, Mullingar, Castlebar and D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill in my home town of Cavan.  The personnel based in these barracks and their families, as well as those serving overseas &mdash; 22 whom come from the D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill barracks in Cavan &mdash; are in limbo.  They do not know what the future holds.  The Fianna F&aacute;il defence spokesman in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Dara Calleary, along with Deputies Brendan Smith and Robert Troy, have been attempting to obtain information about proposed Army barracks closures from the Minister since April.  I raised this issue on a number of occasions in the Seanad, including during an Adjournment debate on 27 September.  The reply from the Minister has been the same reply on every occasion and on 27 September he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">As of now, no decision has been made by the Government on the future of Cavan barracks or any other military installation.  The issue of the closure of barracks no longer required for operational reasons to effect necessary savings will, however, be considered shortly by Government.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Army personnel based in these five towns and the communities they serve believe that a decision has been made to close the five barracks.  We are asking the Minister to come clean and to tell us what is going on.  The alleged logic behind these proposed closures is that they are a fundamental requirement for improving military effectiveness and efficiency and that, overall, the move will save money.  No effectiveness or efficiency will be achieved and no savings will be made by closing these barracks.  Some &euro;25 million will be lost to the towns&rsquo; economies.  In Cavan, &euro;3 million will be lost to the town and the surrounding villages.  Some &euro;30 million must be provided to accommodate the relocation of the troops.  In addition, travel and other expenses must be paid to personnel who are forced to move locations as far away as 120 km from their homes.  It is important not to forget the human cost of this relocation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Defence Forces, &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, have been a model of public sector reform and modernisation in the past 15 years.  The report by Mr. Colm McCarthy, referred to as the an bord snip nua report, found that the Defence Forces were the only part of the public sector that decreased numbers during the era of the Celtic tiger.  It did much more than this; it invested the savings generated in better equipment, facilities and training.  The key to this achievement was the 2000 White Paper on defence produced by the former Minister, Michael Smith.  The paper set out a ten year programme of changes and improvements in reforms, including a programme of barracks closures that were implemented in 1998.  As a consequence of the <Col N="924"/>modernisation, Irish troops were the match of any others serving on UN-mandated peace support operations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We were able to send over 1,600 troops per year for most of the past decade to protect and assist some of the most vulnerable people on the planet.  Increasingly, we took leadership roles in these missions and supplied particular expertise and logistics in ordnance disposal.  We took the command in the UUP support mission in Chad to assist and aid refugees fleeing the terror in Darfur.  Troops from every barracks in the country were trained and equipped to the highest standards and serve regular six month tours of duty on overseas missions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At a time of almost full employment, a life in the Defence Forces was still seen as a good career choice.  Recruitment campaigns were oversubscribed.  We now have a highly professional and well equipped defence organisation.  While the individual commitment and loyalty is the same, it is smaller, leaner and more efficient than it was 20 years ago.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2008, four Border posts &mdash; in Monaghan, Longford, Lifford and Letterkenny &mdash; were closed and personnel transferred to Dundalk, Cavan, Athlone, Finner and Mullingar.  This was achieved under the stewardship of the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea.  As he pointed out at the time, closing these barracks was part of the peace dividend but also a consequence of there being sufficient capacity and accommodation in other barracks to receive the additional troops.  The Defence Forces have done everything that was asked of them and more.  Why then is the Minister, Deputy Shatter, coming back for more?  Why is he contemplating barracks closures and further reductions in numbers which will undo the progress made in the last decade?  Why is he targeting and victimising the one area of the entire public sector that has been reformed, modernised and downsized?  Is it the Minister&rsquo;s intention to reduce the size of the Defence Forces?  The barracks closures being considered do not make sense on any level.</P>
        <P>When does the Minister propose to transfer the troops?  Where does he propose to transfer those stationed in Mullingar, Clonmel, Kilkenny, Cavan and Castlebar?  Where is the spare capacity in the remaining barracks?  We know from the last round of closures that they are operating close to capacity.  To close these barracks and permanently transfer 600 or 700 troops would require a considerable capital investment in additional facilities in Athlone, Finner, Dundalk, Limerick and even Dublin.  How does the Minister propose to secure the funding to provide this additional capacity?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Is it the case that the Minister&rsquo;s true intention is not to provide additional facilities, as part of a hidden plan to reduce Army numbers even further?  Many of us in this House, and many people in my home county, suspect this is the real agenda.  It is not so much a plan for closing barracks as it is a tactic to reduce numbers in the Defence Forces.  Has the Department done the figures on the additional facilities and accommodation that will be required?  Has it calculated the allowances due to the personnel being transferred?  Have the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, visited any of the barracks earmarked for closure, or any barracks at all, since their appointment?  What is the balance in 2012 and 2013 between the costs involved in shutting down these posts and the economy-of-scale savings that would be made in reduced telephone, fuel costs and so on?</P>
        <P>Has the Minister considered the hardship these closures will impose on the families concerned?  Is it not the case that these barracks have been identified by the top brass in the military in order to have all their personnel close by, thus making life easier for themselves?  Why are the seven barracks in operation in the Curragh being maintained?  Why is the number of generals and colonels being increased while the number of ordinary soldiers is reduced?  The wages of one Army general would run D&uacute;n U&iacute; Neill barracks in Cavan town for 12 months. <Col N="925"/> That facility is the only purpose built military barracks to be constructed since the foundation of the State.  It is also the most economical barracks to run, costing only &euro;200,000 per year.  Why is it being considered for closure?  It makes no sense either on economic or security grounds and would leave the entire Border from Donegal to Dundalk without any military personnel.  It is strategically located and vitally important to the security of the State.  While the Minister, Deputy Shatter, likes to list the EU, IMF and other abbreviations, I would counter that by pointing to the abbreviations RIRA and CIRA.  The latter represent a greater threat to the security of this State than anything represented by the abbreviations the Minister likes to employ whenever he is questioned as to when he will tell us the truth about what is going on.</P>
        <P>This issue is of serious concern to my party.  It is of serious concern to the communities in the five towns concerned.  Sixteen people, comprising members of PDFORRA together with partners and children of some of the 130 personnel serving in D&uacute;n U&iacute; Neill barracks in Cavan and the other towns, are in the Visitors Gallery this evening.  The limbo they are in is no joke and they demand answers.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, for attending the debate, but I wish to know why the Minister, Deputy Shatter, is absent.  Is the issue not serious enough to warrant his presence in the Chamber?</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe.  This is one of the most important debates that will take place in this House.  The way in which the motion is crafted is an indication of the responsibility shown by this side of the House in this matter.  We are seeking not to score points but to bring forward the views of those affected  and to reflect the emotion this issue inspires.  It is regrettable that we are currently in a limbo on this matter.  Moreover, this limbo has been ongoing for an exceptionally long period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Wilson outlined the main issues regarding the five barracks in question.  I recently attended a meeting in Clonmel together with my colleague, Senator Denis Landy, and other Oireachtas Members.  The hotel in which the meeting took place was full to capacity, with crowds spilling onto the street.  What particularly struck me was the tone of the meeting.  It was in no way confrontational and there was no partisanship in terms of whether one was on the side of the Government or against it.  Senator Landy will testify to that.  I have seldom seen, at a meeting of this kind, such unity among the political parties.  There was also unity among the sections of the community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Kickham barracks in Clonmel is named for the great Irish patriot, Charles J. Kickham.  The barracks is associated with a long tradition in the town which has always been upheld with pride and loyalty.  Members of the Defence Forces could not speak at the meeting, but their partners and members of the community spoke about this pride and loyalty and their grievance that it is not being appreciated.  This is a case where no economic argument is being put forward.  Moreover, I have some doubt about the pressure that is apparently coming from elsewhere in Europe.  I am not too clear where it comes into the picture &mdash; perhaps the Minister of State will enlighten us in this regard.  Although no economic saving will arise from the closure of the barracks, a costing has been put on the loss to Clonmel, and it amounts to &euro;10 million.  In reality the loss will be even greater.  With other speakers, I welcome the delegation because it shows the interest, emotion and concern this issue generates.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">The members of the Defence Forces have brought huge credit to the country.  Any time I travelled abroad I found that Ireland had very few enemies internationally.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach found that also.  There are a number of reasons for that.  First, we never colonised any other country.  Second, our religious orders did so much to promote education and health care, which is important.  One of the main reasons, however, is the peacekeeping carried out by the Defence Forces which often resulted in loss of life.  It was not easy for the members of <Col N="926"/>the Defence Forces to go abroad on peacekeeping missions and leave their families behind but it was a major kudo for Ireland wherever one went.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regardless of the way we handle this issue, unless it is brought quickly to a positive conclusion the message that will go abroad will be that we did not appreciate what the Defence Forces did.  They secure this State but whenever we faced challenges or pressures, whether it was flooding, tragedies or whatever, Clonmel being a specific case, it was always the Defence Forces that came out to help the civilian population.  Likewise, they came out to help during strikes by providing transport and so on.  The Defence Forces are central to the community and if any of the five barracks is closed &mdash; I refer to the one in Clonmel but it affects the others &mdash; we will end up with a derelict site because if it is expected that this building, Kickham barracks, will attract an offer similar to one that might have been made during the Celtic tiger period, it will not happen.  It will be left derelict and will be a reminder to us of the wrong we did in this particular case.  Also, the families of the Defence Forces will be exceptionally disrupted having to move elsewhere, given the cost factor involved.</P>
        <P>Try as we could at that meeting in Clonmel we could not identify a single saving that will occur as a result of this measure. I hope the Minister, Deputy Shatter, will come to Clonmel because a strong point was put forward by several speakers at the meeting that if the Minister, Deputy Shatter, came to Clonmel, and the other four sites, he might go away with a different view.  He will not see it merely as a numerical equation.  He will see it in a human, service and tradition context.  Any saving to be made, and we cannot see it, will be minuscule but the damage it would do to the morale of the Defence Forces and to the towns which hosted those Defence Forces over the years will not be easily remedied in the future.  I agree with Senator Wilson and ask that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Shatter, would visit each of the towns in question and have consultation, just as he would have in other circumstances, with the people involved and put their minds at ease also.</P>
        <P>This measure will be a poor reflection on the man after whom the barracks is named and the patriots who gave us our freedom, and likewise for the other towns.  We should not tinker with the Defence Forces and we will not be doing a good day&rsquo;s work if we do so.  If the Minister, Deputy Shatter, does not come into the House I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, will tell him about the emotion generated over this issue.  It is like no other debate that has taken place in this House and we are reflecting that back to the Minister.  If no decision has been made let that be known.  If a decision has been made, do not implement that decision until such time as there is consultation with all the parties involved.  Putting down the motion will have done a great service to everyone involved.  It was not to score political points but to do what is right by the State, the Defence Forces and their families, and the towns that have hosted the barracks over the years.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> accepts that Government must make difficult choices in the national interest and deplores the glaring inconsistency of opposing necessary decisions on barrack consolidation for short-term political advantage;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> accepts that reform and reorganisation of the public service including the effective use of State assets is a key element of these plans.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department and Government Chief Whip, Deputy Kehoe, who is more than capable of handling this matter.  I have no doubt he will speak for his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, as well.  I welcome also Councillor Walsh and the good people of Cavan who are present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Unfortunately, there is a basic dishonesty in the motion put forward by the Members opposite because of the policies their party pursued in government and the position it handed over to the Government.  Their sheer brass neck takes the biscuit.  They are shying away from the national interest in their motion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our amendment notes the previous Government&rsquo;s decision to recognise the substantial benefits for the Defence Forces of barrack consolidation by implementing two separate programmes involving the closure of ten barracks throughout the country.  It accepts that the Estimates for the Defence Forces for 2011, decided upon by the previous Government, necessitate a reduction in the strength of the Defence Forces and other substantial economies but I understand, and I am sure the Minister of State will elaborate further, that no redundancies are envisaged in any proposal that may emerge.  Our amendment acknowledges that the previous Government&rsquo;s carelessness and complacency in managing the economy caused an extremely difficult situation for the country and reduced the resources available to the Defence Forces and because of that the Defence Forces must now be prioritised to ensure their operational capacity both at home and overseas.  We cannot afford to put that at risk.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government must make difficult choices in the national interest and we deplore the glaring inconsistency of opposing necessary decisions on barrack consolidation for short-term gain.  Our amendment supports the Government&rsquo;s comprehensive plans to tackle the economic crisis and notes that those plans are now bearing fruit.  It accepts that reform and reorganisation of the public service, including the effective use of State assets, is a key element of those plans.</P>
        <P>The motion is at odds with the policies and decisions the party of the Members opposite took throughout its term in government.  They implemented two programmes of barracks closures, closing ten in total.  Their White Paper on Defence envisaged consolidation and a smaller number of barracks locations.  The programme they laid out is necessary to maximise the effectiveness of the Defence Forces.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I will leave that to the Minister of State.  I will not say what is and is not complete.  We are in a very difficult position which we refer to here daily.  It is for Government to decide on the effective use of resources and maximising the resources available but there is no sense in maintaining barracks where there is no operational requirement if that is the view of the Government.  I understand Senator Wilson is primarily concerned with Cavan and Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; with Clonmel.  Other Members are concerned about Mullingar.  These seem to be the three places in the news.  I know the Minister for Defence, Deputy Shatter, is meeting deputations from these three locations.  I do not know what decision may be taken but we must be concerned about the good and practical use of the limited resources available.  This is a matter for Government decision.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in had sought to seek to amend the original Fianna F&aacute;il motion to include the closure of Garda stations and to deal with some of the terminology and the loose language, that could be seen to undermine the arguments and fails to reflect the situation in the North.</P>
        <P>I deplore the amendment put forward by the Government parties.  I take offence to the line which mentions the opposition to these decisions for &ldquo;short-term political advantage&rdquo;.  How dare the Government condemn anyone or any group for standing shoulder to shoulder with their local communities, for representing their friends, colleagues and neighbours, like the people in the Visitors Gallery.  I went to school with the families of soldiers.  I socialise and play sport with them.  The Opposition are not the members playing politics with people&rsquo;s lives under the pretext that it is the final diktat of the troika.  The D&aacute;il debate on this issue was dominated by the narrative that Ireland has no choice, which is completely and totally untrue.  The Government is free to adjust the terms of the bailout agreement on the condition that the <Col N="929"/>final outcome remains the fiscal adjustment to which the agreement commits Ireland.  Was it not the Minister&rsquo;s party that campaigned and was elected on a mandate of &ldquo;we will renegotiate&rdquo; and &ldquo;we will get a better deal&rdquo;?  This amendment is really true to form.  It is an abdication of responsibility.  At what stage will the Government take responsibility for what it is doing?  It looks unlikely that it will take responsibility for budget decisions.  It seems to be a Government that promises much, even though it has an overwhelming mandate to deliver change, and delivers little.  It offers excuses, as we have seen from Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s exchange with Senator Wilson.</P>
        <P>The Government is blaming Fianna F&aacute;il for its failed policies, but that can only get it so far.  It cannot pretend to be something different when implementing the policies of the previous Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the question of costs and savings, there is no economic gain to be made by closing barracks.  There would be immediate costs involved in transferring and redeploying the troops currently based in the barracks.  There is no spare capacity in other locations.  Closing the barracks would likely involve building and updating facilities.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, last week stated in the D&aacute;il:</P>
        <P LI="1">This is purely a parochial game which simultaneously ignores the national requirement.  The Government will not continue the Fianna F&aacute;il habit of wasting taxpayers&rsquo; money.  Rather, its aim is to use that money to get the best possible return for the country as a whole.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">What does the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, have to say about his comprehensive spending review, when one looks at the cost of paying extra travelling allowances to approximately 600 people for up to nine months; the substantial capital investments that will be needed in other barracks to accommodate those who are dislocated or the substantial security and maintenance bill for the closed sites?  That does not sound like savings to me or the best possible return for the country, not least when the reality is that there will be no financial gain from any potential sale of a closed barracks in the present property market.  Will the Minister respond to that or tweet me a response?</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the vicinity of the D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill barracks in Cavan, the recession in the private sector has left its mark with empty retail sites littered the length of the Dublin Road.  Now the Government wants to close the state-of-the-art facility, hitting the area a final knockout blow.  As we have already heard, the cost to Cavan town and county is estimated to be &euro;3 million per annum as this money will be taken out of circulation.  We have to look at the personal cost to people if these barracks are closed.  On foot of the closure of the Monaghan barracks and the earlier closures of Cootehill and Castleblayney barracks, Dun U&iacute; Neill barracks became home to many of those displaced members of the Defence Forces and a further displacement of these soldiers and their families, with all that this entails, is grossly unfair and may force some soldiers to leave.  Is the dole queue going to be their only future?  What will a serving member who is already in negative equity do?  The soldiers bought homes in these towns for record high prices during the boom.  Will they and their families be bailed out?  These serving soldiers have given service to individuals and their community, struggling to deal with the variety of challenges.  The value of the Army&rsquo;s civil support role was not appreciated until very recently when we experienced the severe weather conditions of the last few winters and the Army helped to keep the emergency services in action.  What was Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s response last week in the D&aacute;il?  He said, &ldquo;the implication of this motion is that we should conduct the comprehensive review of expenditure on the basis that the taxpayer should continue to invest in something that is not required.&rdquo;</P>

Molann Sinn F&eacute;in leas&uacute; ar an r&uacute;n chun aird a tharraingt ar an gceist a bhaineann le st&aacute;isi&uacute;in na ngarda&iacute; agus ar na cainteanna at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l faoi dh&uacute;nadh chuid acu.  Although we agree in principle with the motion, we thought it was imperative to draw attention to the fact that there is a danger that the Garda stations in rural areas will be closed down and that up to 200 Garda stations could be pinpointed and the chief superintendents in each region have been asked to look at which stations should be closed down.  That is happening in all areas across the county.  I know from being at meetings locally in Connemara that places such as Letterfrack, Rosmuc, Carna and so on are being looked at.  There is a deep unease about this for different reasons.  One of the reasons cited for the possible closure of these Garda stations is the fact there is such a low level of crime.  Surely the measure of success of these Garda stations is that there is such a low level of crime in these areas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Absolutely, we believe the Minister in question is looking at rationalisation across the whole of his Department and it is important to look at the motion in that context.  This is being done in the context, as my colleague, Senator Kathryn Reilly, said, of cutbacks.  In a couple of weeks time, the Government will hand over &euro;700 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  The people would much prefer that the money be spent on services, such as barracks and Garda stations.  The GRA said closing down Garda stations would have a profound effect not only on the community but on their members&rsquo; ability to do their job.  I am sure the Army would say exactly the same thing.  There is a great fear among the community about the level of policing and the number of Garda.  It is such an important service  that it needs to be reinvested in.  The local Garda station is an imperative in an area, no more than the backup it would get from the Army.  We argue that these cuts should not be brought in and the Minister should reconsider.  Everything that can be done to keep these essential services like the Garda and the Army in the local community should be done.  The time of an economic cutback is not the time to make cuts of these sorts.  Our fear of what would happen in rural areas is that if one loses the presence of these essential services, there will be a significant increase in criminal activity.  The mere presence of positive community policing, for example, has a much better deterrent effect than not having a service in an area.</P>

        <P>Second, I wish to remind Sinn F&eacute;in of something.  I was living with my family next door to Lifford Army barracks in 1985 when the IRA set off a bomb in the street.  It blew in my windows and most of the windows in the Army barracks.  Sinn F&eacute;in would not condemn the incident.  The glass blew into the house and almost hit my baby.  Sinn F&eacute;in now has the gall, and the people of Cavan should realise this, to say it wants the Army barracks kept open.  It tried to blow up the barracks in Lifford.  I was young and had a young family and the IRA set off a bomb beside the bridge in Lifford on a lovely summer morning in 1985.  The Senator is too young to remember, which is a pity because I remember it as if it happened yesterday.  My spouse remembers it as well.  A lovely morning was destroyed by people who are the Senator&rsquo;s friends.</P>
        <P>The Senator need not deny them or try to deny them.  Do not come into this House to say that the Army barracks throughout the country should be kept open when your organisation spent 25 or 30 years attempting to blow them up and close them down.  Do not fool the people of Cavan or try to fool us that the IRA wants to keep Army barracks open.  The IRA wanted to close them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesHeffernan"><NameTxt>Senator James Heffernan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I listened with interest to the contributions from Opposition Members.  They were difficult to swallow at times.  In 1998, Castleblayney military post, Clancy Barracks in Dublin, Devoy Barracks in Naas, Fitzgerald Camp in Fermoy, Magee Barracks in Kildare and Murphy Barracks in Ballincollig were closed.  Ten years later, in 2008, Rockhill House in Letterkenny, Lifford military post, Connolly Barracks in Longford and Monaghan military post were closed.  Ten barracks have been closed since 1998 under Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s watch.</P>
        <P>Magee Barracks was a 200-soldier garrison in the heart of Kildare town.  The barracks was closed by the then Minister for Defence, former Deputy Michael Smith, along with five others.  This was at the height of the boom.  The closure has cost more in security and maintenance than any saving that was made.  It is now no longer an outpost for soldiers but a haven for anti-social behaviour, drinking, drug taking and arson.  A huge opportunity was lost by that Government to provide housing, community facilities, a school, playground and so forth in the centre of Kildare town.  I did not hear any of the Fianna F&aacute;il representatives making a case for Magee Barracks or any of the others at the time.  Yet here we are this evening debating this motion in Private Members&rsquo; time, with Fianna F&aacute;il Members shedding crocodile tears before any decision has been made.  Who are they trying to fool with these antics?  Then we hear the Sinn F&eacute;in Members empathising with soldiers and garda&iacute;.  Come on, lads.</P>
        <P>This appears to be a shift in tactics on the part of the Opposition, particularly Fianna F&aacute;il.  A few weeks ago I noticed two Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies marching shoulder to shoulder with the accident and emergency nurses in Limerick.  Those two Deputies had done nothing in six years to help alleviate the problem there.  There they were, however, as bold as brass as they marched up and down the road with the nurses.  This motion and that type of behaviour are just not credible.  I certainly will not support the motion.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe.  I served with his uncle Tony, a former councillor in Carrick-on-Suir, for many years.  I also welcome the group in the Gallery representing the Army spouses, particularly Councillor Patricia Walsh, who is a good friend of mine.  She is married to a Carrick-on-Suir man, who is also a very good friend.  She took a good name with her to Cavan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will speak about Clonmel Barracks.  I am probably unique in this House in that I served in Clonmel Barracks.  I was a member of the FCA for a number of years and was seconded to the Army for a short period from 1979 to 1980 when the barracks was depleted of many personnel due to the mission in Lebanon.  I have an innate knowledge of how the barracks in Clonmel works, and today we have the opportunity to discuss this.  I assure the people in the Visitors Gallery and Members of the Opposition that the horse has not yet bolted from the stable.  This issue is only at discussion level and no decision has been made.  I am here to prove to the Minister that this would not be a good decision.  I will support the Government&rsquo;s amendment, on the basis that it will prolong the discussion on this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At 12.30 p.m. tomorrow, I will be part of a deputation from Clonmel that will meet the Minister to discuss this issue.  The Minister has allocated an hour and a half for the meeting.  We have a very strong case.  I am aware that deputations from Cavan and Mullingar are also arriving here tomorrow.  We intend to convince the Minister that this would not be a good move.  I will deal with some of the cost issues.  The projected cost savings are approximately &euro;1.1 million or between &euro;200,000 and &euro;300,000 per barracks.  This is being examined in a comprehensive spending review.  It will have to be a critical and robust analysis on a cost-benefit basis; it cannot be done in any other way.  It will have to be subject to objective analysis when it is completed.  If it is proven that it would not save money, the idea should be consigned to the dustbin.</P><Col N="933"/>
        <P>Senator Reilly mentioned the cost of travelling from Clonmel to Limerick.  I do not know whether the Senator meant that soldiers should not get the payment but they are entitled to receive it for nine months.  The cost of that will be between &euro;200,000 and &euro;250,000 for thenine months.  The cost of securing the barracks in Clonmel will be between &euro;150,000 and &euro;200,000.</P>
        <P>I ask the Chair for some latitude as I wish to make some further points.  The cost of providing extra accommodation in the barracks in Limerick for personnel who will move to Limerick could be approximately &euro;3 million.  I refer to the cost associated with those who will leave the Army.  Some will not be entitled to full pensions because they do not have the required service and they will have to claim social welfare payments because there are no jobs for them.  This could cost up to &euro;500,000 per annum and all of this will be done to make a saving of &euro;250,000 in Clonmel.  The figures do not add up.  I disagree with the figure put forward by Senator Wilson regarding the cost to the local economy because we have scoped it and it will be agreed by the chamber of commerce locally.  It will be approximately &euro;5 million and it will be a massive loss to the economy of Clonmel and south Tipperary.  When the spending review is completed, the Minister will not close the barracks.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Wilson that the Minister has gone to the top brass and asked them to find savings.  The easiest thing to do is close the four barracks.  All the top brass are based in the Curragh and they do not particularly care about other sites.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in is saying the Government will pay out &euro;700 million in two weeks as a result of the bailout.  Amnesia has returned to the Chamber.  I remind Sinn F&eacute;in Members that their party voted in favour of the bailout.</P>

        <P>When I read the motion, I could not help but reflect that the resilience of Fianna F&aacute;il is a wonder to behold.

	<P>The motion is completely at odds with the policy pursued by Fianna F&aacute;il in government; it is mischievous and it is scare mongering of the worst type.  It does nothing to help the Defence Forces and causes unnecessary worry to members of the force and their families.  When in government, the party implemented two programmes of barrack closures and it closed ten barracks in all.  I have no hesitation in giving Fianna F&aacute;il credit for this; it was one of the few good decisions it made.  What is the difference now, apart from the fact that the Government is facing the worst possible financial mess, inherited from the Fianna F&aacute;il Government led by former Deputies Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen?</P>
        <P Just="Left">To put the motion in perspective, let us consider Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s contrasting approach when in government.  In July 1998, the then Government announced the closure of six barracks, which I will list in case Senator Wilson has forgotten: Ballincollig and Fermoy Barracks, County Cork; Devoy and Magee Barracks, County Kildare; Castleblayney Barracks, County Monaghan; and Clancy Barracks, Dublin.  This resulted in the relocation of 880 personnel.  In the context of the 2009 budget, the then Government also announced the closure of four barracks: Monaghan, Lifford, Longford and Rockhill House, Letterkenny.  When I debate issues in the Lower House, I always wonder whether the Members opposite are suffering from magnesia in some way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Fianna F&aacute;il made a hames of it when it was thinking about the future when last in government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should stick to the subject in hand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The closure of barracks in 2009 resulted in the relocation of 595 personnel.  St. Bricin&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin was also closed by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  The closure of the four barracks has been achieved and the consolidation of St. Bricin&rsquo;s is linked to the provision of modern medical facilities within the existing departmental property portfolio and will take time to implement.  While the closure of the barracks and the sale of the properties has provided funding for investment, it was never the sole driving factor for the consolidation <Col N="935"/>of defence infrastructure.  The primary driver for the reorganisation of barracks and personnel redeployment is the efficient and effective delivery of military capabilities.</P>
        <P>Since 1998, a total of &euro;84.98 million has been realised from the disposal of six of the barracks that have been closed.  Agreement in principle has been reached to dispose of two more of these.  Notwithstanding the extremely depressed state of the property market, it appears that the round of barrack closures effected by Fianna F&aacute;il in 2009 will ultimately yield less than &euro;5 million.  The consolidation of barracks into a smaller number of locations was a key objective of the previous Government&rsquo;s White Paper on Defence and it was recommended in many reports.  It remains a key objective of the ongoing defence modernisation programme to maximise the effectiveness of the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are few opportunities to trim down spending on the Defence Forces without impacting on front-line delivery of services.  It is self-evident that concentrating personnel in fewer locations provides the potential to protect essential collective training and to reduce unnecessary overheads in terms of barrack management, administration, maintenance and security.  It also affords the Minister for Defence the possibility of maintaining the Defence Forces at their current level of approximately 9,500.  That is a priority for the Government and the Minister has put this on the record on numerous occasions.  It is his responsibility to ensure that taxpayer resources allocated to his Department are used in the most efficient way and, similarly, that the assets at our disposal are not wasted.  Does Fianna F&aacute;il understand the phrase &ldquo;not wasted&rdquo;?  The party was well used to wasting money in government.  Whatever Fianna F&aacute;il might say, we are discussing the use of limited resources effectively and productively to ensure we get the best return for the taxpayer.  Fianna F&aacute;il never thought of the taxpayer or workers going to their jobs day in, day out who spent their money wisely.  It was happy enough to be flaithi&uacute;lach with their money for many years.</P>
        <P>Given our grim financial state thanks to the failure of Fianna Fail to capitalise on the gains made during the Celtic tiger years, the Government is faced with making many hard and tough decisions across the public sector.  The Department of Defence is no different in this regard.  We have been forced into a position of making hard and difficult decisions and we cannot stand still.  We have to make the hard decisions sooner rather than later if we are to get out of the current economic climate.  No decision has yet been made, as the Minister has indicated clearly on numerous occasions.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The Government will not shy away from its responsibilities in this regard no matter how difficult the decisions that must be made.  There is no logic in maintaining barracks where there is no operational requirement for them in the first place.  For Fianna F&aacute;il to try to argue otherwise is not the way to put the point across and it is being downright dishonest to the House and to the people in the Visitors Gallery.  It is typical of Fianna F&aacute;il carry on.  It avoids the hard decisions but then again Fianna F&aacute;il is a past master at that.  It is simply putting the parochial interest before the national interest and that has always been the hallmark of a Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  It is the same in opposition; it puts the parochial interest before the national interest.  That is what got this country into the position it is in today.  It put parochialism before the country and our national flag.  I do not believe it ever thought of the national flag and the sovereignty of the country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, although I would not necessarily welcome his speech.  As far as this issue is concerned, these are additional barracks which it is proposed to close.  I will give an example of what the D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill barracks means to people in Cavan.  The former Minister for Defence, the late John Wilson, uncle of our esteemed Whip, Senator Wilson, brought forward the proposal to build it in 1987 during a very difficult recession.  The Taoiseach commended him on looking after his constituency.  The proposal was approved by the Cabinet and it has been a major benefit to the development of Cavan since that date.  A large number of officers and men use that barracks because it is so strategic as far as the Border is concerned, and Senator Wilson outlined that in his speech.  This barracks in the Border area is vitally important.</P>
        <P>We have suffered a bad fallout from the closure of the Longford barracks.  The former Deputy, Peter Kelly, fought as best he could to retain that barracks in Longford.

        <P>I have been informed that the savings to the State here are minimal but the benefits to the areas involved are immense.  Let us be logical.  Unfortunately, too regularly, we hear announcements by private organisations about jobs cuts.  The Minister might say we will not lose any jobs here but if one moves the troops from Cavan, Dundalk, Athlone, Clonmel or elsewhere, the cost to the families is immense.  One breaks up the community in those areas.  Families are settled and their children attend schools within certain hours.  People work at home when officers or members of PDFORRA return home.  They are part of the community.  It is damaging for the area to remove such people from barracks.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Government to desist from the closure of D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill Barracks in Cavan, the Columb Barracks in Mullingar, Kickham Barracks in Clonmel, Stephen&rsquo;s Barracks in Kilkenny and the military barracks in Castlebar.  I presume the military barracks in Castlebar will not close and will be protected by the Taoiseach.</P>

        <P>We appreciate the difficulties in the country.  We had to face them.  We took decisions in the national interest, not that of Fianna F&aacute;il.  If we had we would have gone to the country in September 2010 and allowed Fine Gael to take on the task of introducing a budget.  It is implementing a budget we introduced last year but this decision is ill-advised.  The Government <Col N="939"/>should desist from these closures, bearing in mind the impact they will have on communities.  It is not the time for closures when no alternative jobs are being created in rural areas.  We need jobs.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, to the House.  I ask him to bear in mind our request in this regard.  We closed some barracks but at the time those decisions were made there were no plans to close other barracks.  I ask that they be retained.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I do not think the banter and exchanges we have had in the past 20 minutes do anything to help the families and people in the areas which may be affected. I acknowledge the excellent work undertaken by the Defence Forces on a daily basis. They have stood by the State through turbulent times when subversives and terrorists threatened the very institutions of the State. Their work on peacekeeping duties continues to be an example for all peacekeeping forces in the UN.    The Defence Forces have undergone significant changes in the past ten years.  They have probably witnessed more rationalisation than any other group in the public service.  The wage cuts which all public servants have endured hit the Defence Forces particularly badly.  Many families in the Defence Forces are in receipt of family income supplement and hurting very badly.  Uprooting families will, as has happened over the past number of years, be traumatic for them.  There have been ten barracks closures, as outlined by Members, since 1998.  As everybody knows, previous Governments led by Fianna F&aacute;il destroyed the public finances and led our country practically into receivership.  As a result we have had to undertake a searching reappraisal of every aspect of public expenditure.</P>
        <P>The legacy we have inherited is so dreadful that no area of expenditure can be excluded from the review.  I regret that the Defence Forces are not exempt from the review.  There are few opportunities to trim defence spending without impacting on front line delivery.  The potential to protect essential collective training and reduce unnecessary overheads, such as barrack management, administration, maintenance and security, is something that will have to be examined.  It affords the Minister the possibility of maintaining the Defence Forces at their current level of approximately 9,500.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are told the primary driver of barrack reorganisation and redeployment is the efficient and effective delivery of military capabilities.  The Defence Forces are now at the lowest level since the 1970s.  This is a result of the previous Government&rsquo;s proposals and actions in the past ten to 12 years.  It is very hard to understand how people from Fianna F&aacute;il can come into the House and condemn barrack closures, which we believe are pending, after it closed 12 barracks.  The top brass and senior personnel in the Defence Forces are leading the change for operational purposes.  I would like that position to be changed.  I hope the Minister will listen to the various suggestions on where barracks may close, but in view of the facts I have outlined I am not very hopeful.</P>

        <P>This debate comes at a time when many families across Ireland are worried about the approaching budget and the additional charges and taxes it will undoubtedly bring to their lives.  It is a cruel twist that we have the budget in the weeks before Christmas, a time when the burden of expectation weighs heavily on families across the country, extra bills and costs flood in and purse strings are stretched to the maximum.</P><Col N="940"/>
        <P>For families of Defence Force staff this year there is an extra challenge.  Not only do they have to adjust to the reductions in pay which all State employees have had to endure but they have the unwelcome uncertainty around whether they will have to relocate in the coming year.  The prospect of renewed and further barrack closures must weigh heavily on them, in particular on people based in towns such as Mullingar, Cavan, Clonmel, Kilkenny and Castlebar.</P>
        <P>In the decision that will be made it should be remembered that the families of serving personnel suffer the most significant disruption and impact on their lives when they are forced to relocate.  They will have to sell houses which, in the collapsed market, will impose significant losses on many people.  There will be difficulties in securing school places elsewhere.  They will be leaving support networks of friends and relatives behind, as others have said.</P>
        <P>Many of the people we are discussing in the abstract have laid down roots in the communities where their loved ones have been posted.  They have made long-term decisions based on the future.  They have made commitments which the decision to close a post will cancel.  The families of our serving personnel should be kept to the fore in the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the issue.</P>
        <P>A critical issue in the discussion we are having is balanced regional development.  Some years ago a previous Administration introduced, with a fanfare of publicity and flurry of expectation, a report that was to set the course of future investment in services and infrastructure in Ireland.  I refer to the national spatial strategy.</P>
        <P>There is no shortage of expensive reports gathering dust on the shelves of the Oireachtas Library but the national spatial strategy is perhaps the most intriguing.  It proposed to move from what had been a legacy of rather disjointed developments during the Celtic tiger years to charting new paths for balanced regional investment and infrastructure.  Unfortunately, I understand the strategy has been killed off and is to be found in the Natural History Museum rather than the Oireachtas Library, stuffed and mounted in a glass case.</P>
        <P>I raise the issue of the national spatial strategy in the context of this debate to illustrate a broader point about the critical importance of supporting large gateway towns that act as service and commercial hubs for hinterland regions.  The decision to close Army barracks in the towns mentioned flies in the face of any commitment to balanced regional development.  Mullingar is home to Columb barracks and traditionally the artillery corps of the Defence Forces.  It is a thriving town with a population of over 18,000, historically a busy market centre, a key town in County Westmeath and for the region generally, and a gateway town earmarked for investment and infrastructural expansion.  The barracks is the base for 200 troops and support staff and the income generated from pay, pensions and ancillary purchases is worth &euro;10 million to the local economy.  The nearest sizeable private sector employer was the US multinational financial services firm Capmark, which had a financial shared services centre employing 250 in Mullingar until it halved its staff in July 2008 as the recession took hold, with 50 staff taking voluntary redundancy.  The final jobs left from the company in October 2010, with 50 local call centre jobs moving 35 miles up the N4 to Maynooth because suitable office space could not be found in Mullingar.  We are left with a town that has been damaged by the recession and associated job losses.</P>
        <P>There is little we can do to prevent a multinational from shutting up shop and axing jobs but the public sector and the Defence Forces are firmly within the Government&rsquo;s control.  The closure of Mullingar barracks will not occasion the redundancy of the 200 personnel based there; they would be moved to another location.  On that basis, why is the Government deter<Col N="941"/>mined to contribute to the decline of towns like Mullingar, which have been singled out as the very towns we should support to attain balanced regional development?  Apart from the immediate costs in transferring and redeploying people, can the Minister confirm where the spare capacity in other barracks is to be found?</P>
        <P>In January 2008, the Defence Forces strategic planning office prepared a discussion paper on possible options for barrack closures.  The paper followed the earlier conclusions of a working group established in 2004 to review the Department of Defence&rsquo;s existing property portfolio.  A key rationale advanced for the closure of various military establishments, leaving aside the changed security situation on the Border, was the windfall that could be obtained from selling barracks that were invariably located in town centres and prime development sites.  This rationale no longer stands considering the current property market.  It is foolhardy indeed to contemplate closing military barracks as there is no market for these properties to be disposed of.</P>
        <P>There is a danger these towns will be left with the physical legacy of a large, empty building that the taxpayer must pay to keep secure.  The Government can act to stop the decline of these regional towns that have seen so many job losses as the small and medium business sector has contracted, by choosing to prioritise investment, not just from multinationals through the IDA, but using its own discretion to retain the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The Government states in its self-congratulatory amendment that the plans to tackle the economic crisis are now bearing fruit.  The fruit is still rather sour.  In situations where we can control what we prioritise, balanced regional development must be maintained as a priority.  The Minister has the power to shield areas from adverse economic impact through the retention of jobs and services where there is no sound economic case for their refusal.  That is not even to mention the strong social impacts of closing barracks, the historical connections between towns and their barracks and the supports to youth, the elderly and volunteerism in the area in which the Defence Forces are so intimately involved.  In Mullingar, the troops raised &euro;30,000 for the stroke unit in the local hospital.</P>
        <P>At family, community and economic and regional development level, there is a case for the Government to reconsider its approach.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not intend to contribute to this debate but I feel compelled to do so when I hear the arguments from the other side of the House and the language that has been used.  It is terrible to hear Fianna F&aacute;il Senators speaking about our soldiers as if they were economic units, how much they spend locally and how much they are worth to the economy.  Is that all the Defence Forces are to Fianna F&aacute;il?  It is a dreadful and disrespectful way to speak about the Defence Forces, Irishmen and Irishwomen who are proud to wear the uniform of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, the real &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann that is.</P>
        <P>The language used by Fianna F&aacute;il betrays something else, their real motives perhaps.  It has nothing to do with barrack closures.  These decent people were brought down here to be codded by Fianna F&aacute;il and to pretend this is about barrack closures.  It is not, it is about political point scoring and that is all.  It is obvious that Fianna F&aacute;il is whipping up fear among ordinary decent people for political point scoring.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To hear Sinn F&eacute;in Senators talking about it, as they profess to be concerned about the welfare of the Defence Forces, is nothing short of the meanest hypocrisy and the worst type of dishonesty.

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this motion.  It was well presented by Senator Wilson.  It is important to note there was some pruning done in the past of barracks and like any fruit tree, it was important some pruning was done; it was appropriate and acceptable.  This further attempt to close several barracks, however, will kill the fruit tree.  It is a slash and grab effort and it is deplorable because it was not too long ago when some of the Members now in the other House who were on this side of the Seanad fiercely condemned the closure of certain barracks.</P>
        <P>About four months ago, the Minister for Defence came to the House on the defence Bill that dealt with the appointment of a military judge, an issue about which I had a particular view.  At that stage he indicated that it was an urgent matter and there was a backlog of courts martial and hearings in the military court and a judge had to be appointed.  We are still waiting for that appointment to be made.</P>
        <P>The appointment of a military court judge could be well dealt with by the secondment of a Circuit Court judge for two or three weeks.  Many of the cases are technical and could be dealt with in that timeframe by a Circuit Court judge on secondment.  The legislation to deal with the appointment of a military judge would cost &euro;350,000 per annum.  Any of these barracks could be kept open for that amount.</P>
        <P>If the barracks are closed, the saving to the Exchequer is negligible.  It is not cost-effective to do this and it serves no purpose.  We talk about supporting the Defence Forces but no other party in this House has a greater respect and affinity with the Defence Forces since the foundation of the State than Fianna F&aacute;il.  I do not want to go into historical episodes where a certain party had a great distrust of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  I was proud to serve for many years in my young days in the LDF as a support for the Army at the time and I was glad to play my little part.</P>
        <P>The Government is trying to convey the idea that the closures will bring about huge savings and are necessitated by the economic crisis.  Certain events happened.  Some were of an international nature and outside the control of the previous Government or anyone else.  The medicine prescribed by the outgoing Government in its last budget is the same as that being applied <Col N="943"/>by the current Government.  We should not be lectured as to where things did or did not go wrong.</P>
        <P>The proposal to close these barracks is short-sighted.  The Government is being penny wise and pound foolish.  Savings over the next five or seven years will be so negligible that this decision will come back to haunt the Government.  The attempt to close barracks, whether D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill in Cavan, Columb Barracks in Mullingar or Stephens Barracks in Kilkenny, and to dress the closures up like a wolf in lamb&rsquo;s clothing will not go down well with the public, or with the people of Cavan, Mullingar or Kilkenny.</P>
        <P>I am glad to lend my support to this motion.  I believe the Minister for Defence is disingenuous, as he has been in the past.  The issue of the appointment of a military judge was another red herring.  We are going down a dangerous and unnecessary road.  I ask Senators on the Government side to vote for the motion and save embarrassment.</P>

They stood for election on a programme for Government and pre-election promises most of which are already broken. Today&rsquo;s job losses in Aviva point to the failure of the Government&rsquo;s jobs initiative. Fianna F&aacute;il is proposing something the Government can do to keep jobs in major towns by confirming that the barracks will not close. The 700 men and women of the Defence Forces who are stationed in these barracks do an excellent job for the country at home and abroad. The Leader acknowledged this in his contribution, and none of us has any doubt about that, but words mean nothing and deeds mean everything. The Government can respond to the motion tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il by confirming that it will not close the barracks in Mullingar, Clonmel and Cavan.

	<P>I will not block their speaking.  They will have plenty of opportunities to speak.  The result of the vote will be the most interesting aspect of this debate.  The Government Chief Whip is dealing with this matter on behalf of the Minister who could not come here as he is busy, given that he has two portfolios.  The Minister cannot address PDFORRA and cannot come into the House to tell us what the Government is going to do.  Members opposite do not know either what the Government is going to do.

	<P>It is a <i>fait accompli</i> that the barracks in Cavan will be closed.  As I understand it, there is no economic benefit in this regard.  The cost of closing the barracks will be equivalent to its remaining open.  As I stated, the Minister, Deputy Penrose, is at least making a great stand for Mullingar barracks.  I commend his efforts in that regard.  However, others are notable in their silence, except in their speeches in this House.  I am sure they attend public meetings in their constituencies.  Fine words on the closure of these barracks and the impact of this on people&rsquo;s families are no good to the people in Clonmel, Cavan or Mullingar.  It is the result of the vote that will matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government amendment states: &ldquo;...accepts that reform and reorganisation of the public service, including the effective use of State assets, is a key element of these plans&rdquo;.  We all know that there is no hope of any assets being realised or of any money being earned by the State from the sale of these assets in the current economic climate.  It is hard to imagine a modern military purpose-built barracks securing much funding on the open market.  There may be some that would find use it, such as the Americans.  Perhaps the Government, which wants us to rejoin the Commonwealth, might sell it to the British army.</P>

I <Col N="947"/>was making the point that the Government might perhaps like to give the barracks in Cavan to the parachute regiment and we would rejoin the Commonwealth.

	<P Just="Left">I thank colleagues on all sides for their contributions.  I regret the Minister of State made a scurrilous contribution to this debate and did not take seriously the amendment tabled in good faith by my party and out of genuine concern for the 700 members of the Army and their families.  I regret the issue was not taken seriously by the Minister of State.  I regret also that the Minister was not here for the debate on this important issue.  I would like at this point to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, to the House.  The security of the State is at risk as a result of the proposals which the Minister for Defence, Deputy Shatter, proposes to make to the Cabinet.</P>
        <P>With the indulgence of the House, I would like to put the following on the record of the House.  During the past couple of days I obtained a security report which states that in the last eight months or so the PSNI has had to deal with up to ten devices, all viable and not elaborate hoaxes, left on the northern side of the Border.  This occurred in the Rosslea-Newtownbutler area.  Also, a number of devices were recently dealt with in Wattle Bridge.  A jeep, used to transport one of these devices, ended up in Castle Sanderson forest, which straddles the Border with Fermanagh and Cavan.  This incident took place within seven miles of D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill barracks in Cavan town, one of the barracks which it is proposed to close.  I also have before me a document outlining dissident Republican activity in 2010 and up to 13 October 2011.  It details serious subversive activity, Loyalist and Republican&mdash;&mdash;-</P>

	<P Just="Left">As pointed out by a number of speakers on this side, it is up to the Government to decide where savings are to be made.  While I accept that savings must be made within the Department of Defence, taking this out on 700 soldiers and their families is not the way to go about it.  The document I have before me details the wages of the top rank and file of the armed forces.  Most of the people who are deciding the future of the soldiers in the five barracks referred to in Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s motion are on average salaries of &euro;150,000 per annum, basic.  This does not take into account the plethora of allowances that go with their cosy positions.</P>

	<P Just="Left">These people are insulated in one of seven barracks in the Curragh.  These are the people who are making the balls for the Minister to throw.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, as a sensible and reasonable businessman point out to the Minister for Defence, Deputy Alan Shatter, that no savings will be made by closing these barracks?  On the contrary, it will cost tens of millions of euro to close them, not to mention the human cost for 700 Army personnel and their families.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator Gilroy and his party colleagues should check the debates in this and the Lower House when the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government had to close ten barracks.  What was said this evening by Fianna F&aacute;il, the Independent and Sinn F&eacute;in Members is mild to what was said back then by the Opposition which is now in government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim c&eacute;ad f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  T&aacute; m&eacute; thar a bheith bu&iacute;och di as ucht teacht isteach ar an gceist iontach t&aacute;bhachtach seo.</P><Col N="951"/>
        <P Just="Left">I raise on the Adjournment this issue which relates to the Vision Impaired Service Providers Alliance, VISPA, and services for persons with visual impairment.  As the Minister will be aware, last week was World Vision Day and a group from VISPA marched to the D&aacute;il and handed a letter in to the Taoiseach, and my party organised an information session with them on the previous evening.  The VISPA group is made up of four organisations. They are the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, St. Joseph&rsquo;s Centre for the Visually Impaired and Fighting Blindness. They are trying to draw awareness to the issue of visual impairment.  Some 224,832 persons in Ireland are affected by sight loss, while 12,995 persons are classified as blind. </P>
        
        
        <P Just="Left">I want to recognise at this stage the input of Senator Conway to this debate and, certainly, last week as well.  He is always vocal on this issue, for which I commend him.</P>
        <P>The real financial cost of visual impairment and blindness in Ireland is estimated to be &euro;386.09 million in 2010 and the charities mentioned provide essential services and lead innovation.  For over 70 years, Ireland&rsquo;s vision rehabilitation needs have been met largely by charitable organisations and while they receive Government funds, their success depends on individual generosity and fund-raising.  They provide essential services and lead innovation in the areas of education and retraining, mobility and independent living, social care and counselling, developing better assistive technologies, and also funding social and medical research on blindness.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A commitment was made in 2003.  I refer to the WHO global resolution, supported by the Government in 2003 and 2009.  In that commitment the Government committed to create a national co-ordinating committee by 2009 to implement the recommendations in Vision 2020, yet nothing has been established to date.  Some 118 World Health Organization member states have established national committees, as was indicated in that commitment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government must honour the commitments in that document and it should do this as quickly as possible.  The cost of sight loss survey indicates that the State&rsquo;s investment in vision health is more than  &euro;380 million, that is more than &euro;1 million a day.  This funding should be co-ordinated and delivered through a national vision strategy, which is another part of the Adjournment motion.  Included in a vision strategy would be the following: access to services such as opthomology, which are under-funded, and critical planning. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">With regard to rehabilitation, with the right support people affected by sight loss can maintain a good quality of life and this is very important.  Research needs to be continually funded.  Interestingly, although this area involves people with a disability, it also has great potential because it is the area in which some of the top research in the world is being done.  Last week, I was told by the experts dealing with it that clinical trials would be imminent if funding was continued.  If clinical trials can be put in place, not only would they provide great help to those suffering from loss of sight or blindness, but they would create the potential for jobs in the country because the cures that potentially could be developed on Irish soil would make us a world leader in the area.  It would make no sense whatsoever to stop investment in research, and this investment should be increased.  We also need to increase the awareness of people about the issues involved.</P>
        <P>Is the Government willing to support VISPA&rsquo;s recommendations?  It has called on the Government to work with all vision health stakeholders to develop and implement a vision health plan for Ireland.  We cannot afford to wait to plan for the imminent vision health crisis.  T&aacute; m&eacute; thar a bheith bu&iacute;och don Aire agus tuigim go bhfuil a fhios aige go maith faoin gc&aacute;s <Col N="952"/>seo agus go dteasta&iacute;onn an taca&iacute;ocht seo.

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Senator raising the issue as it gives me an opportunity to set out the Government&rsquo;s thinking on it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Vision 2020 is the global initiative for the elimination of avoidable blindness.  It is a joint programme of the World Health Organization and the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness.  On a worldwide basis, it is estimated that up to 80% of blindness is avoidable, which indicates cost-effective treatments are available.  Vision 2020 has targeted a number of diseases that contribute to blindness.  Many of these diseases are related to infections commonly found in tropical regions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The World Health Organization monitoring committee for the elimination of avoidable blindness stated in 2006 that, generally speaking, the prevention of blindness is, for the most part, not a public health issue in a large percentage of countries in the Americas and Europe.  It went on to state that many of the countries in these two regions have long solved their infrastructure problems and their health care delivery systems function efficiently.</P>
        <P>It is not proposed to set up a national co-ordinating committee to develop and implement a national vision policy, strategy and plan.  However, the Government will continue to provide and develop vision services and supports through health prevention, screening and intervention policies and programmes.  I will outline these services in a moment.  We will also continue to support the members of the Vision Impaired Service Providers Alliance, including the National Council for the Blind, the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, St. Joseph&rsquo;s Centre for the Visually Impaired and Fighting Blindness, regarding service provision, research and support for visually impaired people in Ireland.</P>
        <P>A number of eye conditions are part of Vision 2020, including cataract, refractive error, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration.  Detection and treatment services are already available throughout the country, in community and acute hospital settings, for many conditions which can lead to vision impairment and blindness.  For example, diabetic retinopathy is one of the most serious complications of diabetes.  We know that screening, followed by treatment of retinopathy, is very effective in preventing blindness.  Earlier this year, the national cancer screening programme was formally requested by the Health Service Executive to commence the development of a national diabetic retinopathy screening programme.  A total of &euro;4 million has been made available in 2011 for the development of a screening model.</P>
        <P>Screening tests for glaucoma are available and treatment involves anti-glaucoma medication, which is also widely available.  Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of blindness in industrialised countries.  Treatment options are available for certain types of macular degeneration, although it is generally agreed that further research is required and this is on-going on a global basis.  The Health Service Executive provides screening through child health examinations.  Children are eligible for ophthalmic treatment and optical appliances in respect of any problems noted at child health examinations.  More than ten years ago, a scheme was launched which provides free eye examinations and free spectacles to adult medical card holders.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Cataract is clouding of the lens of the eye and is amenable to surgical intervention.  This surgery is widely available in acute hospitals.  In July, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, announced changes in the role of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The special delivery unit, work<Col N="953"/>ing in close collaboration with the NTPF, will introduce a more focused strategy to target treatments for patients and systematically reduce waiting lists.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Where people are blind, the focus of any health or personal social service support is to facilitate full participation in the social and economic life of the community.  When we develop policies, strategies or action plans for people with a disability, those who are blind or with a visual impairment are included.  The Government will finalise a value for money and policy review of disability services before the end of the year.  The report of the disability policy review has been published for public consultation and I urge everyone with an interest in the area to participate and give their opinion; we will be interested to hear them.  It is my intention to examine both the policy report and the value for money report, and in conjunction with the Minister, I will bring proposals for the future of disability services to the Government.</P>
        <P>I contend that, while it is not proposed at this time to develop a specific vision strategy, we are working through the actions required to address the goal of the WHO&rsquo;s initiative, namely, to eliminate avoidable blindness in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very disappointed to hear the Government does not intend to establish a national co-ordinating committee to develop and implement a national vision policy, strategy or plan.  We are often told that we have international commitments.  The Government made commitments to the WHO in 2003 and 2009.  If we are able to renege on a health commitment, why can we not renege on our commitments to the EU, the IMF and the troika?  It beggars belief that we can meet our commitments in an economic area but not in health.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With respect, the reply did not address the issue of research funding.  People suffering from this disability do not have time and we need to implement a strategy.  They tell us research is crucial.  Therefore, we strongly urge that funding in this area is not cut.  It deserves essential funding.  Certainly funding for research should be maintained or increased because of its economic and job potential.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have no indication that visual impairment research funding will be cut.  It would be wrong to state it will be.  We have several obligations with regard to disability.  We have not yet signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities but we intend to do so.  It is a process and we will continue along the road in respect of our other international obligations also.  When it comes to how we deal with people who are visually impaired, our priority should be to provide this service for them and we are well on the way to doing this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome Minister of State.  The issue I wish to raise follows quite nicely from the previous debate because it is with regard to the provision ofdiabetic pumps and the appropriate backup staff for children with type 1 diabetes in County Galway.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Approximately 3,000 children and adolescents in Ireland have diabetes, and approximately 850 of them live in the HSE West area of which 200 to 250 live in Galway city and county.  Almost all of these children and adolescents have type 1 diabetes, with the incidence of type 1 diabetes in childhood and adolescence having doubled in the past 20 years, which is quite an increase.</P>
        <P>Generally, Ireland has very poor paediatric diabetes care, with over half of the patients having no access to a proper multidisciplinary team and many of the rest travelling long distances for care.  Currently, children and adolescents with diabetes outside of Dublin are at a <Col N="954"/>geographical disadvantage because of the lack of local services.  On the other hand, children and adolescents with diabetes in Dublin, where there are services, are at a numerical disadvantage because so many children from outside Dublin are forced to travel there.  Dublin services are inundated with referrals for children and adolescents with diabetes from throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Children and adolescents with diabetes must attend hospital on average four to five times per year to monitor their diabetes.  Monitoring children and adolescents with diabetes in hospital aims to limit the subtle but cumulative damage which diabetes can cause to the eyes, kidneys, nerves and smaller blood vessels.  Up to 50% of children and adolescents with diabetes will have some form of long-term diabetes complication by the time they reach adulthood.  This is worrying.  Diabetes is a cumulative condition and if it is not properly approached and dealt with, complications can emerge quickly.  In order to reduce the risk of a child developing any of these long-term complications, children and adolescents with diabetes learn to control their diabetes and to monitor their blood sugars and insulin levels.</P>
        <P>Self-control of diabetes is challenging but this is what the parents want because they know that is what is best for their children.  Technological advances now allow children and adolescents with diabetes to monitor their diabetes with intensive therapies, such as insulin pumps, much more effectively and accurately than with standard treatments.</P>
        <P>Insulin pumps are the focus of my Adjournment matter.  An insulin pump is a medical device used for the administration of insulin in the treatment of diabetes and of MDI, multiple daily injections of insulin.  Both are an advance on the standard twice-daily injection with insulin.  Insulin pumps are more correctly referred to as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.  Insulin pump technology is not available at hospitals where the vast majority of children and adolescents with diabetes receive their diabetes care.  Pumps are an effective method of insulin delivery and are the method of choice in many countries that practise intensive insulin management.  An improved quality of life is associated with pump usage.</P>
        <P>The use of insulin pump technology makes a lot of sense.  The long-term cost to the health service of not approaching diabetes early is huge.  Patients in Ireland should have an equal opportunity to access pump therapy and they and their parents are increasingly seeking insulin pumps.  The funding issue regarding pumps is improving, but it is still inadequate as demand for pumps, for example in Galway University Hospital, vastly exceeds supply.  Insulin pumps are, essentially, unavailable in Galway where only 12 pumps are allocated per year, despite the hospital having the correct clinical expertise on hand.  Parents of children with diabetes in Galway are clear that they want this treatment and more pumps made available locally.  Having children treated in Dublin means four to five trips per year, days off school and the transfer of the child&rsquo;s care to a Dublin hospital where there are no records for those children.</P>
        <P>The provision of a comprehensive pump service requires essential personnel on the mutidisciplinary team, in particular a paediatric diabetes dietician and a pump nurse.  A paediatric diabetes dietician is an essential member of the multidisciplinary team required to offer effective insulin management to parents and children.  The paediatric diabetes service at Galway University Hospital, with a patient load of 110, has access to dietetic services for just 12 hours per month.  This is below recommended levels and this service is currently not available as the person in question is on maternity leave and due to the embargo on recruitment has not been replaced.  This issue must be re-examined.</P>
        <P>The diabetes nurse specialist staffing levels are also below recommended levels.  The hospital has only a whole time equivalent of 0.75 as opposed to the recommended level of 1.5 and there is no psychologist on the team.  Despite the best effort of team members, this can impact on <Col N="955"/>the quality of care provided.  A ring-fenced paediatric dietetic service at Galway University Hospital and nationally is urgently required to ensure the provision of intensive insulin management and a satisfactory insulin pump service.</P>
        <P>I am surprised to learn that insulin pumps are more available in some counties, such as Dublin and Clare.  These counties have funding, but others do not.  Will the Minister ensure that the multidisciplinary team for diabetes care is properly and adequately staffed?  Investing now in paediatric diabetes care will reduce the cost to the State in the long run of dealing with complications in adults caused by poorly managed paediatric care.  Will the Minister of State explain why there are adequate pumps available in Dublin and Clare, but not in Galway where there is a case load of 110 patients, but only 12 pumps available?</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Healy Eames for raising this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is estimated that there are between 3,000 and 4,000 children and young adults under 16 years of age with diabetes in Ireland.  Over 90% have type 1 diabetes but there is an increasing number of young patients developing type 2 diabetes.  The incidence of type 1 diabetes is also increasing by about 2 to 3% per year and experts anticipate that in the next ten to 15 years, the incidence of type 1 diabetes will double.  Type 1 diabetes is a particularly complex condition in children and young adults and therefore it is recommended that their care be delivered in a multidisciplinary setting with access to a consultant paediatric endocrinologist and other diabetes health care specialists.  In view of the complexity of the condition and the significant dangers of hypoglycaemia to the developing brain, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, commonly referred to as insulin pump therapy, is often a preferred treatment option.  An insulin pump is a method of administering insulin on a continuous infusion basis and is portable and easy to use.  It is an alternative to injections and is an appropriate therapy for younger children.</P>
        <P>The suitability of certain children or adolescents for insulin pumps is also a factor that must be taken into account.  The HSE national clinical programme for diabetes &mdash; which includes the care of children and adolescents with diabetes &mdash; was established within the clinical strategy and programmes directorate.  The purpose of the programme is to define the way diabetic clinical services should be delivered, resourced and measured.  A clinician has been appointed to lead on the development of the programme, which has as its central aim to save lives, eyes and limbs of patients with diabetes.</P>
        <P>Improvements in the care for children and young adults with diabetes are required and with this in mind a number of proposed models have been suggested.  One model, based on eight to ten regional networks with the three existing Dublin centres acting as a tertiary hub of excellence and continuing to see one third of the national paediatric and adolescent diabetes population, comes from the recent Diabetes Federation of Ireland diabetes action campaign.  The second model is from the expert advisory group report.  This model proposes that care be centralised for each region in a dedicated paediatric and adolescent diabetes centre, looking after at least 150 children or adolescents.  Ideally the centre should be in a regional hospital that has an adult diabetes centre to facilitate transition to adult care.  However, the final shape of any model will be determined by the working group and may be a variation of either of the two earlier models described.</P><Col N="956"/>
        <P Just="Left">While services are provided for children and adolescents with diabetes in all the major hospitals across HSE West, there is no pump service available and children must attend either Crumlin or Temple Street to avail of this service.  I wish to inform the House that the national clinical leads for diabetes and paediatrics met recently to discuss the issues involved in the care of children and adolescents with diabetes.  They set up a working group to assess current services across the country, to agree a model of care and to standardise these across the country.  This work will also include work on the provision of insulin pumps.  The group will also work on a policy to prevent and aid the early detection of diabetes in young children and adolescents.  The group was only recently established and its work is continuing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In HSE West, services are provided by paediatricians with a special interest in diabetes in Galway University Hospital, Portiuncula Hospital and Mayo General Hospital.  The consultants are supported by clinical nurse specialists in diabetes and the diabetes teams have access to dieticians, psychologists and social workers.  The consultants are supported by clinical nurse specialists in diabetes and the diabetes teams have access to dieticians, psychologists and social workers.  In addition, transitional clinics are provided across HSE West for adolescents who are transferring from the paediatric service to the adult service.  It is widely recognised that secondary or acute care alone cannot cope with the current and increasing burden of disease.  Re-organising systems into more integrated models presents opportunities for a more efficient and effective approach to the management of diabetes care.  Diabetes service implementation groups have been established countrywide, including in HSE West.  At national level, a priority of the working group is to progress the integrated care model of care.  Work is continuing in this regard in order to improve services available for this chronic disease across the health system.</P>
        <P>Regarding maternity leave and speaking as the Minister of State with responsibility for equality, they should be exempt from the embargo.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted by the final comment of the Minister of State.  Everything the Minister of State said is what I said.  She reiterated the story and, by and large, she accepts that there is a strong case for what we have said.  When will the working group deliberate?  What is the timeframe for the group to decide which measure to take?  The Minister of State said that a clinician has been appointed to lead the development of the programme.  Where is the clinician based?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The clinician will be a national lead, which is important.  The difficulty with diabetes is that the service has been patchy around the country.  The service in Dublin has always been the best and people travel from as far as Cork.  There was a huge difficulty with childhood diabetes in Cork for a number of years.  It has improved but further improvements remain to be made.  Rather than a standardised performance across the country, the performance is patchy.  A clinical lead brings standardisation into play.  Putting the working group in place is a huge step forward.  This is a problem that will double in the coming years and we must consider management of this chronic disease.  The consequences of not managing it properly may be horrendous.  It is often forgotten in this debate that having a specialist nurse at the end of the telephone line, who can reassure parents in the early stages and explain how to manage the child&rsquo;s condition, would prevent many children from ending up in hospital.  I hope the working group will look seriously at this.</P>

      <sTitle>School Staffing</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the matter of Gaelscoil Chnoc na R&eacute;, Ballydoogan, Sligo.  I should be able to debate the matter in Irish but I cannot and that may be part of the reason this motion should be listened to and acted upon by the Government.  It relates to a decision taken by the Department of Education and Skills whereby this school will lose two permanent teachers at the end of the month and the principal will return to the classroom.  Staffing at the school will be reduced from seven classroom teachers and an administrative principal to six teachers, including the principal.  As a result, class sizes and the number of mixed classes will increase, despite the number of pupils in the school increasing from 166 to 177 in the past year.  The school has been in existence since 1996 and is in temporary accommodation.  A health and safety study in 2009 found the school&rsquo;s accommodation to be inadequate despite the high level of educational standards maintained by the teaching staff.  The school had a large catchment area as there is no gaelscoil from south Donegal to south Leitrim.  A great number of people are serviced by the institution and its growth from an initial 22 students in its founding year has been consistent over the years.</P>
        <P>The decision taken by the Department, towards the end of the last Administration, means that the school is to lose two teachers.  The favourable pupil-teacher ratio in small and developing gaelscoileanna was to be abandoned with effect from September.  Reasonable and proven educational and linguistic reasons support this favourable ratio and we should examine the matter again.  The amount of money is small in the greater scheme of things and there are a small number of gaelscoileanna.  The Minister has resource issues in the context of scarcity and our changed economic environment but that is the challenge of government, to redeploy resources where they can have the maximum impact.  Education is clearly one of those cases.</P>
        <P>Next month, &euro;700 million will be paid on unsecured bonds, presumably to one of the great European banks, and a further &euro;1.2 billion will be paid at the beginning of next year.  I realise there is a European angle to this but it is incumbent on the Government to look for a reduction on some of the bond terms.  That would give adequate resources to deal with smaller issues like the gaelscoileanna, which will have such an impact on the community in Sligo.</P>
        <P>An appeal is possible and will be lodged this week.  I hope that common sense will prevail rather than a literal interpretation of the rules.  This is an independent appeals board but I asked the Minister to provide additional terms of reference to the independent appeals board to use common sense when considering the grounds put forward by gaelscoileanna such as Gaelscoil Chnoc na R&eacute;, when they lose out marginally on the basis of the criteria.  It is a double blow in the context of increased number of students.  The school will lose not one teacher but two, including the administrative principal.</P>
        <P>If it was up to the Minister of State, this would be done as a personal favour to me but I know that central government cannot operate like this.  A small number of gaelscoileanna are affected in this way.  Immersion education requires to be treated differently, where additional effort and resources are required to deal with an entire curriculum through the medium of Irish.  That contributes to the renewal of our language, to which all parties are committed.  I hope the Minister of State can be helpful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s lack of Irish, his enthusiasm and passion for the issue is evident.  I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue as it affords me the opportunity to outline the position with regard to the staffing schedule for gaelscoileanna for the 2011-12 school year.</P><Col N="958"/>
        <P Just="Left">The standardisation of the staffing schedule for gaelscoileanna, in order that it is the same as that which applies to primary schools generally, is one of a number of measures introduced in budget 2011 to control and reduce teacher numbers.  These changes became effective on 1 September 2011.  The school referred to by the Senator now has the same pupil thresholds as ordinary national schools for the appointment and retention of mainstream classroom teachers.  Given the financial constraints in which this country now finds itself, it is not possible to reverse these changes.  The gaelscoileanna movement is well established and I do not believe that the growth of gaelscoileanna will be impeded by way of this measure.  This change in the staffing schedule has resulted in an overall reduction of the order of 50 posts in gaelscoileanna. There are more than 1,500 teaching posts in these schools. </P>
        
        <P>The Government will endeavour to protect front-line education services as far as possible.  However, this must be done within the context of bringing overall public expenditure into line with what we can afford as a country.  All areas of expenditure, including funding for gaelscoileanna, must be managed on a reduced level of resources.  The challenge will be to ensure the resources provided are used to maximum effect in order to achieve the best possible outcomes for pupils.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Under the revised staffing schedule for gaelscoileanna, Gaelscoil Chnoc na R&eacute;, Ballydoogan, County Sligo, was allocated a staffing of a principal and five mainstream classroom teachers, based on its reduced enrolment of 166 on 30 September 2011.  While mainstream staffing for any school year is based on the previous September&rsquo;s enrolment, there is a provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolment.  The school in question was allocated two additional mainstream posts on developing grounds, based on a projected increased enrolment for 30 September 2011.  The school has now informed the Department that it has not achieved its projected increased enrolment and the posts have therefore been suppressed with effect from 4 November 2011.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is open to any board of management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeal board.  Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0019/2011, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The appeal board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the issue of accommodation, Gaelscoil Chnoc na R&eacute; is currently located in rented accommodation at St. Mary&rsquo;s GAA club, at a cost of &euro;131,922.54 per annum, which is grant-aided by the Department at a rate of 100%.  A reconfiguration of the temporary accommodation was approved in 2009, providing a purpose-built two-storey, modular and temporary unit in addition to the clubhouse accommodation at St. Mary&rsquo;s GAA club.</P>
        <P>An application for a new school building was received from the school authorities in March 1999 and assigned a band rating of 2.2, in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s published criteria for prioritising large-scale capital projects, which are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The progression of all large-scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered.  Their progression is contingent on the availability of funding within the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme and the competing demands for this funding.  However, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the particular project at this time.</P>
        <P>I understand fully the frustration of boards of management, teachers and parents when a school is given an allocation which is subsequently withdrawn through no fault of the school.  Unfortunately, in the current circumstances, in which we are relying on the generosity of others, resources are limited.</P>

	<P>I am disappointed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s response, although I appreciate it is one of those set-piece documents the Department doles out on this issue.  The reality is that one size does not fit all when it comes to gaelscoileanna.  I appreciate that we must get by with fewer resources, but I remind the Minister of State that we are about to pay back very large amounts of money to unsecured bondholders.  Even a slight reduction in that repayment would facilitate the issue of immersion education and the needs of Gaelscoil Chnoc na R&eacute; and others like it throughout the State.</P>
        <P>I also remind the Minister of State that at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education, there was cross-party agreement, including from Labour Party Members, that we should lobby heavily on this issue.  I ask the Minister of State to urge her colleague, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, to direct that common sense prevail in the appeal process in regard to this school.</P>

	<P>Scoil Ghorm&aacute;in Naofa in Gorey, County Wexford, is a standard two-classroom school built in 1950, similar to many older schools throughout the State.  Today there are 128 pupils on the roll, who are largely accommodated in six prefabricated buildings, one of which functions as a disabled toilet.  The school has six teachers and two resource teachers.  The number in junior infants increased from 15 in 2010 to 22 in 2011 and is expected to increase further, to 26 in 2012, 30 in 2013 and 2014, and 32 in 2015.  The cost to the Department of the prefabricated accommodation is in the region of &euro;40,000 per annum.</P>
        <P>When the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, was Labour Party spokesman for education, he was blistering in his attacks on the Department for paying out these types of costs.  Scoil Ghorm&aacute;in Naofa is seeking devolved funding for an extension of four classrooms and the refurbishment of the original 1950 two-classroom facility.  I understand the building cost per classroom is now &euro;70,000.  This is a reasonable request.  Members of the community have told me that once this funding is received, they will do whatever is required to ensure a new, modern facility is constructed.  They will not return to the Department requesting additional funding.  All they are seeking is four times the classroom grant plus the refurbishment cost for the original building.  This represents value for money, which is an absolute requirement for any such projects in the current circumstances.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  I thank the Senator for raising it as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and to clarify the current position on the application for major capital funding from Scoil Ghorm&aacute;in Naofa, Castletown, Gorey, County Wexford.</P>
        <P>The school has a core staffing level of a principal and four mainstream teachers, together with two support staff.  This staffing level is based on the school&rsquo;s 2010 enrolment of 126 pupils.  The school authority submitted an application for major capital funding for an extension and refurbishment works to the Department.  As part of the assessment process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  A building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band 1 is the highest and band 4 the lowest.  The project for Scoil Ghorm&aacute;in Naofa was assigned a band two rating.</P><Col N="960"/>
        <P>The Department of Education and Skills is forecasting an increase of more than 43,000 primary pupils and 24,900 post-primary pupils by the start of the 2017-18 school year.  In order to meet the needs of our growing population of school-going children, the Department must establish 40 new schools, as well as extending a number of existing schools in areas where demographic growth has been identified.  The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department&rsquo;s budget for the coming years.</P>
        <P>While enrolments at Scoil Ghorm&aacute;in Naofa have increased by 21% in the past five years, it is not envisaged that the school will be extended to meet the demographic growth to which I referred.  However, the Department accepts that the school has temporary accommodation which, while it is relatively new, will in time need to be replaced should enrolment remain at current levels.  The school has benefited from various grants amounting to in excess of &euro;90,000 in recent years to carry out various improvement works.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently.  All school building projects, including a project for Scoil Ghorm&aacute;in Naofa, will be advanced incrementally over time within the context of the funding available.  However, in light of current competing demands under the Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.  I thank the Senator again for the opportunity to reply to the matter.</P>

	<P Just="Left">That was an appalling answer.  I know the Minister of State did not write it but if I was her, I would have been embarrassed giving me that answer, and I do not say that lightly.  If she was in the position I am in, she would not accept that answer.  The bulk of the page and a half of the reply is about something else.  There is one small fact contained in it, indicating an increase of 21% in the past five years.  It is not acceptable to come to the House with an answer like this.  That is what the other guys did and that is why they were put out of office.  Is this how matters on the Adjournment are to be answered by the Department?  I am not blaming the Minister of State as she is delivering the message and I am not going to shoot the messenger on this occasion, but I ask her to go back to whoever gave her that reply and tell that person that it is not acceptable to me.  It is a disgrace to throw that reply up in front of somebody at this stage of a debate. The reason the other guys were put out of office was because they treated this Chamber with disdain by giving replies such as the one I got. It is not acceptable. I ask that this Adjournment matter be taken next week again and that I get a proper answer to it. </P>
