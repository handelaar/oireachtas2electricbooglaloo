      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have notice from Senator Jimmy Harte that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to make a statement on the problem where developers in receivership are not paying ESB bills for sewage pumps in housing estates, in particular, in the Letterkenny area of Glencar and Glenoughty where the ESB has given notice that power will be switched off on 20 November.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have notice from Senator Thomas Byrne of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss the recent flooding in Drumconrath, County Meath and the Office of Public Works&rsquo; proposed remedial actions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have notice from Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality and Defence to confirm that Malahide Garda station will remain as a 24 hour a day full-time station serving the areas of Malahide, Kinsealy and Portmarnock and that the opening hours of this station will not be restricted, or that the station will not be merged with the station in Swords.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have notice from Senator Martin Conway of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to direct Irish Rail to install a lift at Ennis railway station to enable people with mobility impairments to access platforms on both sides.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Harte, Byrne and O&rsquo;Brien as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Conway as it is an operational matter for Irish Rail.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to commence at the conclusion of the Order of Business and adjourn at 1.45 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes; and No. <Col N="408"/>15, motion No. 6, Private Members&rsquo; business, to commence at 4 p.m. and conclude not later than 6 p.m.  The debate on housing will take place on another day when matters are clarified.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the Leader had to make some changes to the Order Paper today.  When we talked last week about the Water Services (Amendment) Bill he said he would give us as much time as was required on Second Stage.  I propose that while the statements and question and answer session on housing is deferred for obvious reasons, to which I will refer in a moment, that he should allow for an extension to the debate on the Water Services (Amendment) Bill.  I am sure several speakers are offering on the Government side, as on the Opposition side.  That would be a proper use of Seanad time.  I ask the Leader to accede to this request.  </P>
        <P>In light of the resignation yesterday of the former Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste can count themselves lucky in one regard, that the rest of the Cabinet are not as principled as Deputy Penrose.  Otherwise, there would be no one left at the Cabinet table.</P>
        <P>This brings me to today&rsquo;s business.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Education and Skills come to the House to explain Government plans for the abolition of all financial supports to new post-graduate students from next year, and the scrapping of existing grants and maintenance support for post-graduate students.  I remind the Government, and particularly Labour Party members of the Government, that their party gave a pledge to &ldquo;reverse the &euro;500 increase in the student services charge and the &euro;200 charge for post-leaving certificate courses that were recently introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il&rdquo;.  I wonder if Labour Party colleagues remember the picture published on 21 February 2011, four days before the general election, of Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn outside Senator Bacik&rsquo;s <i>alma mater</i>, Trinity College.  He was photographed signing a pledge on behalf of the Labour Party that not only would there be no increase in third level student fees but that the Labour Party would reverse last year&rsquo;s &euro;500 increase and would not introduce third level fees.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Education and Skills said &ldquo;We are not in that space anymore&rdquo;.  What space is that?  Is it the space of four days to go to a general election when one continues to throw promise after promise but once in Government proceeds to break those promises?  When Deputy Quinn signed that pledge, did he know he was lying to people?  I am sure he did.  He has continued to lie to people.  He is lying to the 20,000 students from all across Ireland who will be outside Government Buildings today protesting at the most blatant breach of trust between a Government and the young people we are supposed to support.  Did Senator Bacik and her Labour Party colleagues also sign this pledge?  We all signed it.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party also signed an undertaking to introduce a climate change Bill.  That has gone.  Most importantly, the Labour Party signed a pledge to the young people of Ireland to reverse the &euro;500 increase and not to introduce third level fees.  The party is now taking the legs from under those pledges and is planning to scrap existing maintenance grants.</P>
        <P>I want the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House today to answer to the elected Members of the Oireachtas as to why he feels it is appropriate to lie to the people and to continue to do so.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am afraid a pattern is emerging.  I do Senator O&rsquo;Brien the courtesy of listening to his outrageous attacks on different individuals.  I listened to him making an outrageous assertion that the Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, lied.  He has not lied.  I ask the Senator to withdraw that very serious and untrue allegation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Nobody has lied.  Yes, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, signed the pledge and I signed it.  I think most Members of this House signed it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien can give it out but he cannot take it.  He cannot sit and listen when I do him the courtesy of responding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I too seek a debate on third level education, as I have previously done.  No decision has been taken by the Cabinet.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Labour Party is committed not to reintroduce fees.  The Labour Party is the party that abolished fees when in government and we are proud of that record.  Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s Government under-funded third level education to the point where Trinity College and other top level universities in Ireland have fallen down the international rankings because of under-funding, to the point where university presidents are looking for sufficient resourcing to be able to offer the quality education we want to continue to offer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We need a debate on third level education, particularly when no decision has yet been taken by the Cabinet, to assist us in coming to a decision as to how we can adequately resource third level education.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us have the debate today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I know that students will be protesting today outside the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Many of us started out careers in student politics&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and feel very strongly about the principle of free education and of no third level fees.</P>
        <P>I have also sought debates on climate change.  That pledge has not gone, as Senator O&rsquo;Brien knows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>It is gone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is still a commitment, as there is in the programme for Government, to introduce climate change legislation.  Let us not forget that the Fianna F&aacute;il Government dragged its feet and prevaricated for years in the face of pressure from the Green Party in government and never brought in the climate change Bill it had promised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On behalf of all of us, I congratulate the Irish team on the wonderful result in last night&rsquo;s match against Estonia and look forward to our participation, at last, in the championship next summer in Poland and Ukraine.  That will be very exciting and a real morale boost for the country.</P>
        <P>I thank my colleagues, Senators van Turnhout and Conway who, yesterday, raised the issue of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and asked what will be done to phase out the use of detention for 16 and 17 year old people in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  There is a commitment to do that in the programme for Government.  We heard wonderful presentations last night from Professor Harry Kennedy and Ms Emily Logan, the Ombudsman for Children.  I would like a debate in this House on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and a clarification of how it will be phased out for children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the congratulations to the Irish team, which has given us all a boost.  Perhaps we would like to skip over the budget and get straight to the European matches.  Unfortunately, we cannot.</P>
        <P>I have concerns at the kite flying that is happening.  Vulnerable hard-pressed families are reading headlines every day and wondering what will happen.  We should all be careful with our comments.</P>
        <P>I echo what Senator Bacik said about St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and seeking a debate in the House.  It is of extreme concern and a gross violation of our human rights record.  For the sake of the children in vulnerable situations we need to act as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Today, I raise the issue of transition year students.  Most of us are aware of the transition year programme which promotes the personal, social, vocational and educational development of students and prepares them for their role as autonomous, participative and responsible members of society.</P>
        <P>Recently, I received an application from a transition year student to work for one week in Leinster House as part of the work experience programme.  I was informed that this is not possible.  What better way to achieve these goals than by allowing young people to experience a working environment through one of the work experience programmes offered by most schools that conduct the transition year programme?  The Houses of the Oireachtas lacks any dedicated structure to facilitate students who wish to experience the working life of the Parliament.  Work experience is available for second level students with members of parliament in the European Parliament and the British Houses of Parliament.  Why can we not do it here? Even closer to home, Dublin City Council offers second level work experience.</P>
        <P>This experience is extremely valuable, would give students an insight into our work and would help them understand what we are doing here.  I call on the Leader and the House to examine ways in which the Seanad could put in place a one week programme once a year to provide transition year students with an opportunity to listen to some of our key debates and a chance to partially shadow a Senator.  The programme could be open to a lottery and provide to a limited number of transition year students an opportunity to see what we do.  I ask that this be given serious consideration and I would be happy to give any support and assistance I can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Mindful of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s meeting with Chancellor Merkel today, I seek a full debate on the euro and its role in our current economic difficulties.  It is necessary to have this discussion because the drift in Europe is towards the transfer of yet more powers from the nation states to the centre.  Many of the problems of the euro were caused by people at the centre, by not having any exit mechanism, the loss of the exchange rate as an instrument of economic policy and the lack of a mechanism to deal with vast capital flows, such as those <Col N="412"/>which flowed into the Irish banking system and destroyed the property market.  We did not have a proper debate when we joined the first time around and many of the faults we have now encountered have their origins in Brussels.  We need a debate and analysis of that.  In particular, we should resist any idea that the European Union should be organised by technocrats rather than by elected politicians.  There are sinister elements in that a failed currency is now seeking to extract even more powers from nation states and elected parliaments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Social Protection to the House to discuss the recent proposal to transfer sick payment benefit for the first four weeks of an illness from the State to the employer?  This suggestion must be thought out more fully and redressed.  Who, for example, will pay the sick payment benefit to the 9,000 staff out on sick leave in the HSE, which has the highest rate of absenteeism in the public service?  I understand the figure involved would be an astronomical cost for the HSE.  In the case of teachers out on sick leave, would the burden of paying their benefit be laid on boards of management?  I would appreciate it if we could have the Minister in the House to discuss and thrash out this proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the call made by Senator Barrett for a debate on the euro.  It would be opportune to have rolling debates on that issue given the current difficulties.  I also agree with the comments made today and yesterday by members of Fine Gael and with their concerns about possible anti-job measures with regard to passing on social welfare costs for sick pay to employers.  As mentioned, absenteeism and the willy nilly issuing of medical certificates by GPs is a much bigger issue and should be tackled at that level.</P>
        <P>The Government talks about job creation, which is important, but often its actions do not measure up to what is being said.  I suggest the Leader should arrange a debate in the House with the Minister for Finance to discuss the issue of people and businesses who have come to an arrangement with their main lending institutions who then find it difficult to get the co-operation of State agencies, particularly the Revenue Commissioners.  It is imperative that in the current economic situation we prioritise jobs, but while the collection of revenue should remain a priority, it should not be an impediment to the retention of jobs.</P>
        <P>The issue relating to the Minister for Education and Skills has been well covered by my colleague, Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.  If ever we had an election where there was no need to make promises, it was the most recent general election.  There have been many broken promises and, unfortunately, these fuel cynicism among the public, particularly in the case of young students, about politics and politicians in general.  This is bad.  Where commitments have been made and people are now changing tack, they should apologise and admit they were wrong.</P>
        <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business.  Yesterday, I raised the issue of the closure of the three embassies, in particular the Holy See embassy.  The response from the Leader did not give me any great hope there would be an immediate debate.  I propose that we have a debate today with the T&aacute;naiste regarding the real reasons for the closure of these embassies in order to persuade him to rescind that particular regrettable decision.  I also support the amendment put forward by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance if he has any plans to cull the practice of retired public and civil servants, who have taken substantial lump sums from the State and who are in receipt of State pensions, returning to State employment in one form or another, namely, nurses, garda&iacute;, teachers, etc?  This practice is wrong.  Many people are looking for work yet people have pensions coming in one door and wages coming in the other.  The Minister for Finance should address the problem and put a stop to this practice.</P><Col N="413"/>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday, Senator O&rsquo;Brien got very agitated about the Taoiseach&rsquo;s tax claim on his property in Dublin.  Unfortunately, there is a cost in doing business when one has to spend six or seven days a week or 350-odd days of the year here.  I do not have a difficulty with the tax practice in that regard.  It has applied here for over 50 years, before it applied to the Taoiseach.  However, I did not hear Senator O&rsquo;Brien get as agitated when the pensions of retired Ministers and Taoisigh were printed in the newspaper the previous week. Some former Deputies left the other House with &euro;250,000 and &euro;200,000 in lump sums and with pensions of &euro;150,000.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance if he has any plans in this regard in the coming budget.  We seem to pre-debate the budget here every week, but none of us know what is in it, apart from the Minister and the Cabinet.  Will the Leader ask if the Minister has any plans to claw back some of those moneys, which were effectively stolen from the taxpayer?  I have a serious concern with regard to the amount of money taken from here and I assume Senator O'Brien would agree with me.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have long argued that if we are going to create jobs, they will not be created by Government.  Governments do not create long-lasting jobs.  What must happen is that we must encourage industry and business to create jobs.  One way to do this is by helping those in transition year, as mentioned by Senator van Turnhout.  I have always had students on work experience in my office here and I am amazed now to learn that for some reason or other we have been told to discontinue this practice.  This issue needs immediate attention.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Yesterday, Senator Healy Eames spoke very strongly, as did Senator Sheahan today, about the difficulty of transferring costs to industry.  Senator Healy Eames was quite explicit with regard to the tough job of running a business.  If sick pay must be paid for four weeks by a company, this will damage the opportunity to create jobs.  Today&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i>  states that Sarkozy is to tackle labour costs.  He says the high costs of labour in France penalise the economy and penalise France in terms of international competitiveness.  That is exactly what will happen here if we transfer more costs onto industry and business.  If we are to succeed, we must ensure this sort of thing does not happen.  Some 20 years ago, I was chairman of a hospital and we used to get letters every week from a State agency seeking to place more people asking whether we had taken on any more nurses, porters or help.  That was the wrong way to operate.  The creation of jobs just for the sake of the jobs will not help us get out of our difficulty.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Barrett&rsquo;s call for a debate on the euro.  We must keep a careful eye on this issue and debate the economy weekly so that we ensure we can create employment in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on the role of younger people in society.  A number of measures were introduced in the last budget and by the previous Government that when looked at collectively give a clear and somewhat insidious message to our younger people.  I think in particular of three specific measures.</P>
        <P>In the previous budget, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for young people between the ages of 18 to 21 was cut to &euro;100, and to &euro;144 for those between 22 and 24, not on the basis of need but purely on the basis of age.</P>
        <P>In the dying days of the previous Government, the then Minister responsible for housing reduced the eligibility of young single people to rent supplement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>This sent a message stating it did not believe in their right to house themselves independently of their families.</P>
        <P>The third measure taken by the previous Government was to raise increasingly the cost of third level education.  This was another message to the young stating they were not necessarily wanted in the country.  The House needs a proper debate on the role of young people in society, taking all these factors into account and questioning seriously the message being given to the young.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting that, any time the Government representatives are confronted with facts, they are just unable to accept them.  Before the election, they lied consistently on a number of issues.  I can give a number of examples.  They lied in respect of bondholders and stated aggressive burden sharing would be imposed.  The Government, and Fine Gael in its manifesto, made it very clear unilateral action would be taken.  The Government representatives lied in regard to money that would be put into Anglo Irish Bank by stating not one more cent would be put in.  They lied in regard to education.  An example is the pledge, signed by members of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, not to increase third level fees, yet this is to be done.  They lied in regard to health cuts.  We saw the reversal involving the closure of the accident and emergency department in Roscommon and noted many other promises that were not honoured.  As the Leader will know, a promise was made by the Government parties to build a new 50 bed community nursing unit in Waterford.  The capital funding will now not be made available.  The Government has lied consistently.  Its members lied before the election and are still lying to the people of this State.</P>

All parties are making pre-budget submissions.  We can offer alternatives to the Government and we have done in our pre-budget submission.  We point out where money can be raised and saved such <Col N="415"/>that we will not have to raise third level fees for students.  I agree with the previous Senator that increasing fees represents a passport out of Ireland for young people.  I commend the students who will be campaigning for their rights today.  Many families are being forced to choose which child they will send for third and fourth level education.</P>

	<P>I propose that the Minister for Finance be invited to the House, before rather than after the budget, to have a full and proper discussion with all Senators on all the pre-budgetary alternatives and the proposals they seek to make.  Coming in after the budget is not good enough; we need a debate before it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Cullinane proposed that the Order of Business be amended.  He requested yesterday that we debate the budget.  Obviously, I am not seconding his formal proposal but I believe that, with the budget being announced on Tuesday fortnight and every item discussed here yesterday, today and, I presume, over the next few days proving to be related to budgetary policy, it would be helpful if we could outline our views on what the Government should be doing in the budget.  This will require us to outline how the magical figure of &euro;3.8 billion will be achieved.  There are no easy answers, as we all know, but it would be helpful if we had the opportunity to stop the political sideshow, sniping and games of tennis and actually put our proposals on the table.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am awaiting the Leader&rsquo;s response to my suggestion.  We do not expect a budget debate today.  I ask that some time be set aside next week, in advance of the budget, so we can make suggestions to the Government and outline the policies we would like to see therein.  I ask the Leader to take the suggestion on board.</P>
        <P>Amendments to the Order of Business are tabled on the hour but they are entirely unrealistic.  We know Ministers are not going to come to this House at the drop of a hat.  Can we not try to be a little more constructive in the way we do business?  Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s suggestion that we have a debate on the budget is good but this will not happen this afternoon.  Let us be realistic.  Perhaps we could agree that it will happen next week.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appropriate to state that Deputy Penrose, when in this House, acquitted himself very well and was very attentive.  I chaired the session when he was present.  He was doing tremendous work on ghost estates and his resignation from his Ministry is a loss to the country.  He was a very amiable and approachable Minister of State.  I wish well Deputy Penrose and the others in Westmeath, such as Mr. Mick Dollard, who will now be Independents.  They will be available for canvassing in the next election campaign.</P>
        <P>I second Senator Walsh&rsquo;s call on the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, to come to the House to discuss the proposed closure of our embassy in the Holy See.  I have received a submission from Mr. David Quinn and others of the Iona Institute <Col N="416"/>outlining the reasons for having an embassy to the Holy See.  I note the very constructive manner in which the proposal is made.  It states one hundred and seventy-nine countries are linked to the Holy See and 76 &mdash; it was 77 &mdash; will have embassies there, including Haiti, a very impoverished country.  Countries such as Macedonia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania and Georgia have full embassies to the Holy See.  The Iona Institute made the point that we have embassies in Lesotho, Mozambique and Malawi.  They are all worthy locations so there are alternatives, therefore, to closing the embassy to the Holy See.  I call on very powerful organisations, such as the Order of the Knights of St. Columbanus, which may have many members in this House or, at least, the other.  I see a Senator smiling; I am not sure whether he is a member of the organisation.  I was under the impression that Senator Paul Coghlan was a member of the Order of the Knights of St. Columbanus, but I now understand he is not.  I do not have the membership list.  I have examined the organisation&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We are very conscious of the very important meeting taking place today in Berlin between the Taoiseach, the German premier and her Minister for Finance.  We wish them well because we hope the Taoiseach can get across to them the need for greater flexibility in the implementation of our reform programme.  It is important that they be sensitised to the need to maintain public support for the reforms necessary.  Perhaps most important, <Col N="417"/>I wish them well in dealing with proposals regarding oversight of national budgets.  This is at the heart of the matter as regards securing the future of the euro.</P>
        <P>I spoke on the question of the embassy yesterday.  I say seriously to everybody, in the knowledge that there is concern on both sides, that a very senior, superb diplomat &mdash; the most senior man in the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr. David Cooney &mdash; has been appointed and should be allowed to exercise his diplomatic functions.  He will be in the Holy See once a month and is the ambassador.  He will, perhaps, spend weekends there.  This can be resolved and restored rather quickly but he must take it up with the secretary of state.  Senators should be patient.  We are a small country in economic difficulties and this is being forced on us.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret that we will not be taking statements on housing today but I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Deputy Penrose, an honourable and decent man who came into this House on a number of occasions.  He was unique among Ministers in this and previous Administrations in that he listened to what was being said and acted to the best of his abilities.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Defence, Deputy Shatter, to the House to outline the criteria used to decide on the closure of the barracks in Clonmel, Castlebar, Mullingar and Cavan.  While I appreciate that the closure of Castlebar barracks may be a smokescreen given that it houses fewer than half a dozen soldiers, most of whom are due to retire, and is little more than a storage facility, the other three barracks were strategic to the defence of this country.  We are given to understand that the decision was based on economic and strategic considerations.  The most modern barracks in Europe is located seven miles from the Border at County Fermanagh, an area which is alive with dissident republican activity.  We are to believe that it is not as strategically important as the seven barracks located in the Curragh where the military top brass play soldiers at their ease.  They do not want to be discomfited by moving to places like Cavan, which is not strategic to them.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I want to know why that is the case.  The Minister was misled by the top brass in the Defence Forces.  Even while he was telling delegations from Cavan, which I accompanied, and the other three towns that he had not reached a decision, instructions were issuing from Defence Forces headquarters for the Reserve Defence Force units based in Cavan to find alternative accommodation.  Is he not the Minister?  Did he make the decision or is he being led by the cushy top brass in the Curragh in deciding the future of 700 men and women who have served the State at home and abroad?</P>

	<P>I am coming to my question.  I ask the Leader to arrange a discussion on the topic of honour in politics.  The Seanad could make an important contribution to the political discourse of this country.</P>
        <P>On a point of order, is it appropriate for Members of this House to use the word &ldquo;lie&rdquo; at regular intervals?  I understand it is considered unparliamentary under Standing Orders to use that type of language.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order.  It was made under a political charge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be happy to second Senator Walsh&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.  I do not need to elaborate on the issue because my views on it are well known.</P>
        <P>I also support the Senator&rsquo;s remarks on job creation.  If struggling companies managed to work out an arrangement with lenders that allows them to survive in these difficult economic times, it would be strange if the Revenue Commissioners played by the book rather than help to preserve jobs with a view to guaranteeing the payment of what they are owed in the future.  It is important that State agencies do not act in a penny wise, pound foolish manner.  I would welcome an opportunity to discuss this issue with the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>On the subject of short-sighted thinking, I hovered between respect for Deputy Penrose&rsquo;s decision to resign his ministerial post and fear that if everybody did likewise we would be stuck with parish pump thinking and insufficient reflection on the national interest.  As somebody who contributed to the debate about the closure of Army barracks, I side with Deputy Penrose because I question the level of savings made possible by the decision.  Given that personnel are not going to lose their jobs and that the property market remains depressed, I wonder whether substantial savings can be made.  During the debate I spoke about the importance of social capital and the contribution these barracks make to the towns in which they are located.  Members of the Defence Forces have been involved in a wide range of voluntary activities.  We should balance the range of issues in our minds because if we take a slash and burn <Col N="419"/>approach we may not save money in the longer term.  I ask the Leader to take that message to the Government.</P>

I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by my colleague, Senator Cullinane.  I also seek clarification from the Leader regarding our letter to each Member of the House about speaking time for members of Sinn F&eacute;in.  A certain amount of information has been conveyed to us about changes to that.  There will not be statements on housing today, but there will be tomorrow.  However, there is no clarification yet on where we stand with regard to statements and how much time will be afforded to Sinn F&eacute;in Members of the House.  We would appreciate if the Leader would clarify that as we obviously need time to prepare.  Being given only a minute is quite different from having a number of minutes.  We would appreciate clarification as to where every Member of the House stands on allowing Sinn F&eacute;in Members the right to speak in these debates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also support Senator Hayden&rsquo;s call for a debate on the role of young people and how they are treated in this country.  If the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, is coming to the House to discuss those issues, I am anxious to ask why single parents are being discriminated against in the JobBridge programme. Single parents are not allowed to apply for the JobBridge programme.  Many of them are young people.  Against all adversity they are trying to get back into the workforce and make a career for themselves but, according to correspondence I have received from the Department, they are excluded from that programme.  We should discuss that and also whether the JobBridge programme is working and doing what it is intended to do.</P><Col N="420"/>
        <P>I also ask that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, be invited to the House to discuss the new licensing regime for the oil and gas industry.  A total of 13 licences were given to exploration companies for the Corrib gas field.  He should explain to the Seanad what terms and conditions were attached to those licences.  Are they different from the terms and conditions in the licences that were handed out by the previous Government, which handed over our scarce natural resources for little payback to the Irish State?  If that has happened again, the Minister can explain why that is so, which models from which countries he has examined in his deliberations, the regimes with which he has compared our regime and why we do not have more favourable regimes like those in countries such as Norway and Canada.  T&aacute;im ag iarraidh go dtiocfaidh an tAire, an Teachta Rabbitte, isteach chun m&iacute;ni&uacute; ioml&aacute;n a thabhairt d&uacute;inn ar ch&eacute;ard at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute; maidir leis na cead&uacute;nais, &oacute; thaobh g&aacute;is agus ola, sa t&iacute;r seo.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I support the calls for a debate on the role of young people in Irish society and how they are treated.  The only options available to young people at present, while the unemployment rate is so high, are education or emigration.  We must tread carefully with regard to education.  There is a tipping point beyond which things could get really bad for young people.  Yes, invite the Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, to the House as quickly as possible in order that we can discuss rumours of huge numbers of redundancies among teachers, caps on student numbers and grants for students.  Education is a right that we must guard; it has served us well.</P>
        <P>I wish to follow up on Senator Feargal Quinn&rsquo;s comments.  Jobs are not created by governments but by employers and entrepreneurs.  That is the reason I was so careful in my remarks yesterday.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, must reconsider her proposal to charge employers for sick pay for their employees.  That would mean the employers would have to pay twice when staff are out of work.  First, they would lose the person&rsquo;s performance and possibly have to replace the person and, second, if they had to pay sick pay, it would be unbearable.</P>

	<P>It is time we stood up together and said who should bear responsibility for sick pay.  Currently, the private sector employee is out sick for an average of six days per year whereas the average public sector worker is out sick for 11 days per year.  We must grasp this nettle and say what is fair given the finances in the State.</P>

The Minister appears to be implying that there will be 2,500 fewer teachers in the system over the next few years while, in fact, the EU-IMF programme provides for an additional 2,500 teachers in the next four years.  There is a stark contrast with the EU-IMF programme.  The word &ldquo;lie&rdquo; was used in the Chamber today, justifiably so.</P>

It is important that we are constructive and if there are ideas we can adopt from that part of the island, we are open to accepting them.</P>
        <P>It is also important that we try to encourage young people.  I was at a meeting in Cork last night where I met a young person who cannot qualify for any of the support mechanisms in place at present because he is living at home and his parents are supporting him.  Many young people are losing out because they do not tick all the boxes for the support schemes in place to get them back into employment.  We need a debate in this House on these issues, as well as on other issues relating to young people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senator Sheahan&rsquo;s call for a debate on the suggestion that the first four weeks of sick pay should be met by employers, rather than by the Department of Social Protection, which is the <i>status quo</i>.  It is an outrageous suggestion.  Last week, I spoke in the Chamber about the problems facing small businesses which are trying to retain their staff and this idea appears to be a double whammy.  Surely the idea behind employers paying employer&rsquo;s PRSI is to ensure that when an employee becomes ill, those payments will be used to cover his or her illness.  It is enough for an employer to be obliged to source an alternative or to change rosters, one often loses money both ways, without allowing this outrageous proposal to come down the line.</P>
        <P>As for the student protests, I remember distinctly the student protests that took place almost this time last year.  It was highly confrontational and I had to smile when I heard Senator Healy Eames talk about not being confrontational, because she was beating a big drum that day.  I remember that well, as do my colleagues on the other side of the Chamber.  In fairness to the outgoing Government, it was heavily defeated in the general election but Fianna F&aacute;il went into that election without giving any hostages to fortune or making any false promises.  I note two members of the Government parties already have gone overboard, namely, Deputy Naughten and now the former Minister of State, Deputy Penrose.  It bodes ill for the long-term future of the Government if its members already are panicking in the face of what must come down the line.  While my party took a beating, it took it on the chin.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The issue I wish to raise today is important for rural communities nationwide.  As Members are aware, the rural development programme is run by Leader partnership groups and development companies, which support communities that wish to invest in sports fields, community centres and so on.  What I consider to be a new rule has been introduced to the effect that permission must be granted by the European Union for grant aid in excess of &euro;200,000.  This is affecting many communities and I have received a considerable number of representations on this issue in recent weeks.  Many communities have conducted fundraisers, have raised a lot of money and are ready to start work but now are affected by the new rule that permission from the European Union is required for those projects which exceed &euro;200,000.  This issue should be dealt with as a matter of urgency and perhaps there should be a debate on it.</P>
        <P>In addition, food projects or anything pertaining to the processing or manufacture of food is excluded from the programme and this issue must also be considered.  If one is serious about creating jobs in rural Ireland, the processing of food must be included and if grant aid is available, it should be made available in this regard.  I seek a debate on this programme, which is run by the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>

	<P>I share the sentiments expressed on this side of the House in particular in respect of the former Minister of State, Deputy Penrose.  As already has been stated, he came to this House a number of times.  I remember specifically a debate on electoral legislation in which he was so expansive and impressive that Members wondered whether he was a Minister at all because he took his own line.  I have known Deputy Willie Penrose for 25 years or so and long before he entered the Oireachtas.  He is a man of great honour and irrespective of what has been said, I would hate to think the Labour Party is now circling the wagons and intends to do down this man because of the decision he took.  This is based on some of the remarks I have heard so far.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.  My question relates to Senator Paul Coghlan&rsquo;s comments, the sentiments of which I share, on the meeting of the Taoiseach with Ms Angela Merkel in Germany and to the references made by Senator Quinn and others to the euro crisis.  I believe it is vitally important to keep this issue on the agenda and in that context, I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, my commendation of a series of articles in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Germany.  Yesterday&rsquo;s excellent article referred to the impact Irish cultural activity has had and continues to have in Germany.  The article paid a warm tribute to the consular officials in the Irish Embassy in Berlin, who had turned around an attitude in Germany of not wishing to bail out a country it was considered had gone on a party.  The aforementioned officials had turned around this sentiment and there now was a real understanding and recognition that Ireland was not Greece, Italy, Spain or Portugal.  Moreover, this was achieved through the cultural activities that continued to take place in Germany.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to convey to Mr. Eugene Downes, who is chief executive of Culture Ireland and who has headed Imagine Ireland, a concept that has been expanding Irish culture into America in recent years, the possibility of expanding its activities into Germany.  The name of Ireland in Germany unquestionably is very positive at present and it will be important to take advantage of that sentiment in light of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s meeting with Ms Merkel.  After all, it is Germany that will make the ultimate decisions on our future, whether we like it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to organise an early debate on the drugs problem in Ireland.  I note reports in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers that Ireland is in the top half of the league in respect of the use and abuse of certain types of drugs.  Violent murders take place day after day, as do many drug-related suicides and the decimation and destruction of families and young people.  Moreover, anti-social behaviour takes place in estates nationwide and huge pressure is being placed on the health services as a result of the drugs problem.  There has been an increase in the sale of, and activity in, drugs because of the economic crisis in which we now find ourselves.  People who are short of income are turning to the sale of drugs as a means of raising income and Members have a major crisis on their hands.</P>
        <P>This House would be an appropriate venue for a major debate on how this scourge will be tackled, how communities will be helped to come to terms with the associated difficulties and how young people, whose lives are being destroyed by the use of drugs, are to be helped.  This is a major issue and I sincerely ask the Leader to organise such a debate.  I acknowledge that Members will have a debate this afternoon on the issue of alcohol, which is linked in some ways, but the drugs issue warrants a separate debate and I ask the Leader to organise it at an early opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the years, decisions have been made by the State, generally with the best of intentions, which it subsequently has been necessary to revisit.  One reason this happens is because inadequate debate has taken place, perhaps involving misinformation or a lack of information and so on.  The same applies to the closure of the Army barracks because when this debate was initiated, Members were given to understand it had something to do with the financial position of the State.  Thereafter, the grounds tended to move and it was suggested it was a directive from Europe.  The present position, post the decision having been made, appears to be that it was operational.  I suggest it cannot be a financial consideration because everyone now accepts the closure of these barracks will result in a loss.  If this is the case, there is no reason for Europe to have given a directive, which means it is now down to being an operational issue.  In that context, I would have thought there was more involved here than just a simple operational matter.  Serious consideration should have been given to those people <Col N="425"/>who are being unnecessarily affected.  There is no reason this development should absolutely happen.</P>
        <P>Second, we will have a situation where, as happened in Kildare, five buildings will be vandalised and we will have huge losses.  In addition, if as part of this decision we are going to factor in the possibility of selling these sites, I believe it is being factored in at their value some six years ago whereas those sites do not have such a value now.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the next couple of days, will the Leader bring in the Minister for Defence and let us once and for all remove the confusion among the public.  This issue is not going to go away.  I ask the Leader as a matter of urgency to bring in the Minister for Defence.</P>

The reason we are adjourning the debate at 1.45 p.m. today, although it can be resumed on any other day we decide, is that the Minister has another engagement.  I am making inquiries to see whether the Minister can stay longer today.  If possible, he will, but I do not believe at present that is possible.

        <P Just="Left">With regard to the question of education, third level funding, the cap on numbers, student fees and so on, as the House knows, the programme for Government provided a commitment to undertake a full review of third level education funding with a view to introducing a funding system that would provide third level institutions with reliable funding but which would not impact on access for students.  The Higher Education Authority has recently finished a report on the sustainability of the existing funding framework for higher education and it was submitted to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, on Monday, 14 November.  The report examines the interrelationships between funding levels, the scale of growth and the maintenance of quality in the system. As the Minister has just received the report, I am not in a position to comment on its contents but the Minister and his officials will be considering these in the coming weeks.  The report will help to inform consideration by the Government of policy options in regard to the future funding of the higher education sector.  I understand the HEA intends to publish the report in the next couple of weeks, following its consideration by the authority.  Perhaps that might be an opportune time for us to discuss the report.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator Wilson asked about the criteria used to close barracks and, with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, asked that the Minister for Defence come to the House.  The purpose of the decision to close barracks is to maximise the effectiveness of the Defence Forces by removing the burden imposed by manning and maintaining unnecessary installations.  The consolidation of the Defence Forces' formations in a smaller number of locations is a key objective of the ongoing defence modernisation programme in order to maximise the effectiveness of the Defence Forces and has been recommended in many reports in recent years.</P>

        <P Just="Left">In recent weeks, the Minister has met individual Members of the Oireachtas, who expressed very strongly held views as to why particular barracks should be retained.  He also met a number of delegations made up of a wide spectrum of interest groups from Cavan, Clonmel and Mullingar.  The Minister has reflected carefully and at length on the sincere and genuine concerns raised by those delegations, particularly the wives of serving personnel.  He wishes to acknowledge the sincerity and courtesy of the people he met.  However, he is obliged to take a broader view and must consider the overall needs and organisation of the Defence Forces, not just today but in the years ahead.  It is in this context that the consolidation of the Defence Forces in a smaller number of locations must be and has been addressed.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two main reasons for the introduction of this legislation, the first of which relates to non-compliance with EU legislation.</P>
        <P>On 29 October 2009, the European Court of Justice ruled against Ireland on the treatment of waste waters from septic tanks and other on-site waste water treatment systems.  The court found that by failing to adopt the necessary legislation to comply with Articles 4 and 8 of the Waste Directive on domestic waste waters disposed of in the countryside through septic tanks and other individual waste water treatment systems, Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under that directive.</P>
        <P>The European Court of Justice has found that Irish legislation does not adequately provide for domestic waste water from septic tanks to be recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and without using processes which could harm the environment and that Irish legislation also fails to provide for the prohibition of the uncontrolled disposal of such waste waters which is a requirement of the waste directive.</P>
        <P>The court also found that Irish legislation does not adequately provide that the holder of such waste water either has it handled by a public or private waste collector or recovers or disposes of it himself or herself in accordance with the provisions of the directive.</P>
        <P>The second reason is a more fundamental reason and is one with which no right-thinking person could disagree.  The key objective of the new legislation is to enhance and protect public health and the environment which will, in turn, benefit rural dwellers in terms of a better quality of life and better quality water.</P>
        <P>In its water quality 2007-2009 report, the EPA noted the presence of microbial contamination arising from the entry of faecal matter to Ireland&rsquo;s waters and stated that one of the main sources of microbial pathogens was on-site waste water treatment systems, including septic tanks.  The EPA&rsquo;s report states that the high proportion of monitoring points with faecal coliform detections not only reflects the impact of human activities but also the vulnerable nature of groundwater in some parts of the country.</P><Col N="430"/>
        <P Just="Left">Groundwater is a source of drinking water for many.  Approximately 26% of the public and private drinking water supply is provided from groundwater sources and the EPA has identified effluent from on-site waste water treatment systems as one of the main sources of contamination of groundwater in Ireland.  Census 2006 reported more than 450,000 households were served by septic tanks and other forms of on-site wastewater treatment systems.</P>
        <P>Aside from the obvious need to protect human health and the environment, there is another reason it is critical that we have this legislation enacted as soon as possible.  In July 2011 the European Commission applied to the European court to have fines imposed on Ireland for failing to comply with the original ECJ ruling in this case.  If we do not comply with the ECJ ruling, Ireland will be the subject of significant fines by the court.  The level of the fines could be a lump-sum penalty of &euro;2.7 million and daily fines for continued non-compliance of more than &euro;26,000 per day which is equivalent to more than &euro;9.5 million per annum.  The Government has not delayed or prevaricated in addressing this matter.  We have acted promptly in bringing the Bill forward and we are determined to have it enacted as soon as possible and to meet the requirements of the European Court of Justice ruling.</P>
        <P>The Bill has been drafted to minimise the impact on householders.  Responsibility for the prevention of pollution from septic tanks and other on-site waste water treatment systems already rests with the owners of premises served by such systems.  Section 70 of the Water Services Act 2007 places a duty of care on owners to ensure their treatment systems do not cause a risk to human health or the environment or a nuisance through odours.  Section 4 of the Bill provides for the amendment of section 70 of the 2007 Act by the inclusion of a new Part 4A, containing 11 sections, after Part 4 of the 2007 Act.</P>
        <P>The new Part 4A will build on the existing legal obligations in the Water Services Act and ensure Irish legislation on the treatment of waste water from septic tanks and other on-site waste water treatment systems fully complies with the waste directive.  Part 4A will introduce a register of all such treatment systems.  It will establish an inspection system for treatment systems and provide for the necessary protection of human health and the environment.</P>
        <P>I will now outline the purpose and operation of the new sections being inserted into the Act by Part 4A.  Section 70A provides for definition of the terms used in the new Part 4A.  Section 70B provides that each water services authority will be responsible for maintaining a register of treatment systems.  It is intended that this will comprise a single national register with individual parts for each local authority.  Work is under way to develop the database which will support the register.  Section 70B also establishes a requirement for householders to have details of their systems entered on the register.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the section, I will make regulations prescribing the date for householders to have their systems registered and I have in mind a timeframe of 12 months from the date of enactment of the legislation for this requirement.  A facility to allow online registration is being developed and it is also intended to put in place a written registration facility via the local authorities.  Details of when the registration facilities are available will be announced in the national and local media.</P>
        <P>Section 70B also provides that householders will be required to pay a modest registration fee which will not exceed &euro;50.  The exact fee will be prescribed in regulations.  The revenue generated will be used to fund the delivery of a national inspection plan which will be developed by the EPA in consultation with local authorities.  Roll-out of the national inspection plan will be managed by local authorities.  Householders will not be charged for inspections.  Following the initial registration, householders will not be required to re-register their systems for five years and there will be no charge for re-registration.</P><Col N="431"/>
        <P>Section 70C sets out the duties of owners of premises connected to domestic wastewater treatment systems and places the responsibility on the owner of a system to ensure it is maintained and operated in a manner that does not cause a risk to human health or the environment.  Section 70D provides that after the date for registration, to be prescribed under section 70B, when a house served by a domestic wastewater treatment system is sold, the vendor must provide evidence to the purchaser that the system is registered.  The purchaser is required to notify the relevant local authority of the change of ownership.</P>
        <P>Section 70E deals with the appointment of inspectors.  The EPA will be responsible for the appointment of persons to act as inspectors of treatment systems.  The section includes a provision for the making of regulations concerning the appointment of inspectors, criteria to be met by those seeking appointment, the circumstances leading to the revocation of an appointment and procedural matters in relation to appeals.</P>
        <P>Section 70F contains provisions concerning the EPA&rsquo;s responsibility to establish and maintain a register of persons appointed as inspectors for the purposes of Part 4A.  Section 70G sets out the powers granted to inspectors appointed under section 70E.  These powers include the examination of a treatment system, taking samples, taking photographs of any element of the treatment system, examination of the subsoil, and obtaining information and inspecting records pertaining to the maintenance, servicing or operation of the treatment system.  This section also provides that an inspector cannot enter a private dwelling without the permission of the occupier.</P>
        <P>Once notification of an inspection has been provided by a water services authority, it will be an offence for a person to prevent an inspector from entering a premises, to obstruct or impede an inspector when carrying out their duties, or to provide false or misleading information regarding a treatment system to an inspector, the EPA or a water services authority.  The EPA or a water services authority will have the power to have authorised and appropriate persons accompany inspectors in the course of their duties.</P>
        <P>Section 70H provides that inspectors will carry out inspections of treatment systems as requested by the EPA or by a water services authority.  Inspections will be based on the national inspection plan, which is provided for under section 70K.  Under section 70H, inspectors are required to inform the owner of a treatment system and the relevant water services authority of the results of the inspection.</P>
        <P>Where a water services authority receives notification that a treatment system is causing or is likely to cause a risk to human health or the environment, the water services authority must issue an advisory notice to the owner within 21 days.  An advisory notice will state that the water services authority considers that the particular treatment system is, or has potential to be, for stated reasons, a threat to human health or the environment.  The notice will direct the owner to take the necessary remediation measures and will specify a timeframe for completion of these measures.  Failure to comply with the provisions of an advisory notice within the specified timeframe will be an offence.</P>
        <P>This section also provides for an appeals mechanism for persons who do not agree with the provisions of an advisory notice.  On payment of a fee to be prescribed, an appeal of an advisory notice can be requested.  There is a legal requirement to set a maximum limit on fees in primary legislation.  However, I will be providing in regulations for the appeal fee to be set at a substantially lower level than the ceiling provided for in the Bill.  I intend keeping the appeals fee level under review having regard to experience in the operation of the system.  The section provides that where an advisory notice is cancelled following an appeal, the fee for the appeal will be refunded.</P><Col N="432"/>
        <P>On receipt of an application under this section, the water services authority will arrange for the re-inspection to be carried out by an authorised person appointed by the water services authority.  The re-inspection process will confirm the provisions of the advisory notice, revise these provisions or set aside the advisory notice.  If necessary, a revised advisory notice will be issued.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 70H also provides for an appeal to the District Court in certain limited circumstances by a person aggrieved by an advisory notice issued after a reinspection has been carried out.  The section also sets out actions to be taken by a person on whom the advisory notice has been served and by the water services authority once remediation works are carried out.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 70I provides for the EPA&rsquo;s supervision of water services authority functions for the purposes of this Part.  The EPA may issue directions to the water services authorities to ensure they are carrying out in an effective manner the functions assigned to them under the Bill.  The section also provides that the EPA may direct the water services authorities to maintain records regarding registrations, inspections carried out, advisory notices issued and prosecutions initiated, and to submit these records to the EPA.  The EPA is required to keep records regarding its supervisory role and of directions issued to water services authorities.  Water services authorities must comply with directions issued under this section and failure to do so will be an offence.</P>
        <P>Section 70J provides for the issue of directions by the EPA to inspectors and provides that inspectors must comply with these directions.  Section 70K deals with the preparation by the EPA of a national inspection plan regarding the inspection of domestic waste water treatment systems.  It sets out the issues to be considered by the EPA when drawing up the plan.  The section also provides for the revision of the plan.  Water services authorities will be required to give effect to the plan and failure to do so will be an offence.</P>
        <P>The section outlines the criteria the EPA should take into account when preparing the inspection plan and in particular risk or potential risk to human health or the environment.  The risk-based approach to inspections and monitoring is consistent with the EPA&rsquo;s overall policy and approach to environmental enforcement and is consistent with international best practice.  The first inspection plan will be developed by the EPA in 2012 and inspections of systems will commence in 2013.</P>
        <P>Section 70L provides for the making of regulations for the purposes of Part 4A and sets out some of the issues which may be dealt with in these regulations including,<i> inter alia</i>, the performance standards for treatment systems and the standards and procedures to apply where domestic waste water treatment systems are being emptied and the contents are being disposed of.  Section 70M provides for the penalties for offences under the various sections of the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I stated, the Bill is necessary to ensure Ireland complies with a ruling of the European Court of Justice and the timing is critical as we face the imposition of fines and penalties for non-compliance.  The Bill is equally important as it will establish additional protections for public health and for the environment.  There has been much speculation, hyperbole and deliberate confusion about the Bill and what it will mean for householders in rural Ireland.  People living in the countryside need have nothing to fear from this legislation.  On the contrary, the legislation will benefit rural dwellers.  It will improve water quality and serve to improve the quality of the countryside and the quality of life in the countryside.</P>
        <P>If Senators highlight in the course of this debate details of any breaches of existing water regulations, I will be glad to have them inspected and investigated immediately because all of us, whether living in rural or urban areas, want to ensure we have safe ground water and water quality.  Local authorities are doing some of this work under existing legal requirements.  The <Col N="433"/>Bill deliberately sets out a risk-based assessment and approach that will do no more or less than to ensure we have good quality ground water.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to see the Minister attending the House for this legislation.  I fully appreciate where the Bill is coming from.  On this side of the House, we all appreciate the need to protect our water sources, including springs and wells.  We agree with the Minister in that respect but I disagree with him on other matters.  In the last paragraph of his speech, the Minister stated that people living in the countryside need have nothing to fear from this legislation.  I am not sure what planet that statement is coming from.  The reality is that people living in the countryside have everything to fear from the manner in which this legislation is being brought forward.  I will go through the points in detail in a few moments.</P>
        <P>As drafted, the legislation ultimately criminalises people with septic tanks.  There are 475,000 people living in rural areas with septic tanks.  On the basis of about four people living in each house, that equates to between 1.5 million and 2 million people.  It goes beyond that because urban dwellers &mdash; be they in Kilkenny, Cork, Waterford, Dublin or Galway &mdash; who may have holiday homes in the country will also be affected by this measure.  By extension, one could argue that the vast majority of people living in the State will be affected by this legislation.</P>
        <P>The Bill will have drastic consequences and I will get to the nuts and bolts of it in a moment.  I appreciate that the legislation has arisen as a result of the European Court of Justice ruling following complaints that were made by various do-gooder organisations in this State that appealed to the European Commission.  It its ruling, however, the European Court of Justice did not specify the manner in which Ireland had to comply or impose sanctions on people with septic tanks.  The court did not go into any detail on that regard in its ruling.  It spoke about fines but it is worth pointing out that the European Court of Justice has never imposed a fine on this State.  In fact, it has only ever imposed nine fines on member states.  Four such fines were imposed on Greece, as well as France and Portugal.  Some people may say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be fined by Europe and the big fines are going to come&rdquo;, but I think it is time we told Europe where to get off on issues such as this.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill will impose a &euro;50 registration charge on householders.  The Bill is being sold by saying, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s &euro;50?  The registration charge is only &euro;50.  No one has anything to worry about.&rdquo;  That is what has been coming from the Government and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  That is the least draconian measure in the Bill.</P>
        <P>The first inspection is free so the inspector will visit a site to assess whether or not a septic tank meets the required standard.  I understand the standard will be based on the 2009-2010 EPA guidelines.  Essentially that means, for example, that for everyone living in a house one needs an 18-metre percolation pipe running from the septic tank.  In other words, if one has a four-bedroom house, and the EPA guidelines state there are eight people living there, one will need 144 m of pipe running from the septic tank to create the appropriate required percolation <Col N="434"/>area.  Those pipes will have to be 2 m apart and come in six-foot lengths.  They must also be 10 m away from any county road and 20 m from the house.  Any quarter or half-acre site with a four-bedroom house will not be able to meet those criteria.  One may argue that one can put in a treatment plant but it also requires a percolation area.  How will householders on a small site be expected to meet the criteria?  In addition, if the site&rsquo;s soil quality is poor it can pose a problem.  In my own constituency there are many sites where the soil, according to industrial experts, would not meet the required standards.  Such people will then be forced to extract the soil from the site and replace it with more suitable soil that can create a better percolation area.  What will that cost?</P>
        <P>The financial breakdown of the Bill being cost neutral is unclear.  If it is cost neutral then who will pay for the first inspection charge?  The householder will pay &euro;200 for the second inspection charge, while subsequent inspection charges will be free.  If the Bill is cost neutral, however, who will pay for the inspection charges other than the second one?  Perhaps the Minister can outline how the Bill is perceived to be cost neutral in that regard.</P>
        <P>Opposition Senators, and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, our deputy party leader, were accused of scare-mongerging about the costs associated with sites.  That is quite unbelievable because the RIAI report, attached with the legislation, which comes from the Oireachtas Library, clearly states that the costs associated with upgrading a septic tank could be in the region of &euro;17,000.  We were talking about &euro;12,000 but the RIAI is talking about &euro;17,000.</P>

A grant of at least 85% should be given to anyone facing such costs, but that is not provided for in the legislation.  The Bill is flawed and we will fight it at every turn on this side of the House.  It is a tax too far on rural Ireland and the public will not stand for it.  People in my constituency and others feel this is a blatant attack by a new Government on those with septic tanks.</P>

	<P>The Senator believes that you close your eyes and it will go away. That is what has been done and the clock is ticking.  This Bill will amend the Water Services Act 2007.  It proposed the establishment and implementation of a registration and inspection process.  We had to be brought by the European Court of Justice and regulations and directives to do this.  As the Minister said and it is worth restating, if we do not comply with the European Court of Justice ruling, Ireland will be subject to significant fines by the court.  A lump sum penalty of &euro;2.7 million and continuing daily fines of &euro;26,000 per day, which is the equivalent of &euro;9.5 million per annum.  What Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill is recommending is that we pay a fine of &euro;9.5 million rather than implement good regulations.  We must implement the regulations but Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill wants to send this money down the Swanee.</P>

	<P>This is what has Ireland where it is.  Regulations are made to be implemented.  There is no point in saying that the regulations are there but we will not take a blind bit of heed of them.  That is no way to run a county.  People are where they are because they have closed their eyes and think it will go away.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation will provide for a proportionate and risk-based approach to inspections.  On reading the documentation I know that in the first instance inspections will be concentrated on sensitive areas with high risk to the environment and public health.  I understand the factors to be considered in assessing the risks posed by septic tanks include the density of the waste water treatment system in any one area, the soil type, as the Senator alluded to, the presence or absence of underlying aquifers and the thickness of the sub-soils.  If there is rock near the surface, there is a greater risk of pollution, as we all know.  While many people may not have detailed analysis of their soil type, this gives people a basic guide to implementation process.</P>
        <P>The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is developing a GPS mapping system to identify areas at high and low risk of pollution.  This risk-based mapping system will provide inspection services with a sound scientific background when determining which systems to prioritise for inspection.  As we all know, people want fairness, transparency, and consistency throughout the country in any system that is implemented.  We are all too aware of one county doing this and another county doing something else.  Transparency and fairness of implementation throughout the country is not always evident.  There are an estimated 441,000 septic tanks and other domestic waste water facilities in the country, a significant number.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Minister has outlined the principal themes in the Bill, I will not address them in detail.  I will give the reasons it is necessary to implement the regulations.  I compliment Cavan County Council, as it is the only county in Ireland that has implemented the regulations.  I know some fine councillors on Cavan County Council and I say well done to them.  The rest of the country will be following suit.</P>
        <P>Approximately 20% of drinking water supplies originate from ground water, and leakage from septic tanks is a major cause of ground water pollution.  I did not hear recommendations coming from the Fianna F&aacute;il Party about what it proposes to do about ground water pollution in rural areas.  Poison the people; have them all in hospital.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>Put more cost on the system.  That is what the Fianna F&aacute;il Party is proposing.  Inefficient septic tanks pollute surrounding soil and may release climate change gases such as methane into the atmosphere.  The reduction of these gases is necessary.  Waste water discharge feeding into surface waters can pollute drinking water sources.  Nobody mentioned the drinking water for livestock.  The animals do not know from looking at the water what is good and what is bad.  This Bill will provide good drinking water not alone for humans but for livestock as well.  We all realise there is a need for the legislation and it is important that we avoid the imposition of penalties and fines where possible.</P>
        <P>To illustrate further the need for legislation, the HSE recently produced a report on the quality of drinking water from private wells &mdash; let me stress these are private wells, because I do not want to be a scaremonger &mdash; which revealed a staggering 76% non-compliance with standards required under the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations 2007.</P>

	<P>The appeals process is mentioned in the Bill in section 70H(7)(<i>b</i>).  A &euro;200 fee is payable by a household when appealing an advisory notice.  I know the Minister mentioned in his speech that it would be under that amount, but I suggest that he take a zero off the &euro;200 and apply a fee of &euro;20 to this section.  I ask the Minister to make a statement on this.  A fee of &euro;200 is way off the mark.  We know we have a significant problem, but we know also that a great many septic tanks will have to be repaired.  There are people who may not be able to afford anything, and in the interest of saving the environment versus penalising a person who cannot afford to pay, I ask the Minister to look at a system of grant aid in cases of hardship or other such cases where one house is causing pollution in a ground water system.  When one considers that urban dwellers have a subsidy for the sewerage system, in the interests of equality would the Minister reconsider a system for those in the country?  There is a system for new houses, but that is not the system that will be implemented for existing septic tanks.  I ask the Minister to reconsider and see if he can do anything for those with existing septic tanks.</P>
        <P>I highlight the importance of the regulation.  We all agree that the risk factors posed to the health of humans and animals is not one we can afford to take.  We could do a great deal with the &euro;9 million per annum to upgrade our systems throughout the country rather than pay that money in fines, as is being proposed by the Senator.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister.  When the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, announced in September that he would introduce a pre-registration fee, I got calls from county councillors who were terrified.  The Minister used the word &ldquo;hyperbole&rdquo; but I do not agree, as these councillors want to get re-elected in the elections of 2014.  In my experience county councillors are the people who keep rural communities together.  Where would we be if people in rural communities were not committed to giving public service, which is what a county councillor does.  They are in fear and dread that their constituents will not be able to pay the fees that will arise from this legislation.  It is fine for the Minister to say that most of the septic tanks will be up to standard.  That is not correct.  The real problem is that so many of the existing septic tanks will not be up to standard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator White is admitting we have a problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>We all agree the authorities in Cavan are exemplary in their delivery of this perfect scheme, but since 2004 there has been a 25% septic tank failure rate in the county.  Given that septic tank standards have increased significantly since 2004 under the 2000 EPA code of practice, such a failure rate will surely increase.</P>
      <TimeSt down="3" idown="3">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The scale of inspections will also be broadened under this legislation to encompass the impact on the countryside.  There is a real issue in this respect in terms of the number of septic tanks that will not be up to scratch.  That is a fear in county councils.  Where will people get the money to pay for the upgrading of septic tanks?  There is an unemployment rate of 14.4%, as well as massive emigration.  Every person in the country is being frugal and parsimonious as people are terrified about not having money to spend.  The retail sector is flat and people are scared to think about how they will pay bills in the coming years.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il totally opposes the Bill and will fight it tooth and nail to the bitter end.  I know the Minister is a warrior.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Minister will meet 14 warriors from Fianna F&aacute;il in the Seanad and I am sure I can speak for Sinn F&eacute;in Members also. I know from my previous career in the building industry that the main polluters are local authorities, which is unforgivable, rather than rural dwellers.  It disturbs me that local authorities and the bureaucrats which run county councils have allowed this to happen during the years.  There are a number of rivers and coastal waterways which have been polluted because the relevant local authority has not done its business, as the Minister knows.  That should be a key driver to get the Department to put the screws on county councils which should not be allowed to continue polluting rivers and lakes with sewage.</P>
     
	<P>There is a fear among older people in rural communities who have septic tanks.  From where will they get the money to bring their septic tanks up to standard?  That is all we want to know.  We would be delighted if the Minister provided the money for them, as we all want to maintain Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a green food island.  As my colleague, the chieftain from Donegal, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, has mentioned, this legislation may not be constitutional as urban dwellers have their system paid for by the Exchequer.  Rural dwellers are being penalised.  We are looking forward to a big battle with the Minister on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="439"/>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  As he noted, this is an extremely important issue and legislation.  I will start where Senator White left off on local authorities.  Their compliance with legislation leaves much to be desired.  Across the country authorities are in breach of regulations.  This issue has been left to one side, yet we are going down the route of pursuing this requirement.  People may argue about and dislike it, but the Minister has correctly indicated that this issue costs us much money on a daily basis.  Some mechanism must be put in place to ensure compliance by local authorities.  </P>
        <P>For a number of years I served on the Committee of the Regions and one of the items I was progressing before being elevated to this position was the availability of money for the provision of reed bed water treatment systems for local authorities.  I ask the Minister to pursue this issue through the European Union, as the funding is available.  It offers a solution to the problem at low cost to the Exchequer.  Some of the actions of local authorities are despicable.  I make this point before getting into the nuts and bolts of the issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister has mentioned the register which is being compiled.  I do not have the appropriate statistics, but a large number of houses were built before the introduction of the 1963 planning regulations.  There are literally no records of infrastructure for the disposing of waste.  How will the register catch such properties?  Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill and Keane have mentioned the standards which will be applied.  I live in rural Ireland, where I built a house 12 years ago.  The standards required of the septic tank I put in place are totally different from the standards applied today.  Will cognisance be taken of the difference?</P>
        <P>The issue can be distilled into two elements: the requirement on us as a member state to be compliant, with which nobody can argue, and the methodology to be use in being compliant.  I do not have a major difficulty with the legislation which I welcome, but I have a number of queries.  People will be required to spend money if the standard that prevailed in the past is to be raised.  Will the Minister elaborate on the standards that will apply to new houses and those which applied to older properties?</P>
        <P>Section 70B relates to database compilation and indicates registration by a householder.  Will householders be required to register, or will they be caught by the Department in setting up a register?  The legislation is not clear on this point.</P>
        <P>Section 70E states the EPA will appoint staff, but will they come from the EPA or local authorities?  Section 70H refers to an advisory notice on required improvements.  Will the Minister provide for clarity on a timeframe?  For example, if an inspector finds a pipe broken and that the effluent on a property is not being diverted to the percolation area, that would require the undertaking of minor repair work.  If the system is clogged up and a new percolation system must be put in place, a different timeframe will be necessary.  We need clarity on this point.  Will the timeframe be job-specific, or will there be a general timeframe?</P>
        <P>The initial roll-out of the programme from compilation of register will take approximately 12 months, according to what I have read.  Following this is a scenario in which an individual could be told to carry out repair works.  There would then be a rush to meet the timeframe for compliance, leading to problems in getting the required specialist contractors to do the work.  Will the Minister take account of the fact that there are not enough contractors available to do what will, in effect, be work in a goldmine?  Everybody will want to do work based on inspections.  When people come to look for contractors, they will find they are scarce.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister for the work done so far, but we must tweak certain elements.  This is necessary legislation and the Minister has acted on the issue.  There have been objections from the other side of the House, but I have not heard any proposal so far, other than a reference to what happens in Northern Ireland, which is a minor example.  The reference to Scotland was replied to by Senator C&aacute;it Keane.  We must do it properly.  We must see how we <Col N="440"/>can help people who will be hit financially for the work being carried out.  One should not engage in scaremongering.  People should be allowed enough time and space to find money to do the work that is needed.  I urge the Minister to respond to that point as well when he replies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will see a number of the Fianna F&aacute;il proposals by way of amendment on Committee Stage, when we intend to discuss them.  I hope he will consider each amendment on its merits.</P>
        <P>This is not just a rural issue; it is a big issue in my constituency in north County Dublin.  I attended five meetings in recent weeks in Rush, Lusk, Loughshinny, Ballyboughal, Skerries and Swords.  A further meeting is planned for Thursday in Swords.  Rural dwellers with one-off houses have paid significant development levies to local authorities for services they do not have.  That is certainly the case with Fingal County Council.  People in north County Dublin have paid between &euro;30,000 and &euro;50,000 to the local authority by way of development levies for services that do not exist.  The Bill does not refer to providing grant aid for people in any way, shape or form.  Neither does it refer to means testing.  Let us consider what is done for the warmer homes scheme and provide a degree of equity.  We will have problems with septic tanks and systems that will fail the test.  People will have to pay for the remediation.  My colleague, Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, is correct; in many instances it will cost thousands of euro to remediate the system.  What will happen if people do not have the money?</P>
        <P>In his opening statement the Minister correctly referred to the importance of ground water and the supply of fresh drinking water.  I could not agree with him more.  He should talk to the people in north County Dublin who are faced with a proposal from the Department.  I will tell him where he will get the money; under the greater Dublin strategic drainage scheme.  The Department, in conjunction with Fingal County Council, proposes to install the largest waste water treatment plant this country has ever seen in the middle of the horticultural and market gardening capital of this country where 60% of the fresh fruit and vegetables are produced.  The scheme remains part of the capital programme.  The Minister has allowed it to proceed to planning.  Between &euro;2.3 billion and &euro;2.6 billion has been put aside for this project that is not needed.  What will happen is that the people of north County Dublin and Fingal will treat the waste for nine regional local authorities all around that area.  If the Minister wants to save money to enable him to introduce a grant scheme to allow people to remediate their septic tanks he should bin the proposed scheme for a monster treatment plant in north County Dublin that will serve all of Dublin, Kildare, Meath and north Wicklow because it is simply not required.  That is where he will get the money to provide the grants we are talking about to allow people to remediate their systems.</P>
        <P>Is it Government policy to proceed with the Bill without making provision for grant aid or means testing?  If it is, the Minister will get total and utter opposition from us.  We will propose amendments in that regard.  Is it Government policy &mdash; bad policy &mdash; to proceed with a massive, regional waste water treatment plant to serve the east coast and to land it slap-bang in the middle of north County Dublin?  Has the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, raised the matter at Cabinet?  Has the Minister not considered the fact that best practice across most developed countries is localised plants?  Deputies referred to Scotland.  There is a massive treatment plant in Edinburgh that allowed raw sewage out into the North Sea for 60 hours at 1,000 litres per second.  That is the type of thing the Government proposes.</P>
        <P>The Minister can introduce the Bill with means testing and grant aid.  As is the case in Northern Ireland, he should have at least one free desludging per year.  The Minister can do that if he bins the crazy proposal on the treatment plant.  Is it Government policy to proceed <Col N="441"/>with the treatment plant?  In addition, is it Government policy to proceed with the Bill with no financial assistance to people who would be badly in need of it?</P>
        <P>Senator Keane correctly said that we are all concerned with the environment.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government should also be.  He should know that one cannot get blood from a stone.  Where will people get the money who have individual sewerage units and septic tanks that require remediation that could cost between &euro;10,000 and &euro;17,000?  There is not one proposal in the Bill to provide for grant aid.  We will table significant amendments on Committee Stage.  We hope our colleagues in government will consider the amendments because as the Bill stands, it is an attack on rural areas, as outlined by Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, which could be unconstitutional.  People have paid development levies to their local authorities for services that do not exist.  Now they are being hit again by Government and by local authorities with an additional charge to do the work the local authorities should have done in the first place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a constructive, balanced, well-thought out approach to dealing with where we find ourselves today in that we have not complied with the necessary provisions to protect the water schemes and ground water, especially in respect of septic tanks.  It is unfortunate that the European Commission has threatened to impose fines and that the necessary work could not have been done previously.</P>

	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;they promised they would introduce a scheme for licensing and inspecting septic tanks and wastewater treatment systems.  As that is what we are doing with the Bill before the House, I do not think it is crazy at all.  It is practical, necessary and important legislation.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>A couple of issues were raised, including that the Bill might be unconstitutional.  Everyone has an obligation to protect their environment and to ensure that their impact on it is reduced and minimised.  Legislation such as this produces a framework within which waste water treatment systems can comply.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien referred to people in his constituency who have paid development charges recently.  They will probably have treatment systems that are well-informed from an environmental point of view given that they were probably constructed relatively recently because development charges have not been in place for long.  People in new constructions will register their treatment system under the legislation.  I expect they would welcome the measure.</P>
        <P>It is important that we know exactly what is going on as we do not see much pollution given that it is not visible.  It is underground in the soil, ground water and aquifers.  We must step back and take note of what is going on.  Legislation such as this will enhance the planning and development of one-off housing in rural or semi-rural areas.  I am in a similar constituency to Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien that is composed of some rural but largely urban areas.  The legislation is important.  I welcome the fact that a methodology is put in place whereby inspections will be carried out and there is an obligation on householders operating waste water treatment systems &mdash; septic tanks as we know them &mdash; to register the provisions.</P>
        <P>I share the concerns expressed by Senator Landy on older systems, especially those pre-1963, and systems that were constructed where they should never have been constructed because of <Col N="442"/>the sub-soil or ground water system but nonetheless they were given permission.  In the light of today&rsquo;s knowledge I envisage that difficulties will arise for some people.  It is important that such concerns are raised at this stage.</P>
        <P>Compliance with European environmental directives has been a good thing for this country.  It has been one of the positive aspects of membership of the European Union.  In many cases we have been brought kicking and screaming but we have addressed our environment.  In this case we are dealing with air, soil, groundwater and aquifers.  We have been forced to address these issues and have acknowledged the need to do so.  We have established natural heritage areas and special areas of conservation.  Our environment, heritage and countryside are the richer for that.</P>
        <P>I am an urban dweller but I spend much time in rural areas.  Farmers and rural people are in touch with their own environment.  Many people welcome this development.  This is a grey area.  Last night I was looking at chat lines dealing with septic tanks and came across people who had bought a house ten years ago but did not know whether they had a septic tank or not.  There will now be an obligation on a vendor to inform a purchaser of property that such a thing is in place.  One could point to the fact that a surveyor did not point it out.  However, there are now people who own dwellings and have no concept of what happens when they turn on a kitchen tap or flush a toilet.</P>
        <P>This legislation is very important and welcome and puts a framework in place by which we can protect our much-valued environment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have always regarded the Minister as a very sensible and practical man, until I read this legislation.  It is obvious that it is based on a desk study.  No one in this House would deny that we need to protect our environment.  The protection of the health of the population, by ensuring clean water, is absolutely essential.  However, the Bill goes beyond what is practical.</P>
        <P>Where is the bar being set?  The European Court of Justice singled out County Cavan as the only compliant county in the country, based on the 1975 directive.  I understand that Cavan was compliant with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, guidelines of 1999.  Now the bar has been raised.  As the European Court of Justice has already decided that Cavan is compliant, why has the Minister raised the bar with the new EPA guidelines?  Many of those who were compliant with the 1999 standard will not comply with the new requirements.</P>
        <P>Our objective is to protect our water.  Rather than basing new standards on the inspection of septic tanks, therefore, why not look at water courses, test the quality of the water in them and then go back and ensure that any discharges within the catchment of that water supply are corrected?  That would be a more focused approach, rather than the across-the-board, catch-all system which the legislation creates.</P>
        <P>The Bill will affect people in the private sector, many of whom may well be distressed financially and in other ways as a consequence.  What about our public systems?  This is an example of the State pointing the finger at individuals before getting its own house in order.  At the beginning of 2008, waste water from 112 locations with a population equivalent of 500 or greater was being discharged, with very basic treatment or none, into estuarial or coastal waters.</P>
        <P>A report on urban waste water was published in 2009, based on the years 2006 and 2007.  The EPA itself has carried out studies and produced reports on urban areas which show that 66% of all urban sewage treatment plants fail the necessary tests.  Having spent &euro;2.7 billion on upgrading the new urban areas wastewater treatment systems, both Dublin and Limerick city failed to meet the criteria.  Why are we going after people in rural Ireland who are the backbone <Col N="443"/>of our country, work hard and subscribe to the economy and targeting them for something that, in many instances, will be impossible to comply with?</P>
        <P>There is no provision in the Bill for cases where a person fails the inspection, and I have heard nothing from the Minister about such a provision.  They will get an advisory notice and a timeframe in which to remedy whatever defects have been identified.  Many septic tanks are on household sites of half an acre, and householders will be unable to meet the required standards, particularly in the percolation areas and the extent of piping required.  It will be physically impossible for those people to comply.  What will happen those people?  What will happen the person who gets an advisory notice and is faced with a cost of a five figure sum?  I have heard figures from &euro;10,000 to &euro;17,000 mentioned, depending on the scope of the work that needs to be done.  How does such a person, who may be on social welfare or a paltry pension, meet the requirement in the advisory notice?  There is nothing in the Bill to say people will be assisted.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to what is happening in Northern Ireland.  Britain is focusing on wastewater treatment schemes where the discharge is up to 5 cu. m per day, or less than the surface water, and which are discharging up to 2 cu. m per day into groundwater.  Britain is taking a much more targeted approach than we seem to be doing.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister to rescope the legislation, from a purely practical point of view.  Improving our water supply system is fundamental for us and something to which everyone aspires.  However, if legislation is going a certain route it must be practical.  The Bill will create difficulties for a large proportion of the rural population, as well as householders in ribbon developments on the outskirts of our towns which are not connected to a public sewerage system.  This is a failure of our local authorities.  They do not have the funding to do it.  One way to deal with that problem, although it would not help the majority of people who will be adversely affected by this measure, would be to pipe the wastewater effluent from those septic tanks into the public scheme and leave the solid material to be cleaned from the septic tanks.  If the Minister does not offer some sort of financial package we will be whistling in the wind.  The legislation will lead to tremendous aggravation among the populace as a whole who will be seriously and adversely affected by it.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the Bill, which implements the policies of the previous Government, although Opposition Senators may not wish to acknowledge that.  There is good intent on all sides of the House to clean up this particular mess.  We are working assiduously to clean up the economic and financial mess, and the Taoiseach is abroad today trying to do so.  The environmental mess caused through not dealing with this problem over the last number of years is also being dealt with, and this is welcome.  Seven or eight months into office, we have a Bill before us which will go through committee.  If suitable amendments are tabled I have no doubt the Minister will be more than happy to examine them and deal with them accordingly.</P>
        <P>I commend the people and council of County Cavan who saw the light a long time ago and put regulations in place to deal with this problem.  I was at a conference in Cork several years ago at which the environmental director for Cavan County Council gave a very enlightening presentation on how Cavan had dealt with the issue.  Interestingly, the European Court of Justice judgment against Ireland exempted County Cavan.  It is a bit rich that a certain MEP in Ireland West is going around holding public meetings berating this legislation.  I wonder <Col N="444"/>whether the same MEP held a meeting in Cavan.  It would be interesting to know whether that happened.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation is very welcome.  However, there is one thing I would like the Minister to take into consideration.  He should consider the people who will end up having to carry out remedial works and the contractors employed to do such work, as there have been shady developers and builders operating over the years.  The last thing we need now is people taking advantage of householders who find it necessary to carry out substantial remedial work.  Some sort of register should be introduced.  In County Clare, we had a register of people who were qualified to carry out percolation reports and did not accept planning applications unless the percolation report and proposals came from somebody on the list.  Perhaps we should use a similar system to provide structure and ensure we have a panel of people who have been inspected and are qualified to carry out this work.  We have seen what has happened with light and poor regulation over the years.  This is a new venture to try to clean up public water and ensure we are compliant with the European directive.  As such, it is important that the workers individuals must employ to carry out remedial works are competent, capable, efficient and cost efficient.</P>

	<P>Thank you.  The &euro;50 charge must be considered in the context of the dire straits our economy is in and the potential fines we face as a country if we fail to implement the ECJ ruling.  The Minister has spoken of a lump sum penalty of &euro;2.7 million, followed by daily fines for non-compliance of more than &euro;26,000 per day, amounting to more than &euro;9.5 million annually.  It is very clear that as a State we cannot afford to pay those fines.  These are grave economic times and they require tough decisions made for the right reasons.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, has shown that he is up to this task and I wish him well in piloting this legislation through the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>It is interesting to hear Government representatives, when challenged by either of the Opposition parties, talk about opposition for the sake of opposition.  We had a similar discussion this morning, but I do not want to have to read again the litany of promises made by the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party before the election which have been broken.  Consistently, promises and commitments given have been broken.  There was significant opposition for the sake of opposition from those parties when they were in Opposition.  I could recite many of the promises that were made, particularly by Deputy Gilmore, to <Col N="447"/>protect people in rural Ireland, people who live in poverty, people who live in disadvantaged communities and come from disadvantaged backgrounds and to ensure that fairness and equity would be at the heart of Government decisions.  However, we have the opposite now from those parties.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me deal with the issue at hand.  My party favours moves that will further environmental protection.  We believe it is vital to have a comprehensive mode of inspection and oversight in this area.  We take a rights-based approach to the environment.  Having a clean environment is a right that must be upheld to achieve a better quality of life.  Clearly, considering the damage a faulty wastewater treatment system can do in its immediate environs, it is vital that the Government ensures such systems are properly maintained and inspected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill&rsquo;s digest, which was helpfully provided by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, notes approximately 20% of drinking water supplies originate from ground-water and, as detailed in the regulatory impact analysis carried out on behalf of the Department of Envir<Col N="448"/>onment, Heritage and Local Government, leakage from septic tanks is a major cause of ground-water pollution, especially in rural areas.  A good inspection regime should have a very positive implication for ground-water quality by minimising pollution from wastewater treatment systems.  Insufficient septic tanks pollute the surrounding soil and may release climate-changing gases such as methane into the atmosphere and cause odour nuisance.  Wastewater discharge feeding into surplus water can pollute drinking water sources for livestock and other animals.  Improvements in service water quality on the implementation of the Bill would reduce the incidence of illness as a result of animals drinking contaminated water.</P>
        <P>The Bill, which is to amend the Water Services Act 2007, is being introduced because, in October 2009, the European Court of Justice ruled that Ireland failed to adopt the necessary legislation to comply with Articles 4 and 8 of the Council&rsquo;s waste directive regarding domestic wastewater disposed of in the countryside through septic tanks and other individual waste treatment systems.  This could have been resolved many years ago, however, and the Government is right to blame a party that is now in opposition.  This issue has its roots in a European directive from 1975 and it appears we are many years behind other European countries, especially our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, in introducing a comprehensive inspection and registration regime.</P>
        <P>There are aspects of the Bill that cause concern among those of us in Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Bill penalises ordinary working people in rural areas.  Ordinary people have been hit badly, albeit by proposals of the previous Government, but I am sure they will be hit in a similar vein by the present Government when its budget is announced in a couple of weeks.  The dreaded universal social charge was announced last year and it has had a significant impact on many working families.  In addition, families are expected to pay household charges, water charges and the proposed septic tank charge.</P>
        <P>Reducing poverty ought to be the core aim of the Government.  Increasing unfair household charges will not do anything but decrease people&rsquo;s incomes.  Reducing the incomes of those who spend takes money out of the real economy.  We have seen how this has had a deflationary impact on the economy in the State.  The proposal to charge the owners of wastewater treatment systems for registration is iniquitous and unfair.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let me deal with some of the issues that were raised in regard to what Sinn F&eacute;in has done in the North.  There is an alternative.  In the Six Counties, desludging services are available for free to domestic users once per year from Northern Ireland Water.  If users require a second service during the second year period, they must bear a charge.  My party is committed to ensuring the systems in the Six Counties and Twenty-six Counties are harmonised.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The bottom line is that if Government representatives want to grab hold of the Sinn F&eacute;in pre-budgetary submission &mdash; I will ensure they all receive a copy &mdash; they will see that there are many alternatives that could be considered to tackle wealth in this country to ensure that high earners pay their fair share, especially those in the political system and at the top of the public service, who walked away with lottery prize-sized payments in recent times.  Many of the proposals we are making would allow the Government to raise revenue without having to penalise again working people in rural areas.  We can have inspections through the local authority system without having to impose charges.  A point was made by a Fianna F&aacute;il Senator about what happens if remediation works need to be done.  They <Col N="449"/>could cost thousands of euro.  Where in God's name will families who are financially crippled at present get the money to carry out these works if there is no grant system in place?  The measure is putting the cart before the horse again.  Ordinary working people must foot the Bill.  They pay their taxes for decent infrastructure.</P>

	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister to the House.  I welcome the Bill and agree with its provisions.  While there is some concern about it, the subject with which it deals should have been dealt with many years ago.  Approximately seven or eight years ago, I met the then Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, in my capacity as a member of the IFA.  He stated then he would consider introducing a grant to help people experiencing difficulty in rural areas.  We allowed the Celtic tiger to pass by but this was not done.  Unfortunately, we are not in a position at this point to introduce a grant but it is vital that we protect public health.  We do not  want to see cryptosporidium in the water in any county, as was the case in Galway some years ago.  This created a very serious problem and the council had to draw in water for people.</P>
        <P>There has been much scaremongering on this issue in recent months, particularly regarding the introduction of an inspection charge of &euro;300.  In these times, &euro;50 is quite a lot of money but its not a significant charge.  It covers the owners of septic tanks for five years.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Keane on the desirability of grant aid for people who encounter serious difficulties, perhaps based on means tests.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>This Bill will create a private army of inspectors who will have greater powers than the Oireachtas.  How are Fine Gael Senators and councillors going to explain to their constituents that an army of inspectors and appeals officers, all of whom will be appointed by the EPA with the consent of the Minister, will have the power to enter houses and properties to inspect and monitor waste water treatment systems?  The legislation allows them to set up camp for up to a week.  They can take photographs of waste treatment systems, instruct residents not to disturb parts of their own premises, use diggers to carry out surveys of the soil and inspect records and other private information relating to waste water treatment systems.  While the legislation states that inspectors require the permission of occupiers to enter, it will be an offence for a person to refuse entry to an inspector.  I object to any private individual who is not employed by a statutory authority being given power to enter a house.  The legislation should give those powers to the local authorities, the EPA or the Department.  Who knows what level of political influence will be applied when the Minister&rsquo;s consent is required?  This issue needs to be considered in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>We have already had an extensive debate on the charge and I am not going to rehearse the arguments.  How are Fine Gael and the Labour Party Members going to explain to their constituents that they will have to work through all sorts of appeals and upgrading work if they do not comply with the legislation?  I regret that the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy McGinley, is no longer in the House, even though this is not his area of responsibility.  How will he tell people in Gweedore, where all the houses are built on top of each other, that they will have to upgrade their tanks and purchase additional land to put in place a new percolation system?</P>

In many parts of counties Meath and Donegal where ribbon developed was permitted, insufficient land is available to upgrade septic tanks.  Householders will be unable to do what the Minister is requiring of them.</P>
        <P>The proposed new section 70D is a Trojan horse which deals with the sale of premises connected to domestic waste water treatment systems.  While the legislation benignly states that owners will not be able to sell their properties if they are not registered, nobody will want to buy a house if its septic tank is not up to scratch because of the risk of inspections or being made upgrade.  Any solicitor worth his or her salt will have to advise potential purchasers of rural houses to hire a surveyor to determine whether the waste water treatment system is up to the standards required by the legislation.  God love anyone trying to sell a house with a 30 year old septic tank and insufficient land for another percolation area.  A buyer would be mad to buy a house in a rural area in such circumstances.</P>

These are genuine issues but they can be addressed by the establishment of the grant system several Senators opposite have called for.</P>

        <P>Senators Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill and Thomas Byrne talked about an army of inspectors descending on people&rsquo;s private property.  What I am doing in this legislation is no different from what Fianna F&aacute;il did with the building energy regulations scheme, where it provided for private inspection of the energy performance of buildings.  That is allowed.  The national car tests are private inspections carried out on motor cars.

With the greatest of respect to the Minister, whom I respect, I have never been as agitated in making a point of order since I was first elected to the House.  Am I invisible?

	<P Just="Left">It is a point of order.  Two members of our party had indicated to speak before the Minister was called, as the Member who was in the Chair will confirm.  Two of our members have been denied the right to speak on Second Stage of a very important Bill.  I ask for the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling on this situation because I believe a genuine error was made by the Acting Chairman.  Two, in fact three, of our members had offered to speak and were present in the Chamber.  We are not going to permit this, where a Bill is rushed through and a Minister is called in to try to nobble and quieten our Members who are listed to speak and had offered to do so.  We are not going to accept it and they must be offered the opportunity to speak on this Bill.</P>

In good faith, having been in the Chair myself on many occasions when quorums were called, I always allowed sufficient time for people to get back into the House.</P>
        <P>Members are criticising our colleague for calling a quorum.  He is quite entitled to call a quorum under the Standing Orders of this House and it is a long-standing precedent that time would be given to colleagues to re-enter the Chamber.  I want to put it on the record of the House that it is my clear understanding &mdash; I believe my colleagues &mdash; that they were here and had indicated, as well as having been mentioned on a list that is in front of the Cathaoirleach.

To deal with the issues raised by Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill and Byrne in regard to the army of inspectors, this is no different from the Dog Breeding Establishments Act, which allowed people from the private sector to go onto premises and which the Senators voted for in 2010.  It is no different from the private people who are set up as panels by local authorities for planning purposes and no different than the building energy regulation scheme which allows for private people to go onto premises.

It never ceases to amaze me how some Members of the previous Government and their newly elected colleagues can conveniently forget the commitments that were made and that they made.  Allow me to quote from the renewed programme for Government agreed between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party on 10 October 2009.

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Goverment (Deputy Phil Hogan)</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of matters have been raised in the course of the debate which I will address now.</P>
        <P>First, the Department has examined in detail the regulatory systems that are in place in other jurisdictions.  There is no single consistent approach to regulating the use of on-site treatment systems although monitoring and inspection are common features in many of the countries reviewed.  Notwithstanding the approach being taken in other countries, this legislation must ensure compliance with the court ruling which requires the establishment of a system of inspection.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The most extreme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Northern Ireland and Scotland have been mentioned as having regulatory systems which could be replicated here, and people have suggested that there is no charge.  In Northern Ireland, regardless of when a septic tank was constructed or installed, discharge consent under the Water (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 is required and with effect from 1 April 2011, the application fee increased from &pound;110 to &pound;115.  The assertion that there is no charge is not true.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="462"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is more focused; it is not a catch-all.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Free desludging, that is where the issue is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have waited a long time to say these few words and I listened to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister to continue, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>What I am saying does not suit Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not want to hear what I had to say.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In Scotland, from 1 April 2006, registration of septic tanks with the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency is required, and registration fees are as follows: &pound;77 for on-line applications; and &pound;104 for application using a hard copy application form.  The notion that there are no fees in other jurisdictions mentioned here today is not correct.</P>
        <P>On registration fees here, a number of Senators suggested that the appeal fee of &euro;200 is too high, and I have accepted that.  In the course of my address, I indicated I would change that and the figure I have in mind is &euro;20, rather than &euro;200.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The scope of the appeal is too narrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>On inspection and the condition of planning that apply, I am introducing a system of planning exemption for the work to be carried out in this regard.  I am glad of the opportunity to allay fears about this matter.</P>

	<P>There are no grants.  The Government is yielding to the pressure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know of any situation where grants have been included in legislation.  Perhaps Senator Byrne would point me in that direction.</P>
        <P>We will consider a grant scheme once the inspection period in 2013 is over and where we see the extent of the work that has to be done in remediation for the one-in-five households that will be inspected on the basis of this risk-based approach.</P>
        <P>On any of the scaremongering that we have heard about all of the various charges and the amount of money that it will cost, it costs &euro;2,000 to put in a septic tank and I do not know from where Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill gets &euro;17,000.</P>

	<P>The penalty I am proposing is &euro;5,000.  It is much different.  In addition, it has been mentioned that there is no support being given for rural areas.  Under the rural water programme, a substantial amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money has been put into upgrading group water schemes and schemes in rural areas.  In fact, my predecessors in Government have invested &euro;500 million and I want to acknowledge that.  It was a significant success.</P>
        <P>The rural water programme has demonstrated, in the EPA samples carried out, massive improvements in the quality of water in rural areas.  I have money allocated to that programme in 2012 and I will look at how we can deploy that money in order to help people overcome any difficulties in group water schemes or group sewerage schemes in rural areas.  I will seek how we can target resources to help those who need it most.</P>
        <P>The grant scheme can only be looked at in the context of the budget of 2014 because in 2013, we will know the extent of the problem arising from the one-in-five inspections carried out.  Senator Walsh would not expect me to bring in a grant scheme for something that has not yet happened.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> accepts that we need to enforce a minimum price for alcohol, based on the price per unit of alcohol;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that selling alcohol for below cost price is an incentive to the purchase of alcohol;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that excessive consumption of alcohol is damaging for the health of individuals;</P><Col N="466"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that the average age for a first drinking experience is declining;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> recognises that below cost selling of alcohol can be damaging for individuals, families and communities; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> recognises that alcohol-related crimes have risen in the decade from 2001 to 2011.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I, too, welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Alcohol, the purchase of alcohol and alcohol abuse comprise a problem that must be tackled.  This motion outlines some methods that we can use to begin to tackle it.  Affordability and easy access, as acknowledged by many reports in this field, are the two chief problems that need to be addressed to curb consumption.  When talking about affordability and easy access, we need to draw a distinction between off-trade, which is that of off-licences, and on-trade, which is that of pubs.  Put simply, the minimum price per unit of alcohol is not designed to hurt Irish pubs or stop business.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is clear that the majority of people who go to their local pub for a social drink act sensibly and responsibly.  However, it is important that we protect vulnerable and susceptible people in society.  A six pack of beer bought from an off-licence can cost between &euro;1 and &euro;2 per can, a price which under-age drinkers can easily afford.  Providing they have access to an older relative or friend who is willing to make the purchase, these youngsters can obtain a decent amount of alcohol for a relatively small cost.</P>
        <P>It makes sense to introduce this initiative because the health and economic benefits are clear.  In regard to health implications, Alcohol Action Ireland has pointed out that an Irish male can reach his low risk drinking limit for less than &euro;10, while a female can reach her limit at &euro;6.  These are off-trade prices and they equate approximately to one hour&rsquo;s work on the minimum wage.  The motion before us begins to address this problem.  An EU health report concluded that the affordability of alcohol in Ireland rose by 50% between 1996 and 2004 and suggested that an increase of 1% in affordability results in an increase of 0.22% in consumption.  It is plain that increases in alcohol affordability, particularly in the off-trade environment, have been accompanied by increases in consumption.  A decrease in affordability can be expected to have an inverse effect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That the off-trade business is booming is evident from the fivefold increase in the number of off-licences between 1990 and 2006.  Last year a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme highlighted the ease with which under-age children could obtain alcohol through delivery services.</P>
        <P>Accessibility and affordability are key problems which must be addressed if we are to make progress on this issue.  The sensible solution is to set a minimum price for alcohol based on the price per unit.  Senators van Turnhout and Crown have made valuable proposals on amending our motion and, in the interest of harmony, I am happy to include their suggestions on describing alcohol content in grams as well as units in order to pre-empt future changes to measurements.</P>
        <P>There can be no ambiguity about the cost of alcohol to the economy.  It is estimated that alcohol abuse cost Ireland &euro;3.7 billion in 2007 and treating alcohol related problems in hospitals costs the health system an estimated &euro;1.3 billion per year.  The increased costs associated with vandalism and work absenteeism can also be attributed to excessive alcohol consumption.  The combined cost of these social and economic problems are approximately &euro;1.5 billion.  The chief medical officer estimated that a 30% reduction in alcohol abuse would save &euro;1 billion for the taxpayer, not to mention the numerous lives, families and communities that would benefit from such a change.</P><Col N="467"/>
        <P>We need to bring about a change in our attitudes and, by introducing a minimum price for alcohol we can begin to effect that change.  By curbing the quantities of alcohol bought and consumed outside the pub environment, we will foster changes in attitudes towards alcohol and a decline in its abuse.</P>
        <P>The health implications of alcohol are plain.  There is a clear link between alcohol and depression.  Most suicide attempts occur when the individual concerned has consumed alcohol.  We need to discuss this problematic relationship openly and maturely.  The days of denying these problems and their causes are over.  Alcohol related deaths have increased steadily between 1995 and today.  As many as 30% of injury related admissions to emergency departments are due to alcohol.  A floor price for alcohol would reduce consumption and, in turn, the number of alcohol related illnesses, suicides and deaths.</P>
        <P>This proposal is not unprecedented.  A national price initiative taken in Canada is regarded as a success story and in March 2011 the Northern Ireland Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety proposed a minimum price for alcohol sold in the North.  Under the latter proposal the minimum price for a bottle of wine would be between &pound;4 and &pound;7 and a six-pack of beer would cost between &pound;4.40 and &pound;7.70.  These prices are designed to impact on the booming off-trade environment.  If possible, we should reach a cross-Border agreement on minimum alcohol prices.  If Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland decide to introduce minimum pricing, we should attempt to co-ordinate prices for obvious economic reasons.  If similar initiatives are not taken in the North people in Border counties will be able to travel north to buy alcohol for cheaper prices.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the 1990s, eight out of ten Canadian provinces introduced social reference pricing, whereby a floor price was set for alcohol.  This initiative was considered a success, with a Canadian addiction research centre stating there was clear evidence that minimum pricing had significantly reduced alcohol consumption.  The level of alcohol consumption <i>per capita</i> is far lower in Canada than in Ireland.  An annual average of 9.77 litres of alcohol is consumed per person in Canada, compared with a figure of 14.41 litres in Ireland.</P>
        <P>For a multitude of reasons relating to business, society, health and crime, we need to enforce a minimum price for alcohol and I am proud to commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion and thank my colleague for taking the initiative at a Fine Gael Parliamentary Party to research and draft the proposals contained therein.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was a member of Cork City Council for 12 years.  I represented an area around UCC where huge changes have occurred in alcohol consumption patterns over that period.  Whereas pubs were previously a common social outlet for young people, four have closed within a half mile radius of UCC in the past five years because increasing numbers of people are drinking at home.  The off-trade has increased dramatically and it is not unusual to see students carrying slabs of beer out of off-licences on Tuesday and Thursday evenings.  This will impact on our health services because, while bar owners decide when a customer has consumed sufficient alcohol, there is no such control over people who drink at home.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A series of reports on alcohol consumption have been produced since the 1960s by the Commission on Liquor Licensing, the advisory council on health promotion and the national council on alcoholism.  However, the problems appear to have increased in the past ten years.  According to one recent report, 8,000 people presented with drinking problems in one year.  Each of these individuals will affect ten people, which means that more than 80,000 people are directly or indirectly affected by problem drinking.</P>
        <P>The price of alcohol in Ireland has decreased and it has become more accessible.  It is important that we approach the issue in a constructive manner and the motion before the <Col N="468"/>House is the appropriate way to deal with it.  Below cost selling is certainly not helping.  We must put in place more severe restrictions to ensure that if people want to buy alcohol, they will have to pay the price for it.  There is also the issue of taxation and whether we should seriously consider tax on alcohol.  If people are consuming a large amount of alcohol, the net cost is to the State in real terms.  As my colleague said, the accident and emergency departments have to provide the after-care in many cases and that is a direct cost to the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>It is time to change the existing regulations.  Now is the appropriate time to review the matter and to move forward on it.  I formally second the proposal put forward by my colleague.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I compliment the Fine Gael Party on tabling this motion.  It is a comprehensive motion dealing with far more than the price of drink.  It outlines the alcohol related health issues, crime levels and so forth.  It is not just a matter of how alcohol affects the people who abuse it but how society in general is affected by it through anti-social behaviour, which we have seen so often, and alcohol related crimes, which are becoming far more prevalent.  We need only consider the number of stabbings, killings and so forth that take place at house parties, and alcohol is very much a factor in those.  It is timely, therefore, to examine this issue and how society has changed.</P>
        <P>Senator Colm Burke correctly said that we have gone from a pub culture to where drink is brought to the private house, where there is no control mechanism.  I am not talking about social drinking but the large amounts of alcohol being consumed by young people.  I travelled through a village recently in the middle of the day and I was very surprised to see a group of young men loading a number of six packs into a supermarket trolley to bring them to their cars.  They were obviously going to a party but it certainly did not appear to me to be social drinking.</P>
        <P>It is important not to wait for a knee-jerk reaction.  I recall the very sad case in Dublin in which a young man was killed outside a nightclub.  Subsequently, there was legislation in response to that.  However, on the day after that crime virtually every mainstream newspaper carried an editorial concerning the abuse of alcohol, using that incident as an example.  I am not saying the killing would be normal or prevalent but there are many such cases.  When I spoke in the Seanad in the days following that very sad tragedy I said it would be gone off the radar the following week, and it was.  That is the reason this motion is so important &mdash; it is not a knee-jerk reaction to a particular incident, but a focus on what we, as legislators, should endeavour to do.</P>
        <P>This motion would not have been brought forward seven to ten years ago.  One of the reasons is that we tended to treat the abuse of alcohol in a jocose manner.  It was the stock in trade of every comedian to talk about the drunk.  What we were missing, was what was happening behind that scenario, such as the broken homes, the violence in homes, young people&rsquo;s lives destroyed and the homeless people who once had homes but were now winos out on the street.  That was the real story, but we ignored it.  Perhaps we culturally ignored it because of our traditions in that regard.  This motion, therefore, would not have been brought forward ten years ago.  I genuinely believe a sincere effort is now being made to do what is right, and in a balanced way.</P>
        <P>None of us is preaching about alcohol.  We are talking about the abuse of alcohol, which is a different matter.  In that context, we are prepared to give consideration to the fact that alcohol is an industry as well as being a social instrument.  We accept that.  However, at times I would have expected a greater response from the industry, in the same way that legislators gave a response.  When legislation was required on smoking, for example, which is a drug like alcohol, we were prepared to grasp the nettle.  There was huge opposition to what was being done but everybody knew that secondary smoking was harmful to individuals.  We owed the legislation <Col N="469"/>to the rest of society.  We passed that legislation and it is working.  People responded by looking after the rights of smokers as well.  There is no advertising of cigarettes.  I recall being taught in drama classes how to use one&rsquo;s hands, because all actors and actresses had a problem with that.  One was always given a cigarette.  If people look back at the many soap operas and well known films, they will see all the actors smoking.</P>
        <P>The same is happening now with drink.  Watch &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo;, &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; or &ldquo;Eastenders&rdquo;.  Each one of them sets most of their scenes in a pub.  I am not arguing against that but against the glorification of drink.  A great effort was made with the supermarkets.  There are ten or 11 supermarket chains that agreed a regulatory approach to the display and sale of drink.  The report from that body has just been released for the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter.  There is an independent monitoring body to ensure that these businesses fulfil their commitments as to where they place the drinks and how much advertising they do.  They can only spend 25% of their advertising on drink.  I spoke to the chairman of this body today and I understand this approach is working.</P>
        <P>We should now examine the advertising of drink.  We could do without it.  Drink will still be sold.  We should try to separate it from victory in sport and so forth.  I recall seeing some very young men filling a trophy with drink after a game.  That is not necessary.  They will get their drink but that is associating the role models with drink.  We should seriously examine that issue.  Crime is a serious issue associated with drink.  As with drugs, abusing alcohol leads to irresponsible actions.  There is a tribal aspect to large numbers of people drinking together and, unfortunately, decent good young people get caught up in that unwittingly, not seeing the dangers attached to it.  For that reason we must consider education.  We have looked at education in other areas, such as for safe driving.  When there are car accidents we tend to lower speed limits and the limits on the amount of drink one can consume.  Can we not see the same situation here?  We should learn from what we did in those areas.  We grasped the nettle and were prepared to take a stand.  From the education point of view, we must extend it into the schools.</P>
        <P>I was delighted recently to see so many young people setting up No Name clubs, where alcohol is not available.  However, I recall a survey being conducted about four years ago in a particular part of Ireland which endeavoured to find out at what age young people started to drink.  The vast majority had started at the age of 13 years, and they were drinking hard spirits.  The alarm bells are ringing.  Fine Gael has taken a step today and legislators are prepared to come together on this issue.  I believe society in general will thank us, as will young people in the long term.  I commend Fine Gael for this motion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this issue because, until recently, I worked in services that dealt with alcohol addiction.  I have seen at first hand what alcohol misuse can do.  By the same token, many people enjoy a drink and when Members debate alcohol policy, they should not move to a position by which they take polar opposites of the extreme or are perceived as being fundamentalists in favour of one argument or another.  Instead, they should add some balance to the issue.  The problem with alcohol arises when it begins to have a negative effect on work, family relationships, health or the ability to live a happy life.  That is when alcohol becomes problematic for people.  I also note the economic cost of alcohol to the State with regard to lost hours in employment, the impact on the health and criminal justice services and the number of road deaths.  There is hardly any area in which alcohol misuse is not felt.  Most people will agree that as a society, Ireland has a rather unhealthy relationship with alcohol and it is more than simply an individual problem.  Moreover, the reasons for this are profound and probably are not amenable to a single or simple solution.  It is clear that if the reasons explaining this society&rsquo;s relationship with <Col N="470"/>alcohol are complex, any policy response put forward must be equally complex and must be multi-stranded.  Any proposed single solution is doomed to failure from the outset because it will fail to recognise the complexity of the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As for some of the more startling effects, one can point to road deaths and that alcohol misuse is indicated in up to 40% of deaths by suicide.  When discussing alcohol misuse, it also is important not to try to identify a particular cohort of the population as being the problem.  There is a tendency to see young people as the problem in respect of anti-social behaviour and associated matters.  However, having worked in this area for 25 years, my perception is that in our society, it is the more mature people, in terms of age, who present with the mostproblematic behaviour.  It is insidious and under the radar and is not often seen but it must be identified.</P><P Just="Left">In addition, I note the strength of the drinks industry in advertising and lobbying and acknowledge the extent to which alcohol is ingrained in our culture.  Virtually all events that are celebrated and even some events that are not appear to revolve around alcohol.  When Members hear arguments made by particular lobby groups, they should be somewhat suspicious when the proposed solutions put forward by such groups coincide with the best interests of those groups.  It is important to point this out.</P>
      
	<P Just="Left">Whatever solution is proposed, Members will hardly solve the problem today in a two hour debate. I join Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; in commending Fine Gael for tabling this motion.  It is a good place to start, as one must start somewhere.  While reports have been written on this issue repeatedly for 20, 40 and 100 years, we still appear to be calling for more reports.  I commend the Minister of State on grasping a nettle and facing up to the problem and I ask that something be done about it.  The problem must be confronted in all its complexity and Members must be brave in the face of those who stand to gain from maintaining the <i>status quo</i>.  In addition, Members must act decisively and recognise the need for all dimensions of this debate to be confronted.  As it is known that advertising affects drinking patterns, the means and location of alcohol advertising must be considered.  It is a real problem and even to begin exploring that avenue would open a can of worms.</P>
        <P>While I hope never again to be heard in agreement with the former Minister,Michael McDowell, he was right to suggest that Ireland needs to change its culture regarding alcohol.</P><P Just="Left">Moreover, his idea of introducing caf&eacute; bars certainly is worth exploring.  However, matters will not change overnight but in incremental steps over a long journey.  The step proposed in this motion constitutes the first step in that journey.  If one approaches the issue by suggesting that minimum pricing alone will solve the problem, it will not.  However, it will solve it as part of a package of other measures that could be introduced.  I refer to an interesting study carried out by the University of Sheffield on minimum pricing in Scotland.  While the authors added the important proviso that the findings were specific to Scotland, the study found that minimum pricing is effective, but only when prices are substantially increased.  Moreover, the more they are increased, the more effective it becomes.  It also showed that drinkers sometimes switch from one drink to another to compensate for this.  In addition, it showed that reductions occurred in all harm related areas.  Rates of alcohol related crime and absenteeism fromwork have fallen, as has the rate of health related harm.  Moreover, there is a corresponding saving in health care costs.  It certainly looks like a promising area to explore and I would welcome it.</P>

	<P>One minute remains to the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I could talk all day about this subject.  There are obstacles in the path to the introduction of minimum pricing and I wonder whether it should be approached by way of taxation.  If so, how would one differentiate between alcohol products, such as standard and premium beers for instance, and how would the taxation system capture that difference?  If it is not intended to use taxation to implement this measure, would one be adding to the profits of the drinks industry?  This might have the unintended consequence of providing that industry with greater resources for promotion and advertising, which brings one back to the circle of advertising and drink.  While several issues arise, I did a considerable amount of work on this subject in another policy research area last year and on balance I am in favour but again only as part of a package of other measures.</P>
        <P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach will forgive me for exceeding my time.  A cultural change and shift is what is needed.  I certainly will support the Minister of State in this regard and I welcome the position to which she has moved.  While it has taken a long time to move to that position, we have been talking about it for too long and it is now time to do something about it.  I congratulate the Minister of State and I look forward to working with her on this matter.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" Just="Left">Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" /> accepts that we need to enforce a minimum price for alcohol, based on the price per unit of alcohol;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that selling very cheap alcohol is an incentive to the purchase of alcohol;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that excessive consumption of alcohol is damaging for the health of individuals;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that the average age for a first drinking experience is declining;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" /> recognises that very cheap alcohol can be damaging for individuals, families and communities; and</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" /> recognises that alcohol-related crimes have risen in the decade from 2001 to 2011.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and her stated commitments on this issue.  I also thank the Fine Gael Members, in particular Senators Noone and Colm Burke, for tabling this Private Members&rsquo; motion.  It addresses the issue of alcohol related harm.  This is not a pro or anti-alcohol discussion but pertains to alcohol related harm.  It is estimated that the cost to the State in 2007 was approximately &euro;3.7 billion which, if translated into the cost per taxpayer, is &euro;3,318.  Moreover, the profound societal ramifications of the harmful use of alcohol in Ireland makes it imperative this problem be tackled in a determined, concerted and swift fashion.</P>
        <P>The motion as tabled correctly recognises that alcohol related crimes have risen in the past decade.  This is supported by recent analysis from the Garda PULSE system, which recorded a 30% increase in alcohol related crimes between 2003 and 2007.  It also showed the total number of offences among minors increased in the observed period by a staggering 54%.  According to the same data, the 18 to 24 year group was responsible for two fifths of offences, while figures for those under 18 constitute 17% of offences, which is a matter of concern to me.  As for the <Col N="472"/>issue of harmful use of alcohol during pregnancy, it has a proven association with impaired foetal brain development, impaired intellectual development and cognitive and behavioural dysfunctions that can restrict educational attainment and stifle future development in life.</P>
        <P>As previous Members have stated, the harmful use of alcohol can result in substantial economic costs or in the cost of labour market productivity.  It has been suggested that absenteeism has cost Irish businesses &euro;1.5 billion per year.  A recent survey by IBEC found that alcohol was blamed by employers as the primary reason for 4% and 1% of short-term absences from work by their male and female employees, respectively.  In respect of the health and health care cost implications, alcohol liver disease rates and deaths have almost trebled between 1995 and 2007.  Among the 15 to 34 year age group, the rate of deaths from alcohol liver disease has increased by 247%.  Seven out of ten men and four out of ten women who drink do so in a manner that is damaging to their health.  Moreover, a total of 10% of general inpatient costs, 14% of psychiatric hospital costs, 7% of GP costs and up to 30% of emergency health care costs are alcohol related.  Each night in Ireland, 2,000 hospital beds are occupied for alcohol related reasons.</P>
        <P>I refer to the issue of children and the indirect impact of alcohol, as well as its direct impact.  According to the recent report launched by the Minister of State, entitled Hidden Realities: Children&rsquo;s Exposure to Risk from Parental Drinking in Ireland, 587,000 children are regularly exposed to risk from parental hazardous drinking.  The harmful use of alcohol in the home is associated with increased incidences of verbal and physical abuse, witness to violence, neglect, isolation and insecurity.  The exposure of children to risk from parental alcohol problems is amplified by the significant burden children bear, such as a care role reversal and keeping secret the problem, which has a great cost to the child concerned in respect of school and developmental life.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Fine Gael for incorporating the proposals that were put forward by Senator Crown and myself in our amendment, which I appreciate.  I would like the programme to be added for the following reason.  The latest HSE alcohol awareness campaign, for example, speaks of the weekly standard drinks allowance, which is 14 units for adult women and 21 for adult men, and advises that one standard drink is equivalent to 10 g of pure alcohol.  As my understanding is that the standard drink measurement will be reconverted back to grams across the board, I propose this amendment to pre-empt this change.</P>
        <P>With regard to below cost selling, I thank Fine Gael for adding the words &ldquo;and very cheaply&rdquo;.  This is a specific pricing strategy.  It is important to note that &ldquo;very cheap alcohol&rdquo; is a term that is preferred by quite a number of organisations, such as Alcohol Action Ireland, Barnardos, Focus Ireland, No Name clubs, Rape Crisis Network Ireland, the Ballymun Local Drugs Task Force, the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation, the Irish Medical Organisation, the ISPCC, the National Youth Council of Ireland and the North West Alcohol Forum.  It is also supported by the Vintners Federation of Ireland.  I welcome the amendment and the harmony we have reached.</P>
        <P>The reason I had a difficulty with the term &ldquo;below cost selling&rdquo; is that there is no agreed definition of how to calculate and define cost pricing.  It still allows alcohol to be sold very cheaply, given that the unit cost can be varied by the retailer depending on a number of factors.  It is not clear that, if a below cost selling plan was put in place, it would be sufficient to reduce alcohol consumption and, therefore, would not necessarily have the desired impact.  There are also difficulties in monitoring, compliance and securing convictions for below cost selling.  In fact, if one looks back, this was one of the key reasons behind the repeal of the groceries order in 2006.  The price is not linked to the strength of the drink as it does not relate to the number <Col N="473"/>of units or grammes of alcohol the drink contains.  I appreciate the addition of the words &ldquo;and very cheaply&rdquo;, which will address my concerns and will achieve what I believe is everybody&rsquo;s intention in this motion.</P>
        <P>What has been said by all speakers is important.  This is not just one measurement which looks at pricing.  We need to look at culture as well as the enforcement of our current laws.  There are many laws in place that can be enforced in regard to drink driving and many other issues.  We must look at advertising and marketing, including social marketing.  I was shocked to see that when my nephews are on YouTube and Facebook, they get very different advertisements to the ones I get.  Twelve year olds are regularly seeing drinks advertising on their screens whereas I do not get these on my screen, which tells us something about who these products are being marketed at.  It is also about protecting children who are indirectly impacted by alcohol.  As noted in the motion, pricing is an issue in this regard.</P>
        <P>In the cause of harmony in the House, I thank Members for working together.  This is good for the Seanad.  It should be a first step in addressing the harmful effects of alcohol and the price it has for us in Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the amendments.</P>
	<P Just="Left">An interesting exercise occurred last week.  We were in a session of the Joint Committee on Health and Children with representatives of the alcohol industry and also representatives of <Col N="474"/>Alcohol Action Ireland who were concerned about the toll alcohol takes of our society.  An illustrative point was to ask what would their attitude be to the notion that Ireland would be a better country if everybody stopped drinking completely tomorrow and gave up alcohol entirely.  I am quite certain that if alcohol were discovered for the first time tomorrow, it would not be allowed and would be banned, purely on grounds of carcinogenicity.</P>
        <P>Another fact we must bear in mind is where we are in terms of alcohol consumption in Ireland by international standards.  The situation is quite extraordinary.  As someone who worked in the health services of other countries outside Ireland for many years and took a good deal of good-natured ribbing about the Irish reputation for alcoholic excess, I used to be always able to defend us by saying &ldquo;But you do know that here in the United Kingdom you have more alcoholic liver disease than we have&rdquo; and &ldquo;Here in the US you have a greater consumption of alcohol than we have.  We are not actually that bad&rdquo;.  That is the way it was, as we were fairly low down the league tables for alcohol consumption by international standards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The strange and rather sad point is that as soon as we got a few bob during the years of our economic advance, it appears we spent quite a bit of it on alcohol, because we suddenly rocketed towards the top of charts on which we used to occupy mid-table positions.  For example, France would have had approximately 20 litres of alcohol consumption per head of population for some 30 years, which has since reduced to approximately 14 litres.  Over roughly the same period, our consumption has between doubled and tripled, so that we are roughly neck and neck with France and, depending on some statistics, we may be ahead of it.  It is clear there is, in absolute terms, a dramatic change in alcohol consumption in this country.  Much of what we have regarded as being the health consequences of alcohol excess we have not yet seen because it will take quite a few years for them to reach fruition, based on the newer consumption figures which occurred during the 1990s.</P>
        <P>Hypothetically, what would happen if everybody in Ireland decided collectively to take the pledge tomorrow &mdash; if we all gave up alcohol in its entirety?  The first thing that would happen is that we would have fewer road traffic accidents, fewer injuries and fewer deaths &mdash; I do not think anybody would dispute that.  We would have fewer assaults, less domestic violence and fewer rapes.  The murder rate would go down.  There would be a dramatic decrease in the demand for accident and emergency services, with the spin-off benefit of a dramatic decrease in waiting list times for other elective aspects of our health system, which are currently bunged up by people coming in with alcohol-related emergencies.  I can speak with authority when I say there would be a decrease in the incidence of cancers of the head and neck, of the oesophagus and of the pancreas.  We have recently discovered there is a link between alcohol and breast cancer, so if everybody stopped drinking, the level of breast cancer would reduce, perhaps by as much as one third.</P>
        <P>We must also factor in the opportunity costs, in that all the money we spend on alcohol at a time when we do not have much money could be spent on other things.  This affects every family that is spending money on alcohol when there are recessionary pressures.  While I believe most families are extremely responsible to the pin of their collars in using their money as responsibly as they can for the benefit of their children, the reality is there would be more money available for family finance, food, clothing and education.  There is a substantial opportunity time cost of alcohol consumption.  Parents would have more time for good parenting and likely would do it better.  There are substantial economic arguments, some of which we have heard in terms of the implications for employment.</P>
        <P>There really is not any good argument for us to continue drinking, but we will do it, because it is deeply ingrained in our culture and our own personal psychology, so, I guess, we must all define the parameters of our own relationship with alcohol, if we consume it.  However, we can <Col N="475"/>as a society do our level best to ameliorate its worst effects and to discourage and disincentivise alcohol consumption among younger people.</P>
        <P>A similar point arose many years ago with regard to tobacco.  All of the arguments which are advanced in favour of alcohol are spurious, except for the argument that we do it because it is fun and gives us pleasure &mdash; that is the only one that is valid, which people must honestly admit.  All of the arguments that it facilitates socialisation or that the mild relaxation effects might help to disinhibit people who might otherwise not have the opportunity to engage others in conversation are all spurious arguments.  It is addiction thinking, which is very reminiscent of the same arguments that were advanced in favour of tobacco, such as &ldquo;Sure, won&rsquo;t the few cigarettes relax me&rdquo; and &ldquo;I would get a heart attack if I did not have them&rdquo;.  We now know that is total nonsense.  All of the social benefits which occur with alcohol would be available in different social fora without alcohol.</P>
        <P>What we should be aiming for as a society is less alcohol consumption.  Clearly, we need to do a whole array of things which will decrease the amount of alcohol we collectively drink.  At the committee last week we interacted with members of two representative organisations, the Vintners Federation of Ireland and the Alcoholic Beverage Federation of Ireland.  There have been few occasions in my life when in the course of a one or two hour meeting, my attitudes hardened more.  I went in thinking I was in favour of a gentle ban on broadcast advertisements for alcohol and nothing else but I came out thinking these people were the enemy.  We have to tackle them and we have to refute all the arguments they advance.  Collectively, it is our responsibility as representatives of our society to do all we can to ensure people drink less and drink responsibly.  The arguments they advanced were that we can drink just as much as we do, if not more, and as long as we do so responsibly, we can ameliorate the social effects.  That is not true.  We need to drink less and to set ourselves against the wind with an ambitious agenda to ban all alcohol advertising.  We cannot allow companies to profit from encouraging people to do something that is bad for them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The pricing issues, correctly raised in our amendment by Senator van Turnhout, must be addressed.  I am delighted we have had a high measure of co-operation with the amendment.  We also need, as many colleagues have pointed out, to look into our own souls, examine our own attitudes to this drug and try to do what we can to set a major decline in alcohol consumption over the next five to ten years as an ambitious national goal.  I thank everyone for the cross-party support for the motion.  This is a critically important health issue we all need to deal with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ImeldaHenry"><NameTxt>Senator Imelda Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  She is committed to dealing with this issue.  She attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children several weeks ago on this issue and I was impressed by her presentation.</P>
        <P>Six years ago, the breakdown of alcohol consumption in Ireland comprised 70% in pubs on-trade 30% off-trade in supermarkets and off-licences while today the breakdown is 45% on-trade and 55% off-trade.  There are many reasons for this, including lifestyle changes, legislation directed particularly at the on-trade rather than the off-trade and general economic circumstances.  The single biggest factor has been the abolition of the groceries order, which has allowed supermarkets in particular to sell alcohol at the prices they do.</P>
        <P>The reason we have irresponsible drinking is price and availability.  Children as young as 11 are drinking.  I feel strongly about having an effective education programme in all our national schools to make children aware of the dangers of alcohol.  The North West Alcohol Forum Limited, a non-governmental organisation, does excellent work in this regard.  It was established to work in partnership with all sectors, including health, justice, community and education, to reduce hazardous drinking and its consequences among individuals, families and communities. <Col N="476"/> Steetwise for Life is the forum&rsquo;s national school programme.  Representatives go into sixth class and they also run another programme for first years in secondary school.  This has been rolled out only in County Donegal and the forum is trying to have the programmes rolled out in counties Sligo and Leitrim.  The Government needs to consider a national programme for primary schools to educate children about the dangers of alcohol, and I hope we will do this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Minimum pricing needs to be introduced and the Government also needs to implement section 9 of the 2008 Act which states that alcohol should be sold in a separate area with a separate entrance that is manned by a mature person.  The ministerial order for this was never signed.  It is important we try to ban price-based advertising and prohibit volume related promotions.  We should also consider the concept of a green tax on non-returnable bottles and cans.  While this would not guarantee a floor price, it would make it more difficult for the supermarkets to reduce their prices to the crazy levels we are witnessing.  The concept of the green tax would work on non-returnable bottles and cans and would operate similar to the plastic bag levy.  Research has highlighted that almost &euro;120 million could be generated annually by applying a 10 cent levy to cans and a 20 cent levy to bottles.  This is worthy of consideration in the context of the current debate that centres around the low price of alcohol in supermarkets.</P>
        <P>As Senator Gilroy stated, the Scottish Parliament recently published a Bill to introduce minimum pricing and similar legislation is also being considered in Northern Ireland.  As a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, I had talks with several of my Scottish colleagues about their plans in this regard.  I will keep in touch with them regarding their progress with that Bill.</P>
        <P>Minimum pricing will not penalise moderate drinkers, as it would have a marginal effect on them, but it would have a significant impact on consumers, especially young people, who have a problem with alcohol consumption.  The drinking habits of young people are price sensitive and alcohol is being sold at below cost in supermarkets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am involved in the pub trade and I was nominated to the House by the Vintners Federation of Ireland.  I was surprised last week that one of my colleagues declared in the House that he thought that it was inappropriate to have a representative in this House nominated by vintners.  The same Senator during his recent presidential campaign went to great lengths to emphasise how he has spent his political career representing the marginalised and his campaign rhetoric was big on the need for inclusion and for everyone having his or her voice heard.  He seems to have changed his mind on that.  I am a democrat and I believe in everyone having his or her voice heard regardless of whether he or she agrees with what I have to say.  The majority of publicans are responsible and we support minimum pricing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While people may say we have a vested interest, I remind Senator Crown there is a social aspect to this debate.  Perhaps people living in the greater Dublin area might not be aware of this as much as those of us living in rural Ireland but many older people in rural communities were used to going to their pub for one or two pints at most.  That was their routine.  They got to meet people in their communities and everyone knew that they were okay.  If they were not seen for a day or two, somebody would check on them.</P>
        <P>Senator Gilroy referred to caf&eacute; bars but we might have missed the boat in this regard because the good times are gone.  We cannot get people into pubs and, therefore, we are unlikely to get them into caf&eacute; bars.  This is a good motion.  Alcohol abuse is a major issue, particularly among young people, and I have faith in the Minister of State to move on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I also welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment her on the initiatives she has taken on substance abuse in general.  I wish her well.</P><Col N="477"/>
        <P>I am grateful to Senator van Turnhout for the amendment, which has been accepted by the Government, because it is significant.  I am also grateful to her for quoting many of the relevant statistics, which prevents me from having to repeat them.  This happens all the time and the fact that they are on the record is more important than who puts them there.  I presume most of the statistics come from Alcohol Action Ireland&rsquo;s pre-budget submission.  This is the national charity for alcohol related issues.  I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with the submission and that she will go into it in detail with her officials because it goes some way to signalling the direction in which the motion is attempting to go.</P>
        <P>I was struck by one statistic in the context of the current price of alcohol.  A woman can reach her low risk weekly drinking limit for only &euro;6.30 while a man can reach his for less than &euro;10, which is the equivalent of approximately one hour&rsquo;s work on the minimum wage.  Previous speakers have referred to alcohol induced social crime.  For example, 85% of Garda youth diversion projects put alcohol related crime first on the list of offences committed in their area and they state that affordability and accessibility are two of the key factors fuelling alcohol related youth crime.</P>
        <P>I always will defer to Senator Crown on health related issues.  I agree with him that if alcohol were discovered now, it would be banned.  However, I could not help but reflect on the Volstead Act which attempted to ban alcohol in the US in 1919.  Currently, the series, &ldquo;Boardwalk Empire&rdquo;, is running on Sky Atlantic and it has a strong Irish dimension.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">One might welcome that from a major television programme but then one realises it is just as much to do with alcohol, its abuse, the sale of illegal liquor and the consequences of the Volstead Act that brought in prohibition, which led to organised crime.  In a perfect world it would be great to have and I support the reasoning behind Senator Crown&rsquo;s comment and the evidence he used to back it up, but we are faced with a situation where this country, more than perhaps any other European country with the possible exception of Britain, has a reputation for binge drinking.  Unlike our European colleagues, we do not just drink, we drink until we are absolutely ossified.  There is a culture that has grown up among younger people that it is not enough to go out and enjoy oneself and have a few drinks, one must get absolutely out of it, which seems to be part of the rite of passage now.  Sadly, in my own family, I have 18, 19 and 21 year old children and they are drinking.  My wife is not into drink apart from the odd glass of wine and I never drank.</P>
        <P>In the pre-budget submission, the World Health Organization quoted from a statement it made in 2009 that there is indisputable evidence that the price of alcohol matters.  If the price of alcohol goes up, alcohol related harm goes down.  The same applies to cigarette consumption.  In Britain the Government promised prior to the election to tackle concerns about the rise of violence among drunk teenagers and while in opposition, the Conservative Party promised to call time on drinks that fuel anti-social behaviour.  Sadly, the most recent initiative has not gone down well and the British Government seems to have taken its foot off the pedal.  A number of spokesmen said the partial restrictions on low cost selling show the Government accepts cheap drink is the main driver of health damage and these restrictions will ease it in the right direction to make a practical difference.  Don Shenker from the Alcohol Concern campaign said, however, that the measure would not go far in resolving binge drinking and that the Government must look again at a minimum price per unit of alcohol.  That is the only evidence-based approach that will end cheap discounts once and for all.  In that context, there is a revealing statistic from 2009 in Britain, and I assume the same is true here, that revealed the main supermarkets were selling beer cheaper than mineral water, at 5p per 100 ml, triggering claims that such rock bottom prices fuel binge drinking.</P>
        <P>I agree with the sentiment on all sides that we must address the culture that exists.  This is not simply about putting initiatives in place, it is about a culture and we must have an holistic <Col N="478"/>approach.  It is a slow burner, it will not happen overnight and I presume that is part of the Minister of State&rsquo;s mandate &mdash; to induce a change in that culture.  In that context I compliment the Gaelic Athletic Association, which in recent weeks has initiated an alcohol and drug abuse programme and has appointed a national officer, Mr. Colin Regan, a former intercounty player from my county.  He will work out of Croke Park but the organisation is also appointing similar officers at county board level throughout the country.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that while the GAA has been criticised about Guinness sponsoring the national hurling championship, there is much more tolerance for Heineken supporting rugby competitions.  The word is nearly embedded in our culture, with the Heineken Cup serving to associate the sport with drink.  The advertising is highly creative but it feeds into a conditioning process that somehow associates playing rugby, playing a manly sport, and I use that term in a genderless context because women play rugby as well, with drinking Heineken.</P>
        <P>I agree totally with an outright ban on advertising.  I thought it was happening but it seems the drinks industry has managed somehow to secure a compromise and that such advertising will continue.  I thought thresholds and restrictions would be put in place.  I agree with Senator Crown that all alcohol advertising should all be banned, the price of alcohol should put up sky high and, on the basis of evidence, we might then make a start in tackling the abuse of this drug.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  One of the disadvantages of being far down the speakers list is that most people have cited the statistic I intended to cite.</P>
        <P>I notice Senator Crown mentioned all the organs of the body with the exception of the liver and I was surprised he left it out given that it is probably one of the organs that suffers most from excess alcohol consumption.  I also support Senator Imelda Henry in her remarks.  We are well past the day when we all play cards around the fire while sipping cups of tea, and will not be going back to John Huston&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Dead&rdquo;, where we would stand around the upright piano or reciting improving poetry or singing songs.  Those days are gone and the reality is that Ireland historically has had a pub culture.  One of the sad things is that in the recent two decades we have moved away from the positive aspects of that pub culture to the negative aspects of cynical below cost selling on the part of some supermarket outlets.</P>
        <P>Much of this, however, is not due to the activities of supermarkets but of successive Governments milking the cash cow of excess duty on alcohol in pubs.  This is not such a narrow issue.  It is much broader and goes right to the fundamentals of Irish society.  I note that young people in Ireland take a much more positive attitude to the prohibition of drinking and driving so I would not like the impression to go out that young people are sitting around under the hedges throwing back bottles of vodka and naggins of Jack Daniels.  Education is an issue, not just of younger people but also of people of my generation and older who saw it as perfectly fit in the 1960s and 1970s to get into cars without thinking twice about driving down the road absolutely trolleyed.</P>
        <P>Some of the research mentioned points to the complete change in our culture.  As recently as 2003, 70% of drinking was done in pubs and clubs.  That figure has fallen dramatically and while I am completely in favour of the motion, we must be clearer in our thinking about how we address the impact of what has happened in recent years.  Aside from the fact that we know excess consumption of alcohol leads to significant health difficulties, it is a fact that excessive consumption of alcohol is related to depression.  At present we are living through the worst period the country has seen since the 1950s, and I include the 1980s in that.  I argue for a rebalancing.  I am totally in favour of the motion but we must look at what we are doing.  The term &ldquo;social inclusion&rdquo; is thrown around but the pubs of Ireland in the past were places where people could socialise and get involved in community activities.  They were positive contributing factors in society.  This is not just an issue in rural areas; there are vast tracts of urban areas <Col N="479"/>where the residents might as well be living on the outskirts of rural areas for all the potential that exists to socialise and interact.  We need to make it more affordable for people to socialise in rural pubs.  There is also a need to consider the issues or rural and urban transport.  We must take what was good about the past and what is negative with regard to the present and carry out a rebalancing exercise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Is m&oacute;r agam deis a fh&aacute;il labhairt ar an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo.  Mar duine a d&rsquo;oibrigh le daoine a bh&iacute;onn deacrachta&iacute; acu le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; alc&oacute;il, s&iacute;lim gur r&uacute;n iontach t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; an r&uacute;n seo.  Cuireann Sinn F&eacute;in f&aacute;ilte roimh na molta&iacute; at&aacute; sa r&uacute;n at&aacute; romhainn anocht.  In general, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the motion.  I have a particular interest in this area and I worked with a number of professionals in the west of Ireland in respect of it.  I am, therefore, very much aware of the problems to which alcohol can give rise.</P>
        <P>Not for the first time today, I must admit that I am obliged to agree with a great deal of what Senator Hayden said.  This is an extremely broad-ranging issue and, as a result, is very difficult to discuss alcohol-related matters separately from each other.  Alcohol abuse does not merely come down to the fact that people can go to their local supermarket and purchase cheap drink.  Such abuse relates to societal factors, to the backgrounds of those who engage in it, to the fact that some people are medically predisposed to drink alcohol and to difficulties in respect of financial or other personal matters.  We must engage in a broader debate on this matter.</P>
        <P>I spoke to a professional involved in this area in Galway and was informed that one of the biggest problems in that part of the country did not just relate to cheap alcohol but also to the mixing of such alcohol with certain caffeine-containing drinks.  The latter caused people to have blackouts and complete lapses of memory.  There is a need, therefore, to examine this issue in a much more wide-ranging fashion and everyone is aware that the debate in which we are engaged is extremely important.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to regurgitate some of the statistics that have already been put forward in respect of the harm which alcohol can cause.  It is not just the people who are involved in drinking who are affected; their immediate families, relatives, friends, work colleagues, etc., can also be affected.  Monday morning syndrome gives rise to huge rates of absenteeism in the workplace and also to major sorrow and anger on the part of those who are affected by it.  According to the North-West Alcohol Forum, one in every three child abuse cases involves alcohol.  That is a startling and terrifying statistic.  In addition, one is seven child welfare cases are alcohol related.  As a result of dealing with people in the areas in which they reside, I am sure other Senators can attest to the fact these statistics reflect reality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Alcohol is also a factor in many violent crimes and road accidents.  This is all linked to the fact that alcohol is being sold at extremely low prices and, in some instances, below cost.  Some 271,000 children under the age of 15 are exposed to risk as a result of parental drinking.  A total of 1.37 million adults, including 72.9% of 18 to 24 year olds, engage in hazardous drinking on a regular basis.  The numbers of those under 18 years of age who engage in such drinking is also likely to be quite high.  In such circumstances, I agree with Senator Mooney that this issue is extremely broad in nature and that we must deal with it in a wide-ranging way.  As someone who lives in a rural area, I am very aware of the latter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the caveats I have in respect of the motion is that it is very easy to focus on the selling of cheap alcohol.  There are certain people who are quite strapped for cash at present and who do not have the option of travelling to the nearest city, town or whatever in order to socialise.  As previous speakers indicated, there is no late-night transport system for such individuals.  We must ensure that any measures relating to the pricing of alcohol do not affect those on low incomes.  The fact that someone earns less money is no reason to deny him or her the possibility of being able to socialise or purchase &mdash; as is his or her right &mdash; an alcoholic beverage <Col N="480"/>in the local shop and enjoy drinking it at home because he or she does not have the option of going to a pub or a nightclub.  There is a need to ensure that the Government provides proper funding in respect of the rural transport programme and other public transport systems in order that people will have the option to socialise at night.</P>
        <P>In its 2010 strategy on reducing the harmful use of alcohol, the World Health Organization, WHO, calls for special attention to be paid to reducing harm to people other than drinkers and to populations, including children, that are at particular risk.  Sinn F&eacute;in is in wholehearted agreement with this and has consistently attempted to ensure that the sale of alcohol, North and South, should be properly regulated and secure.  We have continually argued against below-cost selling and made strenuous efforts and attempts to both highlight and stop it.  We have also been extremely active in campaigning against the cash-on-delivery sale of alcohol.  Sinn F&eacute;in is of the view that addressing the impact of alcohol on public health must be the major imperative and determining factor influencing the Department of Health and other Departments.  Like the broader community, we recognise that alcohol is not merely another tradeable commodity.</P>
        <P>Worldwide medical evidence demonstrates that alcohol, unlike benign or healthful products, is a drug that, when misused, is second only to tobacco use as a preventable cause of death and hospitalisation.  The direct and indirect costs of alcohol misuse are well documented and while there is a clear onus on individuals to ensure they use alcohol wisely, there is also a very clear responsibility to have controls in place and adequate preventive measures to warn people &mdash; particularly the young &mdash; of the long-term effects of binge or heavy drinking.  There has been a marked change in the patterns of drinking among young people in particular during the past ten years and statistics show that increasing numbers of them are misusing alcohol.  Children as young as 11 have already begun drinking and Ireland has one of the highest levels of binge drinking among 15 to 16 year olds in Europe.</P>
        <P>Alcohol misuse can lead to a number of problems for the individuals concerned, their families and the community in general.  Young people are more vulnerable to suffering physical, emotional and social harm from drinking alcohol and it can lead to their having mental health problems or becoming involved in antisocial activity.  In some instances, it can lead to their committing more serious crimes.  Alcohol Action Ireland has raised a number of points, with which I concur, regarding the need to deal with pricing in order that we might tackle the issue of consumption.  This issue was also raised in the WHO framework strategy, which sets out a number of objectives for the reduction of harmful use of alcohol, in particular reducing its use among the young.  This follows on from previous European alcohol action plans which made similar points.</P>
        <P>Successive action plans have recommended particular actions in order to achieve the outcomes to which I refer.  These include: developing a taxation policy which will ensure a high real price of alcohol, taxation based on alcohol volume &mdash; that is, higher taxes on alcoholic beverages with a higher alcohol content &mdash; and the provision of non-alcoholic beverages at low prices; using alcohol taxes to fund alcohol control activities, including health education, research into alcohol policy, and support to health services at both local and national levels; and controlling the availability of alcohol by restricting, or at least keeping in check, the number of outlets where alcohol is sold under licensing laws, limiting the number of licences and restricting hours of sale.  It would be great if the Minister of State could indicate the extent to which we have succeeded in complying with the WHO&rsquo;s strategy framework and make a statement in respect of the recommendations to which I refer.</P>
        <P>Alcohol can often be purchased at a price which is lower than that charged for bottled water.  This is very worrying and requires serious consideration.  What sort of message does it send out that for the same price as it would cost to attend a football match, a person can purchase <Col N="481"/>16 or 18 cans of beer or several litres of cider?  As someone who has experience of close friends and neighbours being affected by severe alcoholism, I am conscious of the fact that much of what we are discussing is extremely subjective in nature.  It is difficult to pinpoint who will or will not become an alcoholic.  As a result, it is important that the State should put in place every support possible in order that we might assist those who get into trouble with alcohol.  Anecdotal evidence indicates that the number of centres at which people can &ldquo;dry out&rdquo; is far too small.  The supports available through the alcohol and drug addition services are simply not adequate in the context of dealing with the demand, particularly that which exists among young people.  We do not really have any centres which are dedicated to dealing with young people who have problems with alcohol.  There may be one or two such centres but as far as I am aware there are only ten or 20 places available at these facilities.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; s&eacute; iontach t&aacute;bhachtach go rachaimid i ngleic leis an gceist seo.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go bhfuil an r&uacute;n seo os &aacute;r gcomhair inniu.  Caithfimid dul i ngleic leis na deacrachta&iacute; i measc an phobail freisin.  There have been cutbacks in the local development social inclusion programme.  In rural and disadvantaged areas, it is extremely important that young people in particular are encouraged to remain active.  They must be given something to do and funding must be provided in respect of sports clubs, community activities, etc.  If these individuals are not involved in either gainful employment or a particular activity, they can tend to band together into groups and become involved in drinking.  It is important that in the upcoming budget the Government should put forward measures which will assist young people &mdash; specifically those in disadvantaged communities &mdash; to remain in education, create employment for them and provide single parents and others with access to the labour market.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I warmly welcome the tabling of the motion which has received cross-party support.  I thank all of the contributors to the debate so far.  I have noted all of the points made and can assure Senators that in terms of the ongoing work we are doing, they will be taken into consideration.</P>
        <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to outline the position of the Government on the availability and misuse of alcohol.  The debate is timely because there is widespread concern about the misuse of alcohol.  We have reached the point where everybody recognises that it is a serious national problem and that it is time we did something effective and comprehensive about it.  I am heartened by the number of conferences held in recent times and the manner in which they have contributed to a public debate on the issue.  People realise we cannot continue as we are, that alcohol is doing serious damage to society &mdash; to individuals, families and communities.  There is a strong view among the public that it is time to stop and take a more mature and sensible approach to alcohol and face up to what become a national problem.</P>
        <P>We have been dealing with a significant increase in the number of outlets selling alcohol.  A relaxation of the licensing law resulted in alcohol being available on every street corner, in every filling station, supermarket and convenience store.  The widespread availability of alcohol is a key factor in terms of its abuse.  We need to deal with this proliferation of outlets because if we do not and we ignore the body of evidence that suggests this is a key factor in the abuse of alcohol, we will merely be putting our heads in the sand.</P>
        <P>Irish adults drink in a more dangerous way than adults in any other country, a fact that requires further consideration.  A number of Senators have spoken about our psychological <Col N="482"/>difficulties with alcohol, on which I would like to see research done.  Whether it is alcohol abuse, drug abuse or the abuse of prescription drugs, we seem to be top of the league.  While such elements as availability and price are a factor, there are underlying reasons for this which I would like to see researched.  I do not know whether it is that we have an inferiority complex, whether it is something about the Irish psyche or our history, but for some reason we do not seem to be able to handle alcohol as well as people in similar countries.</P>
        <P>Irish adults drank almost 12 litres of pure alcohol <i>per capita</i> last year &mdash; a volume that would be elevated further if one took into consideration that approximately 20% of the population do not drink alcohol.  The average per alcohol drinker is even higher.  Ultimately, 1.5 million Irish drinkers drink in a harmful way.  That is an extraordinary statistic, given that the population is approximately 4.5 million.  Data from relevant surveys indicate that the average age of first alcohol use among children has decreased considerably.  This is a worrying trend for society, particularly parents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I commented during the week at another event, parents need to consider why their children are drinking so much.  One of the items we need to address is that we, as parents, may not be giving our children the best example.  We are too used to having alcohol at the centre of our lives; it is part of every occasion and family celebration.  As adults, we need to consider this, not alone in terms of the damage we are doing to our own health but also in terms of the example we are giving to young people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is also a phenomenon whereby many adults facilitate young people in drinking.  There are concerns about young people drinking on the local green or in the park.  Because of that concern, parents sometimes facilitate the abuse of alcohol by their children in their homes.  In addition, there is also ambivalence about parents being worried in case their children get involved in drugs and saying, &ldquo;At least, it is not drugs; it is only alcohol.&rdquo;  That is a misguided attitude to take.</P>
        <P>All of these issues need to be addressed and we all are guilty of failing in that regard.  It is time for us all to consider these issues.</P>
        <P>The point has been made by a number of speakers that this is a problem for all us within Irish society.  It is easy to think it is a problem which affects the marginalised, for example, certain minority communities.  It is not.  It is one for all of us in Irish society and one we need to address on the basis of a whole-of-population approach.  We need to look at how we can break the cultural link between us as Irish people and alcohol.</P>
        <P>One must bear in mind that alcohol is no ordinary commodity.  For that reason, it is important when it is being sold in outlets that it be displayed in a way that recognises the potential dangers involved.  I am really concerned that, increasingly, there is an in-your-face display of alcohol when one goes into a corner shop, filling station or supermarket.  It is often difficult to avoid the high stacks of alcohol just inside the door.  We cannot regard it in the same way as bread, milk or butter.  It is a potentially dangerous commodity.  For that reason, I would like to see a much greater level of separation between alcohol and other products in retail outlets.</P>
        <P>Cost is a key factor in the abuse of alcohol.  The cost here is high, certainly in pubs.  People often ask, since its cost is higher than in many other countries, how come other European countdries do not have a problem to the same extent.  We have a cultural problem with alcohol.  Bearing this in mind, where cheap alcohol is available, particularly if the price declines constantly, this poses real problems for us in terms of an increasing volume of consumption across the population.  This is particularly true in the case of vulnerable groups, including young people.</P>
        <P>The question of a minimum price of alcohol is an important one.  Personally, I am committed to acting on this issue.  I am still awaiting legal advice and there is an indication that there <Col N="483"/>might be legal hurdles to get over.  However, I am heartened by developments in Scotland which is leading the way in this regard.  In the past two weeks legislation has been published there.  I have looked at some of the legal advice received and hope it will help us in approaching this issue.  I am also conscious of the need for us to work closely with the authorities in Northern Ireland.  To this end, I hope to meet the Minister, Mr. Poots, MLA, in the next couple of months.  We must all row in behind the issue of a minimum price as one of the important planks in addressing the misuse of alcohol.</P>
        <P>It is not my intention or that of the Government to penalise those who drink alcohol in moderation or who enjoy a bottle of wine at the weekend or a few cans of beer while watching a match.  Nobody is out to stop such enjoyment, as all of us enjoy alcohol.  There is nothing wrong with this where it is enjoyed in moderation.  Alcohol has its place with a nice meal.  However, the reality is that for too many in this country the volumes being consumed are at hazardous levels.  It is doing much damage, in particular to young people, and we need to address this.</P>
        <P>The point was made that we do not want to target people on low incomes.  The reality is that we all pay a very high price for alcohol abuse in this country.  A figure of &euro;3.7 billion was mentioned by a number of speakers.  This is the economic cost of alcohol abuse and everybody pays this through their taxes and additional charges.  We are not getting any great bargains with regard to alcohol.  We all pay a very high economic price for it.</P>
        <P>It is also important to point out that in the price war going on at present, the big supermarkets in particular use alcohol as a loss leader.  Recently, a supermarket was selling two bottles of red wine for &euro;5 where this &euro;5 does not even cover the cost of the excise duty or VAT, so the supermarket was taking a hit.  This is the scenario with which we are faced.  Alcohol is being used as a loss leader to attract people into shops.  This means the big multiples must recoup this loss elsewhere which results in higher prices for groceries and other products in the supermarket.  Therefore, it is no bargain and it is a false economy to think people are getting a bargain when they buy alcohol.  This is the thinking behind moving on a minimum price.  The point was also made that it is very difficult to detect what is below cost selling because of the level of discounting that takes place in the big multiples.  This is why we must think in terms of the minimum price per gram of alcohol in addition to excise duty and VAT.  This is the approach I would very much like to take and it is the right way to go.</P>
        <P>It is very important that we are clear about alcohol misuse in this country and what it does.  Alcohol is responsible for almost 100 deaths per month, and one in four deaths in young men were estimated to be due to alcohol.  Compare this with one in 12 deaths due to cancer or one in 25 due to cardiovascular disease.  We are at a point where it is not acceptable that young people should die of cancer.  We do not accept this and yet far greater numbers of young people die as a result of alcohol abuse than from many of the other main diseases.</P>
        <P>Alcohol is a contributory factor in half of all suicides and in deliberate self-harm.  It also increases the risk of more than 60 medical conditions including several cancers.  It is associated with 2,000 beds being occupied every night in Irish acute hospitals.  It is responsible for one quarter of injuries presenting to accident and emergency departments and more than half of attendances in  2008 to specialised addiction treatment centres.  It is associated with a range of disorders known as foetal alcohol spectrum disorders because of mothers drinking during pregnancy.  It is a factor in many unplanned pregnancies.</P>
        <P>Alcohol increases the risk of children needing special care, with the World Health Organization estimating that adult alcohol problems are associated with 16% of child abuse cases.  Alcohol was a trigger in one third of domestic abuse cases.  It is related to illness and costs the health service &euro;1.2 billion, and the cost of alcohol-related crime is estimated to be approximately &euro;1.2 billion.  The cost of lost economic output due to alcohol was estimated to be almost <Col N="484"/>&euro;500 million in 2007.  In addition, alcohol-related road accidents also cost approximately &euro;500 million.</P>
        <P>I was interested to see a conference was held last week on the impact of alcohol in the business community.  I hope we can move towards a situation where there will be much greater leadership in this regard from the business community.  We should not accept this is part of who we are and that a business must factor into costs a certain level of absenteeism or, to use the other term used at the conference last week, &ldquo;presenteeism&rdquo;, which is where workers are present at work but they are not conscious of what is going on or up to the job because of their alcohol abuse.</P>

	<P>All of these mean substantial additional costs for business.  Alcohol greatly reduces productivity and for this reason also we must tackle it.</P>
        <P>In 2009 the then Government established a steering group to examine this problem because it is long recognised that there is a problem and in recent times there has been a desire to address this.  A steering group was established which was chaired by the chief medical officer at the Department of Health and Children.  It comprises representatives of all of the relevant Departments and agencies and various interests including the alcohol industry.  I am not sure I would have included the industry in the steering group if I had established it myself but this is what we have to work with.  I was anxious that the steering group would complete its work because it was three quarters of the way through when the issue landed on my desk.  The group has been considering all aspects of our alcohol problem and it is putting the finishing touches to its report.  I will take this report and consider it, and it will form the basis of a comprehensive action plan to be drawn up by the Government to once and for all address our national problem with alcohol.</P>
        <P>The point has been made that minimum pricing on its own is not the solution and I do not suggest for one moment that it is a panacea.  It is an important element in the armoury for tackling the problem but we need to address the problem on many other fronts also.  I hope we will have an action plan at an early stage in the new year and that we can move forward in producing the legislation and discussing it in this House and the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>I am very much heartened by the cross-party support for taking serious action in this area.  People very much accept that we cannot delay any longer and that we need to tackle it and change our attitudes and behaviour towards alcohol.  Several weeks ago, I made a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and I know it has engaged in a series of meetings in this area.  I am convinced that every party and all independents are keen to move on this.  I hope to bring the report of the steering group to the joint committee so we can consider it, have additional input or recommendations, or add to the recommendations already made.  I hope we will be able to move forward early next year on a cross-party basis recognising the difficulties that alcohol causes and the huge damage it does on a personal and community level in the country and that we can come up with a comprehensive package.</P>
        <P>In addition to the cross-party political response, I hope other leaders in society will also get involved.  I am thinking in terms of employers&rsquo; groups, unions, churches and sporting bodies.  With regard to sporting bodies, the issue of the close correlation between sporting activity and alcohol abuse was raised.  Sporting activity is great and we all love watching it and many people participate but there is an issue in this regard.  We also need parents&rsquo; bodies to be involved.  As a society we need to address it in this comprehensive way.  I believe the time is right.  The motion is very timely and if we do as I expect we will shortly and have cross-party support and <Col N="485"/>a unanimous vote in favour of the motion it will send out a very clear signal.  It is a very important step for the Seanad to take, to show we are serious about tackling this problem and that we will do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the contributions of other Senators.  I have some concerns about the motion.  I was particularly interested in what Senator Gilroy stated.  This is an area where lobby groups have an inordinate influence and nothing that I say has anything to do with lobby groups.  I believe lobby groups should be compulsorily registered with the Cathaoirleach and the Ceann Comhairle.  I am concerned about the way the debate has proceeded.  We did not receive any numbers from the drinks industry.  We received information from the OECD yesterday which states that in 2001 alcohol consumption in Ireland was 14.4 units and in 2009 it had reduced to 11.3 units.  It is, therefore, 27% lower than it was, which corresponds to my experience.  Credit is due to the former Ministers Noel Dempsey and Martin Cullen, as well as the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for the reduced number of road deaths.  There used to be over 600 annually, but this year the number will be approximately 170.  I have seen empty pubs, and others are shutting down.  Senator Colm Burke mentioned what was happening in the vicinity of UCC and the same applies to TCD.  Caf&eacute; society is gaining; when offices shut down, they tend to reopened as caf&eacute;s or fast-food outlets.  If this presents a problem, we should have the up-to-date data.  If we were to receive incorrect data from the OECD, we would be delighted to change them.  In recent years, however, the figures have come down, probably because of the recession.  There has also been a change in culture.  As Government Senators mentioned, drink driving is utterly unacceptable to the present generation, for which I admire it hugely. </P>
        <P>According to the Central Statistics Office, the share of income we spend on drink is less than 3%.  The reduction in price since 2005 is about 3%, which is less than the reduction in prices in the economy as a whole because there is a recession.  If one did not cut the price, one would not be able to sell the stuff.  I wonder if concerns about a large decline in drink prices, leading to a massive increase in consumption, are borne out by the figures in recent years.  Ireland has changed dramatically, particularly in the case of the young, with whom it is my privilege to work and teach.</P>
        <P>The other point referred to in the motion concerns the relationship between youth crime and drink.  About 20% of the 4,000 crimes committed by juveniles this year have been drink related, according to the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s report.  There are, therefore, over 600,000 young people not involved in such activity.  We have real problems in banking, the provision of public services and with the public finances.  Unless we find the aforementioned statistics to be solidly based, a lot of national energy could be wasted on this matter.</P>
        <P>A minimum price for alcohol would enrich the suppliers, which I presume is not our intention.  It certainly is not mine.  Low prices are what we normally seek and I wish bodies in the energy sector were as good at lowering prices.  &ldquo;Below-cost selling&rdquo; is a legal term, for which the Competition Authority has responsibility.  I gather it is extremely difficult to prove and I am not so sure it has been.  There was below-cost selling by banks and we had to bail them out, but the drink companies which we believe are engaged in below-cost selling are still solvent and profitable.</P>
        <P>We have a belief, based on outdated numbers, that there is excessive alcohol consumption in Ireland.  However, the OECD estimates show the level is down by 27%.  It does not account for a major proportion of the household budget.  Many other items are increasing in price, an issue I had hoped the House would address.  Of course, very cheap alcohol can be damaging to individuals, but is the sale of drink in a corner shop, filling station or supermarket any more damaging than the sale of alcohol in pubs?</P><Col N="486"/>
        <P>Well over 100 years ago we persuaded the British Government that Ireland had a massive alcohol problem and the way to deal with it was to restrict the number of pub licences.  It did not make us any more sober, but it certainly made publicans far richer.  One must, therefore, be aware of false routes that we are invited to take.</P>
        <P>I have heard references to the position in Canada, Scotland and Northern Ireland &mdash; I have lived in all three &mdash; but I do not know why we chose these countries as role models.  Why not look at Italy and France as countries in which alcohol is consumed without dire consequences?  If there is co-operation with Northern Ireland, we will, undoubtedly, transfer the business back across the Border again, as happened before.</P>
        <P>A final thought concerns net receipts from excise duties between 2003 and 2009.  In that period receipts to the Minister for Finance from the sale of beer were down by &euro;51 million; from cider, &euro;3 million and from spirits, &euro;41 million.  Therefore, in these three categories the yield from excise duties was &euro;95 million less.  Meanwhile, wine sales yielded an extra &euro;75 million, a trend we have all noted.  The euro was worth far less in 2009 than in 2003, but on that basis, there was about &euro;20 million less coming in to the Exchequer in excise duties in that period.</P>
        <P>I would support the aims of those who tabled the motion if I could be persuaded that the level of alcohol consumption was still rising, which it is not.  We are told this is being caused by low prices, which do not show up in the consumer price index.  In addition, we are being told it is absorbing vast amounts of income, which is also not shown in the CSO data.  Are we blaming the commodity or do we have a problem in health and social services which we need to correct?  We need up-to-date data to discover what exactly has been happening since the start of the recession.  Young people&rsquo;s attitudes have changed; those of drivers have certainly changed.  They have moved away from pubs.  Is it damaging if people bring a drink home rather than having it in the pub?  I would prefer them to have it at home because they pose less of a danger to society there.  Let us not condemn everything that has happened in recent times.</P>
        <P>I apologise to the Minister of State for overrunning on time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  We are grateful to her for expressing such a strong commitment to taking action on this issue, about which there is a great deal of concern, which concern has been expressed across the House.  I commend Senator Noone and the Fine Gael group for tabling the motion.</P>
        <P>We all support Senator Barrett&rsquo;s call for an evidence-based policy on tackling alcohol abuse.  The Senator quoted some statistics.  OECD figures for the level of alcohol consumption do not include the large volumes bought in Northern Ireland and which would have to be acknowledged in any study of the problem.  I agree, however, that we need data and evidence on which to base a policy.  The Minister of State also made this point.  It is clear that there is great concern about, and growing evidence of, the harm caused by alcohol abuse.  Senator Gilroy and others, including the Minister of State, have pointed out that pricing is only one component of a harm-reduction policy, although it is clearly an important one.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment to have minimum retail pricing per gramme of alcohol, independent of excise duties, requires serious consideration.  There are at least three other components, however, including the advertising of alcohol and sponsorship of sports fixtures.  Other speakers have addressed these issues.  As a new Senator in 2007, I raised an issue which had been brought to my attention by a constituent from Trinity College, that is, the fact that alcohol companies were sponsoring football teams which were selling jerseys to children.  The <Col N="487"/>spectre of children walking around advertising alcohol companies on their jerseys was hard to take.  In fact, action was taken elsewhere to ban the practice and subsequently such jerseys were no longer sold here.  To me, however, it was a clear lesson on the need to tackle advertising to ensure there was a change in the culture of alcohol abuse.</P>
        <P>Clearly, the licensing laws need to be re-examined, as the Minister of State indicated.  Other speakers have also pointed to the need for such a change.  Our experience of licensing laws reform, however, has not been particularly constructive.  Often the reforms introduced, many of which we supported for the best reasons, had counter-productive effects.  For example, the ban on so-called &ldquo;happy hours&rdquo; &mdash; which was debated during the lifetime of the previous Seanad &mdash; has had the effect of bringing about day-long promotion of alcohol, whereby bars and clubs are seeking to circumvent the law.  Some bars are offering free haircuts with cheap drink to attract customers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Where are these bars?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very difficult to legislate in respect of such situations.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned that paternalistic laws of the sort we have had in the past have not had the effect of reducing consumption, lessening the harm caused to people or bringing down the level of abuse.  People have tended to binge drink because they see closing time as being imminent.  Restricting opening hours can sometimes have a counterproductive effect.  Again, we must examine the evidence in this regard.</P>
        <P>I fully concur with Senator Gilroy that it is unusual for either of us to be in agreement with the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, whose idea in respect of caf&eacute; bars represented a genuine attempt to try to change the culture that obtains here.  We do not have a very good history in the context of making pubs welcoming to families, children and people who want to have a meal and a glass of wine.  If we are concerned with culture change, we must promote the responsible use of alcohol.  We must consider how we might encourage people to take social drinks, in moderation and usually with food, rather than to engage in binge drinking as has been the case heretofore.</P>
        <P>The final matter to which I refer has not had much of an airing during this debate.  However, it was raised at the &ldquo;Alcohol &mdash; Where&rsquo;s the Harm?&rdquo; conference which the Minister of State opened yesterday and at which Alcohol Action Ireland &mdash; which sponsored the conference &mdash; presented research relating to people&rsquo;s experiences in respect of alcohol.  What struck me as I listened to what was said at the conference is the number of people who have gone out of their way to avoid drunken individuals or places which those who drink are known to frequent.  People&rsquo;s behaviour in taking public transport is changed by their fear of alcohol.  A large proportion of individuals or their families have experienced assaults in public spaces as a result of alcohol abuse by others.</P>
        <P>There is a need to factor in planning and spatial strategies when considering the matter of controlling or curbing alcohol abuse.  Dublin City Council is examining a spatial strategy to encourage families to visit city centre spaces to ensure that they will not become no-go areas as a result of the public consumption of alcohol by certain individuals.  Events such as the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day Festival have become associated with drink fuelled aggression and this is a matter which must be tackled in different ways.</P>
        <P>We need a culture change.  However, we must also examine the position with regard to the law on off-licences.  For a long period, the focus has been on controlling on-licence premises.  There is also a need to consider what happens in respect of the off-licence trade.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, who has displayed a warm and very genuine commitment in respect of this issue.  I was grateful to hear her give a commitment in respect of getting to the bottom of the problem of alcohol misuse.  There have been some <Col N="488"/>dark moments in our history and perhaps this is another such moment which we will be obliged to tackle.  As more people come on board and discuss the issue, it will be easier for us to deal with it.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the proliferation of outlets.  That is only matched by the proliferation in the number of young people on the streets, particularly late at night.  These individuals adopt certain methods to try to imbibe alcohol before they go somewhere else.  I spoke to someone recently who indicated that they had brought to a wedding a gift which they had placed under their seat.  It was not a gift at all, rather it was a bottle of alcohol that was to be consumed during the reception because the person in question was not prepared to pay the prices charged at the bar.  People are going to great lengths to drink in rather odd ways.</P>
        <P>If we are to deal with the culture of &ldquo;getting smashed&rdquo; which is prevalent among young people, we must seek to establish a relationship between the Departments of Health and Education and Skills.  When young people are given information relating to alcohol in their schools, it is presented in a very negative way.  They are informed as to what happens when one gets drunk, namely, that one will be arrested, one will become very ill, and so on.  It would be of major benefit if the two Departments could engage in a process of joined-up thinking to create some way of understanding young people and their wish to drink.  They must also consider how we might counter this wish in an intelligent, more long-term way as opposed to merely wagging the finger at young people and telling them not to drink.  That tends to have completely the wrong effect and encourages the young to do the exact opposite to what we have asked them to do.</P>
        <P>On advertising and alcohol, I have engaged in lengthy debates with those involved in advertising who state that particular sports would not survive without the support of drinks companies.  They also state that advertising revenues are the lifeblood of such sports.  At the very time when we need children and young adults to take an interest in sport and in being active, the last thing we want to do by banning alcohol advertising is to leave a vacuum which will lead to sports either going into decline as a result of lost revenue or disintegrating altogether.  As a result, the impetus for people to aspire to emulate their great sporting heroes would be lost just when it is needed.  There is a need for the Department of Education and Skills to engage in some joined-up thinking with regard to how more sport might be included on the school curriculum.  If we are to take action in respect of advertising and alcohol, we will be obliged to fill the vacuum that will inevitably be created by encouraging children, through the school curriculum, to become involved in sport.  This would mean that children would be driven by their own understanding of what is involved and would not be obliged to rely on the support provided by sponsors and advertisers.  I recognise that sponsors and advertisers have invested a great deal of money in sport but this is an aspect of the matter about which I feel particularly strongly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion and I support the Minister of State in her efforts.  The alcohol industry is particularly influential.  I would not state that it is particularly influential with Government but it certainly had an indirect influence on many of my colleagues in the context of various debates on drink driving laws and other issues relating to alcohol.  That was not healthy for the body politic.  I am disappointed that the alcohol industry is represented on the national steering group charged with producing policy.  I urge the Minister of State to be as strong as possible &mdash; I know this will be the case &mdash; in the context of playing her part in framing that policy.  The Minister of State referred to the steering group finalising a policy framework but she and the Government will finalise that framework in actuality.  I hope that will be done in the absence of influence from the industry.  I accept that the industry is good in many ways, that it provides employment for many people and that it provides a service that people require.  However, it must also be noted that immeasurable harm is being done.</P><Col N="489"/>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to a number of concerns she harbours.  While we all welcome and support the motion, it is important to recognise the issues that have been raised and to listen to the voices of those who do not fully agree with us.  It is crucial that the Minister of State should engage with the authorities in Northern Ireland in particular because any actions taken on this side of the Border will have a major impact on people&rsquo;s shopping patterns.  Alcohol is a major attraction for people when they are shopping for groceries, and so on.  It is essential that we liaise with our counterparts in the North because if we do not do so, any action we take will not work.</P>
        <P>People will list every possible reason this cannot be done.  They will refer to European Union internal market rules and competition law <i>ad nauseam</i>.  We should keep the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation out of it and proceed on the basis that this is a health issue.  If we do so, I do not believe there will be any objections from Europe.  Lawyers may raise objections but regardless of whether they do so it is extremely important that we should take action.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the legislation relating to the sale of alcohol which it is promised to introduce next year.  One relatively known aspect with regard to the law on alcohol is that it is extremely complicated.  A small number of lawyers are becoming extremely wealthy as a result of the complex nature of the alcohol and licensing laws.  It is important, therefore, that the Government should do everything in its power to simplify the legislation in this area.</P>
        <P>I support the notion of a minimum price.  I wonder whether such a price could be imposed in conjunction with excise duty because it is important that the State should derive some benefit.  We need to consider the position with regard to opening hours.  The late Mr. Brian Lenihan, a former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, restricted off-licence opening hours to 10 p.m.  Many Scandinavian countries with problems similar to those we experience have even more restrictive opening hours.  This is a matter to which consideration must be given.  If a person plans his or her night&rsquo;s drinking, he or she will be less likely to engage in binge drinking.  However, I have noticed many people on their way to and from pubs at 9 p.m. going into off-licences to purchase alcohol.  There is no reason off-licences should not close at 7 p.m., other than the fact that there would be major objections.  If a 7 p.m. closing time were introduced, people who needed to purchase alcohol could do so before that time.  There is no need for people to buy alcohol on a whim at 9 p.m.</P>
        <P>The late Mr. Brian Lenihan also established a particular committee in 2008 with which I raised the issue of under-age drinking.  The solution to under-age drinking is very simple but it was not taken up at the time.  I suggest that we prevent all people in secondary school &mdash; regardless of whether they are 18 or 19 years of age &mdash; purchasing alcohol.  If someone is in secondary school, he or she should not be allowed to drink.  In addition, a person in college should be over 18 years of age before he or she is allowed to purchase alcohol.  I did not start drinking until I was 19.  I find it incredible, therefore, that sixth year students might go to the pub immediately after completing their leaving certificate or that they might be served alcohol at their graduation.  I was not even 17 when I sat the leaving certificate.  Alcohol has no place in the secondary school system.  Pub owners should not allow those who are studying for or who have just completed the leaving certificate on to their premises without their parents.  This would, in one fell swoop, undercut the peer pressure exerted in schools by those who are 18 and who can legitimately imbibe alcohol.  Such peer pressure gives rise to a sort of race to the bottom in the context of encouraging young people to start drinking.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we ban those who are still attending secondary school from purchasing alcohol, this would have a hugely positive effect in the context of undermining the under-age drinking culture.  Not allowing young people to drink until they are in college and over 18 would create a level playing field.  I would like my suggestion in this regard to be considered because there is a massive problem in the context of under-age drinking.  I did not engage in under age drinking <Col N="490"/>and I only drink from time to time now.  I went to an off-licence two months ago and the 12 bottles of beer I bought are still in the fridge at home. This debate has reminded me of it.  </P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I enjoy going to the pub from time to time, to be honest, and nobody should be ashamed of that.  I enjoy a bit of craic.  There is a significant societal cost arising from this issue and publicans and the drinks industry should be aware of it.  There is a big problem in Letterkenny and local authorities have powers under legislation to introduce by-laws for certain areas.  If there is a problem with low price alcohol or promotions in a local authority area, I would challenge local authorities to introduce by-laws to deal with the issue.  It is within their power and they should not wait for the Government to act.  As part of this strategy the Government could introduce guidance to local authorities if they have no experience.</P>
        <P>We will support the measure but we should not dismiss people who raise concerns.  I did not hear Senator Barrett&rsquo;s contribution but there are economic issues pertinent to below-cost selling of alcohol, and they should be noted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, for coming to the House.  He is a regular visitor and as somebody who was a Member of the House, he knows the format and the value of having a Minister or Minister of State replying to Senators&rsquo; queries.  My issue is local to Letterkenny, with a problem immediately affecting four estates.  The ESB has written to the residents associations and told them the ESB would switch off power to the sewerage pumps because money has not been paid.  The residents made inquiries through the council and by their own research found that the developer had gone bust.  The developer was from Northern Ireland and the receiver appears to have abandoned ship altogether.  These residents had to go to the ESB and in the past day or two it was indicated that power would not be cut off immediately, although this had been scheduled for 20 November.  There has been no indication of who will pay the bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The residents and possibly a school would be affected if the power is switched off.  These residents bought their properties in good faith and never expected to arrive at such a position.  As a member of Letterkenny Town Council and Donegal County Council for many years, I believe the council has a responsibility for residents and must ultimately pick up the tab because of the lack of a system.  At a council meeting last year I asked how many bonds had been called upon and only one has ever been used.  I question the value of having a bond and the way bonds have been administered in the planning process, which leaves much to be desired.  To date nobody has got to grips with when a bond can be called in or if they can be used.  There seem to be many conditions attached to calling in a bond.</P>
        <P>My experience at the council leads me to believe there is an obligation to take over estates after seven years but in many cases the cost of doing so would be prohibitive.  Will the Minister of State clarify the issue?  Builders have gone bust in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency and the seven-year period is up.  In some cases estates may be 25 or 30 years old but the council would not have taken over.  At what stage is a council legally obliged to take over the running of an estate?  In the Letterkenny case the developer is from outside the jurisdiction and has no means of paying the ESB.  Who has to pay it and will it come back to the residents?  Some of the houses may be owned by developers or investors with no real interest in the local area.  Houses may also be empty.  Such people will not pay up and I would not expect a resident to have to pay for a developer&rsquo;s obligation.</P>
        <P>I know the financial position of local authorities is difficult but it is more difficult for residents and a family home should be sacrosanct.  The previous Administration allowed this get out of hand to such a degree that this is only now hitting home.  It is not a tragedy but it is an injustice.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Harte for raising this matter, which is very important in his part of the country and Letterkenny in County Donegal in particular.  It is important to the affected residents.</P>
        <P>A development which has not been completed in accordance with the planning permission is unauthorised development and may be subject to planning enforcement.  These provisions <Col N="492"/>apply to all residential developments, whether they are to be managed by a management company.  In so far as the taking in charge of residential developments is concerned, section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that, where an estate is completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the planning permission, and any conditions attached to the permission, the planning authority must initiate taking in charge procedures as soon as possible following a request to do so by the developer or by the majority of the owners.  Similarly, where an estate has not been completed to the standard outlined in the planning permission and the planning authority has not taken enforcement action within the appropriate period, section 180 also provides that the planning authority must initiate taking-in-charge procedures if requested to do so by the owners of the units concerned.  The decision as to whether an estate should be taken in charge is ultimately one for the elected members of the planning authority.</P>
        <P>Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a planning authority may take in charge an unfinished estate at any time after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have failed or the authority has not taken enforcement action.  Planning authorities were also specifically empowered in the 2010 Act to take in charge part of an estate, or some but not all of the facilities in an estate.  Housing estates and apartment developments not taken in charge normally remain private developments until such time as the owners of such developments take the necessary steps to have the development taken over by the relevant local authority.</P>
        <P>Where, as the Senator has suggested, in regard to a number of developments in the areas mentioned, a receiver has been appointed by a financial institution, the receiver assumes the obligations of the developer.  In this case, because the receiver has been appointed and given the scale of the development, the receiver in this case is the <i>de facto </i>developer and the owner of the development in law and in terms of the existing planning and development Acts.  It then becomes a matter for the receiver and the institution to consider what steps they may wish to take to complete the development and have it taken in charge.  This may include the realisation of assets on other sites within the control of the overall group in receivership to fund any necessary works.</P>
        <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.  I suggest a transcript of the Senator&rsquo;s contribution be sent to him to see what further action, if any, can be taken by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in its dealings with Donegal County Council.  In this instance, the first port of call is the local authority.  The county council&rsquo;s relationship &mdash; of whatever description &mdash; with the receiver who, effectively, has become the <i>de facto</i> owner of the site and the units on it still has to be clarified.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>The question on the minds of the residents in the estates is: who will ultimately pay the ESB if the company decides next month to cut off the power because of non-payment?  The amount is as yet unclear because there are different figures for different areas.  Houses have been added and as such, the scale of the problem is unclear.  Who will ultimately be responsible for paying the bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>As I am not aware of the particulars of the case, I am slow to make a judgment on it.  In the first instance, one would have to see a report from Donegal County Council to see where the matter stands in respect of unauthorised development.  I will ask the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to revert to the Senator to see whether the question can be answered.  I am not in possession of information or details on the case as to what action, if any, Donegal County Council has taken in the case.  As I said, <Col N="493"/>the county council is the first port of call.  I will ask the relevant section in the Department to revert to the Senator on the matter.</P>

    <sTitle>Flood Relief</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Brian Hayes, for coming into the House to respond to it.</P>
        <P>I refer to the flooding in Drumconrath, County Meath, on the night of the large floods on the east coast on 24 October, of which I know the Minister is aware.  There was a huge flood in the centre of the village in which a flood had not occurred in decades.  A number of houses were completely destroyed and it was heart-rending to visit them, as people could no longer live in them.  With all the publicity in Dublin, there was very little coverage of the hardship suffered by some of the families affected in the village of Drumconrath.  Some of the houses have been in their ownership for hundreds of years.</P>
        <P>The Drumconrath area is covered by the OPW under the arterial drainage Acts.  Some works were undertaken subsequent to the floods in 2008.  The question arises as to whether the works which alleviated the problem in part of the village contributed to flooding in the other part of the village last month.  Reports are due on the matter.  I raise the issue in the Seanad to highlight its urgency and the severe trauma that has affected those who have had to move out of their homes.  I highlight the lack of the knowledge in the village of what is going on.  I also wish to exert as much gentle pressure as possible on the Minister of State to treat the matter with the utmost urgency and to get the reports I believe he is expecting and ensure funding is provided as soon as possible to have the work done.  This is an opportunity to raise the issue to show how important it is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to address this issue in the House; it is one for which I have responsibility, unlike the others to which I have responded.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am well aware of the hardship endured by the residents of Drumconrath on 24 October and the losses suffered as a result of the flooding of four houses and a community centre in the village.  I take the opportunity to express my personal sympathy to and show concern for the victims of the flooding.  As the Senator said, it is very stressful to have one&rsquo;s home flooded and belongings destroyed.  In the few opportunities I have had to visit other victims of flooding throughout the country, it is evident that enormous psychological damage is done to people when their homes are devastated by such an event.  As an organisation, the Office of Public Works appreciates that part of our response is making sure we give people the defences and support they need in recognising the damage done to communities and individual residents.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the tremendous work undertaken locally by the emergency services during the flood event in providing assistance for residents.  Two units of the fire brigade and staff from the road maintenance section of the local authority attended until the early hours of the morning.  The road maintenance crews provided and filled sandbags and supported the emergency services.  Since the flood event, the local area engineer in Meath County Council has met local residents, while a senior engineer has also engaged with them.</P>
        <P>Drumconrath was severely affected by the extreme weather event which affected the east coast on Monday, 24 October.  To put the event in its historical perspective, 82.2 mm of rainfall was recorded at Casement Aerodrome, the highest daily rainfall recorded for October since records began there in 1954.  The Burley Bridge hydrometric gauge on the River Dee, approximately 4 km from Drumconrath, recorded a water level of 3.33 m, the fourth highest level recorded since 1975.</P><Col N="494"/>
        <P>Initial inspections suggest the flooding occurred when the flow in the channel exceeded the conveyance capacity of the channel under the bridge.  That is typical of many other cases along the east coast on that evening; that the channel was not big enough, wide enough or deep enough in some cases to withstand the surge of water.  The surcharged water flow at this point resulted in the flooding of the houses upstream of the bridge.  The surcharged water flow continued across the R165, flooding the community hall, as the Senator is aware.  The depth of flooding in the properties was approximately 0.5 m.  The flood waters had receded by the next morning.</P>
        <P>The river that flooded is a tributary of the River Dee which is part of the Glyde and Dee catchment drainage scheme which was completed by the OPW in 1957.  The Office Of Public Works programmes maintenance as required for this scheme and maintenance was last carried out on the river in 2009.</P>
        <P>On addressing the immediate flooding issues in Drumconrath, the Office of Public Works will undertake a detailed survey of the area and design remedial works to the channel.  Any works will take account of cost/benefit and environmental issues.  The works may be carried out either directly by the OPW or by the council under the minor flood mitigation works scheme.  It is envisaged that the survey will be carried out in early 2012.</P>
        <P>I give that commitment to the Senator.  We will complete that survey early next year so that we can set about correcting the problems that emerge, if they are specific to the OPW.  There may be other issues which Meath County Council may wish to advance to the OPW by way of a minor works scheme.  We would have no difficulty in processing those requirements as soon as possible.  As the Senator knows, under the minor works scheme we deal with this issue on a 24/7 basis.  The more proposals that come from Meath County Council the quicker we can turn them around.</P>
        <P>As a response to the flood events of 24 October, the Government recently set up a humanitarian assistance scheme for which &euro;10 million has been allocated to provide means tested financial support to people who have suffered damage to their homes as a result of the recent flooding which is not covered by insurance.  The scheme is administered on the ground by staff from the Department of Social Protection and will provides hardship alleviation assistance, as opposed to full compensation, to householders affected by the flooding.  Applications will be prioritised and the most urgent cases will be dealt with quickly.  I am not sure this is relevant to the case of Drumconrath.  It depends on whether people had insurance.  However, it is another avenue of support open to people who have no insurance.  I assure the Senator and the residents of Drumconrath of the OPW&rsquo;s commitment to resolving the issues affecting Drumconrath to avoid a repeat of the flooding which occurred.</P>
        <P>As the Senator rightly pointed out, the key issue is to get the review done as soon as possible and to carry out the works.  We have the funds and the support to do that, once the review is done, as well as any ancillary works Meath County Council want the OPW to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for his response and understanding of the issues.  The Office of Public Works is an interesting office and deals with very difficult situations.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned the community centre.  I thank Fr. Connaughton, from the parish of Drumconrath and Meath Hill, for his leadership on this issue.  He has much work to do in the community centre.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned the hardship scheme provided by the Department of Social Protection.  This may or may not apply to the residents of Drumconrath.  It is interesting and concerning that when I raised this with the residents at a meeting last Friday night, which was some time after the flooding, none of them was aware of the full details of the scheme and <Col N="495"/>none had been contacted by a community welfare officer, which I understood was the Department&rsquo;s policy.  They may or may not qualify for the scheme.  I do not know their individual circumstances.  Perhaps some further work could be done on that matter if there are people who may need to avail of the scheme but are not fully aware of it.  The people I spoke to knew about the scheme but they certainly had not been contacted by anyone from the Department of Social Protection.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding is that support is there for people in the first instance if it is needed for specific issues.  In my constituency I know of cases where specific equipment was needed quickly and the relieving officers were able to provide it quickly.  The humanitarian assistance scheme is intended for people who have no insurance, or did not pay their insurance premiums.  My understanding is that the Department of Social Protection will progress those applications as soon as possible, on a means tested basis.  We would encourage people, in the first instance to go to their insurers and draw down funds, given that they have been paying premiums for years.</P>

    <sTitle>Garda Stations</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his intervention the week before last on behalf of the residents of Melrose Park, Kinsealy in Fingal, who were flooded.  His assistance there was very much appreciated.</P>
        <P>There is grave concern in Malahide, Kinsealy and Portmarnock about the review being carried out in the Dublin metropolitan policing area.  It has been reported that Malahide Garda Station is part of the review list.  It is a significant station with 33 garda&iacute;.  It has been there since the foundation of the State and was an RIC barracks before that.  The population of the area is 25,000, and growing.  The closure or restriction of Howth Garda Station is also being talked about.  This would mean the entire local authority area of Malahide and Howth, with 50,000 residents, would not have a Garda station.</P>
        <P>The only thing I was ever involved in closing in Malahide was a head shop.  The garda&iacute; were very helpful in that matter.  I assume the Government will not preside over the closure of Malahide Garda Station.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the review.  The closure and rationalisation of Garda stations has largely been reported as a rural issue.  This is not the case.  Garda stations in Whitehall, Howth, Malahide and other urban locations are also threatened.</P>
        <P>Can the Minister of State confirm to the people of Malahide, Kinsealy and Portmarnock that the station in Malahide will continue as a 24 hour and seven day a week station, that its hours will not be restricted and that it will not be closed and its functions transferred to Swords?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I apologise to Senator O&rsquo;Brien for the fact that the Minister is not here to take this issue, in which the Senator has an enormous interest.  I thank him for raising it.  As with every other public sector organisation, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have to manage with reduced resources.  The House will also be aware that, under plans agreed by the previous Government as part of its compliance with the terms of the EU-IMF agreement, Garda numbers are to be reduced.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner has therefore quite properly been reviewing all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations, in terms of opening hours and possible closures.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that Garda resources are managed and deployed in the most appropriate manner to meet existing and emerging policing requirements and to maintain Garda front line services, which is entirely consistent with Government policy.</P><Col N="496"/>
        <P>Clearly, an examination of the opening hours, and in some cases the viability, of stations forms part of this.  In that regard the Garda Commissioner is considering whether efficiencies could be introduced through rationalisation of some Garda stations and revised arrangements for the delivery of local policing services.</P>
        <P>A final decision on whether station closures will take place, and if so what stations, will be taken in the context of the Commissioner&rsquo;s draft policing plan for 2012 and will be announced shortly.  Therefore, I cannot directly answer Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s question on behalf of the Minister.  His answer will depend on the Commissioner&rsquo;s policing plan, which I understand will be announced shortly.  The policing plan will also be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I presume colleagues will have an opportunity to debate the matter at that stage, either in committee or in plenary sessions of the Houses.</P>
        <P>Before I conclude I would like on behalf of the Minister to pay tribute to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Minister is fully aware that its members will bring their professionalism to bear on the task of identifying efficiencies and in looking at new ways to maximise the effective use of resources.  The Minister is confident that the Garda force will continue to maintain the confidence of the public and operate successfully as it has been doing so effectively since the foundation of the State.</P>
        <P>The key objective in this matter is to maintain numbers so that the front line is not affected by an obvious rationalisation or new efficiencies which might be brought to bear.  I am sure that is the ambition of us all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I know the Minister of State gives this response on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality and Defence, and I do not criticise him.  However, the answer given does not even refer to the Garda station about which I asked and gives no comfort.</P>
        <P>I will continue to pursue this matter.  In my area, Garda stations in places such as Skerries have already been restricted.  The Minister&rsquo;s reply tells me we will have further restrictions and closures.  I would bet my house on that, on the basis of the Minister&rsquo;s answer.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said the draft policing plan for 2012 will be announced shortly.  Does he have any information as to when that will be?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, I cannot confirm when that will occur.  My understanding is that the policing model for 2012 which will include all the information the Senator seeks will be announced shortly.  I will ask the Minister&rsquo;s office to revert to the Senator on what &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; means.  I appreciate the point made that we need some assurance on this.  People need to know where they are going.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in particular need to know what is in store if they must organise their front line to ensure they maximise their resources.  The sooner this happens the better.</P>
