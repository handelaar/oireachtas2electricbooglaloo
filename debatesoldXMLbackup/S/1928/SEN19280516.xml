    <P>New Section.  Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>5.&mdash;(1)  Save as is otherwise provided by this section a rate made by virtue of this Act on an owner of a small dwelling who is not beneficially entitled to such small dwelling shall not be recoverable from such owner.</P>
    <P>(2)  Whenever a rate is made by virtue of this Act on the owner of a small dwelling and such owner is not beneficially entitled to such small dwelling and such rate is in arrear and unpaid for whichever of the following periods is the longer, that is to say, four months from the making of such rate or three months from the furnishing in accordance with this Act to such owner of particulars of such rate, the following provisions shall apply and have effect, that is to say,</P>
    <P>(a)  it shall be lawful for the rate collector by whom such rate is collectable to serve either personally or by post on such owner a notice restraining him for so long as any part of such rate remains unpaid from paying to the person beneficially entitled to such small dwelling any rents or profits received (whether before or after the service of such notice) by such owner out of or in respect of such small dwelling;</P>
    <P>(b)  when such notice has been served such owner shall, to the extent of all rents and profits issuing out of such small dwelling and either received by him before and still in his hands at the service of such notice or received by him after such service, be liable to pay such rate and the same shall be recoverable from him accordingly by all or any of the remedies authorised by this Act;</P>
    <P>(c)  the receipt of a rate collector by whom such rate is collectable for a payment made by such owner on account of the said rate after the service of such notice on him shall, as against the person beneficially <Col N="505" /> entitled to such small dwelling and notwithstanding any direction given by such person, be a good discharge to such owner for moneys received by him for the use of or in trust for such person up to the amount of such payment;</P>
    <P>(d)  if such notice as aforesaid cannot conveniently be served on such owner or the rating authority by whom such rate was made is of opinion (whether before or after the service of such notice) that the amount of such rate so in arrear or some part of such amount is or probably will be irrecoverable from such owner, it shall be lawful for the rate collector by whom such rate is collectable to serve either personally or by post on the occupier of such small dwelling a notice stating the amount of the said rate then unpaid and requiring such occupier to pay to such rate collector or his successor in office all rent then due or thereafter to become due by him to such owner until the said amount of the said rate is by such payment or otherwise discharged;</P>
    <P>(e)  the service of such notice as aforesaid on such occupier shall operate to transfer to such rate collector and his successors in office the exclusive right to recover, receive and give a discharge for the rent required by such notice to be paid to such rate collector or his successor in office.</P>

      <P>Under this proposed new section it is intended to meet the points raised on the Committee Stage, that it would be unfair that an agent who came in under Section 1 as the owner might be liable to suffer distraint and seizure in respect of money that he actually had not in hand.  The section enables steps to be taken by the local authority to order the agent to retain rents paid in respect of a particular small dwelling and to hand over these rents to the local authority in satisfaction of rates due.  Under certain circumstances, where it is impossible to get the agent to do this because of his absence from the country or for any other reason, a a similar order may be issued on the <Col N="506" /> occupier of the house requiring him to hand over the rents due to the owner until such time as the claim for rates is satisfied.  I think the new section meets in a satisfactory way the points raised by Senator Sir John Keane on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;The rating authority shall repay to an owner that portion of the rates comprised in any rent which remains irrecoverable after full recourse to legal proceedings.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the only point on which the Minister and myself have not been able to come to an agreement.  For that reason, the House may feel inclined to have considerable sympathy with the Minister owing to the number of amendments on which he has met me and met the House.  I would ask the House to differentiate in this respect between quantity and quality.  There is a large element of quality, but not much quantity, in this amendment.  It is quite a simple proposition.  It is that the owner under the Bill when it becomes law will be bound to bear the burden of irrecoverable rates.  I ask the House to take the view that it is an unjust burden and may be a very large one.  I consider that it is in no way met by the 10 per cent. poundage which the owner is to get for the duty of collection.  The poundage is given for all the trouble and extra work involved in making the collection.</P>
      <P>This question of irrecoverable rates is really the basis of the whole Bill.  It is because these irrecoverable rates are so heavy that the Bill is brought in at all. Everyone who has ever acted as a member of a county council knows of the trouble there is in dealing with these small occupiers who have got little or no goods and who are no mark for the sheriff.  They will be a mark for ejectment if the Seanad is satisfied that that is a desirable process.  I am afraid it is a process that will have to be resorted to to a considerable extent.  In cases where the rates cannot be recovered ejectment will follow much more harshly for them than as regards the recovery of rent which is largely a personal matter.  I hope the House will support this amendment, and ensure that the owner is recouped by the local authority for rates that he has to pay himself and which he cannot recover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> The Minister, on the last day, gave me to understand that he would be able to give the House some figures, not for the whole country, but for certain areas of it with regard to the volume of irrecoverable rates.  My information is that in some districts they amount to a considerable figure.  In the county with which I am acquainted the total amount of irrecoverable rates in one year was £1,400.  I do not think it would be overestimating if I were to say that £1,000 of that was in respect of this class of small dwellings.  If that is so, then the position in the future will be that that sum of £1,000 is going to come out of the pockets of the owners.  That, I suggest, would be a harsh burden to place upon them.  I would remind the House that these owners are not big men with ample resources.  They are often small men who own perhaps three or four or five houses which they purchased out of their hard-earned savings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment, in my opinion, is not a reasonable one and I intend to oppose it.  The owner is already provided for, because if the occupier does not pay the rates he has power to eject him and let the house to someone who will be willing to pay. I do not think the principle in the amendment to let the owner go scot free and to hold up the house until such time as he can get the rent he wants, is a right one.  I do not think that principle should be admitted in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it strongly to the Seanad that in giving a rebate of one-tenth of the total rate payable we are meeting the owners not only to any extent which they may justly be met because of any additional work thrown upon them&mdash;I do not think that the work will be very much&mdash;but that we are meeting them also in respect of any other contingencies which may arise.  This is not really a question of the irrecoverability of the rates.  The point involved in the amendment is the suggestion that there is a big amount of irrecoverable rents to be dealt with in the country.  I do not think that we can take cognizance of that, because this Bill only deals <Col N="509" /> with the question of rates.  If this amendment were to be embodied in the Bill it would complicate the rates situation unnecessarily.  I suggest that the 10 per cent. is an ample margin to allow to cover any small amounts of irrecoverable rates that there may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last day I said I would get some particulars as far as they might be got, but the figures that I have obtained do not, I am afraid, bear very much on the situation.  However, for the information of the Seanad, I will give the figures that I have got.  They refer to certain urban districts and to certain county councils in the country. They give the total amounts of irrecoverable rates for certain years in these districts.  They deal with cases under £6 valuation.  In the case of Ballinasloe urban district, for the half year ending March, 1928, the total amount of irrecoverable rates was £43, and of this £25 related to cases under £6 valuation, the percentage being 58. In the case of Cashel urban district, in the year 1927/28 the total amount of irrecoverable rates was £120; cases under £6 valuation £102, or 85 per cent. In Castlebar urban district, in the year 1927/28, the total amount of irrecoverable rates was £78; cases under £6 valuation £63, or 81 per cent. In Clonmel for the year 1925/26 the amount was £136 10s.; cases under £6 valuation £72 11s. 5d., or 53 per cent. In Clonmel for 1926/27 the amount was £164; cases under £6 valuation £75 4s. 7d., or 46 per cent.  In Drogheda in 1925/26 the amount was £427 10s. 4d; cases under £6 valuation, £159 15s. 5d., or 37.5 per cent.  In Drogheda for 1926/27 the amount was £730 6s. 6d.; cases under £6 valuation £224 1s. 2d., or 30.5 per cent.  In Dungarvan for 1925/26 the amount was £447; cases under £6 valuation £447, or 100 per cent.  In Dungarvan for 1926/27 the total was £493; and cases under £6 valuation the same figure, or 100 per cent.  In Fermoy in 1925/26 the total was £686 13s. 5d.; cases under £6 valuation £353 18s. 1d., or 51.5 per cent.  In 1926/27 the amount was £716 17s. 5d., and in cases under £6 valuation £400 11s. 10d.  With regard to county councils in the period 1927/28 the total amount of irrecoverable rates in the <Col N="510" /> case of Dublin County Council was £3,221; cases under £6 valuation £191, or 5.9 per cent. of the total.  Mayo County Council in 1925/26 the total was £755; cases under £6 valuation £123, or 16.3 per cent.  In Mayo for 1926/27 the amount was £530; in cases under £6 valuation £147, or 28 per cent. In the case of Waterford County Council in the year 1925/26 the amount was £960; cases under £6 valuation £537, or 56 per cent.  In Waterford in the year 1926/27 the total was £1,210; cases under £6 valuation £587, or 48.5 per cent. of the total.</P>
    <P>Waterford seems to have been a particularly difficult area in the matter. It, however, does not bear on the general principle in the Bill, which is, that we have to deal with the matter in a fair and equitable way.  I submit that the 10 per cent. should cover all contingencies for the owner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the figures given by the Minister. They seem to be rather uneven and do not cover the whole of the country, but from them perhaps one may get a fair percentage figure.  I think that the figures for Dungarvan are certainly rather striking.  The whole amount of the irrecoverable rates there amounting, as well as I could catch the Minister's figure, to over £400, is on small dwellings.  Dungarvan is a rather small place, with a population of, I suppose, three or four thousand people. I ask the Seanad to accept the view that to cast an annual burden of over £400 on the owners of the small houses there is a rather serious thing.  It is a heavy annual burden to transfer to the owners, who are all very small people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be easier to collect them, I admit, to that extent. I am afraid there will be an element of harsh evictions involved, and the owners of property, rightly or wrongly, will be blamed for discharging a responsibility which, I think, should <Col N="511" /> be placed on shoulders other than the owners.  That is the only point I wish to make.</P>

      <P>(2)  The provisions of this section shall be in addition to and not in substitution for the provisions of any other enactment (whether public, general, local, or personal, public or private) enabling a rate to be discharged by payment of a fraction thereof within a limited time, but not so as to entitle any person to relief under this section and under such other enactment in respect of the same rate.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have heard they may object to some of the amendments. At the second meeting of the Committee we had the advantage of the presence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister made suggestions to the Committee which were carefully considered.  We would be glad to have had the Minister at all our meetings.  He got notice of all of them, but only attended one meeting. When the Minister attended, he mentioned that he had had the assistance of Dr. Kelly when he was going through the applications.  We invited Dr. Kelly to assist us, as he was familiar with the particulars of many of the cases.  Every application that came before the Committee was carefully considered. If there was any doubt about a case, it was referred back for further information.  I think I am right in stating that no change was made except some additional information was given to the Committee, information which was not before the Dáil Committee. No action was taken at which Dr. Kelly expressed a strong opinion. I mention these points to show that the Committee was most anxious to have all the facts, and to go into them fully and impartially.  As far as I know, none of the applicants was known to any members of the Committee, certainly not to me.  I think the Committee dealt very fully and fairly with every case that came before it.  These amendments represent the findings of the Committee, and I move their adoption.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has asked me to say that as regards these amendments he is prepared to accept 6, 7, 8 and 9 but that he would oppose the acceptance of amendments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  The principle upon which the Minister undertook to make additions to the Schedule was on the principle enshrined in the 1921 Act, in cases where it was felt that through negligence or political reasons of one kind or another persons who were entitled to be registered under the 1921 Act did not take advantage of these particular facilities. The Minister points out that as regards the first five cases the men referred to would not be entitled to be admitted. With regard to amendment No. 5, where it is proposed to delete a particular name from the Schedule, the Minister is of opinion that that person has a greater right to be on the Schedule than the persons recommended in the first four amendments for insertion.</P>

These persons are recommended by the Committee for insertion in the Schedule. I understand now that the Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks that they ought not to be inserted, and that he is also of opinion that the person whose name it is proposed to delete under amendment No. 5 should be left on.  This, I am afraid, will provide an inconvenient procedure, for under it the House will have to canvass the merits of the four individuals referred to.  It is to be regretted that the Minister had not an opportunity of raising his objections before the Special Committee. I would like to know if any objection was raised before the Committee in regard to the inclusion of these four names.</P>

I think a more appropriate and convenient course to follow now would be to refer this Schedule back to the Special Committee and let the Minister go before it and state his objections. There is just a point that occurs to me, and perhaps Senator Sir Edward Bigger would be able to give me some information on it.  It is a matter that I think it my duty to mention.  The matter is this: that I have been interviewed by a Dublin citizen, apparently a man of great respectability, who made a strong complaint to me in reference to his son.  As to the merits of the case I know nothing.  The man seemed to be labouring under a sense of very great injustice.  He seemed to think his son was being made a victim by the operations of this Bill&mdash;that his means of livelihood was going to be taken from him.  It was the case of a man named Forester.  I do not know whether it came before the Special Committee or not.  I do not want to raise it now, and the only suggestion I would make is that the applicant's father might be able to send the name forward to the Committee.  The Committee then can dispose of the case in any way that commends itself to their justice.</P>

      <P>I strongly support that suggestion.  If these names are to go back to the Committee I think there should be some expression of opinion from the House as to the attitude which the Committee should adopt towards these additions to the Schedule.  Speaking for myself, I think that if there is an assurance that these applicants should be admitted to examination it will ensure a proper standard of qualification.  As long as that barrier exists, and that they must pass it before getting to the Register, then the Committee should be liberal in their attitude towards the applicants. It appears to me they have been very rigid in regard to some cases, and when, as has been said, it is a question of a man's livelihood, and where the qualification can be insisted upon, I think we should deal with the cases in a liberal spirit.</P>

      <P>As has been pointed out, Senators and Deputies have not the faintest conception as to what qualifications a man should have in order to be able to get on the Third <Col N="517" /> Schedule.  So long as those who are claiming to be practising dentistry cannot get on the Register without passing an examination the public are fully protected. This is to be a special examination, not involving any severe literary test, or anything of that kind, but it will be a test of efficiency.  Provided a man must pass that examination in order to get on the Register I do not see why this should not be thrown open as widely as possible.  It is a very serious proposition for a man who has a family dependent on him to be deprived of his livelihood by being prohibited from sitting for an examination, for that is what it amounts to.  If he is a young man he can sit for a subsequent examination, but at that he will have to pass a test that may require obtaining a training in the College of Surgeons. Therefore, in effect, you are making a crime of something that was not a crime up to the passing of the Act.  You are making new conditions in the case of a man who has been practising dentistry for years and depriving him of the opportunity of availing of this special examination by keeping him off the list. This matter has become a public nuisance. People are coming around canvassing at our houses.  Each person who comes along states his case, and for all we know he may be as qualified as anybody else to go on the list.  We have nothing to guide us, and the Minister has not stated the necessary qualifications. I do not know that the Minister has power to lay down qualifications. That is a matter for the Dental Council.  I suggest that the Committee to be set up should be generous in their consideration of applications to go on the Third Schedule. Most of these men will be allowed to practise dentistry only for about six months, and if they do not pass they are no longer on the list.  What greater protection could there be than that?</P>

Our experience of men has been quite as extensive as that of any Minister.  Having gone very carefully through the names of the applicants, <Col N="518" /> and having previously had a consultation with the Minister, we should not run riot or be diverted from the attitude taken up.  We adopted a rigid attitude&mdash;altogether too rigid&mdash;considering that men's livelihoods were at stake, and having regard to the Minister's views we made very few modifications or additions to the Schedule.  There is an arrogant assumption of omniscience, having regard to the personnel of the Committee, by coming along and saying these men are not qualified.  I think if this sort of thing is going on there is a great deal to be said for the attitude of some politicians who say that the Seanad had better be abolished.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was passed through the Committee Stage I suggested, in regard to this Schedule, that the House as a whole was not a very convenient tribunal to discuss the private affairs of individuals who were applicants to be put on the Schedule, and that it could be better done by a few selected members, who would be asked to go into the cases and report to the House, the House not necessarily being bound to accept their recommendations.  This comes before us now only as a recommendation of the Committee, who apparently went very carefully into all these applications.  I may say, in reference to the particular case I mentioned, that I am now informed, and I have no doubt it is correct, that it was before the Committee on three occasions and investigated on each occasion and rejected.  I have nothing more to say on the matter.  On the question as to whether the House is prepared to adopt the Schedule as recommended by the Committee, we are met with regard to that by the statement that the Minister in charge of the Bill is opposed to the recommendations of the Committee, and he holds that as regards the first four names these should be deleted, and that the fifth name, which is deleted, should be restored. Of course, it is now a matter entirely for the House, but I do not see how the House will be in a position to judge as between the Committee and <Col N="519" /> the Minister unless we go into the facts of each case.  We then would be called upon to form an opinion as between the views of the Committee and those of the Minister.  For that reason I suggest that we should refer the matter back to the Committee, and invite the Minister to attend and raise the cases there, so that when it comes back to us we would be able to deliberate on the action of the Committee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is brought forward at the instance of the Incorporated Law Society, which has given this Bill very special attention.  I understand they set up a Select Committee to consider its provisions.  It will be within the recollection of the House that the Cathaoirleach told us on the last day that the President of the Incorporated Law Society regarded the matter of sufficient importance to have an interview with him.  At your suggestion, sir, the matter was postponed from our last sitting.  I do not think there could be very much objection to the amendment I have moved, because, as most people know, in the case of a grant of administration security is invariably <Col N="521" /> required by the court in the shape of a bond or bonds.  The Bill, as it now stands, embraces not only executorships but administrators.</P>

Senator Douglas all along has emphasised the point that the object of this Bill is to place corporations, if they have the power under their Articles, in the same position as individuals.  I do not know am I assuming too much, but I am inclined to hope that Senator Douglas will see no objection to this amendment.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned I have no objection to what the amendment endeavours to do.  It is a matter, I am afraid, as between the best legal opinion I can get and the legal opinion Senator Brady has.  I am informed by the draftsman that it is quite unnecessary, and a silly thing to add.  That is what I am told.  With regard to &ldquo;the obligation to give such security as would be required from an individual&rdquo; I believe the court has power to waive that if it thinks it unnecessary.  It is only done in very few cases.  Under the existing law corporate bodies can act as administrators, and even under this Bill, so it is a matter for the House to say whether it ought to put in this amendment.  It is an unwise thing to do.  There is no difference in principle between me and Senator Brady.</P>

      <P>I object very much to this amendment because it is wholly unnecessary and it makes a very inartistic section.  I do not see why the House should accept an amendment of this kind in it.  There are two cases in which a body corporate can get a grant of administration.  One is where a body corporate is a creditor of the deceased.  In that case the settled practice is that the body corporate would have to give security.  It would have to go to the court and get leave to <Col N="522" /> take out a grant without having securities for its bonds.  The only other case in which a body corporate can become an administrator is under Section 1, which gives the court the right in special circumstances to appoint someone. In the ordinary course you have to go to a court, to begin with, to get the appointment of an administrator. Therefore, this amendment is wholly unnecessary.</P>

In my opinion, the adoption of this amendment would still enable the court in special cases where it thought fit to relieve them from the obligations to give security, but in that case it would simply be putting the law where it is at present.  It is not a question of expense at all; it does not add to the expense.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In this Act the expression &lsquo;body corporate&rsquo; means and includes only a body corporate having a capital for the time being of not less than £50,000 of which not less than £20,000 shall have been paid up in cash.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this, too, I am acting on very eminent legal advice.  As you, sir, stated this day fortnight, it is feared that this Bill might be abused by persons who would avail themselves of it <Col N="524" /> to promote what is popularly known as a bogus company, for which purpose under the Act of 1908 two or three people would be sufficient, and they could advertise to the public that they were prepared to undertake the duties of executors and administrators.  No doubt, it will be said that it is for the intending testator to look out for himself and that he is unlikely to select a person, or persons, or a corporation which would not faithfully carry out the duties and trusts imposed upon them.  But, on the other hand, here as elsewhere, a great many innocent people&mdash;and there are more innocent people in this country than elsewhere&mdash; are very largely influenced by advertisements, and if they saw an advertisement suggesting that the duties of an executor could be discharged by a company, that that would mean perpetual succession and that a person's property would be looked after for ever, as compared with an individual or individuals, who would die some time, a man might be attracted to entrust the administration of his affairs to such a company. Again I am bound to tell the House that the Incorporated Law Society, through its special committee, gave a great deal of attention to this matter&mdash; and the President had the privilege of an interview with you, sir&mdash;and they are very strongly of opinion that there should be a certain amount of capital in the case of such a company.  I understand that the English Act makes such a provision, and there is a further analogy to be drawn in support of the amendment, inasmuch as if any insurance company wants to start business in the Free State it has to lodge a very large sum of money&mdash;£20,000, or there-abouts&mdash;as security.  I do not see any reason why a body corporate, seeking to exercise the powers conferred under this Bill, should not be asked to give equal security in the shape of paid-up capital. It would present no difficulty in the case of those institutions which Senator Douglas has in mind; their capital is assured and known, and if they undertake the duties under this Bill the persons who take advantage of the Bill will be fully secured.  But it is unquestionably possible that a bogus company <Col N="525" /> could be started, seeking to exercise the powers conferred by this Bill, and I think that it is not at all unreasonable that a provision should be inserted fixing the amount of the paid-up capital of such a corporation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at once that if the House likes to confine this Bill to large companies, as suggested by the amendment, I personally will go on with the Bill; it will not spoil it as far as I am concerned. At the same time I am convinced that it is not a wise amendment.  I would like to ask Senator Brady the same question as I asked the Secretary of the Incorporated Law Society, as to how this amendment would prevent a bogus company from being set up.  I have been waiting for an answer to that question, and it has not arrived yet.  I am afraid that there is no answer.  A bogus company, to act as a trustee or as an executor if it were possible, which is doubtful, could be set up at present, and the only difference that this amendment would make would be that if the capital were less than £50,000, or if they had less than £20,000 paid up, they could still act, but they would have to appoint a syndicate.  The object of this Bill is simply to put a corporate body in exactly the same position as an individual, neither better nor worse.  This amendment says that a corporate body shall be the same as an individual if it has £50,000 capital, and it shall not be the same as an individual if it has less than £50,000 capital.  There is nothing whatever to say how much capital an individual&mdash;who might conceivably be a rogue, but who could not very well be bogus&mdash;should have to be appointed as executor.  I leave this amendment to the House.  I do not want to press the point, but I do think that it is a foolish thing to put into the Bill an amendment that would not achieve what is intended to prevent a bogus company from acting.  There is a large question which cannot be dealt with in this Bill and which, I think, should not be dealt with by any private member, and that is the whole question of individuals and corporate bodies acting as trustees, the <Col N="526" /> capital that they should have, and the security that they should give.  That was dealt with in England in Lord Birkenhead's Act, and it is quite possible that an Act will be introduced to deal with it here.  But to move that it should be done only in the case of a corporate body seems ridiculous, and while the law is as it is I think if a man wants to appoint someone under the Bill he could not appoint an incompetent company unless they had £50,000 capital, but he could appoint an incompetent individual who has no capital at all.  This is outside the scope of the Bill, and I oppose it for that reason.</P>

      <P>It is quite true that no security is asked to-day from an individual whom a testator appoints, but it must be remembered that that individual is the deliberate choice of the testator, and no doubt the company will be his deliberate choice also.  I see my learned friend, Senator Brown, shaking his head, and I am always frightened when I see that.</P>

      <P>I must protest against that.  I find myself for the first time in complete disagreement with your lordship.  But the testator selects his executor.  No doubt, under this Bill he will select a company.  But my point is&mdash;and it is a point strongly urged by the Incorporated Law Society &mdash;that the difference between a company and an individual is very great in this respect, that again the advertisement would come into play, and a man who is not very well versed in these matters and who is thinking of settling his affairs will say: &ldquo;It would be a very desirable thing to have a corporation to act as my executor,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I saw X. Y. Z. advertise in a paper last week.  They can do all the work for me, and I will appoint them my executors.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>But I think Senator Douglas will concede this, that if a bogus company of that kind is established, <Col N="527" /> the gentlemen who will constitute the directors will be of such a type that they will be able to impress a small farmer who comes to them about his affairs that they are exceedingly able gentlemen and that he could not do better than entrust his affairs to them.  Frankly, I must tell the House that the more I have thought over it, the more I am impressed by the reasonableness of the amendment. Senator Douglas has admitted that it can do no harm, and it might prevent unscrupulous persons from availing themselves of the Bill.  They could do this to-day, as Senator Douglas has reminded the House.  There is nothing to prevent three or four unscrupulous individuals from forming themselves into a limited company and carefully providing in their Articles of Association that they can act as executors, but so far, at any rate, functions such as these have been associated with big corporations like the banks and the insurance companies, and the bogus promoters, able as they are, may not be alive to the fact, until they see this Bill become law, that they can exercise their powers in the evil manner suggested.  I think that the House would be well advised to add this amendment to the Bill.  It can do no harm, and it can possibly prevent a great deal of harm.</P>

      <P>I am still of opinion that the position will not be changed by this amendment.  There is this consideration: that it is possible that there are a number of private companies formed from time to time which are really partnerships turned into limited companies.  If they chose to include in the Articles power for one individual to act as an executor they could do so and <Col N="529" /> he could let the company do the work. For instance, I could appoint an individual in a firm as my executor.  I could do so under the present law.  If companies had that power in their Articles of Association it might be taken by certain private companies. The effect of this amendment will be that a company, unless it has a capital of £50,000, will not get the benefit of being treated as individuals are.  In other words, it will be made more difficult to appoint partners, because they will have to appoint a syndicate and could not act in the same way as if one individual partner were appointed.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be read a second time.&rdquo;  This is a Private Member's Bill, and it is necessary that some member should move that it be read a second time. The Act of 1926 made provision for houses being decontrolled in three successive stages.  The first decontrol took place last year in the case of houses of a high valuation.  The second batch of houses would be decontrolled in a month.  I think they are houses over £25 valuation.  All control will cease on the 24th June, 1929.  If no Bill is passed in the interim, five or six thousand houses would be decontrolled on the 24th of June, the rents might be raised and evictions take place, as the case might be.  As originally introduced the Bill provided for the continuance of control of houses that will not be decontrolled up to 1934, but, as a result of an agreement between the <Col N="530" /> Government and the authors of the Bill this compromise was agreed upon.  This Bill passed the other House in its present form as an agreed measure, all Parties supporting it.  The Commission appointed to inquire into the relationship between landlords and tenants is, I think, only about to present its report, and the Government does not seem to be in a position to introduce any legislation of its own pending consideration of that report.  This Bill is therefore an interim measure, and, as it passed the other House as an agreed measure, I hope it will also pass this House as an agreed measure.</P>

      <P>Although I do not formally ask the House to reject this measure, I hope that will not be taken as an indication of agreement on my part.  I and others for whom I claim to speak view with the utmost disquietude this tendency to prolong the period of control of property over a class that has been restricted by legislation&mdash;in fact the only class you might say that has been restricted continuously since the war&mdash;and prevented them sharing the full play of market and economic conditions.  It is notorious that house property is the most unpleasant and burdensome class of property one can possess, yet, at the same time, that very class was singled out for a limit, I will not say on their profits, but they were placed on a totally different basis as regards money to any other class of the community. While those engaged in ordinary trade and commerce were able to take full advantage of the market, buying and selling, unrestricted, owners of property were restricted in this way.  The period has long since passed when that has any pretence of justification.  In this case we know that there is a Town Tenants Commission considering the matter, and that it is about to report.  There is the further limitation that this Bill is only for one year.  Still I want to make this protest at the tendency to perpetuate these most irksome and unjust restrictions on one class in the community who would be rendering a far greater service by providing further houses. <Col N="531" /> Further houses will never be provided by private enterprise as long as restrictions of this kind are on the Statute Book.</P>

      <P>I would like to suggest to Senator Sir John Keane that he is rather inconsistent in complaining of landlords not being allowed to raise rents, seeing that at the last two meetings of the Seanad he complained of the terrible difficulty with which landlords were faced in trying to collect present rents.  Notwithstanding that, he wants the right to raise rents although the landlords are not able to collect the present rents. I thought the old argument about rent restrictions militating against the building of houses had been blown sky-high long ago, seeing that control does not apply to any house built since 1919.  I cannot see how anyone could seriously suggest that the controlling of old houses is going to operate against the building of new ones.</P>

A conference meets on the 10th of June, and if they have not got this Bill from the Free State by then they will meet with the authority of one section of the country but without the authority of another section, to do their own business without interference from England, a position that would be somewhat anomalous and humorous.
