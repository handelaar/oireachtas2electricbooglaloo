      <P>I move: That the Second Stage of the Cork Harbour Bill, 1927, be adjourned until Wednesday, 10th April, 1929, or if the Seanad be not sitting on that day, the next day thereafter on which the Seanad shall sit.  I do this with the assent of the promoters of the Bill.  It may be remembered that this Bill has been before the Seanad now for some time and that its consideration has been deferred pending the findings of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal, which is at present examining into the affairs of ports in the Free State.  Earlier in the year a similar motion for postponing consideration was passed by this House in the hope that the Report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal would be ready before to-day.  That has not happened. The Tribunal is still sitting, so that under the circumstances it seems advisable that consideration of the Bill be further postponed in the confident hope that on the date fixed in the motion the Report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal will have been received.</P>

      <P>I think I ought to mention that during the Recess, on my suggestion, certain Senators from the country undertook to consider in <Col N="1188" /> an informal way the provisions of the Seanad Electoral Bill.  The Committee held several meetings and the Leas-Chathaoirleach (Senator Bennett) kindly undertook to look after the matter.  The Minister for Local Government attended the meetings, with the result that he has practically adopted, and proposes to incorporate in the Bill in the other House, all the suggestions made by the Committee, with one exception; that is, with regard to the question of postal voting. That will come up and will have to be considered and settled in this House. I only wish to express my grateful acknowledgment to this Committee for the trouble they have taken and for the courtesy with which they discharge their duties.</P>

    <Title>PUBLIC BUSINESS. - FORESTRY BILL, 1928&mdash;THIRD STAGE.</Title>
    <P>The Seanad went into Committee.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
    <P>In this Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Lands and Agriculture;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the Principal Act&rdquo; means the Forestry Act, 1919;</P>
    <P>the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; when used in relation to the Principal Act means adapted by the Saorstát Eireann Forestry Commissioners Order, 1927, made on the 11th day of August, 1927, by the Executive Council under Section 7 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922 (No. 2 of 1922) and the Saorstát Eireann Forestry Commissioners (Transfer of Functions) Order, 1927, made on the 12th day of August, 1927, by the Executive Council under Section 9 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 (No. 16 of 1924);</P>
    <P>the word &ldquo;tree&rdquo; includes a tree of any age or at any stage of growth but does not include any fruit tree or any osier;</P>
    <P>the word &ldquo;timber&rdquo; means wood which is the product of any tree; <Col N="1189" /> the word &ldquo;wood&rdquo; save in the foregoing definition includes a plantation;</P>
    <P>the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; means prescribed by regulations made by the Minister under this Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1. Section 1.  To delete in lines 28-29 the words &ldquo;includes a plantation&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;means a plantation the area of which is not less than fifteen statute acres.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the definition section where it is proposed to define the word &ldquo;wood&rdquo; and suggests that the word &ldquo;wood&rdquo; should be confined to an area of at least 15 statute acres.  In introducing the Bill, or at some stage of the debates in the other House, the Minister suggested, I think, that it was not his intention to deal with small patches of trees, but that they should have at least an area of 15 statute acres.  If this amendment is not inserted one or two trees might be regarded as a wood.  I am moving the amendment in order to hear what the Minister has to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, if this amendment is carried the Bill will not apply to any wood of 14 or 14½ acres, or to any wood the area of which is less than 15 acres.  That leaves the Bill useless. It means that so far as the ordinary small plantation is concerned we might as well not pass the Bill.  It means that anyone who likes can cut 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or 14 acres, even though it may be ornamental timber or required for shelter for the holding.  The amendment means that the Bill will only apply to timber covering an area greater than 14 acres. I have continually pointed out that a very large proportion of the trees in the country, such as grow in ditches and hedges, are in areas of less than 14 acres, and if this amendment is carried it really would take away the operation of the Bill from 75 per cent. of the timber of the country.  In fact, it would take away the operation of the Bill from the timber that really needs protection.  No one ever cuts down a <Col N="1190" /> big wood wholesale.  What we are trying to do is to prevent the cutting of nice young plantations of eight or nine acres or less.  I would ask the Senator not to press the amendment as it would ruin the Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 1 put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 2, 3, and 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
      <P>(1)  It shall not be lawful for any person to cut down or uproot any tree unless, not less than twenty-one days before the commencement of the cutting down or uprooting of such tree, the owner thereof or his predecessor in title or some person on behalf of such owner or predecessor shall have given to the sergeant in charge of the Gárda Síochána station nearest to such tree a notice in writing (in this Act referred to as a felling notice) of intention to cut down or uproot such tree.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every felling notice shall be in the prescribed form and shall state the name and address of the owner by or on whose behalf such notice is given, a place in Saorstát Eireann at which documents may be served under this Act and such other particulars as may be prescribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  If any person cuts down or uproots or causes or permits to be cut down or uprooted any tree in contravention of this section, he shall be guilty of an offence under this sub-section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds for every tree so cut down or uprooted or <Col N="1191" /> caused or permitted to be cut down or uprooted.</P>
    <P>(4)  If any person makes in a felling notice any statement which is false or misleading in any material respect he shall be guilty of an offence under this sub-section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding twenty-five pounds or, at the discretion of the Court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months.</P>
    <P>(5)  This section shall not apply to any tree in respect of which a permit has been granted by the Minister under this Act so long as such permit is in force, nor to any tree in respect of which a licence has been granted by the Minister under this Act, nor to any tree the cutting down of which is authorised under Section 34 of the Local Government Act, 1925 (No. 5 of 1925), or Section 98 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927 (No. 27 of 1927), nor to any tree which is the subject of a contract for the sale thereof made before the 1st day of April, 1928, where particulars of such contract verified in the prescribed manner have been furnished to the Minister within one month from the commencement of this Act and such tree is cut down or uprooted within six months from the commencement of this Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 5, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 37 the words &ldquo;twenty-one&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;fourteen.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made it clear on the Second Reading debate that I opposed this principle notwithstanding that it was thought to be obviously capable of amendment. Although I do not think this calls for amendment as much as other items, various people who have to do with forestry operations have represented to me that a good deal of inconvenience and delay is liable to be caused by their being unable to do anything until three weeks have elapsed.  I, therefore, put forward this amendment to reduce the delay by the extent of one week.  I think that the period mentioned gives <Col N="1192" /> plenty of time for the making of the necessary inquiries and reduces the holding-up process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator would be a better judge in this matter than I am, but it appears to me that where a man who owns a wood intends to cut it he comes to a conclusion a few months before that.  I should say that in very rare cases would a man come to a conclusion about cutting a wood within a week.  As a rule, a man knows his intentions for twenty-one days or a month or two months, and he has his mind made up that he is going to cut or to sell certain trees.  The other side of the matter is that the Forestry Branch of the Department considers this matter from the point of view of facilitating the public and is anxious to make the period as short as possible. I may say that it is the considered view of the Forestry Branch that it will be extremely difficult as an administrative matter to deal with applications within fourteen days.  After all, if there are any inquiries at all to be made, there are some cases where they cannot be dealt with within fourteen days.  It is the considered view of the Forestry Branch that at least twenty-one days is the minimum period necessary in some cases.  In other cases they may make up their minds at once.  I would put another point of view to the Senator, and it is this: Supposing the view of the Forestry Branch was right, and that in a great many applications it was found necessary to make inquiries which last over twenty-one days, that they were not able to get all the facts within 21 days or a fortnight, they have a way out of the difficulty, as they can serve a prohibition notice at once, make their inquiries at their leisure, and give a licence to cut afterwards.  That is not exactly a benefit to the owner.  It would be very much better for him that the Forestry Branch should be in a position to make up their minds within twenty-one days than to serve a prohibition notice in order to get time to make the necessary inquiries and then to give a licence.  I am afraid if the amendment is carried that that will be the effect.  I do not know much about woods myself, or about the timber trade.  The Senator is a better <Col N="1193" /> judge whether it is a real inconvenience to a man to have to wait twenty-one days instead of fourteen days when he makes up his mind.  I would ask him to remember that it is the considered view of the Forestry Branch that they will not be able to get all the information they require within fourteen days.</P>

      <P>In view of what the Minister has said as to the difficulties, I ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment by leave withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. BAGWELL Mr. BAGWELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 5, sub-section (3).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;the total fine in any one case not to exceed one hundred pounds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a case in which <i>bona fide</i> mistakes can be made with regard to cutting trees other than those of which notice was given.  Owners of trees are often not very well educated and very often those whom they employ may be ignorant men in matters where papers are concerned.  It is very easy to see how a penalty could be incurred through a mistake.  The men actually cutting the timber may misinterpret what they are told by the owner or by the owner's representative who obtained the permit.  I think there ought to be some safeguard under this Section so that a person would not be liable to a fine of £100 which he would incur through a mistake to the extent of cutting twenty small trees.  I think it is evident that cases might occur through a genuine mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, that is the maximum fine.  Where trees are cut by mistake and where there is a licence to cut a wood and the workmen cut not only the wood but in addition a plantation, is there any likelihood that an owner would be mulcted in the way suggested?  It would be, first of all, for the Department to say whether there would be a prosecution and, of course, it would take into account a <i>bona fide</i> mistake if there was any evidence to that effect.  When the case came before the District Justice or the appropriate Court if the owner could show what happened and his <i>bona fides</i> there is no compulsion on the Judge or the <Col N="1194" /> District Justice to impose the maximum fine.  He might impose a fine of a penny or a farthing or he need not impose any fine if he wishes.  There will be very few cases in which the Forestry Branch can step in and say to an owner: &ldquo;You cannot cut these trees down.&rdquo;  Assuming for the sake of argument that they are exercising these functions pretty widely and that this amendment is carried, a man might cut a big wood somewhere in Wicklow, near Bray, which for some reason&mdash;it might be a representation from the Tourist Development Association&mdash; should not be cut.  It might be a valuable one.  It might be well worth a man's while simply to carry the penalty of £100 and cut the wood.</P>

      <P>Section 5, sub-section (5).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;nor to any tree which was planted by the owner of the land or his predecessor in title.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a rather important amendment, because it guarantees in the first instance to the person who plants a tree the right to cut it down when it suits him.  We must remember that the owner of the land, whether farmer or landlord, has been paying for it for years, by rent, rates and taxes.  It is only right that he should be permitted to cut down a tree in order to recoup himself for the outlay and the expenses that he incurred.  It may be said that trees are the property of the nation and not of the individual.  I hold that if the nation wishes to become owner of the trees that the individual who went to the expense of planting them should be paid, seeing that he also paid for the land during the period of their growth.</P>

But apart from that it would be a very serious thing.  The amendment would simply make hay of the Act by allowing a person to cut without any restriction any tree within 33 yards of any wall.  Imagine what would happen. The owner of the wood would measure 33 yards and cut away.  This amendment would render the Bill useless.</P>

      <P>(h)  a tree so situate as to be injurious to tillage operations or the saving of farm crops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that it is much more important for the welfare of the country that there should be no impediment to tillage operations and to the cultivation of the land for crops, and the saving of crops, than the preservation of scenery.  It would be all very well if we could live on scenery, but, unfortunately, we cannot, and I hold that any clause which would hamper the farmer in carrying on his tillage operations is one which would be not only injurious to agriculture, but to the whole country.  Anyone who has any experience of tillage operations knows that in very many cases it is impossible to till land where trees are situated in such a way as to prevent the wind from drying the crops or the sun from shining on them.  I am sure if such a question as that were left to the Department itself, and if permission were <Col N="1200" /> asked to cut those trees which it could be shown were injurious to tillage operations, they would raise no objection to giving permission to have them cut down.  However, I think it ought to be stated clearly in the Bill that it is the intention of the Seanad that no obstacle shall be put in the way of farmers who desire to carry on tillage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(h) a tree forming portion of the timber on any lands when such timber forms a substantial portion <Col N="1201" /> of the security for money advanced as a mortgage of or payable in respect of a charge upon such lands, provided (i) that such mortgage or charge was an existing mortgage or charge at the date of the passing of this Act, and (ii) that the felling of any such tree is for the purpose of a sale the proceeds whereof are to be applied in payment of the moneys secured by such mortgage or payable under such charge.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment intended to protect mortgages and persons who have charges on land, which charges were in existence before the passing of this Bill.  There must be a large number of cases in which money has been lent on the security of land on which there is a considerable amount of timber. There are certainly many cases of family settlements where a good deal of the security for family charges for younger children and that kind of thing consists of demesne timber.  What this amendment seeks to provide is this, that where a substantial portion of the security for a loan on mortgage, or a substantial amount of the security for a charge on an estate, not necessarily in the shape of a mortgage, consists of timber, that timber should be outside the provisions of this Bill, provided that the mortgage or the charge was created before the passing of the Act, provided that the timber is a substantial portion of the security, and provided also that the proceeds of the sale of the timber are to be used in paying off the mortgage or charge.  I think that is necessary.</P>

      <P>Well, when you are passing an Act of that description it is surely well to protect the people who honestly and according to the law have got a certain charge on the land, part of the bargain being that the woods should be sold and the money paid out. Unless you put in some such amendment as this, this Bill will take away all the rights that the man who lent this money had when he made the loan. I think the word &ldquo;substantially&rdquo; describes the whole situation.  You are not going to allow them to interfere in a petty matter, but where a large loan has been given on property, and where one of the conditions was that certain woods were to be sold to pay off all the money advanced, are we to pass an Act which deprives the man who lent the money of any chance of getting his money out of such a wood?  Surely it is wise to put in an amendment to protect his rights.  That is all that this amendment seems to me to do.  This and the other matter with which we have been dealing are two very different questions.  It would be for the Minister probably in these circumstances <Col N="1203" /> to decide whether a claim which is put in by the mortgagee or the owner of the charge is a right one or not, and the Minister will very easily be able to decide whether a man is putting up a trivial case in order to cut down a wood which should not be cut down, or whether it is really a matter of depriving someone of a right to which he is perfectly entitled.</P>

He said that the amendment in its present form leaves it in the power of the mortgagee alone to determine what is a substantial portion.  I think that that is an infirmity in the clause.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a little technical, perhaps.  Before this Act a number of these properties in the hands of peasant proprietors, as they are called, or in the hands of the original landlords, have been made subject to mortgages; that is to say, they have been pledged as security for money advanced. A substantial part of the security may be timber.  Therefore, it is the mortgagee's property and not the owner's property, and you are ensuring that you can cut timber in a case of that kind.  The mortgage carries with <Col N="1204" /> it for the benefit of the mortgagee everything on the land, including the timber, and it may very well happen that the timber is the real security therefore it is a real matter of equity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the case of a man who buys land, on which there is a forest, without a mortgage. He pays for it himself.  He wants to cut it and looks for permission to do so; but the Minister, in the interests of the appearance of the place, or for some national purpose, prohibits him from cutting these trees and gives him no compensation.  If instead of buying that land with his own money he had raised a mortgage on it the bank, or whoever advanced the money, has the right to cut it.  He must be allowed to provide the timber as a substantial portion of the securities of the land.  It all depends on how the land has been got. If a mortgage has been raised on it the timber must be cut, but if the man paid his own money and there is no mortgage on it he can be prevented from cutting it and there is no compensation. Why compensate the mortgagee when you will not allow the ordinary owner to cut it when it is his property? I fail to see where the equity comes in there.  Simply because a mortgage has been raised the timber must be cut, no matter what the national interests are. If not the owner is not allowed to cut it and there is no compensation.  I see no equity in that arrangement.</P>

      <P>He has no grievance if he bought land and considered that he got good value for the money he expended by reason of the area of land he got.  He did not consider that the timber was a substantial and a valuable portion of the holding.  There is, of course, something in what the Senator said, but supposing you agree with his point of view do you not open the door very wide?  Any man who bought land ten, fifteen or twenty years ago might say: &ldquo;I had an eye on it for the trees.  It is true that I did not cut them, but I intended to do so.&rdquo;  A very big proportion of land has changed hands in the last twenty-five or thirty years, and it would be open to anyone to say: &ldquo;Well, I had intended to cut and sell the timber, but for one reason or another I did not do so.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that logically what Senator O'Farrell has said is probably correct.  We are passing this Forestry Bill because we believe the Bill itself is good for the country, and we are anxious to set up a state of affairs which will prevent the destruction of the trees of the country. If a man has bought land, having been obliged to borrow, with a mortgage on that land, having obtained the mortgage because of the fact that there were trees on it which he was about to cut down, if this Bill suddenly comes into effect and no provision is made for that it means that this man has bought his land, there is a mortgage, and he is liable to be pressed for the payment which he undertook to make at a certain <Col N="1206" /> time, which would allow time for cutting down the trees, and a very real hardship would be imposed on the owner of the land.  Senator O'Farrell, logically, I think, is correct, but he assumes that the only hardship is against the bank, or whoever holds the mortgage.  The hardship cuts both ways, and for that reason, though in the strictest logic it may be that we should make exactly the same provision for the man who had the money and could afford to buy the land as for the man who had to borrow in order to cut down the trees afterwards to pay it, I do not think from the point of view of avoiding a real hardship it is wise to act according to strict logic.</P>

      <P>Unfair discrimination will be carried out if this amendment is passed.  It appears to me that the whole substance of this amendment is to protect moneylenders.  That is the brutal fact.  In 1919 and 1920 a large amount of land changed hands. Numerous farmers added to their holdings by buying land.  Some of them bought it with a view to selling some of the timber, and in this Bill it is proposed, that these people shall not be allowed to cut the timber unless with the permission of the Department.  But the amendment proposes that where money has been lent to the man who bought the land the moneylender is to be protected, though the real farmer is not to be protected.  I think it is absurd to give moneylenders facilities to cut down woods because they lend money to the farmers, whereas if a man bought land with his own money he is not allowed to cut down his wood.  I think that the amendment is ridiculous and unfair.</P>

      <P>New section.  Before Section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>9.  When a prohibition order has been served or a licence withheld, an appeal on the ground that the action of the Minister having regard to all the circumstances is not reasonable shall lie to a judge of the High Court nominated for this purpose by the President of the High Court.</P>
      <P>These two amendments really stand together.  It is remarkable, I think, that this Bill, which permits of an interference with the liberty of the individual to do what he likes with his own to, I think, an unprecedented extent, should make no provision for an appeal in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision whatever for any appeal at law against an unreasonable or tryannical withholding of a permit.  The point has been put to me that the amendment would set up an impracticable state of affairs because the judge would, in fact, be made head of a technical department.  But I am not impressed by the point, as judges are constantly being called upon to <Col N="1210" /> adjudicate upon matters about which they know very little.  But, as men of brains and experience, trained in dealing with evidence and being also in a position of great independence, they are specially qualified to dispense justice.  An appeal at law is a great safeguard of liberty and right, and if provided in this case is not really likely to lead to any undue difficulty or confusion. No one will appeal and run the risk of considerable expense unless he feels that he has a real grievance, nor would a judge be likely to reverse the decision of the Minister unless he were fully convinced that a real case of injustice did exist.  We are legislating for all time, but while the Bill remains as it is we have no guarantee for the future.  I hope that the House will realise that if the Bill is passed in its present form, so far from tending to make Ireland a better wooded country it will tend to have precisely the opposite effect, because people will not incur the expense of planting and maintaining woods and paying rates and taxes upon them for many years if they have no guarantee that, when the time comes, they will be able to realise the value which they have themselves created.</P>
    <P>These are my reasons for moving these two amendments.  I hope that the Minister will accept one of them, the one which he thinks the more convenient. If he does not like either of them perhaps he would say which he considers the least objectionable.  I have put down the alternative amendment because I can see myself the advantage of the one over the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the number of obvious difficulties about an amendment of this kind, I am in favour of it.  This Forestry Bill is certainly the most autocratic legislation that ever was introduced in a democratic Parliament, and nothing but the good of the country could justify a measure like it.  We agreed that the good of the country was so obviously at stake that this Bill ought to pass its Second Reading.  We did give it a Second Reading, but at the same time a number of us felt that we ought to do our best, as far <Col N="1211" /> as would be possible consistently with the good of the country, to protect the private citizen who owns trees.  That is the object of this amendment.  What are the objections to it?  I know the great objection to it on the part of the Minister is this: that it practically takes the administration of this Act out of his hands and puts it into the hands of the Judicial Commissioner, if one form of the amendment is passed, or into the hands of a Judge of the High Court in case another form of it is passed.  To a certain extent that is true.  An amendment giving an appeal of this kind is only justified because there never was a Minister put in the position in which the Minister is put under this Bill.  We are not sure of an apostolic succession of Ministers like Mr. Hogan.  If we were, this amendment would probably not be necessary. We are not assured of that, and therefore I submit that it is absolutely necessary that some protection should be given to the ordinary citizen against what, in the future, may occur &mdash;some unsatisfactory decision of the Minister under the terms of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now so much for the principal objection to the amendment.  The other objection which I foresee is this: that it is not a usual thing to give a judge the right of deciding questions of mere administration of Acts of Parliament. He is there to construe an Act of Parliament and not to decide what is the proper mode of its administration.  To a certain extent that is also true, but you must remember that the due administration of an Act like this depends on questions of fact, and dozens of our Acts do give to a judge the right to decide an appeal on questions of fact.  Furthermore, the appeal under the first of these amendments, that is to the Judicial Commissioner, which is the one that I prefer, gives the right of appeal to a judge who, although he is a member of the High Court of Justice, is also the head of a great department and is himself engaged five times out of six in performing his duties in purely administrative work.  Therefore, you are not really against the principle that a judge should not be a referee on mere matters of administration.  I <Col N="1212" /> submit that this is an amendment which the Minister ought to accept.</P>

      <P>The general purpose of this Bill has my hearty support.  I imagine it was conceived in the interests of forestry in this country.  I am and always have been very much interested in Irish forestry and in the re-afforestation of the country, having planted trees extensively myself.  It seems to me, however, that the Bill confers very stringent powers on the head of the Agricultural Department.  I presume that under this Bill he will have the decision in all forestry matters.  It seems fair and reasonable that there should be some appeal against the decisions of the Department on questions relating to the cutting down of trees which people themselves have planted.  I did not quite follow Senator Brown in his disquisition on the proper course to adopt, but the Senator is in a very much better position than I am to deal with these matters.  But on the general principle that the Senator supported, I feel myself quite in accord. The Senator reminded us that there is no apostolic succession in the head of the Department of Agriculture or the forestry branch of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that to-morrow or the next day or perhaps some years from now there may be a change in the head of that Department, and I think it would be just as well if those of us who are interested in forestry could be assured that we would receive sympathetic consideration at the hands of the public generally.  It would be well, too, I think, if individual owners of woods who felt they were aggrieved by the decisions of the Department of Agriculture were given some chance of appealing against these decisions.  As far as the general principle of the Bill is concerned.  I am thoroughly in accord with it.  This is a very important question for this country, and I am very glad that the Minister has found time to deal with it.  I wish the Bill in every sense a complete success.  It may be advisable, for the purpose of reassuring people who are really interested in forestry, that whatever complaints they may have in the future against the administration of the Act will be attended <Col N="1213" /> to by the Department of Agriculture. To my mind the best way to do that is to give to those people the statutory right of appeal against any decision which may seem to them to work hardships or injury in their cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill confers certain powers on the Minister for Agriculture in regard to afforestation. The amendment before the House, to my mind, proposes to take that power from the Minister and leaves it to the Judicial Commissioner or a member of the High Court to decide what amount of afforestation is necessary in the country and what is not.  I do not think that is desirable.  If a mistake has been made by the Minister and if in consultation with his foresters he decides that a wood ought not to be cut down&mdash;even if he makes a mistake in deciding that&mdash;then I think those people who pretend to give lip service to forestry ought not to grumble, because after all, will we not have more trees in the country as a result of the Minister's mistake?  I think if the House were to accept these amendments they would be cutting fundamentally across the whole Bill.  In the Bill the Minister is set down as the authority to decide all these questions. Under these amendments it is proposed to set up a new authority in the person of a Judicial Commissioner or a Judge of the High Court.  I do not think the amendments are desirable, and I am not going to support them.</P>

      <P>The more one looks into this Bill the more obscure it becomes.  The Minister is given the power of prohibition.  It is entirely in his discretion whether he will grant a licence at all or not.  He may simply stand on the form of prohibition order and give no reason.  He may issue or refuse a licence.  If he issues a licence he may attach to it conditions for replanting. Suppose he says that he will not issue a licence he is not bound to give any reason.  He may consider that trees which the owner desires to cut down have an æsthetic value, and for that or for some other fantastic reason he may refuse a licence to cut.  I think that is a very dangerous position to put him into.  The Minister may say that a whole wood is necessary for <Col N="1214" /> some æsthetic purpose, and while he gives no compensation to the owner he may keep the trees growing, though they are deteriorating year by year, and there would be no appeal.  All that is implicit in the Bill.  I think that the Minister should give his reasons in cases where he refuses to give a licence. I think that this House should safeguard in some way the conditions under which licences are granted. They are to be granted on the prescribed form, and that is all we know. The amendment, so far as it gives protection to an owner, is welcome.  By Section 8 of the Bill the Minister is already given power to do exactly what he likes, to make a prohibition order or not.  Then follows the licence if the Minister chooses to give it, but only if he chooses to give it.  In this case the House should insist that safeguards are provided for the owner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the amendment is quite clear, that the owner is to have the right of appeal either against a prohibition order or the refusal of a licence.  It gives him the right of appeal in any event.  Senator Bagwell spoke of an appeal in law. What is the law?  The forestry branch of the Department of Agriculture refuses a licence.  They do not give any reasons.  Assume, for the sake of argument, that there is an appeal in the case of a man who has been refused a licence to cut a wood because it is a good shelter belt, valuable not only to himself but to his neighbour.  Under the Bill as it stands he is refused a licence, and there is no obligation to state any reasons.  Supposing the amendment is passed and he is given the right to appeal, what law is the Judicial Commissioner to administer? What are the considerations that he is to take into account?  The man has been refused a licence.  He goes before the Judicial Commissioner and says that he wants to cut these trees, that the Department prevented him from doing so, and that he wants an order from the judge enabling him to cut. What are the considerations that the judge is to take into account?  Remember it is not the Minister in these matters that counts.  It is the forestry branch of the Department itself.  That <Col N="1215" /> always has been the way, and always will be the way.  Of course, the Department's policy is coloured by national policy.  But in detail the policy of the Government of the day goes down through the departments. Subject to that, it is the branch of the Department itself that carries out that policy.</P>
      <P>When speaking, Senator Bagwell stated that he thought that possibly one effect of this Bill would be to prevent people from planting trees, because when the Bill is law there will be no real security for them that they may cut the trees when they are ripe and fit for cutting.  But by giving the right of appeal to a judge is there not the very same uncertainty?  The judge may prevent people from cutting because the judge is in exactly the same position as the Minister for the reason that he has no law to administer.  He is merely performing an administrative act.  He has no law whatever to guide him.  He will act merely on his own opinion, the opinion of one irresponsible man.  When I use the word &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo; I mean it in the sense that the judge is not responsible to the Dáil or to any elected body.  He is absolutely independent and may do what he likes.  He can afford himself the luxury, in a case of this kind, of having no law to administer, and can simply take into account only his own personal views on the question of forestry.  He can make these the views of the forestry department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Brown that this is a drastic Bill.  There are certain powers in the Bill given to the Minister which are very wide.  Pretty wide powers are given to the forestry branch.  But, after all, the Minister is responsible to somebody.  He is elected by the people and he must be a member of the Government.  There must be a majority of the people of the country behind that Government.  For the moment, he is responsible to them.  His actions may be questioned every day.  On the other hand, the amendment proposes to give to a judge complete and supreme administrative powers with no law of any kind to guide him, making him absolutely independent, and giving him the <Col N="1216" /> right to do what he likes at his own sweet will, and in such a way that his judgment cannot be upset.  The judge, as I have said, is not responsible to the Dáil or to any elected body.  His judgments are as likely to be fallible as the judgments of the person who happens for the time being to be at the head of the Department.  He may be in forestry matters a crank, to put it that way. He has no national policy to guide him, and yet under this amendment he is to have all these autocratic powers that the Minister should not get.</P>
    <P>I ask Senator Brown whether he agrees with this as a general principle; that it is not nearly so dangerous to give, let us say, the political head of a department these powers as it is to give them in an unlimited way to a judge. The political head of a department is not independent.  He is responsible to the Legislature.  He can always be criticised and he can be dismissed.  If you once give a man who is absolutely independent, who has no responsibility to anyone, unlimited powers, without any law to guide him, then, in my opinion, you have a real autocrat, and one autocrat may be just as bad as another, given equal powers.  Possibly the giving of autocratic powers to a judge may be the worst of the two in the long run.  Though perhaps it may be unusual to give the Minister the powers asked in this Bill, the situation is unusual, but I put it to the Seanad that it would be three times and ten times as unusual or unsound to give these administrative powers uncontrolled to a judge who is independent and irresponsible.  I use &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo; in the sense that the judge is not responsible to anyone but to his own opinions.</P>
    <P>I am against this amendment because I think it is unsound.  In my opinion, if the amendment were inserted in the Bill, I think the correct course for the political head of the department would be simply to tell the forestry branch not to issue any prohibition orders at all.  I think he would be bound to do that in the long run.  Governments change and times change.  The forestry position may be entirely different in five or ten years to what it is to-day. It may be such as to force whatever <Col N="1217" /> Government is in power to adopt a definite line on forestry matters.  They will be debarred from doing that if this amendment is inserted unless they repeal this Act.  It will not be their policy that will be administered, but the policy of the judge.  I think there is no doubt of that.  If the amendment is inserted it is not the policy of the Government of the day that will persist in forestry matters, but the policy of the judge, and the judge should not have a policy on forestry or any other matter.</P>

I know quite well that he can be very convincing and that his manner is very plausible.  His arguments were so nice as almost to carry me away.  That, of course, is all very well.  We know, of course, that as long as the present Minister is at the head of the Department that we can all feel quite happy, but the question that presents itself to us is: who is going to follow him?  Is it unreasonable that we should ask to have an umpire to whom we can appeal?  What would the position be if we were to have a Minister who had a fad that under no circumstances should trees be cut down, a man who looked on trees as a sort of ancient monument that had got to be preserved at all costs.</P>

      <P>I suggest that you should put something into the Bill to guide the Minister, a clause giving the Minister power to prohibit the cutting of trees, but providing that he shall not make that order without having regard to the ordinary principles of good forestry.  If that is done, then all the judge will have to decide is whether or not in his order the Minister has had regard to the principles of good forestry.  The aggrieved person can go before the judge and produce expert evidence on the matter.  It will then be for the judge to decide whether or not the Minister, in making his order, has had regard to the principles as set out by the expert evidence.  That <Col N="1218" /> is a thing that I think judges are called upon to do every day.  The very fact that it would be necessary for the aggrieved person to produce expert witnesses would, I think, be a safeguard to the Government against a lot of tiresome and vexatious appeals.  In the nature of things it would cost a good deal to produce expert evidence and to bring appeals, and no one would think of doing so unless he thought he had a reasonably good case.  I hope that the Minister is not going to sit absolutely tight on his objections to allowing some sort of appeal on this question.</P>

      <P>Speaking on a previous occasion on this Bill I stressed the point as to the anxiety that would naturally arise in the minds of those with forestry plantations as to what was happening, as to what mental processes were operating in the Minister's mind during the twenty-one days, or as to whom he would take into consultation in arriving at his decision regarding the granting of a permit or the issuing of a prohibition order.  That was the dark period with no means of lifting the veil to see what was going to emerge at the end of the twenty-one days.  The Minister stated that the amendment proposed to leave the right of appeal to a judge who is uncontrolled and who can exercise his own sweet will in deciding the matter placed before him, but I submit he is controlled by the law as it stands.  I do not think judges can lightly set aside Acts of Parliament and give decisions just according to their own sweet will. The Minister has to state reasons why he arrives at a decision not to grant a felling order, so that there is something tangible to go on in knowing what is influencing the minds of his advisers. There are equities in the case that have to be considered.  The owner has a right to his trees, and if that right is filched from him he has a certain grievance.  I think he is entitled at least to know why a prohibition order was given against him.  As the case stands he has no opportunity of even forming his own opinion as to whether the Minister's order is well-founded or not.  In my opinion the Minister should be bound to give his reasons for the prohibition order.</P>

The Minister himself might be glad of that, and he might find that he had been misinformed and had issued an order on wrong assumptions.  Therefore, if he states his reasons the individual who owns the property would know all the reasons, and if he is able to contest them he gets another opportunity of doing so.  I think that might be a reasonable way out of the difficulty.</P>

That would get over the difficulty.  I quite appreciate that he should get over that but I am not prepared to withdraw this amendment in favour of an undertaking to give a further opportunity for review by the Minister after he refuses, because this is most frightfully drastic.  I do not know if the House realises that it is a tremendous interference with the liberties of the people.  I yield to no one in my desire to see the country better timbered, but I do not think this section would help in that direction, for under it nobody has any guarantee that he will be able to realise on the timber on which he has spent capital in planting and has paid rates and taxes for years.  An appeal would be a great safeguard.  It is quite true that a judge may be an autocrat, but the odds are distinctly against two autocrats being bad.  I am quite prepared to withdraw this amendment on the understanding that I will bring up practically the same amendment with an addition so as to get over the difficulty about a judge not having anything definite to deal with on appeal.

    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> I do not know if this amendment will find the Minister in so accommodating a spirit.  Picture to yourselves the position of an owner who is badly off and finding it a great difficulty to live. Supposing his only assets are his woods, that he has two sons to start in life, and the only money he can lay his hands on is in timber, but he will not be allowed to cut these woods without the intolerable condition of replanting.  These woods had been planted by the owner and cared for, and rates and taxes paid for them.  They are the owner's property just as much as his stock or shares or any other property he possesses. He is unfortunate to possess only these woods.  If there was a lien on the property by the Land Commission, there might be some justification for a measure of security.  If there is no charge on the property and it is held in fee-simple, and that these woods are the only asset a man possesses, why should he not be allowed to realise so as to enable him to educate his children and give them a start in life?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The considerations that the Senator put forward are considerations which deny the whole validity of the Bill.  They may be good, bad, or indifferent, but they go to the root of the matter.  If we were to accept it that fee-simple farm property ought to be disposed of the same as stocks and shares there would be no reason for this Bill.  If an owner is hard up he can cut his woods.  Take the case of a farmer who has a farm of land with woods on it and he has sons. His farm is subject to the Land Commission annuity.  He is hard up, and he has three or four sons he wants to start in life.  Yet he cannot cut the wood.  No question of security enters into it.  It is not because it interferes with the security of the Land Commission this was introduced.  If one man has two sons and wants money, and another man has six sons and he wants to realise too, probably in both cases they would be allowed to realise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. GOGARTY Dr. GOGARTY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Government be requested to consider the proposals of Senator Sir John Griffith with a view to establishing forthwith a national terminal harbour at Galway for high-speed transatlantic passenger and mail services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position at present is that Ireland in spite of the advantages of its position and harbours so far as transatlantic trade is concerned is practically a sea suburb of Liverpool. It is a day or two nearer to America, depending on the speed of the ships, and yet all European bound ships go around this country and leave it marooned.  As Sir John Griffith has pointed out, there would be a saving of time and money to English companies &mdash;a saving amounting to one and a half millions to any company running six ships, that is a bi-weekly service. Slower ships would be given the advantage of using Galway instead of Liverpool. That is a matter for the English companies, whose interest in the existing ports is too strong.  One might as well expect Lord Aberdeen to provide the Shannon scheme as to expect the English shipping companies to strip their docks in Liverpool and come to Galway.  If it is to be done at all it has to be done from other considerations which will constrain the shipping companies to consider the advantages of the position of this island.  The competition for shipping is in the North Atlantic at present.  In no case can ships create a harbour, but harbours can create trade.  By providing a harbour on the West of Ireland we can induce the more enterprising of the two shipping companies which are competing to use that harbour.  It is not generally known that sixty-four per cent. of tourists who leave America go to the Continent never touch the British Isles.  In the case of that sort of tourist trade if vessels were diverted to Galway it would save a day, two <Col N="1227" /> days or two and a half days.  If you had a terminal port there, if only for mail services, it should pay, for that would avoid the delay that is caused by fog outside Liverpool, and it would provide the advantage of a quick transport from Galway to Dublin.</P>
    <P>I should think that if the railways showed as much enterprise as they could afford, and with a little trade to justify it, Dublin could easily be brought within three hours of Barna. Senator Sir John Griffith with his experience showed the advantages of Barna and its advantageous situation as regards the material for constructing a Transatlantic port.  There are heavy lodes of granite in the vicinity of Barna deep water, and sea room for manoeuvring.  The advantages from the shipping point of view are nil at present.  The only advantage that can arise is to create competition by putting a harbour near to the source of traffic, and that is America.  Remember that the south-west of Connemara is the most poverty-stricken and pestilential part of this country.  If relief is to be given to the Gaeltacht in that district the aim should be at putting it on an economic basis.  I cannot think of any better relief than putting down a work which, not only would not have the fate of all relief works, whether for ornament or otherwise, but which would be useful and would open to the light of day the south-west of Connemara.  The construction of a big harbour there would be about one-sixth of the cost of the Shannon scheme and less than one-fourth of the money already expended on roads.  The estimate suggested comes to about two millions of money.  Certain people who are interested in foreign shipping reaching Ireland suggested one and a half millions when it was proposed to link it up by an air service.</P>
    <P>When one goes to see the works on the Shannon it is a revelation to realise what extraordinary work can be done, and what the immense resources of this country really are when coupled with enterprise and determination.  To see that man-made Niagara at Ardnacrusha would do one good, and when you think at the same time that the prosperity of the country is not so intimately <Col N="1228" /> bound up with the creation of an electricity supply as with the breaking down of what is really the key-note of our whole position, and a thing on which the existence of the Free State depends, that is the stranglehold of outside shipping, it will be seen how urgently necessary it is to direct those resources to this relief.  Any country depending for sea-borne trade on shipping, and freights which cannot be controlled, is being constantly stultified when imposing tariffs.  Every tariff we create is turned against us if we cannot call the tune of the freights.</P>
    <P>You put a tariff of 33? per cent. on boots, but the freight on boots coming to this country is £2 a ton readymade, while when we send out for the raw hide the cost is £8 a ton.  Where is your 33? per cent?  So far from being a free country, England's customs houses are on the sea&mdash;not her revenue is an index of her wealth, but the returns of the earnings of her mercantile marine.  There is some excuse for me arriving at that conclusion so late in the day, because it took Arthur Griffith so many years to realise that it was not the revenue returns gave any indication of England's wealth but her mercantile marine. This country is completely in the hands of the mercantile marine of another country, which, no matter how friendly, is bound to give the shareholders at least 5 per cent. dividend on their investment.  Many of the ships concerned in our trade were bought when they were four times dearer than they would be now; hence the great advance per head in the freight of cattle going to Liverpool.</P>
    <P>Galway is not concerned with the cattle trade, but it is concerned with the maintenance of competition between the shipping companies, and I maintain that competition there will reduce freights and give advantages to the customer.  At present there is no competition whatever.  There is not a single company in Ireland except the Limerick Steamship Company, in the hands of the Irish people, which is vitally engaged in the country's prosperity. A western port would have another advantage, and this is important <Col N="1229" /> when one thinks that the death of civilisation is caused by the trekking towards the cities.  It is estimated that with our good roads that within 50 miles of Dublin there will be a general exodus from the country into the city. That is not healthy.  In a small country it is disastrous.  If you had a western Liverpool in Galway, as Ireland's position would justify, you would have a balance; you would have an agricultural country within such easy reach of the city that the people might be satisfied to remain in agricultural districts, and not trek in and swell all that is associated with big cities.  That is the chief advantage.</P>
    <P>The gist of my motion is that this cannot be done without Government enterprise just as the Shannon scheme was carried out.  It cannot be done by the English shipping companies, as they are not interested.  It is better for them to spend the 24 hours outside the Mersey than go out of their circuit. Liverpool is already suffering from Southampton.  If my proposal is carried out it will suffer more, but really not finally suffer at all for this reason: The saving, according to Senator Sir John Griffith's figures in the running of ships, would make up for any loss that they might have for the dereliction of one or two docks there.  It is not a case of kid gloves.  It is a case of competition and of using this country's natural advantages, because for many years the railways have fallen short of any deep-water harbours there are. The history of Galway recalls competition of such a kind as was not perhaps very honourable.  Ships coming from New York were snatched up to prevent them getting into Galway, and one that did get in was run on the only rock in the harbour.  I have not gone into the figures, which is a matter for experts, but the important thing to which I wish to draw attention is that the natural position of this country presents Europe to America almost 24 hours earlier than any other country.  We should bear in mind that it is not British-bound trade can be got by bringing Europe nearer to America, but 64 per cent.&mdash;the predominating trade &mdash;Europe-bound Americans may come here.</P>
    <P>I have said nothing about the air <Col N="1230" /> because it is a moot point if air services have not reached as much perfection as the nature of the services will permit.  All air services are handicapped by the fact that the aircraft have to maintain their own weight in the elements.  It is different with shipping.  If you increase the aeroplane in size you do not do more than double the carrying capacity. If you increase a ship to twice its size you multiply its carrying capacity by eight.  I may say that there are at present in existence machines in Frederichshaven to carry 60 passengers.  If you wish to have these machines waiting in Galway, and a ship coming from America to Galway in four days, the capitals of Europe are only four days and nine hours from America.  Three of these would carry 180 passengers, and that would pay any company.  As long as we do not allow this country to continue in its present position of being marooned, freights that are now a stranglehold on our trade will fall as competition increases. As long as the cost of sea-transport of our external trade remains in the hand of an external power all our tariff and protective measures can be stultified by a <i>pro rata</i> increase in freights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am bound to speak against the motion.  Nobody would be happier than I if an Irish port could be made the main port to deal with Transatlantic traffic.  I believe if any port were in that position this way would be the right way.  The proposed port suffered from certain disadvantages to which other ports in the past have been open.  On principle I could not vote for this motion, because it involves requesting the Government to spend very large sums of public money on a commercial venture of an extremely risky character.  If the case was so good as represented it would be done long ago.  The very fact that it remains undone, and can only be done by the Government and public money, is what put me against it.  Besides, I have grave doubts of the success of any such scheme for certain reasons which occurred to me, as having some knowledge of the reasons why people choose <Col N="1231" /> certain routes of travel and avoid others.  Although there would be a saving in time, it is extremely questionable if that saving in time would compensate for other things.  In the first place, with regard to passengers in a great hurry to get to their destination, I doubt if the saving in time would compensate them in the case of Great Britain.  There would be two additional changes there, and in the case of Continental Europe four.  That would be a very serious thing.</P>
      <P>In addition, instead of landing at the ultimate port of landing in the ship in which they started, they would have Galway, Kingstown and Holyhead to deal with in the case of Great Britain, and Dover and Calais if they were going on to the Continent of Europe. That would be all very tiring and very harrassing, and I think a venture of that kind in Transatlantic service would really fail to capture the bulk of the passenger traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards traffic other than passengers, Liverpool has been talked of a great deal in this connection.  Liverpool is one of the greatest ports in the world, but it is by no means the greatest port.  It has great physical drawbacks as a port.  It has very great objection from that point of view, but it has great commercial advantages by reason of the fact that it has Lancashire and Yorkshire behind it, where an enormous amount of goods are made, which goods have to be exported by the shortest route.  I am afraid I cannot say that there is anything in Ireland now, or that there is likely to be anything, which will ever compete with Lancashire and Yorkshire as an attraction for ships for return cargoes, and consequently a venture of the kind advocated by the motion is really thrown back upon passenger traffic which looks for the most rapid transit possible, and I do not think that that is a good enough thing to justify a very big expenditure of public money.  It is a very risky thing, and it must be remembered that while for years the bulk of the people going to the Continent from America, or a large proportion of them, came to Liverpool, went across England, and then took ship again to some <Col N="1232" /> Channel port, the shipping companies found some years ago that a desire to get to the last point and to do all the sea journey in the same ship was so strong that they abandoned Liverpool where they had been going for years, and went to Southampton, from which their ships went to Cherbourg.  A scheme like this would be the very negation of that system, and for that reason with regret I find myself compelled to vote against the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGriffith" hpid="Sir JOHN GRIFFITH Sir JOHN GRIFFITH">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN GRIFFITH</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Gogarty has mentioned my name in connection with this motion, I think the Seanad will expect me to say something about it.  I do think that there can be no division of opinion in our minds as to the desirability, if it is possible, of passing as large a number of American passengers through this country as possible.  Our isolated condition has been a drawback to us in the past, and many of us longed to see more passenger traffic passing through this country.  It may be said, of course, that we have a very efficient service in connection with the Transatlantic trade, with a number of steamers that call at Cork, Moville and Belfast, but when we come to analyse it, it appears that the attraction to these boats to touch Ireland is simply to take advantage of our losses in emigration.  They come here to capture a trade which is represented by something like 26,000 emigrants annually.  That is not the direction in which I have ever thought of the importance of the Transatlantic service by high-speed passenger and mail service to the western side of this country.  I have looked forward to it as a tremendous advantage, if it can be accomplished, to our people and to our country at large.  It would inevitably lead to a considerable influx of visitors to the country, and necessarily of money passing through it.</P>
      <P>I should like, with the permission of the Seanad, to read a short preface which I wrote in connection with this subject in the year 1923 when I published the second edition of a pamphlet on sites for a Western port:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first edition of this paper was published in March, 1918, during the Great War.  The submarine menace had reached its most acute stage. <Col N="1233" /> The food supplies of the British Isles were within a measurable distance of exhaustion.  Germany was making its final bid for supremacy, and the Americans had but recently thrown in their lot with the Allies.</P>
    <P>As an Irish Lights Commissioner I had during the war sailed round Ireland.  I had witnessed the destruction caused by the German submarines, and was impressed by the urgent need of additional harbour accommodation on the western shores of Ireland, capable of being used for defensive purposes and for safeguarding our trade routes and food supplies.</P>
    <P>The object of this paper was to concentrate attention on this need, to stimulate interest in the problems connected with the proposal, and to examine impartially the various sites which have from time to time been proposed for a Transatlantic mail port in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It was then hoped to induce the British Government to make such provision for the safety of the United Kingdom, and at the same time provide the means for establishing a direct passenger and mail traffic, which must have proved of great benefit to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Conditions have altered since March, 1918.  The war has ended. The pressure on England has been relieved, and English interests in the problem may be dismissed from discussion, except as regards the opposition of vested interests.  It must now be viewed as a Free State problem.</P>
    <P>Do the interests of the Free State warrant the construction of such a western harbour?  Do the interests at stake justify the costly outlay on the necessary works, and the establishment of the direct service of shipping?</P>
    <P>I believe the answer to be in &ldquo;the affirmative.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What, then, are the reasons for the formation of a terminal western Transatlantic mail and passenger port, and why do they appear more urgent now that Ireland is a Free State than before the severance of the Union?  Why do the words of Viscount Morley, &ldquo;Do not let <Col N="1234" /> Ireland be pushed off the great high road between the west and the east,&rdquo; come with greater force now than when they were uttered in 1892?  I think the following reasons may be given:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Ireland by her independence has become more dissociated from English interests.</P>
    <P>(2)  All the principal Transatlantic liners are English-owned and have their home ports in England.  They, therefore, are financially interested in making their terminal ports in England.</P>
    <P>(3)  They are naturally opposed to a terminal port in Ireland, and are even desirous of abandoning a stoppage at any Irish ports of call.</P>
    <P>(4)  The time spent in making for a port of call in Ireland is seldom compensated for by the revenue from passengers or mails to or from such a port of call.</P>
    <P>(5)  The struggle for the American-Continental passenger traffic accentuates the desire to pass Ireland without a call.</P>
    <P>(6)  The shortening of the time in transit by the adoption of a western port and the resulting economics are the principal reasons that can be held out from the traffic point of view for the proposed development; and the question is, can these be substantiated?</P>
    <P>(7)  Experience proves that mails and passengers will follow the fastest and most efficient routes.  The slow vessels will continue to follow existing routes; but if an Irish service is established and maintained as a premier line for speed and comfort there can be little doubt that it would prove successful.</P>
    <P>(8)  Ireland is the landing-place of several Transatlantic submarine electric cables.  Ireland has been a principal station for Transatlantic wireless telegraphy.  Ireland has been the landing-place of the first direct Transatlantic flight, and Ireland should be the principal &ldquo;bridgehead&rdquo; for the Transatlantic passenger and mail traffic between America and Europe.</P>
    <P>(9)  From the purely commercial point of view the saving of time in <Col N="1235" /> the Irish-American mail service will prove an important consideration, and there can be no doubt that the north of England and Scotland would be better served by such a service than by any line via Southampton or any other southern English port.</P>
    <P>(10)  With this accomplished, a stream of passenger traffic would pass through Ireland which could not fail to be beneficial to the country. Although a very considerable portion of such traffic would pass directly through the country on its way to England, yet there can be little doubt but that a large and increasing tourist traffic would be developed and fostered.  The &ldquo;Old Home&rdquo; love would play an important part in such development.</P>
    <P>(11)  The value of tourist traffic to Ireland, if developed on sound lines, can hardly be disputed.  Given easy access and facilities for travel and good hotel accommodation, there is no reason why Ireland should not rank amongst the most favoured tourist resorts.  Placed on the thoroughfare of American-European passenger traffic in the manner proposed, the necessary access will be afforded.</P>
    <P>(12)  A deep-sea fishery harbour should be included in this western port, which, given proper equipment and up-to-date transit facilities, would place our west coast deep-sea fisheries in as favourable a position to the English markets as Aberdeen and Grimsby provide for the North Sea fishing fleets.  This was the principal object of the publication of this pamphlet, and the outcome may be mentioned in the concluding words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have endeavoured to give an impartial description of the various sites which have from time to time been proposed for the Western port, and have largely drawn from the official Admiralty sailing directions.  We have also considered the relative advantages of these sites under the heads (1) depth and area; (2) facility of approach; (3) shelter; (4) position of the proposed port; (5) capacity for development; (6) facilities <Col N="1236" /> for bunkering, commissariat and repairs.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have come to the conclusion that, if an efficient artificial sheltering breakwater is constructed, Galway Bay affords the best site for the proposed Transatlantic terminal port in combination with a deep-sea fishery harbour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Gogarty has asked the Government to consider, and since reading his motion I have been wondering what the consideration was that was chiefly in his mind.  It has occurred to me that it would be perfectly fair to ask the Government to consider this harbour in connection with the following items: Let them decide as to the desirability of a western port; let us know their opinion about it; let them consider and decide on the feasibility of forming such a port and its site; let them begin with the question of financing such a port and the control of such a port, and also what help the Free State could give.  These are the principal points which I have desired to bring before the Government from time to time.  I think at the present time there is a likelihood of a great struggle for the supremacy of the Transatlantic trade between German-built vessels and English-built vessels, and the question of their maintenance and upkeep becomes one of enormous importance.  I am not going to bother you with figures about it, because they would be of little use to you, but they are worthy of the consideration of the Government, and I think if they would ask the Ports and Harbours Tribunal, which is at present sitting and has heard evidence in connection with this subject, certainly from representatives of Cork&mdash;I am not sure about the North of Ireland&mdash;but from others they have a good deal of information as to these ports which would be of great assistance to the Government.  I cannot help thinking that it is worth their while to do this thing dispassionately.  I have endeavoured as far as I am concerned to rid my mind of many hindrances that appeared in the first instance, and I think that I have in great measure satisfied myself that for economic reasons a very high-speed mail service can be run with advantage between Galway and Halifax.  It is for these reasons <Col N="1237" /> that I rather welcome Senator Gogarty's motion that the whole problem might be taken up by the Government dispassionately.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a few remarks with regard to this most interesting motion.  It is merely a suggestion that the Government be asked to consider the proposals, and I hope that the suggestion will be unanimously passed.  I had sent up to the office of the Seanad another motion on a subject that would not clash with this with regard to bases for aeroplanes and seaplanes that we are taking up in a very practical manner in Cork.  This very day, if I mistake not, the engineer of the Harbour Board is submitting to the Board suggestions in connection with what has accrued since the visit of Colonel Russell, and I hope something will be derived therefrom. Possibly in the future, be it longer or shorter, the Government will see their way to expend money on Galway, which I understand will cost about half the amount that is being spent on the Shannon scheme&mdash;perhaps a couple of millions.  It would be of great advantage not only to the Galway people but to the rest of Ireland. But in the meantime there are practical suggestions from the South of Ireland that I hope to submit.  I hope that this motion will pass.</P>

      <P>I think that the motion is rather restricted, and I suggest, with the permission of the House, that it should be amended to read: &ldquo;That the Government be requested to consider the practicability of establishing a national terminal port at Galway for high speed Transatlantic passenger and mail services.&rdquo;  As it is, the motion practically asks the Government to confine its investigations to the proposals of Senator Sir John Griffith, which I have read with a great deal of interest; but if they make any investigation I would like them to take all practical proposals into consideration and view them from other points of view than those submitted by the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On reading Senator Sir John Griffith's pamphlet on the matter I found that, whilst the engineering aspects of <Col N="1238" /> it have been attended to, the geographical situation and so forth and the saving in time for Transatlantic steamers have been taken into account, no estimate is made as to the amount it would cost, and there is also, of course, left out the question of arrangements with Transatlantic lines of steamers.  For instance, if we had such a port, one of the finest ports in the world, the question would then arise of having it utilised by Transatlantic steamers.  Of course in addition to that there are to be considered the railway connections, both in Ireland and in Great Britain, as well as the crossings of the two additional strips of water in the case of Continental passengers.</P>
    <P>But, apart from these considerations, we have to look at the fact that the West of Ireland has no port capable of accommodating a Transatlantic liner, and this is at any time a serious consideration. In time of war it would be one of vital consideration for the well-being of the country.  If those steamers have always to come round the extreme south to the eastern ports it will in times of war result in greater risks from submarines, mines, and hostile sea and aircraft.  From the point of view of safety it is very desirable, if at all practicable, to have at least one port on the west that would be able to receive the produce which we require from the American continent.</P>
    <P>I would look therefore, for the development of a harbour like Galway as one method of national defence or of self-preservation in times of peril arising out of war.  There is, of course, the certainty that the whole of the Irish emigrant traffic to America would pass through that port, as well as returning emigrants.  But in addition to that there is a possibility, almost a certainty, that a large section of American tourist traffic, which is now one of the great items in international passenger traffic, might in the new conditions break their journey in Ireland on their way to the Continent and spend their holidays here, which they do not do at present because they land on the Continent. The same might apply to them in regard to Great Britain; they might take the short route to Great Britain via Galway, break their journey there, <Col N="1239" /> cross to the Continent, and pick up a steamer on the way back at Hamburg, Antwerp or Bremen.  In that way there certainly would be a chance of tapping that great flow of American tourist traffic.  That is not now possible because of our failure to supply a decent port.</P>
    <P>There would be, I believe, certain lines of steamers that might have rather intermittent services to Galway, not very regular services, because they could not get very large numbers of passengers to travel, but they would, I think, get a sufficient number to travel that way to enable them to maintain a fairly decent service.  Then, of course, for epicures in travel and those who desire to have the very fastest possible way of travelling, there would be the question of Galway being an air port, of passengers arriving from New York or Halifax and going by air to the Continent, which would, of course, shorten their journey considerably and would constitute a journey that many American tourists would like to make.  It is a big proposition financially, and the possibilities arising out of it are big. I think for these reasons we shall do no harm, at all events, while we may do some good, by passing the motion in the more extended form that I have suggested.  It is a matter that primarily, I think, might go before the Harbours Tribunal, but a motion of this kind might induce the Government to give added powers to them to go more intimately into this question than they now can under their terms of reference. At the same time I think a word of praise is due to Senator Sir John Griffith and his colleague&mdash;I think it is his brother&mdash;for the immense amount of trouble they have gone to in investigating the possibilities of Galway at their own expense, and for the expense they have incurred in issuing pamphlets in connection with this matter and in distributing them free.  It certainly is a most admirable and patriotic service that they have rendered.</P>
    <P>It would be a pity if all their labours and expense went without any serious consideration, or if they were not availed of to the best possible advantage by the Government and the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Farrell has put into words what I have been thinking about.  The resolution, as it stands, requests the Government to consider the proposal of Senator Sir John Griffith with a view to establishing forthwith a national terminal harbour at Galway for high-speed Transatlantic passenger and mail services.  In other words, the proposal is that we should recommend the Government to put their hands in our pockets and in the pockets of the country and spend two or three million pounds in establishing a harbour there.  I think we are all agreed as to the greatness of the project. With the development that there has been in air traffic, fast steamers, and so on, as well as in view of the various points touched upon by Senator Sir John Griffith, I think we are all agreed that the project is one of vital importance.  It is quite right that the Government should give it their attention.  They should look into all these matters well ahead and see what they can do with regard to them.  But Senator Sir John Griffith did not, I think, suggest that the Government should proceed forthwith in making a national harbour there.  If they did decide to make certain proposals the matter would have to be debated. We would have to examine the financial aspects of it.  I think that we are spending quite enough money at present.  At the same time I think the Government could do a great deal along the line that Senator Sir John Griffith indicated.  They could probe the problem and see how it meets modern conditions.  They could make investigations that might result in encouraging other people to come in to see whether it is possible to formulate such a favourable proposition that moneyed people in America and elsewhere might be got to provide the capital required. I would not like to vote for the resolution as it stands, because it could be quoted afterwards and said that we had asked the Government to put their hands in the pockets of the people to enable them to spend two or three millions on this scheme for Galway. At the same time, I think that the Government can give a tremendous amount of valuable assistance, but I think that the Seanad ought to pass the <Col N="1241" /> resolution in such a way as to leave the money question out for the present.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from Senator Gogarty if he would be prepared to amend the motion in the form suggested by Senator O'Farrell: that the Government be requested to consider the practicability of establishing a national terminal harbour at Galway for high-speed Transatlantic passenger and mail services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. GOGARTY Dr. GOGARTY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that no matter how the Government consider this or how far afield they may go they can hardly improve on the investigations made by Senator Sir John Griffith.  He has sounded the different ports from Barna as far as Spiddal. He has investigated the conditions of water power in the fall of Lough Corrib, and the geological conditions of its environment.  So that I was just as broad in getting in Senator Sir John Griffith as the Government.  I would be delighted to give them every facility provided they considered them.  One objection to the scheme urged by Senator Bagwell was that he thought it would mean that a great deal of public money would be wasted.  I was limiting the cost to one and a half millions, which is really the price of one of those ocean-going liners.  In other words, it would be the case of a shopkeeper providing himself with a shop for the price of a suit for one of his customers. I think that is a point of view that we cannot overlook in view of the fact that on the roads we have spent £5,000,000 and on the Shannon it is possible the expenditure will be £7,000,000.  It has also to be considered that sooner or later a great deal of expenditure must take place in dealing with this part of the Gaeltacht.  To carry out the recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission would be nearly as expensive as the proposal contemplated here.  If the proposal in the motion is carried out it will give relief to that district, relief that will not alone be permanent but that will put them in a better position than they are in at present, because it will, as it were, let in the air to that part of southern Connemara which wants it so much.  The people there are living under conditions which are a <Col N="1242" /> disgrace to the rest of the country. That is not the fault of the people themselves but rather of the quality of the land they hold.</P>
      <P>Another objection that Senator Bagwell made was as to the disinclination of tourists to leave their ships.  It ought to be our desire to get them into the country and let them get out the best way they can.  Possibly on account of the tourist arrangements the bulk of travellers go to Genoa or Naples on their way through Europe, and go home from Cherbourg without calling at Britain at all.  These people after their rubber-neck tour around the Continent would come to Ireland. If we got them in from America in four days we could have a slow service to take the other people back, for not alone will Galway feed itself from the British tourists but it will make a bid for the other sixty-four per cent. who never, under the present circumstances, go to Britain at all.  It is a strange anomaly that I should pretend to be putting myself in the position of giving advice to British companies, but in that competition which is coming they are up against the Lloyd and the Hamburg American Lines.  If we can put out an arm where their ships can enter we would be doing a good thing for the country and possibly for those ships. If they stay in their own ports they will be merely fighting and leave this country to one line of shipping alone. Senator O'Farrell's point is very important. In order to keep wages low, England is electing to feed its citizens from the Argentine.  In the event of war the Atlantic food routes would be cut more quickly in the Channel.  If Galway port were used by food ships food supplies could be more easily protected on the way to England.</P>

      <P>I think it would be a mistake to adopt the resolution put before us by Senator Gogarty for the reason that he has excluded every place else but Galway.  Galway is the only place the Government is asked to investigate. In my recollection a great many other schemes have been put forward&mdash;Blacksod Bay and others. From one point of view Blacksod Bay was extremely attractive, and if carried out would give the shortest route <Col N="1243" /> to England.  I think it would be a mistake to ask the Government to investigate the case of Galway alone. The whole question of a Transatlantic port should be gone into, and latitude should be given in the matter and not have one port only specified.</P>
