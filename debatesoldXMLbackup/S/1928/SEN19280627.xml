    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir THOS. GRATTAN ESMONDE Sir THOS. GRATTAN ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOS. GRATTAN ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of this measure deals with the subject of Income Tax, and I would like to devote a few minutes to the incidence of this tax in so far as it affects farmers.  The Seanad will understand me when I say that I do not stand as an advocate of farmers not paying income tax like everyone else. I agree with John Stuart Mill in that, and I think that farmers, like other citizens, should contribute according to their means to the upkeep of the State. To come down to particulars, the farmer, as we know him in this country, is charged under Schedule A 3/- in the £1, and under Schedule B 3/- in the £1.  He is charged on his Poor Law valuation, or, in other words, he is charged twice.  In the old days before the Great War, when the farmer was supposed to be pulling the devil by the tail, he was only charged under Schedule A.  During the Great War farmers were supposed to be making extravagant profits, so they were charged income tax also under Schedule B.  The reason given for this change was that farmers were charged under Schedule A for ownership and under Schedule B for occupation.  There was some doubt, I suppose, in the mind of the legislature when that charge was made under Schedule B, so they arranged that in certain conditions farmers were to be allowed a rebate of income tax under Schedule B, but to obtain rebates they had to follow the prescribed form.  I <Col N="687" /> have this form here.  It is rather difficult to obtain copies of it, but it certainly is more difficult to fill it up.</P>
      <P>We know the kind of person the average farmer is.  We who have been associated with him all our lives know the mentality of the average farmer.  I wish to discuss with the Seanad for a few minutes the form on which farmers must apply for relief from double taxation in connection with Schedule A. The first page is taken up with notes. I need not worry about the first one. The second note is rather peculiar.  A farmer has to send in his account every year, and the direction is that &ldquo;The money figures of &lsquo;sales&rsquo; on page 5 of the account must be the gross total amount of all sales effected in the year of account, whether the money has all been received by the end of the year or not.&rdquo;  Then: &ldquo;Purchases should be given as the net cost of the purchases effected in the year, whether the farmer has actually paid the money by the end of the year or not.&rdquo;  I do not know if the average farmer could quite understand what he is asked to do in filling in this form, but he must bear point No. 2 in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The note goes on to say: &lsquo;Similarly the receipts and expenses on page 6 should be given on the basis of the amounts accruing in respect of the year of account and not merely upon a &lsquo;Cash received or disbursed&rsquo; basis.&rdquo;  Well, I doubt very much if the average farmer would understand what that means.  It says later on: &ldquo;The actual expenses incurred in the ordinary farming operation must not include anything in respect of improvements by way of reclamations, drainage, new fences, addition to farm buildings or other capital expenditure.&rdquo;  That seems to me to be rather against the proper development of a man's farm, but that is a question for further consideration. At the end of the page the form goes on: &ldquo;The Commissioners may accept copies of them in lieu of accounts drawn up on page 5 and page 6 of this form; but in any event the particulars required by pages 2, 3, 4, and 7 of this form should be furnished and the accounts should be certified in the manner set out.&rdquo;  There are then <Col N="688" /> further directions.  Knowing the farmer as we know him I doubt very much if he could follow those directions when filling up this form.</P>
    <P>Turning to page 2, the first thing the farmer has to do is to give the name of the townland, then the area of his part of that particular townland.  If he happens to have land in more than one townland he has to give the name of the second townland, and he has to give the area in statute acres.  He has then to discriminate in another column between the valuation on land and the valuation on houses.  He has in another column to fill up particulars of the tenure of each holding.  For instance, he has to give the purchase annuity under the 1903 Act.  He may have bought out his farm under different sections of different Land Acts, so that he must put in the various Land Acts under which he bought his holding.  He puts down the payments of purchase annuities to the Land Commission under the 1903 or 1923 Acts.  If he has a lease he has to put in particulars of the lease.  He may hold under fee farm grant, and he must put in particulars of that.  When he has done all this he has probably got a fit.  He has then to put in what portion of each item is utilised for the purposes of husbandry. That is another conundrum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>He will not fill in that because he has got a fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>All the same if he has got a fit before he fills in this form and a great many others he does not get any relief.  When we turn to page 3 of the form we find the farmer has to say how much land he has under plantation, gardens, lawns, avenues, walks or amenity lands.  Senators can imagine the ordinary farmer filling up these statistics.  He has also to give the area of land let under the eleven months' system or in con-acre.  He has to give the area of agricultural land capable of husbandry or adapted to husbandry, which probably he does not know, and he has to divide it up and to state how much is under pasture, meadow, oats and the various crops.  I used to live in a tillage country before I had to quit it, and farmers used to come and ask me whether it was first crop, second crop, or third crop meadow <Col N="689" /> they would put into the form.  I told them whatever it was to do the best they could.  The farmer has to give the acres under oats, barley, wheat, potatoes, turnips and mangels&mdash;in the old days they spelled it mangolds, but now they spell it mangels, which I suppose is a great improvement&mdash;the area devoted to flax and other tillage.  He has then to put in waste and bog, and on top of that he has to put in how the rest of the land is disposed of.  Three lines are left for that.  He has then to put in the acreage and add the whole thing up. This is the catch.  Really this whole form is the work of a genius.  When the farmer has done all this he has to show how the difference between the total area on this page and the total area on page 2 is accounted for.  This is the kind of thing the ordinary farmer in this country has to do before he is entitled to relief under Schedule B. I am not half way through the form yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has to make a livestock statement, which is an appalling business.  He has to begin with the number of stock on hands at the beginning of the year, which is the 1st of April, and to remember all the beasts he had in hands then.  He has to give horses of all sorts, ponies, cattle, including milch cows, sheep, pigs, poultry, mules and jennets, and other livestock.  What the other livestock is I cannot say.  It may be dogs, cats, rats, or rabbits.  He has to give particulars of the number of live stock on his farm on April 1st of the previous year.  He has then to fill in a series of columns showing the number sold during the year of horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry, mules, jennets, and other animals.  He has to give the number killed for home use during the year of cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry, and other animals.  He has then to put in the number of animals that died during the year, horses, ponies, cattle, pigs, poultry, mules, jennets and other animals.  He has then to put down the number he has given away as gifts during the year.  I do not know if he knows the number of rabbits, dogs or cats, but anyway he has to put them down according to this Schedule.  He has then to give the number on hand at the end of the year <Col N="690" />&mdash;31st March.  How the farmer is to fill in the number of beasts he had twelve months previously, that had died, or that he had given away is beyond my comprehension.  So much for the livestock.</P>
    <P>He has then to give the quantities of his harvest crops and the estimated quantity on hands at the beginning of the year.  I can imagine no more appalling question being asked a farmer than to estimate the quantity he had on hands twelve months ago.  The thing is perfectly fantastic.  He has to estimate the number of tons of hay, straw, potatoes and other roots, as well as grain and screenings, oats, barley, wheat, and rye by the cwt., and flax and tow by the stone.  That is bad enough, but the next thing is, if possible, worse.  He has to say how much he harvested in the year of hay, straw, and potatoes in tons, and oats, barley, wheat, and rye in cwts., if he had sown any of these.  In addition to all this, he has to give the various amounts of hay, straw, potatoes, and other roots, as well as oats, barley, and rye that he bought outside in the year.</P>
    <P>You can imagine an ordinary farmer filling in a form of this kind.  He would probably be in a fit before he would be half way through.  If he did get a fit he could not get any relief.  He has to go on and estimate the quantities of the various things that he sold during the year.  He might possibly remember that, but more likely he could not.  He has to tell how much of the crops he fed to his livestock in the year in hay, straw and other crops.  He has to fill in eight columns with these particulars and to tell further the amount under the various categories that he used as seed in the year.  He has then to ask his wife how much hay, straw, oats, rye, barley, flax, or tow were used in the house during the year.  He has to state how much was destroyed or lost in all these categories, and, having given what he had at the beginning, he has to tell how much he has on hands at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>We will now come to another part of this performance.  He has to make a milk statement.  Anyone who knows anything about farming knows that <Col N="691" /> that is an absolute impossibility to the ordinary farmer.  Most of them know nothing whatever about the quantity of milk they produce.  It is only the up-to-date ones, men who farm under latest methods, who know the amount of milk they produce in a year.  I have never attempted to farm on scientific principles, but I kept a dairy for 30 or 40 years and at the end of a year I never knew how much milk was produced and never could get any information about it.  The farmer has also to give the number of cows in milk on the 1st June and the number of cows in milk on the 1st December.  That is a double-barrelled arrangement.  He has to give the quantity of milk produced in the year in gallons.  He has to give the estimated quantity of whole milk sold as whole milk in a year and he has then to estimate the quantity of milk sold as skim milk in the year.  Then he has to give the amount of milk used for butter making on the farm; the amount of milk used for cheese making on the farm, and how much milk he gave to the calves and fed to the stock.  So much for the milk business. He has then to fill in a form in relation to eggs.  Now that the Department of Agriculture has put eggs at the top of the market and that they are arranged in beautiful boxes most symmetrically and are certainly lovely to look at, we can understand the anxiety to find out the number of eggs laid in Ireland in a year.  Each farmer has to say the quantity of eggs produced in the year in dozens on his farm, the quantity of eggs sold in the year, and then he has to give the number of eggs used in the household.  The thing is too funny for words.  He has to go to his wife and say to her: &ldquo;How many eggs did you set to the hens in the year, because they want to know how many eggs were hatched?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir T. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>So far we have done fairly well, but we have two or three more pages which the ordinary farmer has to go through, and as one of them said: &ldquo;You see the result.&rdquo;  The farmer has to give the value of the <Col N="692" /> stock at the beginning of the year, and then the net cost of the stock bought in a year.  He has to give a gross account of the sales of the stock and the value of the stock in hands at the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Then we have horses, thoroughbreds and hunters, and cattle, sheep, pigs and so forth. The farmer then has to give particulars of his feeding, and other things not produced on the farm, lime, soot, implements, machinery, etc.  He has to do that at the beginning and end of each year.  Then he has got to make out his losses and his profits, which is absolutely impossible for the ordinary farmer to do.  He has then got to add up his total expenses and bring them down, and so forth.  And there are quite a number of other things.  Here is page 7, which is perfectly impossible for any ordinary farmer to answer. He is asked if he has kept complete and exact figures of his farming transactions during the year&mdash;what farmer has?&mdash;and if so, are these accounts based thereon?  There are 19 or 20 questions on that page, and at the end of them they tell him this: &ldquo;If any person, for the purpose of obtaining any allowance, reduction, rebate, or repayment, in respect of income tax, either for himself or for any other person, or in any return made in reference to income tax, knowingly makes any false statement or false representation, he is liable, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months with hard labour....&rdquo;  This is the official programme. There are a number of other programmes that he has got to fill up, too, because this thing is sent off to an inspector of taxes, and he sends him back all sorts of conundrums to answer.  They ask about working horses, foals, colts and fillies, untrained <Col N="693" /> horses, brood mares and blood-stock, dairy cows, calves under six months, yearlings, two years old, three years old, over three years old, bulls, lambs, wethers and hoggets, rams, fat sheep, stores, ewes, sows, under two months, stores, fat pigs, boars.  Then there are other live stock.  There are bees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir T. ESMONDE Sir T. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir T. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there is, under the heading of &ldquo;poultry,&rdquo; common hens, ducks, geese and turkeys, and he has got to fill in that to the satisfaction of the inspector of taxes. Farmers in this country are not in the habit of filling in these forms.  They fill them in as best as they can, knowing perfectly well that if they tell an untruth they are liable to six months imprisonment with hard labour.  And this is the sort of question you get back: &ldquo;What was the nature of the machinery hired, and for what purpose?&rdquo; That was in respect of a claim for £5 in one year and £6 in another year for hiring threshing machinery. He had paid £5 for the one year and £6 for the next year.  I suppose he could not use the threshing machine on a particular day, and the inspector of taxes wanted to know what accounted for the difference.  Here is another: &ldquo;How does the farmer account for the percentage rate of profit on purchase of livestock dropping from 40 per cent. in one year to 24 per cent. in the succeeding year?&rdquo;  If you asked a farmer what it meant when his profits were down from 40 per cent. in one year to 24 per cent. in the next he would answer you, and he would answer you very profanely.  Although this particular gentleman did give the number and the sale price of his cattle each year, they wanted to know how his profit had dropped from 40 per cent. one year to 24 per cent. in the other year.  Evidently the gentleman who had asked him that question had not studied the lists of the stock market that appear in Friday's papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One farmer was asked what he had credited in his account for &ldquo;freedoms.&rdquo; I thought we had more or less of a republic in this country now, and I do not know if that is what was <Col N="694" /> meant by &ldquo;freedoms.&rdquo;  The farmer did not know what &ldquo;freedoms&rdquo; meant in this connection, and he said so; he told the inspector to go to a warm place.  Another question that was asked was this: &ldquo;What proportion of timber grown on the farmlands and/or fences?&rdquo;  Can you imagine such an inconceivable question being asked in relation to income tax?  What difference did it make whether the trees were grown on the fences or on the land?  After all, what has that to do with income tax? Another man lent his threshing engine to a neighbour, who was hard up, for two or three days.  Farmers throughout this country always help one another, and they do not put it in their income-tax returns.  Anyhow, this inspector wanted to know the market value of the services of this engine and threshing machine which he lent to one of his neighbours.  There are swarms of other questions, but this is a thing I would like to quote, because it is typical of the whole situation. This case was that of a gentleman who was worried very much in the filling up of his income-tax return.  He said: &ldquo;I am in my eightieth year&mdash;for God's sake don't drive me mad.  No wonder lunacy is greatly increasing in Ireland.  I swear that my farm accounts are perfectly correct and that I have not wronged the Revenue or anybody else out of one penny.&rdquo;  This is interesting: &ldquo;My accounts are kept in farm account books as recommended by the Department of Agriculture, and all receipts and payments are entered in the sub-heads there and not split up into various other sub-heads, concocted by some impossible person unacquainted with farming.&rdquo; That is the answer that was drawn from this particular farmer, in desperation as a result of these unanswerable queries.</P>
    <P>The Seanad has listened to me with great patience, and I think them very much.  I will not detain them much longer.  I do not blame the Finance Minister at all, because after all he has succeeded to this heritage, and it is almost impossible to carry it out.  But what I would suggest to him is this: We all know the reason for this amazing <Col N="695" /> situation in this country with regard to income tax.  This income tax system was devised in England, and it was devised for English application. England is an industrial country, and its farming industry, though important, does not bear much relation to the industries of the country, which is mainly an industrial country.  This particular scheme has been devised for farmers of superior calibre, if you like, who farm on a large scale and who probably are able to answer all these conundrums.  But it is utterly unfitted to a community like ours.  We are mainly agricultural and are likely to remain so.  This country is not likely to be industrialised in our time, and this system of income-tax examination does not suit this country at all.  It would be very much better and more profitable to the revenue if a simpler system were devised.  I do not hold that farmers should not pay income tax; they should pay their taxes like everybody else, but it would be very much cheaper and very much more profitable for the revenue if some scheme were devised whereby, instead of the farmers having to go through all this ridiculous nonsense of filling in these forms, the farmers were to pay under one schedule and not under two or three.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity of suggesting to the Finance Minister that, in view of the unsuitability of this income-tax system to this country, devised as it has been for England, he should appoint a committee or carry out some investigations to see how it would be best to deal with the income tax of the Irish farmers, because the simplest thing for the revenue is to get the taxes without any trouble, and without any annoyance to the people who pay, and to get them in quickly. If you get them to go through all these ridiculous forms, fill them up and answer all sorts of queries arising out of them, the result is that the tax is held up for six, twelve or eighteen months, or longer than that.  I think the time has come when we should have a clearance in this matter, that we should have some tribunal set up, or have some investigation carried out, by capable people who would understand <Col N="696" /> the position of the farmer, so that some scheme might be arranged whereby his income tax would be perfectly plain and clear to him, and he could pay it without any bother.</P>
    <P>That is what I would suggest to the Minister.  I do not find fault with him or with his Department.  But the whole prosperity of this country depends on the farmer.  There is no doubt about it that the farmer is the backbone of the Free State.  On him depends the whole administration of the Government; on him depends our system of local taxation, our schools and hospitals, our charities and our employment &mdash;because the farmer is really the largest employer of labour in this country&mdash;our railways and our financial institutions.  He is really a vital asset to the Government of this country, and therefore I think he ought to be helped in every way.  Certainly he ought not to be bothered with conundrums of this kind which it is absolutely impossible for him to answer.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Finance Minister does not imagine that I am in any way finding fault with him.  I am not.  I say that he has inherited this position, but I think it is time, in his own interests, in the interests of the Department, and in the interests of his successors, that he should evolve some scheme whereby the farmer would know what his tax was so that he would pay it promptly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. COUNIHAN Mr. COUNIHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COUNIHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am encouraged to rise so early in this debate by the eloquent plea made by Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde on behalf of the farmers, and I would impress on the Minister for Finance the need for evolving some simplified method for the farmers to make their returns, for it is almost impossible for them to fill in the forms supplied at present.  But I want to say, in fairness to the income tax inspectors and officials, that the position is not so bad as it appears from Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde's statement, that in a good many cases, at least with the smaller farmers, if they pay a visit to the income-tax office they will find the officials most courteous and helpful.  These officials ask a few simple questions as to your <Col N="697" /> valuation, your family, and a few matters like that, and if they find from these questions that you are a person who is not liable for income tax you get off fairly lightly.  Even with these forms it is not necessary to supply all these details that Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde has pointed out. But that is not my main point.</P>
      <P>For the last four or five years what has been required by the farmers is not so much relief from income tax as some relief from rates.  When we saw the Budget introduced in the English Parliament some months ago and saw the relief which it gave to agriculture we had high hopes that our Minister for Finance would also give us some relief from the very high rates which are oppressing our industry.  But we were sadly disappointed.  We did not get the smallest particle of consideration. We thought and we hoped that at least the main and trunk roads in the country would be taken off our hands and that the whole cost of the maintenance of these roads would be borne out of national funds.  The perfect condition in which these roads are kept is of no advantage to the agricultural community; it is more of a disadvantage, for it is most dangerous for our horses and our live stock to travel on them.  Of course, they are perfect for motoring, and I do not object to that if the city and town dwellers want the luxury of good roads on which to use their motor cars to go into the country, and these roads are certainly a great help in the development of the tourist traffic.  We do not object to the development of the tourist traffic, but we certainly object to paying for the luxury of good roads for city and town dwellers when these roads are of no advantage to ourselves and are not required by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that we thought this Bill would provide money for was the building of labourers' cottages, but nothing has been done.  In pre-war days hundreds of plots were purchased by the district councils for the building of labourers' cottages, but the war stopped building.  The plots are still there, but no cottages have since been built, and there is no immediate prospect of any being built, because the councils cannot afford to pay for them, <Col N="698" /> and except the Government devises some scheme which will give a special grant for this purpose, I am afraid it will be a long time before there will be very much building in the country. It is very essential to have labourers in the country properly housed.  It would prevent them going into the cities and towns and crowding out the slums.  The Governments of every country in the world are at present encouraging the agricultural industry, and I am sure that our Government is anxious to help.  But in my opinion the present Executive Council, with the one exception of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, have such a complete urban outlook that they cannot understand and have not much sympathy with agricultural requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two suggestions that I would like to make.  I listened with great care to the meticulous statement of Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde.  The amazing thing is that a number of farmers have contrived to fill in this extraordinary form and make out a valuation.  One always heard that a farmer had to be everything&mdash;a labourer, a mechanic, a bit of an engineer, and every conceivable thing&mdash;but now he is obviously to be a first-class clerk as well, and in many cases he is.  But having filled in that amount of information, and filled it in to the satisfaction of the inspector, he has got to meet the income-tax commissioners, and these are the gentlemen who harass you to a much greater degree.  I have one case in point.  I know a widowed lady who took the greatest interests in her affairs, who had her accounts made up properly, and she made a return of the depreciation in her cows.  Every farmer knows that his cows deteriorate so much a year, and he puts down £2 or £3 under that head, as the case may be.  This lady put down £2 for the deterioration of her herd.  The august gentleman who was dealing with the case said to this poor lady: &ldquo;When did the moment arrive when these cows deteriorated £2?  Was it at 12 o'clock on New Year's Day, because you say that at 11.59 they were worth £14 each, and yet you say that at 12 midnight they were worth £2 less?&rdquo;  That lady went <Col N="699" /> away in tears from this august commissioner of income-tax.  That is the kind of thing that people have to run the gauntlet of.</P>
      <P>There was one point on which Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde did not touch.  In pre-war times the farmer was assessed on one-third of his valuation.  He is now assessed on his whole valuation, that is, his taxable capacity is supposed to be three times as great, and his taxation is three times as high; so that he is taxed nine times as much as he was taxed in pre-war days.  There is £660,000 odd for the Revenue Commissioners for the collection of taxes and for their enormous staff, and not content with the enormous staffs that they have, they want to get the public to assist them in doing their duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If farms with valuations of less than £120 are not liable to tax why are small farmers with valuations ranging from £25 to £30 a year sent forms day after day and week after week to fill up for income tax purposes?  Why should the Commissioners try to make them pay a tax when they know implicity that they are not liable for it? It is for that reason I say that the action of the income tax authorities in sending forms to these small farmers to be filled up is unreasonable, unjust and illogical.  They ought to know their business well enough not to be sending bills to men in that position.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to instruct the income tax authorities not to be making demands for payment which they know are not due.  What would be thought of a shopkeeper who demanded the payment of £20 from a man that he knew quite well the man did not owe?  Such a person would be branded at once as a criminal.  I think it is wrong, and almost criminal, to be making assessments on these small farmers when it is known quite well, or ought to be known, that they are not liable for payment.  There is a very large staff employed for this work, and surely they ought to know their business well enough not to be making these demands. I hope that the suggestion I have made to return to the position as it was before the war, when a man was <Col N="700" /> taxed on one-third of his valuation and not on the full valuation, as at present, for income tax purposes, will be favourably considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister has difficulties in finding money and in balancing his Budget.  It is realised pretty generally, however, that farmers are entitled to some reliefs, and I suggest that this is one relief that ought to be given to them.  With regard to the filling in of the forms sent out, I feel very strongly on this.  I have filled in these statements myself day after day and week after week.  In some cases the statements so filled in by me were accepted by the Revenue authorities, but that was only after I had made a severe fight.  I think that the statement of accounts required to be furnished to the authorities should be simplified, and that there should not be the undue elaboration in them that there is at present, causing the persons required to fill them sleepless nights and hardworking days in order to comply with the law, and to render the accounts which the Minister for Finance thinks should be rendered in the interests of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to call attention to two sections in this Bill.  Section 9 deals with the general notice to deliver lists, declarations or statements, and Section 10 with notices of assessments and the time for giving notice of appeals.  Both sections indicate a radical change from the system previously in operation.  Section 9 provides that &ldquo;the Special Commissioners shall, in each year of assesment, cause general notice to be given, requiring all persons who by the Income Tax Acts are required to deliver any list, declaration or statement to make out and deliver such list.&rdquo;  In passing I might point out that this is a very indefinite description of the persons who have to supply information.  I think that there should be a definition of the persons who are to furnish the statement.  The section goes on: &ldquo;to make out and deliver such list, declaration or statement to the inspectors of taxes for the respective districts, or to the Revenue Commissioners within such time as shall be limited by such <Col N="701" /> notice, not being less than twenty-one days from the giving thereof.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) reads:</P>
      <P>The said general notice shall in each year be given by causing the same to be inserted once in the &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; and once at least in each of two daily newspapers published in Saorstát Eireann and such insertions shall be deemed to be sufficient compliance with the foregoing subsection and to be good service of such general notice on all persons concerned.</P>
      <P>Previously each taxpayer got a notice by post of the assessment made on him. In that way he had an opportunity of reading it over and of consulting his legal advisers or his income tax expert on it.  Now, it will be observed that it is only by a notice published in the daily papers that he will become acquainted of the assessment that has been made on him.  Senators will also observe that it is only proposed to publish that notice in two daily papers, although there are three published in this State.  It might happen, therefore, that a particular taxpayer would be a subscriber to the daily paper which did not receive this advertisement from the income tax authorities.  He would, therefore, be unaware of the assessment made on him.</P>
      <P>Section 10 of the Bill provides:</P>
      <P>(1)  When assessments under Schedules A and B shall have been signed, the Special Commissioners shall cause notice thereof and of the time for giving notice of appeal to be given in such manner as they shall deem expedient.</P>
      <P>(2)  Any such notice may be given&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by depositing the assessments with the inspectors of taxes for the respective districts for inspection by the persons assessed, and publishing notice of the time for giving notice of appeal in the &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; and in at least two daily newspapers published in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under that section it will be necessary for the taxpayer to travel from his residence to the office of the inspector of taxes, which, in several cases, is a very long distance.  I know inspectors <Col N="702" /> of taxes whose districts comprise not only the county in which they reside, but other adjoining counties.  Therefore, under this section the taxpayer, instead of having the notice of assessment sent to him by post, must travel to the office of the inspector for his assessment if he wants to contest the amount charged, or if he wants to get a copy of it to take to his legal adviser or income tax expert.  That will all mean considerable expense, inconvenience and trouble to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I do not know why this change has been made, or whether there will be any saving in respect of it except as regards the postage.  Hitherto the notice of assessment was served by post at the public expense.  I do not think that system should be abolished. I see by the section that there is an alternative whereby the special commissioners may deliver &ldquo;to each person assessed a notification of the amount of his assessment and of the time for giving notice of appeal.&rdquo; That is an alternative which the special commissioners may adopt but they are not bound to adopt it.  If, for instance, a taxpayer does not see the advertisement in the newspaper and has no opportunity of knowing how much is charged against him, he may possibly allow the period provided for lodging an appeal to lapse.  That would be a very serious thing for him, because of he allows the time for lodging an appeal to lapse there will be no more to be said about it.  The case will go against the taxpayer by default.  In such cases it has been the custom of income tax inspectors to levy the maximum demand.  They salve their consciences by saying that, if the taxpayers had filled in the return and complied with the other requirements, they would only have had to pay the proper figure.</P>
    <P>There is a system that I would like to see adopted and it is this: that when a taxpayer gets the first notice of the demand to be made upon him, that the full amount of the income tax assessment for that year should be fully set out on that notice.  If that were done he would know at once how he stood for that year.  The system would have this advantage, too, that if there was going to be an appeal it <Col N="703" /> would mean that you would only need to have the one appeal on the entire amount of income tax levied for the year, and not as at present be having appeals on different items under Schedules A, B, C, D, etc.  I think the adoption of that system would greatly facilitate the income tax authorities themselves as well as the taxpayers.  I think it would be satisfactory to all parties.</P>
    <P>As regards the old arrears, there is a great deal of dissatisfaction at the manner in which attempts have been made to collect them.  I am referring now to arrears due prior to the first of April, 1923.  I suggest that where a demand is made under this Bill for any arrears which accrued prior to the 6th April, 1923, the right of appeal should be given to the taxpayer concerned to contest that amount.  We all know, of course, that prior to that date things were in a very unsettled condition here.  In many cases the records do not show whether appeal notices were lodged or not.  In many cases, too, there are no records available as to claims made by taxpayers for reliefs that would entitle them to be free from the payment of income tax.  I hope that the Minister will see his way to adopt that suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement, in introducing the Budget, which I have read was, I think, very fair.  In the course of his speech he said: &ldquo;A good deal of misapprehension exists as regards the assessment and collection of income tax.  The Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have no functions as regards the amounts of assessments. The law provides that assessments should be made by Inspectors of Taxes in the first instance.  Taxpayers have a right to appeal to the Special Commissioners of Income Tax against any such assessments.  The Special Commissioners are not subject to the Minister, or to the Revenue Commissioners, in regard to their decisions.  If taxpayers are not satisfied with the result of appeals to the Special Commissioners they have the further right of appeal to the Circuit Judges, and, on points of law, to the High Court.</P>
    <P>When an assessment has become final <Col N="704" /> and conclusive as the result of appeals, or in the absence of appeal, it is the duty of the Revenue Commissioners to see that the tax is collected within a reasonable time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No one could find fault with that policy if it was carried out.  I hope that it will be carried out, especially as regards the old arrears. Even if it became necessary, I think an opportunity should be given the people concerned to enable them to lodge a fresh appeal.  Justice would surely be done by the authorities here allowing fresh appeals, whether to the Circuit Judges or the Special Commissioners. As regards the publication of notices in the newspapers, I hope that the Minister, if he insists on giving notice in that way, will see that they are published in the three daily newspapers and not in two only, as at present.</P>

      <P>We all listened with interest and sympathy to the farmers' tales of woe, as depicted by Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde and some other Senators.  Listening to what these Senators said, one was driven to the conclusion that the Revenue Commissioners must certainly be pressed for work when they send out all these documents to the small farmers of the country to fill up, because from what has been stated, they seem to be more like a census of production than forms to be filled up in connection with income tax.  I feel that after all the work that is involved in sending out these forms and the substantial expense that it must mean to the Revenue Commissioners to carry it out, that it might be considered a commercial proposition by the Commissioners to exempt farmers altogether from the payment of income tax, because I do not believe that one in every two hundred farmers ever pays a penny income tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think then it is a waste of the farmers' time to ask them to fill up these forms.  The farmer is just as likely to fill them up correctly as the Revenue Commissioners are to get any income tax out of the farmer, even though he may be liable <Col N="705" /> for it.  As another Senator suggested, when Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde was speaking, if someone went to Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde as a banker to look for a loan of a couple of hundred pounds he would have about twice the number of forms to fill up in order to satisfy the banker that he should get the loan.  So that the Revenue Commissioners are not the only people who insist, on what looks to the people concerned, on getting superfluous and useless information.  I think that the difficulty with the Revenue Commissioners is that the only people from whom they are able to get anything like reliable returns and from whom they are able to extort the last penny in the way of income tax, are those in receipt of fixed salaries or wages. In that respect, I am glad to see the Minister for Finance promised in the other House to institute an investigation with a view, if possible, to recasting the methods of relief in regard to the payers of income tax, especially those in receipt of small incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income tax here is 3/- in the pound as compared with 4/- in the pound in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Yet, a person here in receipt of a small salary or wage of, say, £300 pays more in income tax than a person in receipt of the same salary in Great Britain where the income tax rate is higher.  That is due to the fact that in Great Britain there is a remission of one-sixth of the total income, while the remission here is only one-tenth.  The result is this: that a man in receipt of a salary of £300 a year who is married and has no children pays £3 7s. 6d. in income tax per year, while a person with the same salary and in the same conditions in Great Britain, pays only £2 10s.  That is in regard to earned income.  But if his income of £300 a year is unearned income he pays £11 5s. in the Free State, and £15 in England, so that you have a principle there which tends towards the development of making Ireland the happy hunting ground for idle people.  I believe that a large proportion of the income tax that is collected is got from people with wages or salaries running up to, say, £400 a year.  These people, with their comparatively small salaries, have to compete in industry with a whole <Col N="706" /> horde of pensioners in this country, many of them young men drawing big pensions.  These pensioners are competing in industry with salaried men who have to earn the money that goes to pay their pensions.  A person with a small salary has to pay the greater part of it for the actual necessaries of life, and to that extent he contributes more in the way of direct taxation when he buys boots, shoes and clothing, soap, sugar and other taxed articles.  He has to pay an undue proportion of indirect taxation, in addition to paying more than his proportion of direct taxation.</P>
    <P>A good deal of talk has been made of the restoration of part of the cut in the old age pensions.  It has been stated that this will amount to £150,000 a year, but it has to be remembered that there is taken from the people this year the sum of £200,000 under the new tax on sugar.  In regard to the sugar tax, I notice that sugar made from beet grown in the Saorstát is exempt from that tax.  I would like to know what that amounts to, because, of course, that new tax is an additional subsidy to the Carlow sugar-beet factory.  I think there is universal agreement on the point that the sugar-beet factory at Carlow is already very handsomely subsidised.  In view of what has taken place, one would like to know whether the sugar made at that factory from beet grown in this State is now going to be sold cheaper than imported sugar, which, of course, will have to bear the additional tax.  Certainly, if there was any excuse for an increase in the price of sugar, I fancy that the Carlow factory would not be slow to take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>A good deal of play was made out of the fact that capital was being kept out of Ireland when the income tax rate here was 5/- in the pound as against 4/6 in Great Britain.  Now the shoe is on the other foot, as the income tax rate here is 3/- in the pound as against 4/- in the pound in Great Britain.  I wonder whether, as a result of the income tax rate being lower here than it is in Great Britain, there has been any improvement in the direction of attracting capital to Irish industry? As far as outward results go to show, there has not been.  The Agricultural <Col N="707" /> Credit Corporation is an example.  It was a complete failure as far as the investment in it of money by the public was concerned, and that despite the fact that a dividend of 5 per cent. was guaranteed by the Government.  I think the same is true as regards a number of attempts that were made to float some small industries here.  We certainly find in the wills of some wealthy citizens of this State that most of their money is invested in countries outside of Ireland.  If the improvement that was spoken of, and that was looked for, has not come about as a result of reducing the income tax rate here, I hope at any rate that we have heard the last of the marvellous things that were going to happen in Ireland, industrially, if we could only abolish income tax altogether.  One wonders if income tax was abolished altogether to-morrow how much more capital we would get invested in industry here with a view to providing employment.  The reduction that has already taken place does not give any grounds for hoping that any further reduction in the rate of income tax is going to encourage the promoters of industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I must ask the Seanad to discount a good deal of what was said by Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde in regard to farmers' income tax.  A discussion like that as regards farmers' income tax is really a case of much ado about nothing, because if we exclude from our consideration farmers who have sources of income other than what they derive from farming, and deal only with farmers who make their living out of the land and whose sole income is derived from farming, the amount of income tax paid by all such farmers in the Free State would not cover the cost of the electric light for the Dáil and Seanad.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>To illustrate that these forms do not go to ordinary farmers and have not to be filled up by them, I might refer to one example that I put before the Dáil.  Take the case of a farmer whose valuation is £200.  He would be a very big farmer in this country. <Col N="708" /> Take it that he purchased his holding under the 1903 Land Act, and that the annuity he pays to the Land Commission amounts to £104 a year.  If that farmer is married, he has no income tax to pay.  If he is single, he would have income tax to pay to the extent of £3 8s. per annum.  That is, as I have said, in the case of a farmer who has a valuation of £200, and there are comparatively few farmers with that valuation in this country.  Farmers under £200 valuation would not have to pay at all, so that a comparatively small number of farmers are concerned in this.  There are farmers, of course, who have other sources of income, and who, even though their holdings are much under a £200 valuation, have to pay tax.  They are in a different category, of course, from the farmer whose income is derived solely from farming.  They may be men who have shops and derive a large part of their income from that source.  I suggest that they ought to be able to keep accounts.  The form that was read out at such length by Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde is only required in the case of a farmer who does not keep accounts.  Any farmer who keeps accounts will have his accounts accepted.</P>
      <P>The form that is sent out is an omnibus form.  The whole form is not applicable to any farmer, but in case a farmer wishes to be charged, not on his valuation or on the amount of his land annuity, he is entitled to be charged on his actual profits if he wishes to be charged in that way.  But in order that that may be done, he must supply particulars to enable the Revenue authorities to find out what his profits are.  If he has no accounts, and suppose he is a substantial farmer, he will be asked and will be expected to supply fairly elaborate particulars.  But as I think Senator Counihan pointed out, the forms present really no difficulty for even the small number of farmers who have to fill them up.  Those who have to fill them up will get assistance by discussion with the local inspector of taxes, who will make it quite easy for them to fill up the forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked in the Dáil a year or two ago whether the form could not be simplified.  That was examined, but it is difficult to simplify a form and at <Col N="709" /> the same time make it suitable for sending it out generally.  If we were to simplify it too much we would require to have different forms to send to the farmers, and the confusion would be made greater.  I want to end up by saying that the farmer class entitled to sympathy is the farmer who lives by the land, and he has to pay no income tax in practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give statistics about the number of farmers who pay income tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether statistics could be easily obtained that would be sufficiently accurate for the Senator's purpose.  If they could be obtained without a considerable amount of expense and labour I would consider the matter.  With regard to relief of rates, I would like to remind Senator Counihan that to relieve agricultural rates in this country, as it is proposed to relieve them in England, would be a more difficult proposition here.  Agricultural rates in England, relatively speaking, are a small matter.  Agriculture there is a comparatively minor factor in the life of the country; here everything depends on agriculture, and if you are seeking a means of relief for agriculture you have got to find those means practically off the agriculturalists.  A fourpenny petrol tax in this country would go but a very small way towards a scheme for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  It would produce a comparatively trivial amount of money. While it might do something it would not enable the Government here to contemplate the thing that it might be possible to do with the proceeds of such a tax in England.  Even a tax of a shilling a gallon on petrol, with the difficulties of collection, would be so great, even if extended to paraffin, that it would tend to reduce the productivity of the tax.  A shilling a gallon would only go a short way towards providing the sort of relief that Senator Counihan has in mind.  Where agriculture is the main industry, where there is no other form of production from which any considerable amount of money can be raised, it is not possible to give aid to agriculture by means of <Col N="710" /> Exchequer grants in the way it can be done in England, where there are industries greater than agriculture which can be taxed, and where there are great accumulations of wealth which can be taxed for the relief of agriculture. I am not saying nothing should be done about rating, but the problem is vastly greater here than in England.</P>
      <P>In regard to trunk and main roads. I do not think it is a fact that farmers are paying for roads of a quality they do not require.  I think, allowing for the change in the value of money, the ratepayers are not contributing more towards the maintenance of roads now than pre-war.  The cost of improving the roads beyond the 1914 standard is, I think, in the main, being provided out of the Road Fund.  I cannot agree with Senator Bennett that there is the excessive zeal he alleged on the part of the income tax authorities.  The position has to be remembered that there was a great tangled mass of arrears to be dealt with when the Free State took over the collection of revenue.  There was an inadequate staff, and there is still a shortage of staff, and the task of the revenue authorities has been exceedingly difficult.  It may be that certain errors took place that would not have taken place if we had not been labouring under such tremendous stress.  As I pointed out in the Dáil, it takes four or five years to make an inspector of taxes.  We were unable, at the beginning, to induce a sufficient number of income tax inspectors to transfer, as the position was disturbed and the prospects did not look good. and they preferred to remain in the British service.  We are still in the position that we have not enough of inspectors of taxes to do the work.  Naturally, that will lead to occasional slips that would not take place if there were sufficient men to do the work that has to be done, but as for any deliberate harassing of small farmers or anybody else, that does not take place.  Considering all the difficulties they were up against, I think the revenue staff have really done magnificently.  I do not claim perfection for anybody, but, taking everything into account, they have done exceedingly well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> With regard to Senator Linehan's references to Sections 9 and 10 in the present form of the Bill, the real purpose of these two is to substitute advertisement in the daily papers for church door notices.  Church door notices were not suitable to the conditions here.  There were no parish assessors here as in England.  In any case, there is too much trouble involved in getting church door notices posted up here, and no one sees them.  All modern legislation is in favour of having publication by notice in the Press rather than church door notices.  I will read what is in the Act of 1918, and the Senator can compare it with the provisions in Section 10 in the Bill as it stands.  Section 134 of the Act of 1918 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  As soon as the assessments under Schedules A and B for any parish have been signed and allowed, the general commissioners shall cause notice thereof, and of the day for hearing appeals therefrom, to be given in such manner as they deem expedient.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any such notice may be given</P>
    <P>(a)  by delivering a copy of the assessment to the assessor of the parish for inspection by the persons assessed, together with a notice of the day of appeal, to be affixed on or near to the church door or on any other public place in the parish; or</P>
    <P>(b)  by delivering to each person assessed a notification of the amount of his assessment and of the day of appeal.</P>
    <P>(3)  With respect to assessments under Schedule D. the general commissioners shall cause a general notice to be fixed up in their office, or left with their clerk, and also to be affixed on or near the door of the church or chapel of each parish, or, if there be no such church or chapel in any such parish, of the church or chapel of some adjoining parish, limiting a reasonable time for hearing appeals, and, except as otherwise provided in this Act, no appeal shall be heard after the time so limited.</P>
    <P>So that all we propose to do is to substitute <Col N="712" /> advertisement in the daily Press for affixing notices to church doors.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in exactly the same way.  There is no other change in the law than what I have mentioned. With regard to the schedule system referred to by Senator Linehan, we are quite aware it would be desirable to introduce a simpler system here. Perhaps we would have done something in that regard but for shortage of staff.  If experienced members of the inspectorial staff were available we would have devised a new income tax code, but we had not sufficient experienced men to do even current work when we took over the system.  We are now almost in sight of the position in which we will have sufficient inspectors. Some of the young men recruited in 1923 have been commissioned as inspectors, and others will be suitable for taking on duty as inspectors within a year or two.  The more experienced men can then be relieved, and it will be possible to examine the system with a view to simplification. We recognise that all the intricacies of the British system are undesirable. It is intended to make a change as soon as practicable.  With regard to the collection of arrears, some time during 1923 notices were issued in the Press allowing people to appeal, the ordinary time for appealing having elapsed.  A great number of people took advantage of that special opportunity to appeal. I do not think any further opportunity can be given.  By far the greater portion of arrears which had arisen prior to 1923 have now been collected and only a small portion remains.  I think nothing can be done with regard to the people who have outstanding arrears which accrued during the period prior to 1923.  I cannot hold out to the Senator any hope that we will do anything more for them.  They got a fair chance in 1923, assuming they had neglected to appeal prior to that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell asked whether the reduction of income tax had resulted in the attraction of more capital here. In certain cases persons who possess an income bringing money into the <Col N="713" /> country and who had intended to leave the country did not leave it, and there were certain other cases where the persons returned.  That is one of these matters where it is very hard to see effects.  It is impossible to collect statistics, but the impression is that the reduction of tax had a certain stimulating beneficial effect.  I do not believe that you will get effects commensurate with the loss as a result of the abolition of the tax.  If we are to take care not to have a tax higher than the British rate, or if preferably we had a little lower rate, we would get as much advantage by that as by having it a great deal lower.  I do not believe the results suggested would arise from the abolition of the tax.  If there is reluctance to invest money in this country that reluctance arises from the fear that profits will not be earned rather than from fear of a tax on the profits.  Except on the basis of the British tax being substantially reduced I would not be in favour of any further reduction in the rate of tax here.  Senator O'Farrell made certain references to the Carlow beet factory.  Of the total amount of subsidy due to the factory, that was paid partly by remission of excise duty, that is by the fact that any excise duty went against the customs duty, and partly in cash.</P>

      <P>There is a point I wish to raise in connection with Sections 2 and 3.  It is probably a point that should be raised on the Committee Stage, but it might be too late then. It refers to the discontinuance of the super-tax and the substitution of the surtax.  Similar changes have been introduced into the Finance Bill in England.  Sections have been introduced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that have been the subject of a great deal of discussion and comment in the Press.  From the correspondence with reference to the English Finance Bill it would appear that under certain conditions a number of people liable to super-tax will, under the change, be now liable under the new name, surtax, to double payment of super-tax for a year, but not longer. The question has been taken up in the Press and it is an extremely complicated one.  The financial papers have discussed it and, as a result, I understand several amendments are being brought in on the Committee Stage of the English Finance Bill.  What I would like to know is, are these sections introduced in the Finance Bill of the same nature as those in the English Bill, because if the Minister wishes to follow suit, and if the amendments are carried, and there is a possibility some of them will be, would not that alter the whole basis here?  The amendments which are to be brought up in Westminster, if passed, would completely alter the incidence of this tax.  Surely if the Minister wishes to be on the same lines as England, he should wait and ascertain what the Imperial Parliament is going to do in the matter.  The hardship caused by the sections I have mentioned in the English Bill would be very severe, judging from the views expressed by the correspondence in the Press.  It may be that under the Bill as framed here the same hardship would not exist.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to let us know.</P>

      <P>There is no need to follow exactly the arrangements that may be made in Great Britain.  It is desirable to have a certain broad similarity <Col N="715" /> largely because of the considerable number of people doubly resident, but there is no need to follow it closely.  The changes made in Great Britain in comparatively minor matters would not cause any embarrassment so far as we are concerned.  Generally, the effect of the substitution of a surtax for super-tax is this: &ldquo;Under the code that has existed up to the present if, say, a person became entitled to an income of £3,000 in one particular year he was not liable to any super-tax within the year, for his assessment would be on the basis of his assessment of the previous year.  The effect of having the super-tax here as in Great Britain will be that the surtax is based on the year of assessment, and payment is postponed till the following year, but the tax is payable for the year of assessment, so that the person who for the first time this year had an income of, say, £3,000, would be assessed on the surtax to the appropriate amount that will really be due in the present year, but time would be given for payment until January the following year.  Generally, the effect of this substitution of a surtax for super-tax is that every person who has the requisite income will pay the higher tax on his income in respect of every year he has that income.  I do not know that it will cause any person to be charged twice&mdash;that is, to pay either for super-tax or for surtax for two years. Personally, I do not propose to make any amendment.</P>

That was as to whether the House should delete the Third Schedule and accept the suggestion made by Senator Hooper that was embodied in his amendment, by which it would be open to unqualified persons at present to qualify under the provisions of the amendment, provided they satisfied the requirements of a certain examination.  There was some question as to the nature of the examination and the body that would undertake it, and it was understood that the Minister and the Senator would confer together. I think the Minister's regrettable illness prevented that, and the position of affairs is that Senator Bigger has one proposal to make and the Government has another.</P>

Consequently there will be further delay in the Dáil in the event of a dispute between the two Houses. If there were serious differences the Houses would need to be in session together in order to get the matter settled.  A fortnight ago we were given an amendment by Senator Hooper.  It was a new amendment.  We had passed from the clause to which it was relevant, but the Senator got leave to go back on it.  The House granted him that indulgence and we discussed every single point that is now in my amendment. If the Senator was prepared to move his amendment a fortnight ago, and was prepared to argue on it, it is very easy to get the points of difference between my amendment and his, and very easy for the House to make up its mind now.</P>

Whether that is likely to be realised or not I cannot say.  What <Col N="721" /> I have in mind is that in view of the pressure otherwise that will ultimately fall on us in the course of the next three weeks, the House might consider whether it would be desirable to sit on Tuesday and to take the Committee Stages on Thursday.  It would not be quite reasonable, I think, in the case of the Constitution Bills to take the Committee Stages on the day following.

      <P>I think it is.  I do not want to occupy the time of the House now and I will simply move the amendment. If it does not meet Senator Mrs. Wyse Power's objection I regret it very much.  If I may say so, I think the Senator exaggerates the purport of this Bill, which, as I pointed out more than once, seeks to eliminate the objectionable <Col N="723" /> clause making it a condition precedent that a child should be found begging before it is sent to an industrial school.</P>

      <P>I think the Bill is very much better without these words, but I do not think that withdrawing the words meets my suggestion about getting a child out when it is put into one of these schools.  I think the Cathaoirleach pointed out that, and I understood that Senator Brady would put some words in to simplify the withdrawal of the child when the parent had employment and when there were better conditions in the home.  That part remains exactly as it was and I do not think that I exaggerated the case at all.  I have given a great deal of time and consideration to the question.  I was a Poor Law Guardian for nine years and during that time had a good deal to do with putting children into industrial schools, or rather, with the prevention of having them put in and finding other means of housing them.  There is a difficulty in getting children out, and I gave the Seanad an example of that at the last meeting.  The example I referred to appeared in the newspapers. It was quite definite.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That the further consideration of this Bill be adjourned until the <Col N="727" /> report of the recent Poor Law Commission has been examined by the Executive Council with a view to legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything more than I said originally, that I object to piecemeal legislation, though I do not object to the principle of Senator Brady's Bill.  I repeat that I was the first in this House to draw attention to the anomaly.  I am quite against it, but I do not think it is fair or just that one paragraph should be taken out of the Poor Law Commission's report and a Bill brought in on that one paragraph. There is the question that arises with regard to industrial schools and future legislation.  We hope, and it is hoped by everybody who has thought out the problem of the life of the child in this State, that something will be done for the widow who is left without a breadwinner. We hope that something will arise on the Poor Law Commission's report to give widows a small pension so that they can rear their children at home.  If the amount given to the schools were given to the mother, she could very often keep her children with her, and they might not be sent into the schools.  If you pass this Bill to-day, without the consideration of the Executive Council on the question, you are cutting across this whole scheme of mothers' pensions.  You are practically retarding that point of view.  A Committee is sitting that has been doing what it could to get these mothers' pensions adopted, and they are very anxious that this Bill should not be passed, because they think it will retard their work.  The question of mothers' pensions is an enormous one for this State, and it is a question whether it can afford them or not.  I know that.  But at the same time I do think that there are certain widows with little children who could be kept for a very reasonable amount, practically as reasonable an amount as that paid to the industrial schools, and that their homes could be maintained.  It is for that reason only that I opposed this from the beginning.  I believe that the principle of Senator Brady's Bill is the right one.  It is a perfectly correct Bill, but I do not think that it is right or reasonable that we should take <Col N="728" /> upon ourselves legislation on this particular matter before the Executive Council has had time to consider it.  It is for that reason alone that I oppose it, and it is for that reason alone that I move my amendment to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. GOGARTY Dr. GOGARTY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment, because I think Senator Mrs. Wyse Power's contention is very far-reaching. There are many Commissions sitting, and it may be a reflection on the disturbance of legislation by these Commissions, or help towards legislation, but there are Commissions sitting whose reports are not in, or whose reports are withheld when they are in, and certain actions take place without regard to these reports.  An instance of this is the Greater Dublin Commission.  Many houses were built while that Commission was sitting, and houses are continuing to be built which may have to be changed or taken down for roads to go through, or which may fall down before the Commission's report is adopted.  In the same way, a Commission was set up to inquire into the child problem, and before it is dealt with Senator Brady brings in a Bill to crystallise part of that Commission's report, and that might be in the way of the relief that might follow from that Commission's report.  I think that that contention cannot be answered, and I wish to support Senator Mrs. Wyse Power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with Senator Mrs. Wyse Power's contention, that the question of mothers' and of women's pensions should be considered, but it seems to be very much like the case we used to hear long ago in Ireland of &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass.&rdquo;  These poor children who are now destitute have now no place to go to.  If we do not pass this Bill they will remain in the same deplorable condition until such time as legislation can be passed.  The question of providing pensions for mothers is a question of finance, and it is a very complicated one.  The Minister for Finance will have to consider it, and consideration will have to be given to the question as to whether the finances of the country would stand it.  There are a hundred and one things to be considered, and things that ought to be <Col N="729" /> considered.  But here you have a concrete proposal to remove a definite, crying hardship.  If this Bill is passed it will remove it, and I submit that it will in no way interfere with the broader problem of giving pensions to mothers.  I cannot see that it cuts across it in any way.  This will remove a grave injustice, an injustice which we all see is placed on the community by the law as it stands, and if you permit this Bill to go by the board now you will prevent these poor little children and these poor mothers from getting assistance, and you will in no way help them in another direction.  What Senator Brady proposes is to make provision for them by law, without making criminals of them.  I think the Bill is a very essential one, and I think its passing will in no way militate against a broader consideration of the problem. We should allow the horse to live on the grass he has, without looking to the grass which may be greener and better when he gets it, but which he may never live to get.</P>

      <P>The only point is the removal of the criminal action of begging. Some of us believe that the passing of this Bill would make it easy for the opponents of mothers' pensions to defer this very necessary measure which is in operation in England and in Northern Ireland.  I feel that I ought to oppose this Bill rather than put any excuse, any means, into the hands of the opponents of mothers' pensions.  They will say, when the people who are agitating for mothers' pensions carry on their agitation: &ldquo;The hardship on widows has been very much reduced; they can easily send their children, or the children they cannot provide for into industrial schools.  The stigma of begging is removed, and we see no reason for passing mothers' pensions for this State.&rdquo; It will delay this very necessary measure, and for that reason I am <Col N="730" /> going to oppose the passing of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. HOOPER Mr. HOOPER">

      <P>It seems to me that Senator Foran and Senator Mrs. Wyse Power have laid far too much stress upon the possibility of the passing of this Bill endangering the success of the campaign for mothers' pensions.  This Bill really affects a very small number. Probably the number of children who would be admitted to industrial schools as a result of this Bill would not exceed 200 at the outside.  After all, the number of children that can be admitted to these industrial schools is limited by the certificates which are granted to these schools.  Only a proportion of the places are now filled. This Bill might admit of a number of the remaining places being filled, but that would be a very small number. What the Bill really would do would be to see that the children who are admitted to the schools would be admitted without the taint of criminality, and the number that would be allowed to come in excess of those now in would be very small.  The widows' pension scheme was intended to apply to many thousands of children throughout the country, and really I think the danger has been exaggerated when one considers that the number that would be admitted under this Bill would be an infinitesimal percentage of the number that would be affected by a widows' pension scheme.  In these circumstances I believe that the House would be doing right in removing this taint from the children who are now admitted to the schools.</P>

      <P>I would make one short observation on what Senator Foran said.  We are, at the moment, attempting to right a wrong, and there are people opposing us in that attempt. Their contention is that we should not right that wrong because a better case might be made later for something else for which they want legislation.  They want to delay righting this wrong so that they may make a better case for a matter which is not entirely relevant to the matter at issue at the present time.  Why should that be done?  Why should one thing hang upon the other in that way?  Why should we be precluded from doing what we consider <Col N="731" /> is the right thing at the moment?  I think we should go right ahead, and let the other matters of social legislation and widows' pensions be considered on their own intrinsic merits later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that in the public interest legislation is urgently required by which all mechanically-propelled road vehicles used for the carriage of goods or for the conveyance of passengers for hire shall be subjected to taxation sufficient in amount to compensate for the estimated injury to the roads resulting from the traffic and for the advantages and immunities they enjoy from the unrestricted use of the public highways; and, further, that the problems of inland transport can be most effectively dealt with by a single Department of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> At the outset I wish to assure you that I do not propose to enlist myself in the great army of cranks, prisoners under sentence, or editors who write leaders, wishing to go one better than the Government by suggesting a particular Ministry, or anything else, to deal with this.  Therefore, I limit it to the suggestion of a single Department of State.  This problem is a new one, with which every civilised State in Europe and in America is confronted, the problem of the roads being constantly seized upon for the promotion of traffic which pays nothing for the advantages it receives from the roads. I am definitely separating my motion from any consideration of railways or canals, because they have nothing to say to it, other than as a matter of equity.  But if you put the problem as it originally arose to the older transport companies, and compare that with the position of the bus companies, you would require the bus companies to purchase land, form and maintain highways, and maintain offices and stations on those highways, and even then you would not get a condition comparable with that which the older transporting companies had to face.  The roads of Ireland were lately brought to such a pitch of perfection that they are now as good as any roads of which I have experience of in Europe.  This was done by a grant-in-aid of £2,000,000 from the Central Fund, whereupon, using that as a subsidy, several dozen companies, more or less solvent, have exploited these roads, which were put down for the benefit of the whole community, to their own benefit, and it has been done by a method which is not followed by any other transport company.  Buses have been hired by private individuals on a system of deferred payments. They have blazed certain paths and routes, and if they fail to keep up the payments for these buses the buses have been foreclosed upon by companies which enjoy the rights which are charged against the whole State. The companies represented by these buses have to their advantage a subsidy of £2,000,000 and a complete freedom from all taxes and all rates.  The Great Southern Railways Company paid in the year 1926 £203,000 in taxes, <Col N="733" /> but the bus companies of Ireland have not paid a farthing in taxes.</P>
    <P>If it were merely a matter of competition between bus transport and rail transport I would not care.  But it is not a matter of competition.  It is a matter of the destruction of the property of the citizens on the one hand, and of a contribution to the upkeep of the roads on the other.  What I mean to say is this: the railways, through their taxes and rates, are subsidising the roads, and they are subsidising a form of transport which is injuring them.  I know very well that this cannot go on.  No government intends to allow it to go on.  But I hope that what I have to say will get the authority of the Seanad to help to hasten legislation.  It has been worked out that the destruction caused by a bus or by a lorry is 3d. per ton mile&mdash; that is to say that every mile of road covered by a five-ton lorry is injured to the extent of 1/3.  That lorry may possibly go 1,000 miles in a week, and that would be £62 10s. in a week.  If one lorry does not go, another belonging to the same company may, or there may be twenty running together, so that at that rate the destruction caused to the roads by one lorry in a year is £3,250, and the tax on that lorry ought to be £3,250.  Even that taxation would not be adequate to keep the roads.  The railways, by taxing their engines, could not keep up their lines.  It costs the railway £200 a mile for a single line of rails in Ireland, and if a bus or a lorry paid £3,250 in tax we would still be confronted with the problem of the destruction of the public highways, which last year reached their present state of excellence merely by a grant of £2,000,000 from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>I divide the buses and the lorries into two heads.  The lorry is possibly more destructive, because it has not always got pneumatic tyres.  Sometimes it is a small steam engine, without rails to run on.  The bus has done damage to the country apart from the superficial damage to the roads.  It has injured the small country towns by tending to centralise the population.  Shopping is done in the larger towns, to the great detriment of the smaller towns.  But the return in mobility to the public is not adequate to the charge they are <Col N="734" /> placing on the public in rates and taxes through the destruction of the roads, and it does not take very much vision to see a point of stalemate, an impasse, being reached, when the rates will be no longer able to keep up the roads, and the buses, even though they have got a subsidy of £2,000,000 and have an exemption from taxes, will be harly able to move over the roads.  We have more roads, proportionately, than there are in England.  There are 48,000 miles of roads in the Free State, 18,000 of which are highways.  The original situation which confronts every form of transport company is the buying of land.  But if the buses had to keep these roads in cement they could only keep the highways in cement, and even then the railways would not get an adequate relief from the contribution that they have to make towards the upkeep of the highways. That is a matter of equity.  Even if the railways were remitted taxation of any kind they would not be in a position of equality with the buses, because their legitimate passengers would still be taken, on account of certain advantages enjoyed by the buses that they cannot cope with.  The Board of Trade has exempted the buses from any inspection, or from any guarantee that the lives of passengers would be safe; there is no inspection to see that the doors will let the people out in case of fire.  Senator O'Farrell, some weeks ago, referred to the safety of the vehicle.  There is no inspection of that.</P>
    <P>The remedy is very hard to seek.  I say that it would not be an equitable remedy if you relaxed the taxes in the case of the railways, because there are other factors.  But there is one consideration in this country which makes this problem more urgent than it would otherwise appear to be.  This is a producing country.  Produce always looks after itself, but in order profitably to market produce one must have distribution, and the question of distribution will be an ever-increasingly important one.  In every country where there is an attempt made to help agriculture, the first thing they do is to lower the freights on the railways.  Now, freights cannot be lowered on any railway which has to cope with competition and at the same time subsidise its rivals. <Col N="735" /> By paying taxes they are subsidising the untaxed buses.  The buses, with their great stands outside shops on the quays, and lined up against every <i>cul de sac</i> in Dublin, are paying no rates for what should be stations as large as the Broadstone or Kingsbridge stations. That is going on every day, but far more in those portions of Ireland which are sought to be advertised as tourist centres, where there are bog roads which will not stand this traffic. I travelled on the Friday before Whit Sunday through some of the most beautiful scenery in Connemara, scenery that is practically undiscovered, and coming back on Whit Monday I got such a shaking that it was as much as I could do to sit in the car without getting a shock to the base of the skull from the ruts.  That was on a road where there were only four buses.  I believe the county councils had some discriminating power about stopping buses on certain roads, and that they could allow them to run only on certain routes.  They will have to be stopped, or also apply for certain routes which they would pay for themselves. In America I believe they are trying to meet the case by taxation and by relegating the buses to certain routes.  But this country is too small for such routes, and it can only be done by a large increase in the taxes that buses are paying, or by the remission of taxation on other companies.  The buses cannot carry the essential merchandise that this country depends on, nor can they engage in the distribution of live stock which is being sent out of the country, for which the railway companies are required, and the railway companies must continuously keep up subsidies to the buses.  There are shops that should be distributing their merchandise that England sends over in return for our goods, and they are gravely injured by the concentrating of the centres of population caused by these buses.</P>
    <P>I am not an enemy of the buses.  I rather like the great speed at which they go along, and I certainly like the exhilarating petrol pumps that relieve the scenery everywhere.  But this is not a matter that can be tolerated very much longer, because the question of <Col N="736" /> transportation is a vital one.  The very routes that used to transport food and certain of our produce are becoming impassable, and the destruction is far greater than any advantage the country has gained.  It may soon be desirable to put a tax of £3,250 on buses, but 3d. a ton mile will not pay for the roads, if that tax could possibly be enforced. If one suddenly stopped every bus in Ireland there would be an outcry with regard to the hardship of people being unable to move, but I think we would have hardly any outcry, because the people are at present enjoying quite an artificial condition of affairs.  They are enjoying a subsidy of £2,000,000 unwittingly given for the use of these buses; they are enjoying the action of foreign companies who dumped buses into this country out of their surplus supplies in England, and they are enjoying the bankruptcy of the small bus-holders being unable to meet their payments. They are also enjoying the fact that when a railway company tries to buy up a bus company two or three other bus companies come in.  Other bus companies will come in if this motion is passed, merely to gain goodwill. I opposed Senator O'Farrell's motion because I saw that there would be a kind of goodwill extended to all the bus companies if there was a Minister appointed from whom they could get compensation for ceasing to run.  The country has far too many buses, and in one way far too many road services. But whether it is met by a petrol tax, which would be hard on those who own private cars under a ton in weight, or whether it is met by an inclusive tax, it is a thing we have to consider, not a problem of competition with the railways, in which I have no interest, but as competition that is going to be a far more serious matter than we can see now, because later on it may be that if the proposal of Mr. Baldwin, who intends, I hear, to remit rates on agricultural holdings, is followed in Ulster it will be followed in the Free State, and we will be starting off with minus £3,000,000 a year for the upkeep of the roads and for public health and poor law services.  Instead of having this £2,000,000 a year out of the Road Grant we would have minus £3,000,000 a year on account of a remission of <Col N="737" /> rates on agricultural holdings.  This problem will have to be met and dealt with, and the reason I suggest that it be met in one Department of State is to prevent anyone having the objection against me that I had against Senator O'Farrell's proposal, that it would lead to the creation of a Ministry, though I think the more Ministers the merrier. One Department of State ought to deal with this problem before the roads become so impassible that the money that should be spent on them cannot be afforded, because we can get a certain degree of damage, and beyond that it really means absolute ruin.  I will not occupy the time of the House any longer than to ask them to consider this problem, which is just now, in this country and in every other country, the question of the privateering of public moneys for certain transport companies, which have the undue advantage of contributing nothing to the general upkeep of the highways over which they ply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenjaminHaughton" hpid="Mr. HAUGHTON Mr. HAUGHTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HAUGHTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the resolution, and I suggest to Senator Gogarty that he should add the following to it: &ldquo;That the Government be requested to authorise the carrying out of proper scientific tests for measuring the damage caused to the roads by the verious vehicles.&rdquo;  This subject has been frequently discussed by the Cork County Council.  It has been prominently brought under their notice by the fact that there has had to be considerable expenditure on the maintenance of the roads in the county which have been so seriously injured by the heavy traffic that is taking place over them, especially by the solid-tyred lorries and by the buses, which travel at the rate of 25 miles per hour, to the great danger of all pedestrians.  The roads in the county have been very badly cut up by these lorries and buses.  I am afraid that many people in the Free State overlook the fact that these motor vehicles that are used across-Channel are scarcely suitable for this country.  The point, however, is that they have been imitated and adopted here.  There is a great difference between our roads and the roads in Great Britain.  In Great Britain they spend over £50,000,000 a year on the roads.  I have one practical <Col N="738" /> remedy to suggest to the House to deal with the present situation on the roads. I hope it will meet with the approval of the House, and with that, too, of the Minister for Industry and Commerce whom we are all pleased to see here this afternoon after his recent illness.  One of the suggestions which I propose making is conveyed in a resolution passed by the Cork County Council.  It reads:</P>
      <P>Having considered the report of our county surveyor, and from our own observations, we are convinced that our roads cannot stand the destruction caused by the vehicles at present allowed to use them.  We desire to refer particularly to the heavy solid-tyred lorries and the heavy buses allowed to travel at excessive speed.  We ask the Government to take proper steps to control road traffic with the object of fitting vehicles to the class of road that we can afford to construct and maintain. With this object we also ask the Government to empower the University Colleges, and especially University College, Cork, which is quite willing to act, to carry out tests on the lines suggested in our county surveyor's report.</P>
      <P>These tests have been adopted in Sweden and in the United States of America and other places with great advantage.  I also suggest, on the advice of experts who have asked me to mention the matter, that the vehicles used in this country should be six-wheeled. Vehicles of that type would do infinitely less damage to the roads than the class of vehicles that is at present being used.  I think also that some substantial concession might be made to lorry owners who used pneumatic tyres on their vehicles instead of the solid tyres that are tearing up the roads in all directions.  I hope that Senator Gogarty will agree to the addition that I have suggested to his resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. BAGWELL Mr. BAGWELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that I ought to support this resolution.  It is a subject to which, at different times.  I have given a good deal of thought.  The subject is a complicated one, and lends itself to be dealt with by this motion, <Col N="739" /> which touches on part of the problem. I feel myself that what is advocated in the motion would be a move in the right direction.  As Senators know, I have always been opposed to subsidies, and to the subsidisation of organisations. Of course, the arguments in favour of a subsidy are that you will get your money back in another way. Sometimes, perhaps, you do, but I am by no means certain that you always get it back.  Outside the towns, I contend that commercial transport on the roads is the most heavily subsidised industry in the country.  That, I admit, is merely an assertion on my part, but I think it is a reasonable assertion. After all, the main factors in destroying the road surface is a combination of the factors of weight, speed and friction.  These commercial vehicles that are now in use are the heaviest things on the road.  The amount of friction that is caused by them tends to tear up the roads to an enormously greater extent than that caused by slow-moving vehicles.  It follows that the roads could be maintained in their present condition, or probably even in a better condition than they are now, at a very much less cost, if these commercial motor vehicles were taxed in proportion to the damage which they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must not disguise from oneself the fact that these vehicles do perform a public service.  They are unquestionably of great public benefit to certain sections of the public, especially to those who use them, and the question is whether the benefit they confer outweighs their cost to the country as a whole.  The only sure means of testing that question is on the lines suggested by this motion; that every motor vehicle should, as far as possible, be taxed according to the increase in the cost of road maintenance when it occasions.  Suppose that the whole country, if I may draw a fanciful picture for the moment, were under one man, and that we were to look at the whole community as members of his family, and suppose he was anxious to do what he could for the general weal, is it likely that he would divert his traffic from the steel roads, which he had already got perfectly well built to <Col N="740" /> carry his heavy traffic for him, not perhaps so well as the road vehicle in some instances, and transfer all that heavy traffic to the roads which were not made to carry it, and on which enormous sums of money have to be spent so as to enable them to carry it, and so as not to render them unfit for the carrying of any sort of traffic?  I do not think that he would.  I think that if the general weal were wisely considered in an all-round way, that could be shown not to be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I am voting for the motion, though I feel it does not cover the whole ground.  The mover of it, I think, would not claim that it does.  I think, at all events, it is only right that some attempt should be made to try, so to speak, to make the punishment fit the crime as far as increasing the taxation on these heavy motor vehicles, accord-to the damage they do to the roads, is concerned.  I think also that these heavy motor vehicles might be prohibited from travelling over roads except certain scheduled roads.  If we are to tax these vehicles according to the damage they do to the roads, one great advantage would, I think, ensue.  We should be certain that the service which these commercial motor vehicles give is really in the public interest, because unless they were able to make enough money to enable them to pay the increased taxation, the thing would soon find its natural level.  What I think must be present to the mind of every man who has ever given any thought to the question is: whether the present way of dealing with it, or rather the failure to deal with it on scientific lines, has not involved the country in enormous waste.  I think it probably has.  I heartily support the motion in the hope that the Government will do something in the way of considering this question on somewhat more scientific lines than it has up to the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. COUNIHAN Mr. COUNIHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COUNIHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With some portions of the motion moved by Senator Gogarty I agree.  One is with regard to transport buses and the number to be under the control of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  I think that <Col N="741" /> as regards all buses plying for hire on any highway, regulations should be made by the Department requiring them to have a permit.  I think that, before these people got a permit from the Department, they should be able to show that there was necessity for a licence being issued to them to run a bus.  At the moment there is an amount of unnecessary bus competition which is certainly doing harm to the roads, and which is of very little use to the country generally.  I do not agree with Senator Gogarty's contention that the motor buses or motor lorries should pay £3,250 a year in taxes.  If that were carried out, it would mean taxing the buses and the lorries off the roads altogether.  These motor lorries have become an essential in the life of the community.  I hope that the Government will take up this matter and inquire into it fully with a view to introducing legislation when the whole subject can be adequately discussed in this and the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>With the general principle of the resolution I think there can be no real disagreement.  The resolution merely postulates the commercial principle that every industry should, as far as practicable, be self-supporting. The majority in this House have fairly consistently supported that principle. Moreover, it is a principle that has been acted upon in regard to all other forms of internal transport, such as the railways, tramways and canals.  The railways, before coming into existence, had to get legal authority to do so.  They had to buy land, sometimes at exorbitant prices, to build their permanent way and maintain it at their own expense. In addition they have to pay rates on all this property, including the buildings they occupy, on accessories, etc.  The tramway companies are also governed by legislative enactments. They have to build and to maintain their permanent ways, not only the permanent way over which the trams run, but, in addition, over nine inches, I think, on each side of the rails.  The same applies to the canals.  Even in regard to sea-going vessels, these have to pay high tolls and wharfage rates. They have to maintain stores and pay rates on them.  None of these regulations <Col N="742" /> apply to that form of transport which is now seeking to become a substitute for practically the whole of the internal transport system of the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in discussing the question of transport in the other House, postulated a veritable transport revolution when he said that &ldquo;the amalgamated company should make the carrying of goods its chief concern, and not set out to be, as in the past, a passenger-carrying service.&rdquo;  He modified that statement somewhat on the following day. He was certainly very definite in his statement to the effect that all passenger train traffic now carried by the railways would eventually be diverted to the roads.  As far as the Great Southern Railways is concerned, it alone took in 1927, by way of receipts for passenger traffic, the sum of £1,806,000.  When one considers that, one can easily visualise the vast amount of extra traffic which the Minister foresees is going to be turned on to the roads, and the problem that constitutes for road maintenance, for the public safety, and for those who use the roads for other than motor transport purposes. Yet the Minister did not give much indication of the existence of any plan or policy being in the mind of the Government as to how that great revolution was going to be dealt with. When one considers the amount of damage done by fast-travelling omnibuses, weighing perhaps from five tons to ten tons, it is difficult to say what the actual tax should be.  If, as Senator Gogarty seems to think, the average distance covered by a bus is 1,000 miles a week, that is certainly a small estimate for a bus service.  The Senator, I think, referred to Sir William Ackworth.  He made an estimate, and, as well as I remember, it was threepence per ton mile.  One can see that that would impose an impossible tax on the buses, and to that extent certainly they cannot be taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has got to realise that the tax paid on the highest-taxed buses in the country would not be sufficient to pay the wages of the worst-paid road worker in the country.  The higher-taxed buses are mainly 32-seater <Col N="743" /> vehicles, and the tax on them is £64 a year.  That sum would not be sufficient to pay the wage of 25/- a week which is paid to some road workers in the country.  It could not be sufficient to pay the wages of the road worker employed in repairing the damage done on the roads in any one year by a bus that was in full service, to say nothing at all about the cost of the road material, which is very high, or the other costs involved in maintaining the roads.</P>
    <P>I am informed that last year the amount received from the tax on buses and lorries combined was in or about £42,000.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but a Government official gave me that figure from memory.  The mileage done by passenger buses alone during the first four months of this year, in the Free State, was nearly four and a half million miles.  If you allow for the fact that the first three months of the year may be regarded as winter months, and that a vastly greater mileage is done in the summer period, you must allow that at least fifteen million miles will be covered by these buses in a full twelve months' period. If you spread that total mileage over the sum of £42,000, you will find that it works out at about three-fifths of a penny per mile, irrespective of the weight of the bus.  That may mean that a bus weighing five or six tons is only paying a tax at the rate of three-fifths of a penny per mile for the damage it does.  That obviously is not a commercial proposition, and Senator Bagwell was not overstating the case when he asserted that this was the most heavily subsidised industry in the country.  That figure of three-fifths of a penny per mile is a long way from the estimate of Sir William Ackworth which was threepence per ton mile in respect of each bus.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the Dáil, indicated what was the basis upon which the ordinary ratepayer was assessed in respect of the roads at the present time. He said that he took the cost of what was spent on the roads in 1914, and added to it the increased prices which farmers were getting for their produce two years ago, and that anything over and above that was made good out of <Col N="744" /> the road fund.  In other words, the farmer was paying about fifty per cent. more in rates for the upkeep of the roads now than he was paying in 1914. The rest is made up in grants, partly from the road fund and partly from other grants for the relief of unemployment such as the £2,000,000 grant, etc. While that may look fair enough on paper, it is true I think to say that the roads are not as useful to the farmer, as safe for the farmer as regards the driving of horses and cars on them as they were in 1914, while they are almost impossible from the point of view of pedestrians.  It is a fact also that the big expenditure on the roads is being confined, in great part, to the great boulevards that are being constructed for the convenience of motor traffic.  In that connection I notice a statement made by a Deputy from Waterford.  He said: &ldquo;I am afraid that the farmer ratepayer will not be satisfied.  He maintains that he is not getting more for his produce now that he got in 1914. His argument is that he is back to 1914 prices, but the cost of the upkeep of the roads is far is excess of 1914.  As evidence of that the Waterford County Council last year and this year cut the county surveyor's estimate by practically £30,000.  In addition to that they had to cut off a number of third class roads and deprive a number of their own ratepayers practically of access to their own holdings.&rdquo;  In other words, the ratepayer finds it hard to get to his own home in order that he may maintain a first class highway for motor traffic in which he is not very mightily interested.  All sorts of Board of Trade regulations have been imposed on the railways, tramways, and canals for that matter, at a time when one would imagine that all forms of transport should be encouraged when there was no competition.  It is now when we are independent of any particular form of transport that we are actually paying the heaviest subsidy ever paid to one form of transport.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the question of a tax on petrol has been left out of consideration. We have been told by the Minister that it is an impossible tax, but Great Britain at all events is going to prove that it is possible.  A tax of 6d. per gallon on petrol on the basis of <Col N="745" /> the consumption of petrol last year would bring in about £450,000.  Of course, in addition to that there would still be required some tax on the basis of axle, spread of the wheel, etc., as far as huge vehicles are concerned, because they are imposing a burden upon the roads which the roads were never built for.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Government have ever considered the equity of a tax on passengers' tickets.  That certainly would impose a tax in proportion to the amount of business done.  It would be an equitable tax, I think, from the point of view of the passenger. My attention has been drawn to the fact that a number of people who own private motor cars, some eight or ten miles from the city of Dublin, have been able to dispense with their cars because of the bus facilities afforded. In dispensing with their cars, they have been able to save themselves the cost of the upkeep of them, while the State has lost the tax which would be paid on them.  I think there would be no hardship inflicted on these people if they had to pay something for the very cheap fares that they are getting as a result of the public subsidy of that particular form of transport.  They could hardly complain if a tax were put on the tickets.</P>
    <P>When speaking on a previous occasion, Senator Bagwell talked about the danger of interfering with private enterprise. As there are other forms of industry and transport under private enterprise working without a subsidy, it cannot be argued that the motor transport industry is private, inasmuch as it is getting this heavy public subsidy. When one compares the community value of these forms of transport, you will find that there is really no comparison between road motor transport, and, say, the railway industry. The railways in the Free State pay £60,000 per week in wages.  They employ over 18,000 workers, and when you take their families into consideration, that means that they are maintaining in employment, in fairly decent conditions, a very large number of people indeed.</P>
    <P>The railway industry is one of the few industries in the country worth talking about.  They put up, by way of <Col N="746" /> wages and other material, nearly five and a half million pounds a year.  That is no mean contribution towards the revival of trade and the solution of the unemployment problem.  In 1926, the last year for which I have figures, they paid in rates the sum of £203,700.  Part of that goes towards the upkeep of the roads.  When you compare the contribution which the other forms of transport make towards the solution of unemployment, or the reduction of the rates, you will find a very striking difference. Deputy Davin, in the Dáil, quoted figures in regard to one line in Ireland, that is, the line from Dublin to Dalkey.  He showed that on that section the railway company employs 451 men and paid £79,000 in wages, and that there was to be added to these figures the cost of coal, rates, the maintenance of rolling stock, etc.</P>
    <P>The Tramways Company employs 340 men; it pays in wages £54,900 and for rates and way-leaves £23,550 and £11,300 for maintenance of rolling stock.  Coming to buses, there are eleven or thirteen companies serving that area.  They employ 40 people, paying in wages £4,160 and £1,290 in taxation.  Not one of these buses, as I said before, pays in tax as much as the wages of one road worker in the year and, therefore, even on the very best of lines where they are most numerous they are by no means a national asset.  Their failure or otherwise is not going to affect our national credit to any great extent, while the disappearance of the other form of transport is going to be a blow to our national credit, to say nothing of the effect on employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in suggesting that the railways should confine themselves to goods traffic I think should take into consideration the fact that it is hardly possible for a railway line to be run if it is only to carry goods traffic.  For instance, the receipts of the Great Southern and Western Railway for 1926 were £4,260,000 and out of that the receipts from passenger traffic were £1,806,000.  If you take away the receipts from passenger traffic you cannot run the line for the benefit of the goods traffic.  I do not think it is good national policy to encourage the creation of a condition of things which <Col N="747" /> would leave the whole passenger traffic in the hands of one form of transport divided up amongst 100 or 200 different concerns with no co-ordination between them, bound by no regulations of any value to the community, and shut up the railways for passenger traffic because we have got this new form of transport service.  The railway companies have to provide stations, platforms, waiting rooms and lavatories. Then they have to pay rates on these buildings, and water rates.  They have to contribute to the maintenance of roads which the buses use.  Streets are provided free for the buses, and free stands are also provided for them.  The railway companies must provide warehouses and goods stores and pay rates on them, while the bus companies provide neither one nor the other.  The railway companies are common carriers and have to take all kinds of goods whether they like it or not.  The bus companies are under no such obligation and they may take or refuse to carry.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he had been in intimate and constant touch with the amalgamated company since the amalgamation and he had received no request from them for any form of restricted control of road transport.  I am not surprised at that as the railway directors, or some of them, look on the railways as side lines.  They have half-a-dozen business interests and the railways are only a passing interest.  I did not see one of these railway directors present during this discussion, which is an indication of their interest in the matter.  The Minister should not take their interest in this question as being any indication of the state of public feeling, for it is even possible that some of them may have an interest in road transport.  Where the railway companies do plead the iniquity of the existing situation is when they go before the Railway Wages Board to get the wages and salaries of their employees reduced.  Then they say all the things they should say where it will have some effect.  Their only contribution to the solution of this problem is to take off the table of the railwaymen a little more bread which is perhaps already scarce.  The Minister defended his <Col N="748" /> failure to do anything because he was ignorant of the existing conditions.  He said the only people from whom we have any returns are the railway buses which are under control, or words to that effect.  In other words, keep ignorant of the existing conditions and you need never do anything, and you can defend your inaction by that means. It was suggested that there should be some form of control that would fix rates and fares and generally exercise more control than exists at present. One was driven to the conclusion that the Minister's speech was a very eloquent without being a convincing defence of doing nothing.  I think he went out of his way to say that if they were to control transport why not control cinemas and drapery shops?  That is absurd.</P>
    <P>There has been control of inland transport for over a century.  A system of control has been adopted by all governments through all the years.  It is extending to things other than transport. For instance, the Minister would never allow publichouses to open <i>ad lib.</i>, but he would allow unfair competition.  When the railways were built no parliament would think of authorising the building of two lines beside each other, as that would mean running into speedy bankruptcy.  If that principle stands good in regard to railway transport, surely it is equally good in regard to that form of transport which is going to substitute it, and control and regulation is more essential in road transport, as it mixes with many other forms of transport, and with pedestrians, and is more intimately associated with public safety than railways, trams or canals.  The suggestion has been made that all powers of government should be concentrated in one department of State, and the question has been asked under which department. It is not easy to say without examination under which department it should be.  It is argued that the Ministry of Local Government deals with all questions of roads.  The rates which go to maintain the roads are paid under that Ministry, but the fact remains that the contribution of road transport taxation towards the upkeep of the roads is going to increase and will eventually <Col N="749" /> outweigh the amount paid from the ordinary rates.  Those who contribute the greater proportion of the rates for the upkeep of the roads will want to have some effective say as to the kind of roads they require.  To that extent it will be found that probably the Department of Industry and Commerce, which is closely and intimately associated with transport questions proper, can more conveniently than in the past take over all questions, including roads, and the question as to whether motor lorries should be allowed to run on roads or prohibited from doing so. I do not think it is an impossible proposition to say that all these questions shall be concentrated under one Ministry. One effect would be that all aspects of the case would be looked at by the same group of people, and we would not have different people examining different aspects without regard to other aspects.</P>

      <P>No, but it is possible, and it is a thing that happens in most human concerns where you have different Departments dealing with different aspects of a question.  The great thing is to approve the principle that within reasonable limits road motor buses and lorries should be made pay for the damage they do, and thus become like other forms of transport, self-supporting commercial undertakings.</P>

      <P>I do not think this discussion should close without attention being called to the indefiniteness of the proposition in the motion regarding the sums of money to be recovered from motor transport.  The motion is quite silent as to how that money should be applied.  I fancy there are a good many Senators who are not aware that in addition to the railway companies contributing to the rates they have to maintain certain sections of the roads.  Where bridges have been made and roads diverted, the railways contribute considerable sums towards the maintenance of the roads.  These roads have been cut away by the motor traffic, and where they are cut away the railway company has to bear the cost <Col N="750" /> of putting them in repair.  In my opinion, the railway company should receive the money and not the State or anybody else.  Senator O'Farrell mentioned the case of the tramways, and pointed out that a number of buses were running in competition with the trams on the Dalkey line, on roads actually maintained by the Tramways Company.  Where they run on paved road surface they are smooth and even, but when they get off on to the macadamised roads travelling is very uncomfortable. If any legislation is carried out dealing with this matter, obviously the people who are called upon to bear the cost of the maintenance of the road are the people who should receive that money.</P>

      <P>Senator Gogarty made certain suggestions on the question of transport which I heartily support. There are twenty buses now running on the Naas to Dublin road, and it is almost impossible to use the main roads for cattle traffic, and the by-roads have to be used for that purpose. Some lorries would hardly pull to one side to allow a person to pass with safety.  I am strongly in favour of having buses of over five tons weight taxed in proportion to the damage they do to the roads.  A good many people prefer to use the buses because they are a novelty, and as they pass their doors many avail of them to travel to Dublin.  That happens to be particularly so in the fine weather.  I hope that the iron roads of commerce, as Mr. Field called the railways, will regain their favour with the public.  I believe the question raised by the resolution should have the earliest attention of the Minister.  It is the duty of the Government not to let anything happen that would be a set back to the prosperity of the country, as, for instance, the railways being crippled by the competition of this new form of traffic.  In my opinion, however, when the expense of repairing and renewing buses and lorries are to be met, and people find these buses and lorries are not an El Dorado, they will again go back to the railways.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand Deputy Haughton's point with regard to empowering University <Col N="751" /> authorities to carry out tests.  The University Colleges are autonomous, and they can carry out any tests they desire.  I do not know that they need any inquiry, unless it is an attempt to hide a demand for money.  If it is that, then it is a different question.  Somebody has put the question as to whether the railways, by paying rates, did not give, in fact, a subvention to their rivals.  Senator O'Farrell asserts that bus companies do not pay anything of this sort.  In so far as the railway companies pay rates on house property, such as railway stations, they pay to the local authorities, because they get from them a certain service.  Bus companies with garages pay rates for them. In so far as the railways go beyond that and pay over to other bodies money applicable to road maintenance, that may be regarded as a subvention of the roads, but it must be remembered that railways would never get traffic if they were confined to traffic that was never carried on roads.  They get traffic of which some appreciable portion has been carried over roads, and to that extent they pay, and rightly pay.  There have been certain observations made with regard to Board of Trade restrictions on railways and other forms of transport, and that there is no form of inspection with regard to buses.  There is an inspection at least at the beginning with regard to vehicles before a licence is granted.  There is no inspection after that, but neither is there any inspection of a railway vehicle until accidents occur, and then the company has to meet the damages if at fault.  The delusion is fostered here that the railway companies are subject to examinations of the permanent way and the rolling stock, etc., day in and day out, whereas the buses go free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell referred to the £2,000,000 grant which he has described as a subvention to the road-carrying companies.  It has been partially that, I suppose, but it was intended in the first place to be a contribution to the re-making of the roads after the troubled period, and, secondly, to a large extent it was meant to be for the relief of unemployment.  I hope that nobody will believe I spoke in the Dáil in the way Senator O'Farrell quoted <Col N="752" /> me.  I have said some things, but I based them on a certain hypothesis.  I never put the attitude of defence on transport matters that I did not know and that I was determined not to know. I said that certain essential facts were required to be known before one could form a proper policy with regard to the roads.  If I spoke in ignorance there I was in good company.  All I say is that there is nobody, Minister or otherwise, who has in his possession the facts required for the particular type of control suggested to me.  So far from saying I was going to keep on in my ignorance, I said distinctly that we were now giving power to the railway companies to enable them to run buses on certain roads, and that as regards these 'bus journeys we would be able to get all the data we required, and that in the course of a year or two the accumulation of these facts would give the material required with regard to this particular traffic, and that the state of ignorance about it would be dissipated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, what I did say was the Minister suggested you might as well control drapery houses and cinemas as control buses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was being put to me that I should prohibit competition on the grounds that competition of a certain type was shown to be wasteful.  I asked was that to be applied merely to transport, or were we to take it as a general rule with regard to business in the country.  If there was a man who wanted to start a cinema in a particular place was I to say there are three there already and that is sufficient, and then apply the same principle with regard to drapery establishments? I simply wanted the question to be raised from the groove of transport to a general business principle as to whether we should go in and check competition where we thought it was wasteful.  Similarly, I did not speak of envisaging a great revolution whereby railway companies would be confined to goods-carrying traffic.  I said that possibly they would have to adjust themselves to meet a new situation which they themselves thought was coming.  As the Senator O'Farrell's <Col N="753" /> quotation of what I said on another occasion, one can quote exactly a sentence and leave the sentences preceding and following it out so as not to give a correct picture.  When I made the point to which Senator O'Farrell has alluded I was referring to statements made by the railway companies before the Railway Tribunal when they said they regarded certain passenger traffic as irretrievably lost.  If that was so the passenger traffic left them would constitute such a small portion of their entire receipts that they would have to be regarded as a purely goods carrying service, and in that event they would have to readjust their entire system and, as I said, I look forward to the time when the railways would become only a goods carrying service. As to the second part of the Senator's motion, it should have been brought forward in 1926 and if adopted then it would have come up in the Budget of 1927.  We can go on making inquiries, but I do not think anybody can say with any degree of accuracy what damage is done by particular types of vehicles.  If one takes the variation of the effects of the different types of vehicles on roads it is very difficult to say that a particular type of vehicle is causing a particular kind of damage to roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No general principle has been adopted.  A Committee was set up in 1926 or the early part of 1927.  An investigation showed that, taking the average moneys expended on roads in the three years ending the 31st March, 1926, and comparing these with the moneys spent in the year 1913-14, the actual increase is about 120 per cent. It was ascertained that the moneys paid by local councils to road workers showed an increase in those three years, based on an average of about 140 per cent. over the 1913-14 figure. The conclusion was drawn that there was not in fact anything more being done on the roads at the expense of the local rates in 1925-26, or the years before that, than there was in 1914, taking into account the difference in the value of money since 1914, while the motor vehicle taxation in 1926 was bearing 30 per cent. of the cost of maintenance and upkeep of roads. Particular calculations were made at <Col N="754" /> the time.  The roads in 1913-14 could be considered as not built for motor traffic.  It was not appreciably heavy that year.  Therefore, the roads were maintained by the local authorities for the ordinary type of traffic there was there then.  We made up our minds that it would be fair to ask the farmer to pay in 1926-27 an amount equivalent to what he paid in 1913-14.  The equivalent was got by taking the index figure of the selling price of his produce and equating that with what he got in 1913-14.  Items of cost on the roads beyond that we tried to get the farmer to pay, bearing in mind what he was paying in 1913 and making allowance for the equivalent increase in the value of money, building it up that way so that no further moneys were going to be taken out of motor taxation. That is the policy that has been followed since that day.  Private motors were bearing in 1926 about 50 per cent. of the entire money from motor taxation. The principle is that motor taxation ought to make up for the increased expenditure on roads above the 1913-14 basis by reason of the fact that motor vehicles are now plying over these roads.  If it is discovered that they are not paying enough then certainly the taxation will be increased. Everything in regard to the £2,000,000 grant has been met definitely out of the Road Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 50 per cent. before extra taxation went on heavy vehicles and heavy lorries.  I cannot understand the figures that Senator O'Farrell has given with regard to taxation.  I know that in 1926 the revenue derived from commercial vehicles amounted to £114,000 and the taxation of the hackney vehicles, including buses, £113,000, or £227,000 in that year, and that was before the taxation was increased.  The Road Fund is built up in a particular way. How it is built up comes back to the <Col N="755" /> other matter I spoke of, whether the incidence of taxation from motor vehicles as a class is properly adjusted between the different types of vehicles in that class, and that is a matter I am getting inquiries made into.  But the principle is there, that if we take the roads in 1914, as roads not built for motor traffic, if we take the expenditure, we say that the ratepayers should pay equivalent to what they paid in 1914, and we say that everything beyond that, which ought to represent the money spent by reason of the fact that more motors are now going on the road, is to be met out of motor taxation. That principle may not be operated properly.  There might not be enough money derived from motor taxation, but that will work itself out.  The motors, particularly the heavy motors, will be taxed eventually to meet that. That was the basis adopted in the Budget of 1927, and that operates.  A further inquiry as to how far it works out, and works successfully, is now being made.  I do not think there is now any great subvention being made to road vehicles.  If there is, it is not at the cost of the railways; it is at the expense of the private motor owners.  I am pleased to note that there was not a single argument advanced here with regard to the last portion of the motion:</P>
      <P>That the problems of inland transport can be most effectively dealt with by a single Department of State.</P>
      <P>It was the one portion of the motion that I wanted to hear argued, but there was not a single argument on it.  Senator O'Farrell referred to certain statements that I made in the Dáil in regard to this, but there was no argument used here on this point.</P>

The great advantage of one Department would be to organise and unify all forms of transport to prevent, for instance, such an abuse as occurred the other day to a lady who arrived in an American liner and wired to Dublin from Cork for a motor car to bring her up.  They proposed to charge her £27. If we had a unified service that sort of abuse could not take place.  There would be definite taxation and a definite rate made for transport per mile.  I am sure the Minister appreciates my reticence.</P>

One of the matters alleged to produce chaos was that the police, acting under the Department of Justice, prosecute people for breaches of the speed limit.  I want to know if I am supposed to take over the police, or supposed to have special traffic inspectors? Am I supposed to leave to the police the duty of having some check?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is done at the moment.  That is apparently not co-ordination. Co-ordination apparently is that people must be under the same Ministry.  The Minister for Local Government, if he were the person to move in the matter, could get the aid of the police as readily as I could, but actually the police, operating in the ordinary way under the Department of <Col N="757" /> Justice, bring these prosecutions.  If it is meant that there should be someone to say to the police that buses are flying at a great speed through certain parts, and to get after them, there might then be some co-ordination.  The police are always there, and if it is pointed out to them that these speed regulations are being broken they can be relied upon to take measures.  Am I to be asked to take over the roads? Am I simply to be asked to take over that amount of money which is derived from motor taxation, leaving the ratepayers to apply any way they like, through the local councils, the money derived from the rates?  I do not see any lack of co-ordination at the moment.  For this reason anything dealing with transport is a very big matter of policy.  It is a matter of Government policy.  It would fall for discussion by the Executive Council. The Executive Council is the co-ordinating authority.  I should say that 98 per cent. of the transport must come under my Department, but the Executive Council is the co-ordinating authority.  I was very interested in this motion on account of the last couple of lines in it, as I thought we were going to get a discussion on chaos. Where is the chaos, or anything that could be called chaos?  How far would it be bettered to have all the services in the State dealing with transport acting under one Ministry, and, after that, what Ministry?</P>

But there is room for discussion on that matter alone as to whether there should be one Department to control this.  But we have not been faced with any arguments that there was some negligence which could be dealt with and done away with by reason of the fact that control would be in one set of hands.  I think that the Executive Council co-ordinates so far as any co-ordination is necessary.  All the <Col N="758" /> Departments co-ordinate on certainly 90 per cent. of the bigger matters that arise, and about 98 per cent. of the entire transport matters are dealt with through my Department.  They may not originate there, but my Department puts them to the Executive Council. I ask the Seanad not to pass the motion until we have had some discussion on the last part of it.</P>

But the Minister does not want to escape.  There is no question about the destruction of the roads, and the only question is where is the remedy?  I think it is impossible from taxation, unless the tax on every motor car is multiplied four times over, to keep roads such as we had a year ago, and I cannot see from the Minister's explanation how that £2,000,000 is accounted for by the Road Fund. It is not an annual yield.  How do you arrive at that?</P>
