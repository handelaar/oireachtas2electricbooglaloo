      <P>I do not desire to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill. The object of the Bill shortly is to relieve a company which has been formed under the Public Bodies Mutual Insurance Act, 1926, from a liability to lodge a sum of £20,000.  Every insurance company which does fire business in this country under an Act which was passed before the Free State came into being has to lodge a sum of £20,000 as a sort of security for the conduct of its business and the payment of its policies. There is an exception to that rule made in favour of mutual insurance companies, companies which mutually insure their members, that is, all the members insure each member against risk.  The company which has been formed under the Act of 1926 called itself a mutual company.  It was formed under an Act the title of which is the Public Bodies Mutual Insurance Act. but in fact it is not a mutual insurance company and has been so decided by a competent court.  It has been held by Mr. Justice Davitt, and with great respect most properly held by him, that this company not being a mutual insurance company is liable to lodge this sum of £20,000.  The object of this Bill is really to relieve it from that liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, I am not opposing the Second Reading of this Bill, but I am very anxious to ascertain from the Minister or from my friend, Senator Kenny, whom, sir, I may describe as the father and mother of the original Act, whether the object of the Act of 1926 is being carried out by this company by the formation of a sufficient reserve fund, or whether this company is acting and will continue to act merely as a re-insuring agency.  The object of the Bill of 1926, as we were told when it was passing through this House, was to enable local bodies to mutually insure each other.  In the ordinary acceptation of language, that would mean that all of them were to be liable for the risk of each, and it was pointed out following what was done in England and the experience obtained in England that the premiums which these local bodies would have to pay would be very much smaller than they were paying under the system that existed of insuring with ordinary insurance <Col N="1061" /> companies, and secondly, that the premiums would be all kept in this country.</P>
    <P>I am afraid, without going very carefully into the machinery provided for the working of the Act, that was what we thought we were doing when we passed the Act, but in fact it was not what we were doing.  The machinery for working the Act is provided, I think, by Section 2 of the original Act.  Under that section local bodies might form a company known as a company limited by guarantee.  That is a company in which nobody was to be a member except the public bodies.  There could be no private shareholders, and the shareholders were to be public bodies, and their only liability was to be by way of guarantee, and the guarantee was not to exceed the sum of £10.  Now we all know that in the case of a company limited by a guarantee, that the guarantee never comes into use until the company is being wound up, and it is really a provision for the cost of the winding up of the company.  The company which was formed to work this Act was to be that kind of a company limited by a guarantee, with no share capital and with no lodgment of the £20,000.  It was therefore a company which would have no assets to start with.  It was only a company of the kind that could carry out the objects of this Act&mdash;that is, insurance by these local bodies by starting with the re-insurance of all their risks, plus the gradual formation of a reserve fund.</P>
    <P>I understand that is what has been done by a company which was formed in England to carry out their Act. which was passed before, I think, the year of 1909.  We were told that the English company had already acquired a reserve fund of such colossal size that it was capable of meeting any possible losses, and that its annual premiums had been reduced by an enormous number of thousands of pounds.  What I am anxious to find out from the Minister, or perhaps from Senator Kenny, who might know more about the working of this company than the Minister, is this: What provision is this company making, or what provision is it bound to make, for this reserve fund?  How is that secured and how is it to be provided <Col N="1062" /> for?  It is very important to know that, because the whole success of this company as an efficient insurance against risks which these public bodies run depends on the formation of that reserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with what my friend, Senator Brown, has said.  The Bill before us states in Section 2 that the Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance shall be deemed always to have been and shall continue to be a company, etc., which of course, as far as this country is concerned, is deeming it to be what it is not.  This company is carrying an enormous amount of insurance and, as Senator Brown has very well said, it is simply acting as a re-insurance agency.  As an actual fact, it has very much less money in the country than any other insurance company that has been established.  However that may be, it may work out in time, but this is asking the Seanad to sanction a Bill exempting a company with no assets from depositing the statutory amount of money.  This company is a mere re-insurance agency, and even as a mere re-insurance agency it is not insuring with what is known as the recognised tariff insurers.  It is asking this House to deal with public property in a manner in which I as an insurer myself would not deal with my own property.  If the House in its judgment assents to that view&mdash;it is within its competence to do so if it thinks well &mdash;I ask Senators who have important insurance to effect, are these the classes of re-insurers to whom they would trust risks involving the destruction of their property?  From my experience of them I do not think so.  In my opinion, this Bill should not be further proceeded with until its real nature has been carefully examined by a joint committee of both Houses, who would report back to the two Houses.  I did not oppose the Bill in the first instance because I never dreamt that any companies other than tariff companies would be used for re-insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity for this Bill is regrettable, because I think it is due entirely to an oversight in the drafting of the original measure.  The object of the present Bill is to give <Col N="1063" /> effect to what were undoubtedly the intentions of the Oireachtas when the original Bill was passed.  The Minister for Local Government at the time, Deputy Bourke, who conducted the Bill through the Oireachtas, stated in the Dáil:</P>
      <P>The company or companies formed as a result of the Bill will proceed exactly on the same lines as the English company, which was in all respects a conspicuous success... It is not a case of taking a plunge in the dark.  The way has been already mapped out for us by the English company and we know exactly where we are going.</P>
      <P>The Minister continued:</P>
      <P>At the outset, of course, the company that will be formed as a result of this measure will be only able to retain a very small part of the business it will secure.  It will have to re-insure practically up to 90 per cent. or more of its business, and in that way local authorities will run no undue risks.  The funds that the company will have in hands will be able to meet any liability... As reserve funds are accumulated the company will be able to carry a larger share of the risk.</P>
      <P>The Minister at the time made that statement in the Dáil on the 23rd June, 1926, so that it cannot be truthfully said that the Bill was passed under false pretences.  It was well known that, in the beginning and until such time as reserves had gradually accumulated, that a large proportion of the risks would have to be re-insured, and that the proportion would decrease in the course of time, until eventually the new company would be able to carry a very considerable proportion of the entire risk.  That is what is being done in regard to all insurance companies.  Most of the insurance companies re-insure their risks, because hardly one of them carries one-quarter of the funds sufficient to cover the amount of the risks that they make themselves responsible for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of capital has been made out of this Bill, and an attempt has been made to show that the <Col N="1064" /> original Act has not been a success. In fact it has been a very conspicuous success, as its balance-sheet shows.  One finds that under the item of fire insurance that the usual reserve for unexpired risks is forty per cent. of the net income for the year&mdash;that is to say, forty per cent. is set aside&mdash;but this company has set aside 91 per cent in respect of fire insurance.  In addition, it has written off half of the whole of its preliminary establishment expenses, so that it shows no false or vague assets of a non-existing character, as is the case with certain companies that are now trying to destroy the existence of this company.  The most eloquent commentary on its success is the fact that the tariff companies have, as a result of the existence of this company, had to cut their rates down by an additional ten per cent. in respect of fire insurance for local authorities, on condition, of course, that each insuring authority would insure for a period of not less than five years.</P>
    <P>There is no branch, I think, of insurance on which greater profits are made than on local authorities insurance. The eventual result of this Bill will be that tens of thousands of pounds probably will be saved to local authorities, and consequently to the ratepayers through its working, and they will incur no risks that they do not incur at the present time.  It has been pleaded in certain quarters that the tariff insurance companies give employment, whilst this company gives little or no employment, but it has to be remembered that the employment given by the insurance companies is almost entirely in respect of industrial insurance burdens, and that in respect of local authorities fire insurance no employment is given except to the local bank manager who transacts the business, and possibly sends a cheque furtively to some clerk or official of the local authority.  That is the only employment that it gives, employment to people who do not require it, and who are not in the real sense of the word insurance workers at all.</P>
    <P>I hope that the House will pass this Bill, and pass it before this session has concluded.  Personally, I may say that I am rather averse to retrospective <Col N="1065" /> legislation of any kind, but here quite obviously the intentions of the Oireachtas were not expressed in the wording of the Act, and it would be quite foolish and ridiculous for us to fail to implement the intentions of the Oireachtas even at the expense of an amending Bill such as this.</P>

      <P>I would like to say, in reply to what Senator Brown has stated, that we would be very glad to have pointed out to us any way in which this Bill does not cover the exact legal position.  I am advised that the Bill fully covers the legal position with regard to the legalising of this particular company, and enables all companies such as it is to carry out the work that the original Bill was intended to allow them to do.</P>

      <P>The position which the original Bill was intended to meet here was a position which, as far as my advice goes, could have been created by local bodies here under certain circumstances under the existing British Acts, because the kind of mutual insurance carried out by this particular company is exactly the same type of insurance that is carried out by the Municipal Insurance Limited in England.</P>

      <P>It was, and because it was formed before the 1909 Act, it was not required to make a deposit of £20,000.  But in the year 1918 the bodies which are members of this particular company wanted also to take up insurance themselves against employers' liability.  When they approached the Board of Trade with regard to further extending their business so as to include employers' liability, they were challenged and told that they would have to pay down £20,000, but they were excused after a certain amount of argument with the Board of Trade from putting down the £20,000, because they convinced the Board of Trade that under the 1909 <Col N="1066" /> Act they were a mutual insurance company. This is an extract from Section 33 of that Act:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where the company is an association of employers... that is about to carry on business wholly or mainly for the purpose of the mutual insurance of its members against liability to pay compensation or damages to workmen employed by them, either alone or in conjunction with insurance against any other risk incident to their trade or industry.</P>
      <P>The Municipal Mutual Insurance, Limited, in Britain convinced the Board of Trade that they were an association of employers about to carry on business for the purpose of mutual insurance of its members, and if the interpretation of mutual insurance in the 1909 Act is going to be reciprocal insurance&mdash;well, the interpretation of the Act by the British Board of Trade since 1909 goes by the board.  It may be because the circumstances are such in Britain that these matters do not go into the courts for interpretation, but why we should restrict ourselves in a way in which in actual practice in Britain the municipal bodies desire to form a mutual insurance company and are not restricted, I do not see any reason for it, or why the present Act should not be carried through.  Senator Brown raised a question about the building up of reserves. So far as the legal position is concerned, I take it that the Senator will not argue that having no reserve will make any difference from the legal point of view?</P>

      <P>In fact, whereas the British company which has now established, as the Senator has said, very large reserves in its first year of trading, the difference between its premium income and re-insurance was only £1,067.  As a result of the first nine months' trading the new company here established a fire insurance fund of £1,010, and while I am assured that its business is carried on in the most conservative way, from the point of re-insurance, it ought to be understood that the Ministry accept no responsibility for the proper conduct of this <Col N="1067" /> company any more than it does for the proper conduct of the business of any other insurance company.  The idea of the new company here grew among the local bodies themselves.  It grew out of circumstances which are pretty well known to most Senators.  We explained when the principal Act was introduced that all the public bodies themselves were to be the members of this company. There are no other members. The nominees of the public body are appointed on the board of directors to carry on this company, and we must have faith in them and feel that they are both able and conscientiously seeing that the work of re-insurance and every work in connection with this company is carried along on good sound lines.  If any public body is not satisfied that the work of this company is properly carried out, there is no obligation on it to insure with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of misconception in the minds of people with regard to these tariff companies. Some Senators who have spoken have stressed the importance of the tariff group.  The tariff group is simply a group of insurance companies of the London fire insurance offices who arbitrarily dictate the rates of re-insurance for the public bodies of this country.  They have their agents in this country.  They have the company that is principally opposing the Public Bodies Mutual Insurance Company. The companies that are in the tariff group form the channel through which the activities of London fire insurance offices are operated for the purpose of protecting profiteering with regard to the business of fire insurance that obtains in the whole of these islands.  They know that fire insurance risks of the public bodies of Ireland are a premium insurance.  The public bodies in this country have in their buildings, usually sound structures, any fire appliances they may have for dealing with outbreaks of fire.  We as a General Council had in contemplation <Col N="1068" /> the setting up of our own fire insurance society for practically the past twenty-five years.  Even before the Hibernian Society came into existence very close consideration was being given to the matter.  At that time, before the Hibernian Company was formed, we thought there would be difficulty in getting a charter or permission from the English Board of Trade, and we placed ourselves behind the Hibernian Company when it was started.  We succeeded in having the accumulated business of the public bodies of Ireland transferred to that company, and so matters went on until the Hibernian Company was bought over, as other companies have been, when it proved to be a success.  Capital was omnipotent and it came in, with the result that the Hibernian went over to the English group, like other companies had done before.</P>
      <P>The object of the London Fire Offices is not to have any Irish companies succeed in this country.  It has been the inevitable fate of Irish companies when they get to a certain paying basis and show symptoms of success that the force and seductions of capital were invoked against them, and they were bought.  We got fed up with this and the General Council of County Councils decided that we would not have any more of this thing, that we would take the fire insurance into our own hands, and would put it even out of our own power to transfer the business to an English company.  That was a condition insisted on by the Local Government Department at the time, that in our Articles of Association we should put it out of our power to make any transfer to any English company, and we did that.  Now the company has been a startling success from the very outset, and the balance sheet shows that in the course of nine months we succeeded in building up reserves which approximate to the fire reserves built up by other companies after an existence of eight or nine years.  We got within a reasonable distance in nine months of the reserves that have been built up in nine years by other companies. The public bodies had been paying for years an extortionate premium rate for their fire insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> When we first took into serious consideration the position, we called for a return from 326 public bodies in Ireland and asked them to supply us with the premiums they had paid under the various headings of fire insurance for the last eleven years, and these returns disclosed the fact that £78,848 was expended in fire premiums alone by 199 public bodies.  The fire losses sustained and recovered by them during that period were only £5,796, so that out of every £100 in fire insurance sent out of this country to the London fire offices, who had a monopoly of this business, we got in return only £7, thus making a free gift out of every £100 of £93&mdash;that is to say, on a 7½ per cent. risk properly attributable to Irish public bodies for insurance we were paying 56 per cent. or 58 per cent. premium.  We then approached the Government, and we represented that the Municipal Fire Insurance Company of London had been a highly successful company after twenty-three years of trading, having started, as we proposed to start, had accumulated reserves amounting to £300,000.  In the first year of their trading they did not manage to build up a large reserve.  I say with regard to the bona fides of the position in England that if there had been any flaw in the Municipal Mutual Insurance Company in England, with the whole body of the fire insurance world ranged against them, because it was the first introduction of the mutual principle as far as fire insurance was concerned, certainly it would have been detected. The Municipal Insurance of England has to-day a Memorandum and Articles of Association similar to ours, and are doing the same business, but more than we are attempting to do as regards variety, and yet with all that phalanx of opposition brought to bear, it has been their fate to survive that and meet with great success.  That is the actual position.</P>
    <P>We are seeking from our own Government only the same facilities that the English Government gave to a similar body in England, and under which permission that body has been trading ever since with remarkable success. When we tried to do that same thing here we found all sorts of obstacles to <Col N="1070" /> our progress.  The Government here, seeing the merits of the proposition we laid before them, wanted to make our position absolutely secure, considering there may be a doubt if tested on the other side in a court as to whether the Municipal Mutual in England could be properly exempted from the deposit of £20,000, and they said &ldquo;We will make the position absolutely secure for you,&rdquo; and to do that they introduced an enabling Bill.  Now the situation has arisen that the Bill does not apply to this particular company for which it was purposely framed, and the ordinary man in the street would say if it does not apply to this particular company for which it was framed, to what does it apply?  It seems to have been a piece of futile legislation which applied to nothing, or which applied to only one set of circumstances, the setting up of this company and to buttress it and secure it in its position.  Now it has transpired that owing to a legal technicality the Act does not apply to the company to which it was intended to apply.  Under the Circuit Court procedure we were debarred from following up the proceedings initiated in the District Court, as the final court of appeal from the District Court is the Circuit Court.  Had we the opportunity of going further we should have done so, and possibly succeeded, because the point was purely a technical one.  In the meantime there has been a considerable amount of propaganda used against us, and we have to try and defend ourselves.  We were the innocent victims right through.  The Circuit Court vouched that we had complied with every possible condition the law had imposed and we were innocent victims. We were mulcted to the extent of some hundreds of pounds, and possibly may be mulcted in more, because the vendetta pursuing us will not stop in its pursuit.</P>
    <P>Whether our case has merits, or whether this Bill is a sufficient Bill or not, I am satisfied that there is no shame-facedness in this opposition so far, and for the purpose of propaganda and to keep up a state of ferment in the public mind, even on the least pretext, proceedings will be instituted against us.  The London fire <Col N="1071" /> offices, we are creditably informed, are prepared to spend £20,000 to break us and prevent the mutual principle operating here.  If with our newly-won freedom it is not possible for us to start a company such as this our freedom, from that point of view, is of very little use.  We are accused of having no assets.  Neither had the Mutual Insurance in England any assets.  I say that in proportion to the risks we hold in any insurance we undertake we have a much greater proportion of that risk covered than many of the companies in opposition to us to-day.  With regard to labour and the giving of employment, I say that we give more employment in proportion to the business we are doing than any of the opposition companies.  We are working in a limited field.  We are only touching the buildings of public bodies. Other companies have the whole field of commercial insurance.  We only do business under one particular head. We are confined to public bodies. Surely these other companies, if they had any sort of decency in them, would leave that little field to us, seeing that they had such a wide area to exploit from which we have purposely cut ourselves off?  This deposit of £20,000 is a chimerical thing relative to the business some of these companies are doing.  £20,000 would probably, in the event of winding up of a company, not contribute one penny per policy on the number of policies issued.  It is looked upon as a sort of security, but in practice and effect the relative value of £20,000 in comparison with the enormous figures of some of these companies is a bagatelle, a mere cypher and quite negligible.  We at the outside have only to retain a risk proportionate to our reserves, but as our reserves are built up we hope to hold more and more of those risks.  Our strong point is re-insurance.  It was contested in the Courts that when we went into the field of re-insurance we went outside our immediate members and put a risk outside instead of keeping it as a mutual risk.  You can establish no fire company or insurance company without re-insurance.  It is inherent in the business of insurance <Col N="1072" /> companies.  Even Lloyd's would not venture to trade a week on their own. Re-insurance is merely a distribution of risks.</P>
    <P>The fundamental principle of insurance is distribution of risks over a wide area.  I want to get back to what is in people's minds regarding tariff companies. It is represented by propaganda on the other side that every risk insured is backed by the whole assets of the tariff group.  That is a mistake. In every insurance risk that is taken by a company, Irish or English, if it turned out that a claim must be made for insurance the party insured would in the first instance have only to look to the company insured with.  If that company went wrong in its insurance risks it would have to bear the brunt. Many of these companies, as far as we know, take very considerable chances in these insurances, and hold much more than they are in a position to warrant them holding.  They take chances.  We take no chances.  We play for safety first, and right through, no matter how small the portion concerned, we follow the lines of the Municipal Mutual Insurance Company.  They gave us the greatest assistance.  In any risk we take we have the treaty group behind us, and that is as strong and as honourable and as well-founded as any of the tariff group.  When we went for our treaty insurance we did not seek for English companies to take it up. They were avid to take it up, knowing that it was absolutely a gift, the insurance of Irish public bodies, and that there was no risk attached.  All we had to do was to make a choice, and that was an extraordinary position.  So far as the non-tariff companies are concerned, many of them are more powerful than the tariff group.  They came after us for this business, and we took a pick from the best of them.  I say that we have a better group behind us than the tariff group.  There are millions behind every insurance we take up and to which we sign our name. That is the position of public bodies. Seeing that this was an agreed measure in the other House, I do not think there will be any degree of hostility shown to it here.</P>

      <P>As far as Senator <Col N="1073" /> Kenny is concerned, this is a private company.  If it were an ordinary company and the ratepayers were not involved, I would not bother to see that it complied with the law.  If public bodies are not properly insured, losses will fall on the rates.  I gathered from the remarks of the Minister that if the Bill goes through the Government have no further interest in it.  There was to be no inspection or control as to reserves or anything else.  The local bodies belonging to this mutual insurance company made their own rates and settled their own reserves, but they hold every single thing themselves, and the ratepayers have only to look in them to see that the business is done correctly and on sound business lines. The rates they charge may be so low that they cannot possibly put up proper reserves.  I take it from what Senator Kenny has said that they are re-insured with good companies.  Are all of them gradually reducing the amount of re-insurance? Are they piling up reserves so that eventually the great security they have got and the small risks will accrue to the advantage of the taxpayers and will remove from the taxpayers the cost of insurance?  These are points on which the public want information.  Personally I would like to know that someone well acquainted with insurance acting on behalf of the Government would keep an eye on these things and give us a report now and then on matters on which we as ratepayers are so interested.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  I am only dealing with the question before the House, which is of great interest to ratepayers.  I suggest that the Minister should tell us that somebody connected with the Government who knew a good deal about insurance matters would give us an assurance as time goes on that reserves have been accumulated, that the ratepayers' interests are being attended to, and that the cost to the ratepayers was going down, so that gradually there would be no charge for insurance, and that the reserves built up might be used for other purposes.  I think the ratepapers <Col N="1074" /> might expect the Government to do something like that, and give us a report now and then.  Senator Kenny is perfectly right in saying that the business is splendidly conducted, but it would be a great relief if we had a public auditor who could give us particulars in the way I have suggested.</P>

      <P>I take it that the insurance funds are audited by a responsible public auditor.  After all, the public bodies are not so foolish that they will not see from year to year that the business of the society is conducted in a proper manner.  I am sure that the public bodies would be the first to leave a firm not conducting business in a proper way.  I realised in the county councils that work of this nature was essential if we were to protect ourselves from the ravages of the English societies.  The county council I was connected with took its own risks with regard to employer's liability.  The English society was so rapacious that they doubled, trebled and quadrupled the amount of premium from time to time, with the result that the council had to form a sort of mutual society and take its own risk for many years, and while doing so it accumulated reserves.  I cannot see for the life of me why the Government, having secured the stability of this society and being satisfied that the risks are being re-insured in a proper manner, should be concerned whether the re-insurance is with a tariff or non-tariff company.  I presume that the Mutual Society in England, while being a non-tariff company, is capable of absorbing a certain amount of re-insurance.  I do not think that a public inquiry every year by the Government into the affairs of this company, any more than any other society, is desirable or should be encouraged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion made by Senator Jameson appears to me to be an extraordinary one.  It is the first time that I heard such a suggestion made.  The facts are, that most of the public bodies in this country were anxious to place insurance with Irish institutions.  For a number of years they went out of their way to place the insurance with Irish companies.  While <Col N="1075" /> we found that the public bodies were patriotic enough to place their business with Irish companies, the patriots who controlled these companies sold our business.  They may say that they sold their own business, but it was not their business.  We had produced that business, and when I say we, I mean those who were connected with the public boards of the country.  We trusted these people and supported them, and then we found that we were sold.  In order to prevent a repetition of that proceeding the representatives of the public bodies put their heads together and said: &ldquo;We will be sold no more; we will do our own insurance.&rdquo;  As a result this Bill was promoted in the Oireachtas, on lines identical with one that was passed in the British Parliament, and the Irish Mutual Assurance Company was established on a purely co-operative basis.  It is not looking for general business, but for the business of the public bodies, yet Senator Jameson tells us that the Government should have a yearly stocktaking of its accounts.  When people were carrying on a vendetta against the Irish Mutual Assurance Company there was no talk about protecting the interest of the ratepayers or of the necessity of an annual examination of the accounts of capitalistic organisations who were conducting the business of the public bodies.  But immediately a co-operative organisation was established by the public bodies themselves there is all this talk about protection for the ratepayer.  It is astonishing how anxious we are about the ratepayers when financial interests are affected.  There was no talk about the ratepayers' interest a few years ago when we had the Sun, Liverpool and Globe, and the London Insurance Companies, but immediately we try to do something for ourselves and stop the continuous flow of money out of this country for insurance, all sorts of objections are raised, and all kinds of obstructions are put in the way, while a vendetta is carried on by people who want to prevent us doing our own business.  The one great thing about this organisation is that the directors of the Irish company are elected by the <Col N="1076" /> policy holders and not by the shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other insurance companies, the directors are elected by the shareholders, but in this organisation the directors are elected by the policy holders.  The business in this company is, therefore, bound to be safe, and I think it is to the credit of the public men who are directors that they charge no fees for their services.  I think it is time we got away from the vendetta that has been carried on against every organisation established in this country when we try to do something for ourselves, and to prevent this continual flow of money to cross-channel organisations for insurance.  I wonder would Senator Jameson suggest that this House should pass a resolution suggesting that there should be an enquiry into the position of some financial insurance companies that spend seventy-five per cent. of their total income on management expenses. When they spend seventy-five per cent. of their total income on management expenses what becomes of the shareholders? Senator Sir. John Keane may shake his head but I know what I am talking about.  I will produce balance-sheets to prove what I am saying, and it would not be the first time that I did so.  Immediately after the setting up of the Provisional Government in this country I was one of a deputation that went to the late General Collins to ask him to take steps to prevent the wholesale robbery of the poor by these insurance companies. As a result of that interview some inquiries were made.  I could give the name of the gentleman who made the inquiries so that Senator Sir John Keane need not shake his head, as I know what I am talking about.  I congratulate the Minister on coming to this House with this Bill to remove any legal technicalities that exist.  There are always legal difficulties when people in this country try to do something for themselves.  I congratulate him on coming here to wipe out all the legal technicalities.  Personally I do not care much about legal technicalities. I am glad to see the representatives of the public bodies in this country going forward in this matter. <Col N="1077" /> They have made a success of the venture and I hope they will go on and that in a few years they will have done such good work for the ratepayers that they will not have to ask them for any premiums.</P>

      <P>Stripped of all verbiage the real question at issue is, what security have the ratepayers or the public bodies in this country for making good any damage done by fire?  I have great sympathy with the suggestion made by Senator Jameson, and I have still more sympathy with it after the speech to which we have just listened.  Senator Farren has just told us that they have been sold over and over again by various bodies.  I think it is the duty of the Seanad to see that the public bodies are not sold again.</P>

      <P>Can they not? They can be very easily sold if some public bodies suffer a loss of ten or twenty thousand pounds, and if the ten or twenty thousand pounds is not forthcoming to meet it.  That would sell them worse than anything else.  It seems to me that it would be a great comfort to our minds, representing as we do the interests of the country at large, if there was some kind of inquiry by the Government as to how this company is doing its business.  This company comes along and asks to be freed from an obligation that other companies are under.  That is the obligation to put up £20,000, which is there as a security for people who suffer losses.  If the company is to be freed from that liability, surely it ought to be put under some other obligation.  It seems to me that it would be only reasonable and fair, in the interests of the public bodies, to subject the business of the company to investigation by the Government every year to see that it is doing its work properly and that the moneys for which it makes itself responsible are likely to be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>I am fully convinced that some scheme for the nationalisation of insurance would be the best policy for this country.  Every Senator knows that there is a large amount of money going across the water for insurance that could be kept at home.  I think if the Government could see their way to nationalise insurance it would be the best policy. One thing that I do not like in this Bill is the retrospective legislation that it involves.  If the Act was wrong, or if there was some flaw in it, I think it should not be remedied by making this Bill retrospective.  I object to that policy very strongly.  I trust that the Government will see their way to nationalise insurance.  If they do they will be doing the best day's work imaginable for the State.</P>

      <P>This discussion is rather going beyond what is legitimate to the Second Reading at all.  All these suggestions about having audits and so forth are really points that should be raised in Committee, and do not affect the principle of the Bill at all.  I did not stop them, because when alluding to them I thought Senators were going to talk about the principle of the Bill, but I found as they went on that they were apparently in sympathy with the principle of the Bill, but were looking for safeguards in connection with audits and other things. These are all Committee matters. Therefore I think, unless the Senator is very anxious or that there is something he wants to correct, it is not necessary to pursue this line any further.</P>

      <P>The worst of it is that this company is labouring under very great disabilities at the moment.  Those people who are out against us are working for all they are worth, and we are powerless until we get this Bill through.  The questions properly and innocently asked by Senator Jameson will rather add to the propaganda. The propagandists seize on these points, and to-morrow circulars will be <Col N="1079" /> sent to the public bodies, as they were sent before, stating that questions were asked in the House and that the Minister and Senator Kenny were unable to answer them&mdash;that they were silent.  That is the sort of insidious propaganda we have been trying to meet.  There was an insidious propaganda for two months, ever since the Court case went against us.  Our hands were tied.  I would ask for the patience of the House for a few moments to answer the questions put by Senator Jameson.  With regard to Government control or Government inspection, our answer is that we are only too happy to have the Government inspect every figure in our books.  That is a thing that no other Irish or English company has had the pluck to do.  The Government is open to do so in our case tomorrow and to investigate every figure. We are under the same rule as other companies and supply annual returns to the Registrar.  For the payment of 1/- anyone can go to the Registrar's office and see every figure in the balance-sheet.  In our first nine months of existence we put up a reserve, as I have already said, a legitimate reserve. There is no camouflage about it.  Our administrative expenses are only thirty per cent., as against fifty per cent., sixty per cent., and seventy-five per cent. in other companies.  Further than that, we have paid all our initial expenses that are usually spread over a period of ten years, and out of the first nine months' trading we had a reserve of eleven hundred pounds to meet fire risks we have retained.  In addition, we succeeded in bringing down insurance premiums in this country outside of the public bodies, by reaction and sympathy, to the extent of twenty-five per cent.  We had not been registered one week when the tariff group dropped their insurance rates by twenty-five per cent.  Kill this company and you will have them up again in a very short time.</P>

      <P>Just one word which I think might have been said in reply to Senator Barrington.  Senator Barrington assumes that if you want to have a sound business in this institution, if you want to prevent all <Col N="1080" /> ills and cure everything that is wrong, all you have got to have is a Government audit.  I wonder is an audit by a Government representative any better than an audit by a reputable firm of chartered accountants.  Is it one bit better?  I think it is a fairly sound line to adopt in regard to these matters to get an institution like this going, to set it on its feet, get it working on sound business lines, put it in charge of a body of men who know their business, and let it work out its own destiny. The experience of most people is that in things like this the less Government interference there is the better, and&mdash;I suppose if we could accept Senator Barrington's hypothesis as correct&mdash;this country would labour under no ills at all and we would be very happy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House very much on this Bill but I confess that I am one of those old-fashioned people who believes that betting is still an evil and that it is an evil which, as a result of the working of this Bill, is to some extent comparable with the evil of intemperance.  Personally I do not believe that intemperance could be wisely cured by prohibition, and I am not going to vote against this Bill.  But I really think that there has been an increase of betting amongst people who cannot afford it as a result of the Bill of 1926.  I think an assurance was given in the Dáil that before another Bill to extend the Betting Act was placed before this House there would be some kind of an inquiry into the whole position of betting shops.  I am very strongly of the opinion that a competent inquiry should be held.  Everybody in this House desires to see drunkenness abolished.  One of the difficulties has been that over a long period certain vested interests arise which are extremely difficult to deal with.  If we do not immediately deal <Col N="1081" /> with vested interests growing up in betting shops as a result of the 1926 Act and place them under proper restriction, I think you will find it extremely difficult to do it in the future. I am not an extremist in this matter but on the whole I think it is far better&mdash;this view is not shared by many of my friends&mdash;to make betting legal than to have it carried on more or less under State supervision and call it illegal.  At the same time I think it is wrong to continue this Act for more than another year without proper investigation. What I want now is to ask the Minister if he can tell us what pledge was given in the Dáil in consist of members of the Dáil.  Personally I would prefer if certain outside experts representing both sides of the question were on the committee.  At least I think it should be a committee representing the Oireachtas.  I am not including myself as I am not in any sense an expert but I think there are some members of this House who would be extremely useful on the committee. I would prefer a committee which included one or two outsiders.  I am not opposing the Bill because of the assurance given, but as it stands I do not think it gives the safeguards that are necessary or respects the wishes of those who want to have betting carried on in a legalised form.  I would like to have a little more information from the Government.</P>

      <P>I feel compelled to take advantage of the last opportunity that will be afforded me to make one further protest against the passage of this Bill.  I oppose it because it is bad for the people as a whole and bad for the Seanad in particular.  The new method will not give the best Senators; it certainly will not give independent Senators.  It removes the incentive to the efficient, conscientious and industrious discharge of public duties.  Instead of working in the general interests and for the merit and appreciation of the general public, it will be to the interest of the Senators of the future to work merely for the purpose of winning the favour of ten Deputies or fellow-Senators.  That is not in the interests of efficiency.  It is not in the interests of the conscientious discharge <Col N="1083" /> of public duties; it is not calculated to give this House the power which will make it a desirable and effective Second Chamber.  It is, moreover, open to disreputable canvassing practices which have already begun.  On the last day we met Senators informed me that they had already been approached in the anterooms of this House and canvassed for their votes for the forthcoming election.  I have myself certainly had letters asking for my support, and I heard one man proclaim joyfully and victoriously that he had devoted a week of his holidays towards securing the necessary support to enable him to be elected to the Seanad for nine years to come.  He was able to come back to work confident in the knowledge that already he was as good as elected.  I think that is a most undesirable possibility to place within the reach of anybody who can get within speaking distance of Leinster House or who can approach sufficient Deputies and Senators outside it.</P>
      <P>It was alleged that the old method was a method that favoured people mainly in possession of money.  Well, it is a notorious fact that amongst the defeated were some of those who spent the most money, while amongst the elected were people who had little or no money at all to spend.  But the new system certainly gives overwhelming support to the man with the money bags.  The golden silence will be infinitely more effective than the silver oratory in the future.  The man who can contribute a substantial amount to Party funds will have an infinitely greater chance of being elected to this House to legislate for the people outside than the man who, with any other qualifications, is capable of fulfilling a public or legislative function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated that the people elected in 1922 by the Dáil have, on the whole, been a credit to themselves in the conduct of their business, and I am not going to say that they have not. I happened to be one of those elected. I also had the advantage of being elected at the one and only popular election.  But I would point out that there was a difference there as compared with what will obtain in the future. In the first place, there was not <Col N="1084" /> that mad rush for the Seanad in 1922 that there will be in 1928.  It was not then quite safe to be a Senator, as many Senators have reason to know, and the type of person who will approach Deputies and Senators in 1928 was very silent and kept very much in the background in 1922.  Moreover, those who were elected in 1922 by that method were convinced that they would, in 1928, or in whatever year their term of office expired, have to face the people as a whole, and they have worked with that belief in their minds.  But the people who will be elected at the forthcoming election will have no such incentive to discharge their duties in a conscientious way. All that they will have to do will be to please the ten people that are necessary to elect them to this House.  I do not know but that in certain circumstances the much-despised British method of creating hereditary peers, much as we abhor it, is not calculated to give a more independent House, and a more public-spirited House than we are going to have under the new system.  As I say, I abhor it and I think it absurd, but it certainly gives a more independent form of legislature than we will have when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>Already this Bill is being used by the enemies of this House as a document under which the House may be deprived of effective legislative powers, and it certainly will be used as a further argument for its final extinction. Those who vote for the Bill, whether they know it or not, whether they care or not, are helping towards the final elimination of this House as a part of the Legislature.  We are told that we will get under this system independent Senators, and that it is desirable, above all things, that they should be of an independent type, even though they may have certain Party affiliations. Whilst these statements are being made it is well known that a small group of people in this House who dared to act independently in regard to this Bill were called together last week and severely castigated by a junior Minister for having the great daring to vote against a Government measure.  If that is the case under conditions as they are, what, in the name of Providence, is <Col N="1085" /> going to be the state of dependence of this House when Senators owe their election and when they are dependent upon their re-election by members of the other House?  That is one indication of the sort of influence that is brought to bear on Senators who are ostensible supporters of the Government but who dare at times to show a little independence of spirit, particularly in a matter affecting the Constitution and affecting the whole future of this House.  We are very anxious to-day to see, when a Division is called on this measure, if there is going to be any turnover of votes.  I am convinced that there will not be, and I do hope that each of the Senators who received what was considered a well-merited lecture and castigation will show that they have not changed their opinion.</P>

      <P>I had not the privilege of being present when the Second Reading of this Bill was taken, and lest it may be thought that I have escaped a castigation under false pretences, or that I wittingly avoided it, I would like to say that I think this Bill is reactionary in its tendency and in its purpose.  I read very carefully the speeches that were made on that occasion, especially Senator O'Farrell's speech, and I cannot say for a moment that that deserved the epithet that it was hysterical.  I thought it was a fair, honest argument, and I was specially impressed by his statement of the countries in which the Second House is elected by popular vote.  I admit that the present method is somewhat cumbrous, but that is no reason for its complete abolition and a complete swing over to a method which I think contains most undesirable features.  In fact, in all the constitutional amendments, what I have objected to is the total swing-over.  There has been no attempt to examine the principle of the old method; there has been a total <Col N="1086" /> abolition, instead of examining the old principle on its merits and modifying it.</P>
      <P>As I conceive this Bill, you will not get an independent House.  It will be what I might call a prize for the good boy, the one who is amenable and tractable and who will not show any independence of spirit, who can be trusted to do what he is told.  I was impressed by the argument of Senator Jameson that in the last election certain outstanding individuals who were well known to this House failed to secure election, largely because they were personally reluctant to put forward their claims by advertisement, or whatever the way was, and partly because they were not generally known public figures.  But I was not impressed by his statement that nobody but a person supported by the ticketed vote or a person of wealth could secure election on a popular basis.  Senator O'Farrell has rather stolen my thunder in this matter.  I can see a man of wealth securing election under the new process far more easily and with far less trouble than under the old, though perhaps with a little more expense.  But it is because this new measure will make this House entirely tied and subordinate to the Dáil and will develop to the most dangerous and humiliating stage the principle of lobbying, and all the other features of that kind, that I shall vote against the final stage of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I was not present on the last occasion that this was under discussion, and I want first and foremost to try to remove the idea that Senator O'Farrell expressed on one of the occasions on which he spoke, that certain Senators were lined up with the Government and were backing up the Government with regard to this legislation. I wish to make it quite clear that I am not in any way under an obligation to the Government or to anyone else.  I always give my honest opinion on any matter that comes before the Seanad, and I am always prepared to do so.  When this question about changing first arose in connection with the election of nineteen Senators I thought that to follow the old arrangement would be rather cumbersome, in view of the strain of the last election. <Col N="1087" /> A Committee was appointed to decide what was the best method.  I thought that it would be a dangerous thing to make any change in the Constitution when it was working fairly satisfactory, that, in a sense, it was a wise precaution to let well enough alone, and that we should be very slow to make any change.  But when a change was to be made, my view was that, instead of the method now proposed the different counties should be grouped together to lessen the expense and the trouble that was attached to the old method.  This Committee was composed of representatives of both Houses and of different Parties, and when the Government decided upon the change that they recommended I came to the conclusion that I should abide by it.  It is not a very sensible or a very complimentary thing to be trying to make out to the people that the members of this Committee were poor types.  It is time enough to go into this matter when it has been tried. If it is a failure some other method can be tried.  When we had the President here on the last occasion he gave what was, to my mind, a very clear indication of what the Government decided to do, and that was to prevent power being used in an unfair manner, to the injury of the community at large.  One of the things I always believed in was &ldquo;How oft the means to do ill deeds makes ill deeds done.&rdquo;  I think the Government have come to a wise conclusion and that, in the circumstances, it is our duty to vote in favour of the measure.</P>

      <P>I had the honour of expressing my views on the Second Reading of this Bill, but unfortunately I was unable to be present at the recent consideration of it.  But I have not changed my opinion on the question of the principle of this Bill in the least degree.  I do not think that the Seanad would be acting in its own interests in passing this Bill.  I think that this Bill will weaken the influence of the Seanad, and I certainly think it will weaken its independence.  We have had examples of other Second Chambers where the members are appointed by the Government of the day, <Col N="1088" /> and that is what this Bill amounts to. That procedure has not been found to work satisfactorily, and I have heard many complaints of its working in practice.  Curiously enough, it may have the effect of considerably affecting the position of a Government.  When it turns into an Opposition, as may very often happen, instead of having a Seanad in which it can claim a majority it will be faced by a Seanad in which its opponents are in a majority.  That does not affect in the least degree my objection to this measure.  I think it will weaken the Seanad, and I think it is liable to affect the independence of the Seanad.  I believe in the old-fashioned democratic idea of trusting the people. I do not think it is wise to remove from the direct influence of the people one of the co-equal parts of this Parliament. If you abandon the elective principle you abandon your sheet anchor.  I agree with Senator O'Connor that the principle might have been modified.  In fact, I outlined on Second Reading a scheme under which it seemed to me that it might be preferable to deal with this question.  But I still think it is a great mistake for this House to agree to the abandonment of the electoral principle, no matter what may be put in instead, and I will vote against the Bill.</P>

      <P>The chief objection, I think, to the old method was that it asked each Senator to take upon himself one hundred and fifty-two times the work of an ordinary Dáil member.  He had to approach the whole country as his constituency, whereas Deputies have to approach only their own localities, where they are well known.  There is another serious objection too.  Looking at the last results, one sees that people who commanded organisations&mdash;I know the different kinds of organisations, but it would be invidious to mention them; I am not speaking of political organisations, but organisations of transport, and things of that sort&mdash;can get known by means of these organisations, and can be pretty sure of being returned.</P>

Then there is a third example, the case of men who, by public work, by patriotism, and by undertaking an immense burden of a reconstructive kind, are entitled to election, and one of the most outstanding men of that type, I suppose, in this country is Dr. Douglas Hyde.  He was unable to secure his return when the election was with the whole country as a constituency, and when you see that happening you know that it is all nonsense to say that the country has been obtaining what it wants.</P>

We have been told that the rich men will get in.  I have seen rich men who did not get in.  But if there was any exception it would be the expense of creating organisations such as are already in the country.  One cannot make a tour of the Twenty-six Counties, and one cannot be expected to, seeing that the House that has the least power has its work multiplied many times.  That is the only reason why I will vote for the Bill, because, as I say, I will be removed from the scene of action, and even Senator O'Farrell might think that I would be inclined to cast an independent vote.</P>

I certainly will vote against the Bill.  I think they could have made many changes.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend voting against this Bill, and I think I am entitled to give my reasons for doing so.  I do not take the view at all that many other Senators who have spoken take in this matter.  I think the Bill strikes rather more deeply than appears on the surface. To my mind the Parliament, consisting as it does of the Dáil and Seanad, was brought into existence for one purpose only, that is, to make laws for the people.  The people are most intimately concerned with the laws that are made by the Oireachtas.  They affect their daily lives and their means of existence.  Every law we make has some intimate relation to the people, and in that sense they should have at least a voice in the election of those to whom they delegate the power of making their laws.  Up to this point that has been the policy.  The people elect the Dáil.  In a lesser sense they elected the Seanad.  This also strikes at the independence, the character, and, if I might term it, the dignity of this House, and we should take these aspects of the question very seriously into account.  In time, under the proposed change, this House will inevitably, and must logically become, a replica of the Dáil.  The change will be gradual, but seeing that the voting power will rest with the Dáil, as they will have five-sevenths of it when we assemble jointly to decide the final issue as to who shall be members of this House, their predominance of voting power must in time make its impression on this assembly.  That is an unfortunate thing, and it strikes at the <Col N="1092" /> character of this House.  What was the intention of the Constitution?  Was it ever intended that this House should be a replica of the Dáil?  It was not.  By the nature of the election, by the nature of the qualifications of candidates for the Seanad, it was clearly intended that this House should be of an entirely different character from the Dáil.  The Dáil is largely elected on the political Party principle.  The Seanad was not elected on that basis.  When the Seanad was brought into existence it was elected with a view to giving representation to the dominating interests of the country and the principal aspects of the national life.  It was elected rather on a sectional basis, and it was intended to be a revisory body, that it should review legislation that was enacted in the Dáil, and that it should review that legislation from an entirely different standpoint to that of the Dáil, from the viewpoint, as it is described in Article 30 of the Constitution, &ldquo;of important aspects of the nation's life.&rdquo; Theoretically, the people are entitled to have the ultimate voice in the making of laws, seeing that they concern them so intimately, but they know that it is practically impossible for them to enact laws.  What they do to make the position practicable is to elect delegates, and they give them plenary powers to make laws for them, with certain reservations.  These reservations are contained in the Constitution. The Referendum was one, but that reservation was never invoked in the seven or eight years during which the Dáil has been in existence. I do not think that people paid very much attention to it, although much unpopular legislation was introduced in that time.  They have made this concession to their delegates, and they have invested them with that power.  We all know that Bills going through the ordeal of the two Houses have been submitted to the rigorous investigation that members of the Dáil have at their disposal, with a full library for reference, and they can put questions to Ministers and approach matters from every aspect. When a measure has gone through that ordeal in the Dáil it comes to this House, and this House has to approach <Col N="1093" /> consideration of it from an entirely different standpoint.</P>
      <P>That is the very foundation of our legislation here.  Senators, before they can be nominated, must have reached a certain age, and the electors who are eligible to vote for Senators must have reached the age of thirty years.  The Constitution provides that this House is to be differently constituted to the Dáil.  The first election to this House had particular reference to these very matters, to the sectional interests and the various dominating aspects of the national life.  It was with that in mind that the personnel of this House was constituted as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that be so, and if that was the intention of the Constitution we should see that any proposed change will not alter the character of that representation. Let us ask ourselves if the results of the last Seanad election afford sufficient reason for the radical change now proposed to be made.  What happened at that election?  It was stated that nobody who had not an organisation at his or her back could possibly succeed in that election. What are these organisations? Do they represent important aspects of the nation's life?  If they do, and if they are made active to return representatives to this House, what fault is to be found with that?  Was that not exactly in conformity with the original intention of the Constitution, and with the latter portion of Article 30?  I am not referring at the moment to the first portion of that Article, which states that Seanad Eireann shall be composed of citizens who shall be proposed on the grounds that they have done honour to the nation.  I do not think that we have yet reached that stage.  We are still in the state that we have only practically ceased from turmoil, and I do not think, until the country has settled down to stable conditions, possibly in the course of a few years more, that the first recommendation in the first paragraph of Article 30 will be given very great consideration. What the people do give consideration to at the moment is their own personal interests, and, after all, that is the factor that actuates us in most of the affairs of life.  Coming to elections, if there are large organisations <Col N="1094" /> active in the work which these organisations are supposed to carry out, the question is: do these organisations represent important aspects of the nation's life?  If they do, what fault is to be found with the system whereby the representatives of these organisations are being returned to this House?  That is absolutely in line with the Constitution and with the provisions of Article 30.</P>
    <P>Who were the representatives returned to this House at the last elections? We had men returned representing various interests.  Some were returned representing the professions, others farming, some others the cattle export trade, and others representing the teachers, education and the licensed trade.  Might I say in passing that the licensed trade is only a distributing trade.  It is not an industry, but it represents a very important industry indirectly.  In the ultimate argument it represents the farming industry of this country, and certainly it represents the distilling and brewing industry. Although it is of very vital importance, the licensed trade itself is only a distributing trade.  Representatives of Labour, of the Army, and of the Press, and of the manufacturing industries of the country were also returned. as well as representatives of the horse-breeding industry, which is a very important one in this country.  The people, exercising their horse sense and the peculiar intuition they have, no matter how clumsy their method may have been, returned to this House representatives of these various interests, and that is really the acid test of the system.  The members returned certainly represented prominent aspects of the nation's life.  That being so, are we not entitled to ask ourselves is the Government justified in altering that system and taking away that right from the people.  The people actually did what the Constitution pointed out to them they ought to do.  The people cannot go very far wrong in their elections. We ourselves are responsible for submitting the panel to the people, and presumably every person whose name appears on that panel that is submitted to the people is eligible to take a seat in this House.  So that the people act <Col N="1095" /> within certain limitations, and if they allow their intelligence to work, as it has been stated here, through the activities of organisations which are ranged up and down throughout the country, so long as these organisations represent great sectional interests in the community or important aspects of the nation's life, the thing is all right, and it is absolutely fair and sound. That will not be the case under the Bill that is now before us.</P>
    <P>The people are entitled to have the Parliament that they elect themselves. Nations, like individuals, will make mistakes, but if the people make mistakes they will learn from them, and eventually they will evolve and work out their own salvation, though possibly through turmoil.  As a result of mistakes which the people may unwittingly make, they will in time become educated, and eventually when more settled conditions obtain here, you will have an entirely representative Parliament derived from the people and based on the fundamental and sound principle that the Parliament represents the voice and will of the people.  We are here for the services of the people.  It is for the people to say who shall make their laws.  If, under this Bill, you take away from the people the right to elect one branch of the Parliament, because remember the Seanad is an integral part of the Parliament and that you cannot separate the Dáil and the Seanad, then you are doing something that is opposed to a fundamental right which the people should have.  Both Houses fulfil one and the same function, and that is to make laws for the country.  Therefore, it is only logical and right that the basis of representation in both Houses should rest on the same foundation. Under this Bill you are proposing to radically alter this basic foundation on which the Parliament now rests.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we are going to lose our independence under this proposal.  We are certainly going to lose caste throughout the country by this thing.  We do not hold, I think, a very prominent position in the goodwill or good estimation of the people, and we cannot afford to jeopardise such little reputation as we have.  But such <Col N="1096" /> attributes as we have&mdash;independence, character, and the dignity that we try to surround ourselves with&mdash;are going to be absolutely undermined and swept away under this Bill.  It may be said that I am taking up a rather illogical attitude by not backing up the Referendum and taking up this position on the larger question.  I always considered the Referendum to be a cumbersome and costly thing and not efficient for the purpose for which it was designed. Proof of that is to be found as to whether the people availed of it or not. Despite the fact that during the last few years we have had a good deal of unpopular legislation, the people have never invoked the Referendum, and I do not think that they were ever likely to do it.  The people never asked for it, and I do not think that they appreciated it.  For all these reasons I am very sorry that I will have to vote against the final stage of this Bill.</P>

      <P>As one who got elected by the people to this House, I want to say a few words, as I do not intend to give a silent vote upon this matter.  I hope that no one who got elected by the votes of the people will betray the trust reposed in him by voting in favour of this measure.  Two of the Senators who have already spoken were elected by the votes of the people, and elected in an honourable place too.  I think it would ill-become any man who was so elected to betray the confidence reposed in him in that way.  It has been said that without an organisation behind one, one could not get inside the precincts of this House. There were men who got high places at the last election who had no organisations behind them.  It was suggested, in fact, that the medical profession did not have an organisation in the country.  Surely, where there are medical men in such numbers as there are in this country and occupying positions of influence as they do, they certainly should have a very strong organisation behind them.  If they fill the dignified and honoured place that they should fill in the life of the country, then I take it that they should constitute one of the strongest organisations in the country, and that their sectional interests should be properly represented.  I <Col N="1097" /> say that it is a great injustice to outstanding men who represent sectional interests that this Bill should be introduced. It will afford one excuse to the enemies of this House when they get into power to say that its members are elected by a party or by a clique, if you like, and that it does not represent public opinion, that it does not even represent sectional interests of great masses of people in the country, that it represents nobody but three, four or five men who in this House claim the right to put forward members for this legislative body.  I should be surprised indeed that anyone who, so to speak, climbed in here on the shoulders of the people would betray the trust reposed in him by voting in favour of this Bill.</P>

      <P>At any rate, it was one of the recommendations of the Joint Committee.  If the Senator was elected to this House by a majority of one, I think he would resent any particular reference to that fact.  Senator Jameson put the case the last day when he asked the House to make up its mind as to what it wanted as regards a second chamber.  A second chamber elected by practically the same machinery as the Dáil is not, in my view, the best method of selecting a second chamber, even if one wanted the second chamber to be an exact replica of the Dáil.  Obviously there is likely to be a conflict between the two <Col N="1098" /> Houses.  Senator Cummins said it was mentioned on the last day that unless one had an organisation behind him that one could not get elected to this House.  He disputed the fact that it was necessary for one to have an organisation behind one in order to get elected.  The fact is that there were certain strong organisations behind certain of the candidates at the last election, and that only nine Senators got the quota, and that less than 25 per cent. of the electors voted.  The case that is really made for a continuance of the present system is a case in respect of particular organised sections of the community.  It is not a case for a good Seanad that is being made, but a case for organised sections of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear something more intelligent from the Senator than simply saying &ldquo;nonsense.&rdquo; Is it or is it not a fact that only nine Senators got the quota at the last Seanad election, and that those who were backed by organisations secured representation in the Seanad to a degree that was out of proportion even to the numbers in those organisations in the country.  The system is not a good one and could not be a good one where you have the whole country as a single constituency.  It may be that some people in Donegal never heard of some of the candidates that were up for election, and it may be that some people in Cork never heard of others of them.  The people were presented with a list of something like 70 or 80 candidates to choose from.  I submit that it is perfectly unreasonable to ask the people, merely from advertisements in the newspapers or from reports of the Seanad, or even from the organisations supporting the candidature of certain groups, to get into touch with forty or fifty names on the list.  In the event of the old system being continued this year, the list might have extended to 90 names.  I put it to the common sense of the Seanad that that is a perfectly unreasonable task to put before the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances we have to consider <Col N="1099" /> what is the best method of electing the Second House.  The Dáil and the Seanad sitting together is not the best method, but at least it is better than the existing one.  I would not pay the slightest attention to the fears of Senator Cummins that the continuance of this House is likely to be prejudiced in the future in the event of a change in the personnel of the Dáil by the fact that the election of the Seanad took place by the two Houses sitting together.  That is like a good deal of the nonsense that we hear not only here but in other places in regard to the Seanad.  It is not on the personnel of the Seanad, but on the work that the persons who constitute this House do that the Seanad in the future any more than in the past ought to be judged, and the sooner the people who criticise it consider that aspect of the situation the better it will be for all of us.  There is no use whatever in entering into a discussion of our public institutions with coloured spectacles.  That will get us nowhere.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats really struck the true note when he said that you want ability here.  I am not by any means inferring that there is no ability in the Dáil, but I say that you want ability here.  There are people who think that this House should be more forceful and should have a stronger policy than the Dáil. That is not my conception of what the Seanad should be, but rather that it should be a body which would review and act as a sort of jury upon the work of the Dáil.  I stated that at a meeting which was held in my Kilkenny constituency to consider and recommend to the people the persons they <Col N="1100" /> should vote for.  I was pressed to make a statement in regard to the list of persons that they should vote for, and I said that I regarded the Seanad as a jury that would consider the legislation sent up from the Dáil, but I do not consider it any part of my duty to select the jury.  That is for the people. It may be that much more interest will be taken in the next Seanad election than there was in the last one.  In my view, having the whole country as a single constituency is all against that. It would be impossible to do it, and perhaps not more than 30 per cent. of the people would vote, if so many did vote.  That is not democratic.  That is not getting the true opinion of the people.</P>
    <P>Senators who talk very loudly about the rights of democracy know that when the people want rights they assert their rights, and assert their privileges in that connection.  Obviously they were not satisfied with the Seanad election the last time, because otherwise a larger number would have voted.  It is not any credit to the institutions of the country that in an election for 19 members for the Seanad, only 23 per cent. of the people voted. Obviously that is a bad system.  If the system proposed now is not the best system, at any rate it gives three years in which to consider a better method of what is really required here.  We will not get that by these kind of cheap sneers.  You will get nowhere by simply saying &ldquo;nonsense.&rdquo;  It was nonsense to have an election in which only 23 per cent. of the people voted, and those who stand for that are not standing for democracy.</P>

      <P>Now that this Bill has been disposed of I might, without referring in any way to the merits of this Bill say a word or two with reference to what we have been informed by Senator O'Farrell is the persistent canvass being pursued, according to him, even in the lobbies of this House.  It is hardly necessary for me to say that if such a thing exists we must all greatly regret it, but at the same time it takes two parties to carry out a system of that kind.  It takes the canvasser and the members of the Seanad.  The members of the Seanad will have themselves to blame if they are in any way a party to it or lend themselves to it.  Speaking for myself, and, I am sure, the members of this House, I do not think that any self-respecting or independent citizen would either put or have his name put forward for election or re-election if the result is to depend on a system of canvassing of that kind.  Therefore I appeal to each member of the Seanad to put his foot down and resist any approach made to him for any purpose of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. GOGARTY Dr. GOGARTY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad congratulates Major Fitzmaurice and his German comrades on their success in flying the Atlantic Ocean for the first time from East to West in a heavier-than-air machine.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are no honours in this country for anybody who has conferred distinction on it except two.  The first is the freedom of the cities, and the freedom of the City of Dublin is a very great honour.  In the last fifty years it has been conferred only about twenty-six times.  The other is a far greater distinction and it rests with this House to confer it.  All of us remember with pleasure that we had the opportunity of conferring it on Senator Yeats when he showed honour to the country by winning the Nobel Prize.</P>
      <P>Major Fitzmaurice has thrown another wreath of fame on this country by flying the North Atlantic for the first time from East to West.  The two actions are very widely separated, but in their reactions on the country they are one and the same thing.  Comparisons may be odious, but in thirty-six hours it might be said that Major Fitzmaurice brought this country more prominently before the world than the six years during which it has been resented at Geneva.  Had he chosen British company his fame had been wider. Had he chosen another engine he might have been more beholden to a certain sporting nation, but he might not have reached his destination.  The honours in this country's gift are limited. Major Fitzmaurice cannot be made by our country a colleague of that coloured king, Sir Ofori Atta, or be given a seat in the House of Lords with Lord Terrington, or be given a title like Sir Alfred Mond, but he can be noticed by the Seanad, and it should be put on record that the Seanad of Ireland did for an Irishman what the Senate of France did for the two people who fell into the Atlantic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senate of France tendered their congratulations at an official reception last November in honour of an American airman and Miss Ruth Elder.  They did not cross the Atlantic; they fell into it.  That has nothing to say to us, <Col N="1103" /> but the fact is that Major Fitzmaurice did cross the Atlantic, and Ireland got a great deal of kudos out of it, that it cost us nothing.  Nobody came forward to help Major Fitzmaurice in his three years' determination to fly across the Atlantic except that good sportsman, Mr. J.D. Siddely, a member of a big English firm, who offered him three engines, but there was no one came forward with the £2,000 necessary to build an aeroplane.  This country is getting immeasurably more value, as I said before, than it got for £60,000 spent in the last six years in Geneva, though the two things are not comparable.  Major Fitzmaurice was trying to do this for three years.  He was determined to do it with every obstacle against him, and every opportunity that came in his way he availed of it.  It was very lucky for both parties that he got the chance of flying with a Junker aeroplane, because, in spite of all the rumours in other countries, Baron von Huenfield said that he never sat behind a finer pilot than Major Fitzmaurice, and, therefore, it confers a certain amount of distinction on the Seanad that it can honour such a man.  It would be a mutual honour if we put it on record that we congratulate Major Fitzmaurice, as we already had the honour of congratulating one of our own Senators. I am very pleased to bring this motion forward, and I trust it will get support.  I am not making any remarks about the narrow-mindedness that showed itself in one or two directions when this flight was a success, or for not encouraging Major Fitzmaurice. Major Fitzmaurice was the first airman who during the Great War made a night flight across the Channel.  He did good work.  As Senator O'Farrell remarked, there was in that unprecedented reception of him in Dublin one or two exceptions where it looked as if they were sore, and perhaps jealous or envious.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  The East to West flight across the North Atlantic was a courageous and memorable achievement, and it has won the rightful admiration of the people of two hemispheres.  Not the <Col N="1104" /> least important aspect of the performance is that in this victory there were no defeats except it be the elements. There are no widows and orphans created by the victory, and no mourning has to be worn as a result.  Major Fitzmaurice and his gallant colleagues have achieved more for their respective countries in this flight than anything that they could have accomplished by carnage on the dripping battle field. They have made a notable contribution to scientific endeavour and scientific achievement.  They had no guarantee of material gain if they succeeded, while they had the certainty of a watery grave or a lingering death on the icy wastes if they had failed.  There was no half-way.  Men who set out voluntarily on a hazardous mission such as this are dauntless men and they deserve the congratulation and admiration of the people.  It is a pity more encouragement is not given to daring pilots, such as Major Fitzmaurice, either by the Government or public-spirited citizens with money, as is the case in other countries.  If Major Fitzmaurice depended on any encouragement he received here for any flight he might make he would never have crossed the Atlantic by air.  I hope the great possibilities of the position will be in the near future carefully examined and exploited in a statesmanlike way.  Perhaps, too, if there was a proper assessment of values Major Fitzmaurice would not be confined to marks of appreciation such as cheers and flowers, and even one step up in promotion in the Army.  He has done something which has given the small Free State Army a more international status, and one would hope that some more tangible recognition would have followed his great performance than has been the case.</P>

      <P>I wish to associate myself with Senator Gogarty's motion congratulating Major Fitzmaurice. His performance in flying the Atlantic from East to West is unprecedented. He has shown himself by his courage, nerve and endurance to be a very great Irishman.  Major Fitzmaurice served during the Great War in my part of the service.  I have always had a great regard for the officers who <Col N="1105" /> served in my regiment, and for that reason it gives me the more pleasure to congratulate Major Fitzmaurice on his performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> Motion put and declared carried unanimously.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.45 p.m. until Tuesday, 24th July, at 3 o'clock.</P>
