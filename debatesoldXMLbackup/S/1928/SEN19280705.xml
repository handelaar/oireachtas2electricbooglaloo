      <P>When the debate on the Second Reading of this Bill was adjourned I was dealing with objections made by some Senators as regards the intervention of the State in matters of this sort.  I think all countries have found it necessary at some time or another to intervene with regard to the control of timber.  It is a sort of natural right that a Government has to do that, because the State has an asset and an interest in timber growth and in the afforestation of the country.  That is because it has so many national phases. The country is affected very largely by the timber industry and its distribution. Timber growing has certain effects on the climate, on the temperature, and on the rainfall of a country, and consequently it affects the soil.  It means greater productivity and earlier harvests.  Therefore, a Government has a sort of natural right to intervene at some time or other in the control of timber production and in its preservation. In large areas of Canada, America and Australia, where one would think that the supply of timber was unlimited and everlasting, the Governments of these countries have found it necessary to intervene at some time because of the indiscriminate thinning out and destruction of timber.  The most valuable kinds of timber in America and Australia were being destroyed through this indiscriminate thinning out.  This modern destruction of timber <Col N="876" /> that went on destroyed all the male trees, and large areas of the forests in these countries, extending over many square miles, ceased to be self-planting. No new saplings came out, and the result was that the supply of timber in these countries was being threatened.</P>
      <P>These, of course, are aspects of the case that do not trouble us here.  Apart from the national aspects I have mentioned, there is another aspect of this which intimately concerns us, and that is the beautifying of the landscape and the preservation of the scenery of the country.  Large tracts of landscape which are not dotted over with trees grate on the eye from the point of view of a sense of beauty.  That is not the sort of picture that tourists would expect to see in a garden country like Ireland.  That is a very important aspect of the question from the national point of view.  As to the commercial side of it, we should see that we produce sufficient timber to supply at least our own needs.  The matter of compensation was mentioned.  I can visualise, as other members of the House have done, that some instances may arise in which there may be a conflict of interest between the State and the owner of certain belts of timber. That timber may have been planted for some time, but the land may now be required for a certain purpose, and the owner perhaps may propose to clear away the timber in order to have the use of the ground for some other purpose. The State may intervene and find that that particular belt of timber serves other purposes from a purely State point of view, and in a cold-blooded manner may issue a prohibition order against the cutting down of the timber. The owner, seeing that this belt of timber was an asset that he himself had created, may have an equitable claim as between the State and himself.  I think that in such a case there should be the right of appeal, so that the whole equities of the case can be gone into in a court of law and right done to both parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan) Patrick J. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was changed considerably in the Dáil.  As some Senators pointed out, when the <Col N="877" /> Bill went originally to the Dáil there were certain provisions in it which aimed at preventing anyone from cutting a tree without a licence.  That was the principle of the Bill.  As the Bill has come to the Seanad there is a complete change in it.  Under the Bill as it is now, people can cut trees freely unless they are prohibited.  That is a distinction and, in my opinion, a considerable difference.  It was held in the Dáil that it was necessary to take some steps to prevent the wholesale cutting of trees.  That is generally agreed.  In fact, it was agreed by practically everyone here.  It was equally felt that if it was necessary to get a licence before anyone could cut a tree that inevitably delays would occur, and that the Forestry Branch of the Department of Agriculture would have a great many applications to deal with.  They would have to deal with a considerable amount of correspondence, and considerable delays would occur before a licence could be issued in each case.</P>
      <P>It was also felt that it would be out of perspective to expect the Forestry Branch to give a licence for the cutting of one ash tree or a hedge.  The principal objection to the Bill, as it stood originally, was that it was necessary for the Department to give a licence in each case before a tree could be cut.  Considerable delays would ensue because of that, apart from any other considerations, such considerations for instance, as the question of refusing a licence, and for that reason we changed the Bill.  I draw Senators attention to that point, because I think many of them said that this Bill would lead to considerable delay, and that considerable confusion would be caused to people who were endeavouring to carry out a quite legitimate commercial enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gathered from what Senator Bagwell and Senator Sir John Keane said that they expected that there would be considerable correspondence between the Department and every applicant who made application for leave to cut a tree.  That is not so, because the scheme of the Bill is this: Before trees are cut a felling notice, in common form, must be served on the sergeant in charge of the nearest Civic Guard barracks, and unless the Department <Col N="878" /> issue a prohibition order the tree can be cut after the lapse of 21 days.  In 95 cases out of 100 what would happen is, that a felling notice in the ordinary way would be served on the sergeant in the nearest Civic Guard barracks. Nothing would occur, and at the end of the 21 days the owner would cut the tree.  So far as the commercial felling of timber is concerned, if that programme is carried out it will, I think, be found to be quite satisfactory because no one purchases a wood to-day and proceeds to fell the timber tomorrow. Senators who have experience of the timber trade know that negotiations between the owner of a wood and a prospective purchaser go on for some considerable time.  It rarely happens that the purchaser of a wood proceeds to cut it for at least one, two or three months later.  Therefore, as regards these ordinary commercial transactions, there is going to be no delay as regards correspondence.</P>
    <P>There will only be correspondence in the event of the Department deciding either to prohibit the cutting of the wood or to make further inquiries.  It might be that when an application reached the sergeant of the nearest Civic Guard barracks that it would go from him to the Forestry Branch of the Department, and that the Forestry Branch might decide that certain inquiries should be made in such a case.  There might not be sufficient time to make inquiries within the 21 days, and for that reason the procedure to be followed would be as follows: A prohibition order would be served.  That would stop the cutting of the trees.  It would give time to have inquiries made. Inquiries are then made by the Forestry Branch, and if they decide that there is no good ground for preventing the felling of the wood a licence would be issued to cut it.  Senators will notice that there are four terms used in the Bill.  They are: prohibition order, felling notice, licence, and permit.  It may be asked what is the purpose of this licence, and what is the purpose of a permit, in view of the fact that an applicant may cut a tree if nothing is done for 21 days.  If the Forestry Branch fail to take steps for 21 days, the applicant may go ahead and cut the <Col N="879" /> tree without any further correspondence. As regards the licence, it comes in in this way.  It applies in the sort of case that I have mentioned: in a case where the Forestry Branch might come to the conclusion that further inquiry should be made, and in order to give itself time to make inquiries it might serve a prohibition order.  In the event of the Forestry Branch deciding that there was no good ground for prohibiting the cutting of trees they would issue a licence to cut.</P>
    <P>A permit is for the convenience of people planting trees, people who are carrying out forestry operations on their own.  They may not care to serve this felling notice and they want to have a free hand.  They would have to apply for a permit to carry out any operation that would be necessary in the course of good forestry.  That is the explanation of these notices.  It is apparently conceded that there must be some limit to the wanton destruction of trees in the country.  Not a single Senator failed to make that point.  Even Senator Bagwell and Senator Sir John Keane made it.  There must be some limit to the wanton destruction of trees.  We have attempted to deal with that. There must be some limit put to it.  The only way that I know it can be done is by giving someone the power to prohibit the wanton destruction of trees. I know that there are objections to giving the power to anyone, but people cannot have it both ways.  I do not profess to have any special knowledge on this question, but in any event the problem is admittedly there.  Everyone talks about it.</P>
    <P>In this country apparently everyone, if you are to judge by their statements, takes a great interest in forestry.  From all classes of people you hear the same story.  They all ask what is the Government going to do about this wanton destruction of trees?  Might I point out that there is only one per cent. of the country under woods, compared to 15 or 20 per cent. in countries like Denmark, not to speak at all of countries like Sweden and Switzerland, where the conditions are quite different. Comparing this country with Denmark, where they have about 20 per cent. of the country under woodlands, <Col N="880" /> we have only one per cent., and that one per cent. is rapidly disappearing. There is practically no planting done, except what is done by the Forestry Branch of the Department of Agriculture. Their planting amounts to 4,000 or 5,000 acres per annum.  The problem is there, as I have said, and we have attempted to deal with it here in a simple way by giving power to someone to prohibit the cutting of trees. Everyone admits that the problem is there, and they all say that something should be done, but they all baulk at the implications of such a provision as that in the Bill.  You must give power to someone if you want to prohibit the cutting of trees.  I could quite understand the position of a person who would say, &ldquo;Well, the trees are being cut by their owners, who have a perfect right to cut them.  We agree that, from the national point of view, it is bad business to do that, and it is especially bad in a country like this, where there is no attempt to re-plant.  We are going to take the risk; we are not going to give such a power, which might be abused, to any Department of State.&rdquo;  That, I admit, was not the position taken up by Senator Bagwell. He made a long, a very well-informed and able speech on this question, but when he came to the alternative, what was it?  Education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. BAGWELL Mr. BAGWELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out to the Minister that I did not proceed with my alternative, because it was pointed out to me that I ought to deal with the Bill itself.  That is the reason I did not outline some other method for dealing with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to the Senator might I say that I was going on to say that at one period it was pointed out that it would hardly be in order to indicate his alternative.  The Senator did indicate as an alternative educative and facilitative methods. That is not a correct alternative.  I do not care how long the Senator gets to develop that question he must know that education will take 30, 40 or 50 years to effect its purpose.  You cannot create many changes in the point of view of the people except over a very long period of time.  Circumstances change. While we can all agree that education <Col N="881" /> is the ideal way to bring about reforms, everyone agrees that if you can get reforms by education and by continually changing the point of view of the people, then you are likely to have a real reform that is going to last. Meanwhile, while we are bringing about this change in the point of view of the people over a period of 30, 40 or 50 years will not the country be absolutely denuded of trees?  Anyone facing up to the thing in a concrete way must realise that in addition to education you must have something else.  You must have a certain amount of State interference.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane prefaced his speech by a remark that he has made on every Bill that I ever introduced into this House.  He said that he was an unrepentant free trader and a believer in the liberties of the subject, and that he had still a pathetic belief in the doctrine of laissez faire.  That really means nothing in the year 1928.  The fact of the matter is that Senator Sir John Keane is not a believer in the doctrine of laissez faire in its crude form, and no one at this hour of the day in 1928 is.  People 30, 40 or 50 years ago, when that doctrine was enunciated in a very clear and taking way, and when people had no experience of its working out in practice, could only consider it in an abstract sort of way.  People were very much intrigued by that particular doctrine, and a big school of thought grew up in England and France and in other countries around that doctrine, but there is no such person who believes in the liberty of the subject now.  Even Senator Sir John Keane does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator was a member of a Commission that sat.  I think, in the year 1922 to deal with certain agricultural problems.  In the Report of that Commission he advocated the most outlandish restrictions to be imposed on the unfortunate farmers of the country.  He signed that Report.  He advocated the most repressive measures in connection with the Dairy Produce Act, the Eggs Act and the breeding of livestock.  In fact he made himself the special champion of these repressive measures on that particular Committee.  Of course, he changed his mind a little bit later when these measures came before the Seanad.  I <Col N="882" /> think he welcomed the Eggs Act enthusiastically but he reverted to his first love and became an unrepentant believer in the doctrine of laissez faire when we reached the Dairy Produce Act, which he recommended himself. The Senator ought to realise that he must make some attempts to be consistent, especially a Senator like him who made it his special business to push through these three Acts, the Dairy Produce Act, the Eggs Act and the Act dealing with the licensing of bulls.  Now he described himself as a believer in the liberty of the subject.  He is a believer in the liberty of the subject to do anything he likes with his own.  He ought to attempt to be more consistent about it.</P>
    <P>The Senator's point of view apparently is that when you are dealing with produce and goods exported from the country you are entitled to take repressive measures to make the producer produce just exactly what is wanted in the export market, but that when you are dealing with produce that is not exported from the country you are not entitled to take any such measures.  Whatever is to be said for that particular distinction, at least it can be said about it that it is not scientific.  I am afraid that some of Senator Sir John Keane's economic ancestors who started this doctrine of laissez faire would turn in their graves if they heard him make such suggestions as he made here at this hour of the day.  I think we might now come back to the Bill.  The Bill could be abused by the Minister for Agriculture and by the Forestry Branch of the Department and made exceedingly repressive if it were unintelligently administered. I admit that.  But I know no way whatever of stopping the wanton cutting of trees, once you admit that people will cut trees wantonly, except by giving power to someone to prohibit them from doing it. You have got to face up to that.  I am not particularly interested one way or the other as regards this Bill.  I left it to the Dáil.  It is one of the few Bills that I put before the Dáil to do what they liked with it.  I said that I would listen to what arguments were put forward for or against it, and that we would try to shape the Bill in accordance <Col N="883" /> with the wishes of the Dáil. I said to the Dáil that I assumed this was not a political issue, and I asked them to make the best of it.  The position is that Senators have got to say either that people should be perfectly free to cut their trees or that they should be prevented from doing so under certain conditions.  I want the Seanad to say one thing or another, and not take refuge under something that amounts to nothing such as the education and facilitating of the people.  This is not a Bill to arrange for a big forestry programme.  We do not want any legislation for that.  All we want is money.  If the Dáil voted me a million pounds I could spend it on forestry.  The Dáil has a perfect right to do that, and the Forestry Branch has powers for spending money.  It could spend more money in providing a bigger area under State forests.  It is all a question of money.  Section 3, I think, is one of the most valuable sections in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators must remember that the Forestry Branch has power to acquire lands compulsorily for forestry purposes. It has that power under the Act of 1919, and application had to be made to the Development Commissioners. These Commissioners are no longer in existence, and the application has now to be made to the Land Commission with an appeal to the Judicial Commissioner.  Moreover, Section 6 is a very important one.  It provides that the Forestry Branch may acquire land compulsorily even where the owner is unknown, and it provides machinery for wiping out the easements that may exist on the land.  Senators may consider that there never is a case where the owner of land is unknown and where the easements are indefinite.  In point of fact, the Forestry Department often have such cases.  That Department is often dealing with mountain land.  There are big areas of it at present suitable for forestry, but it is difficult to say who are the owners, and still more difficult to say what ancient rights of grazing or easements existed over these lands.  At the same time the Forestry Branch cannot take the risk of purchasing lands and then find when the lands were planted that they were <Col N="884" /> open to an action by somebody who had never exercised his rights, and whose rights were of no value and getting an injunction against the Department. This section provides that easements may be bought and that any rights attaching to the land will attach to the purchase money.  That is an important section.  I agree with Senator Bagwell that Section 7 has been weakened considerably by paragraph (e).  It leaves the right to anybody to cut trees on his own land for firewood, and prevents the Forestry Branch, even if they wish to do it, from interfering in such cases.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that a felling notice must be served in every case, and that notice may be acted on if there is no prohibition within twentyone days.  Section 7 sets out there can be no prohibition in certain cases, that though the felling notice must be served the Forestry Branch cannot prohibit under certain exemptions, and one of the cases is mentioned in paragraph (e) which deals with the cutting of trees for the purpose of domestic fuel.  It would be possible perhaps to limit that to some extent.  The point of view in the Dáil was that people should have the right to cut trees for the purpose of firewood.  I think it should be limited still further, and that the same sort of limitation should be inserted there such as you have in paragraph (d).  I think a limitation should be put in the section so that no tree required as an ornament or as shelter could be cut as firewood, and that would go to meet the objection Senator Bagwell enunciated against Section 7.  I cannot agree with Senator the Marquis of Lansdowne, that you can draw a distinction between clumps of trees and large woods.  You cannot draw this distinction in an Act of Parliament.  I was pressed from another angle to do it in the Land Act of 1923.  It was proposed that there should be compulsory powers as regards the landlords, but that there should be no such powers in regard to the class called tenants.  I indicated that you could not make a distinction between persons.  It must be based upon other grounds such as tenures.</P>
    <P>I do not see that there is any case for making a distinction between a <Col N="885" /> large and a small wood.  I think it is illogical on the part of those who object to the Bill as being a rather oppressive measure to state at the same time that they consider Section 7, which deals with these small woods on farmers' lands, should be strengthened.  I think that is illogical.  I think you must apply the same rules to the big as to the small woods, to the landlord who has very large woods on his estate and to the tenant who has only small clumps of trees.  I would ask the Seanad not to make distinction.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by several Senators that there should be some appeal from the Minister in this matter.  I regard that as absolutely unsound.  I do not see how any judge of the High Courts could try a question as to whether a wood should be cut or not.  It is purely an administrative matter.  Why should a judge who is there to interpret the law be asked to go into a forestry matter that requires technical knowledge of forestry and not a knowledge of law?  A Judicial Commissioner was mentioned, but he is a High Court Judge.  He may be a Judicial Commissioner one day and presiding at the High Court next day or sitting in Green Street.  I do not see how any such judge could on appeal try a question as to whether a wood should be cut or not.  What law has he to go on?  What facts has he to take into account in a judicial way?  I think it is a false function for a judge, and it is making him an administrative officer, making him really the head of the Forestry Branch of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The considerations such a judge would have to take into account are considerations which are not judicial and ones which a judge should not be asked to consider.  I think from the point of view of putting the judiciary to the administration of the Act that such a provision would be entirely wrong. Personally, if such a provision were inserted, I do not think the Bill would be a very valuable one, and I would prefer to do without the Bill if it was inserted.  It is unsound from the point of view of the Department and the judiciary.  The best security the owner of property has is <Col N="886" /> the presence of the Dáil and the Seanad, which are always there to take up their case and discuss it with full knowledge.  With such a right there, it would be extremely difficult for any Minister to administer the Act in a foolish or unduly strict way.  Even if this Act were passed, I agree with Senator Bagwell that it will be quite impossible for the Department to stop the cutting of trees to any great extent. He was right when he said that the provisions of the Land Act were practically a dead letter.  Are we to throw up our hands and say, &ldquo;This Bill would be useful if we could deal with a few cases&rdquo;?  Everyone will agree it is not right for a man to buy woods in Wicklow, in a well-known beauty spot, cut them down wantonly and then clear out.  That is the sort of case that can be dealt with.  We may deal successfully with such a case under this Bill. You cannot administer strictly.  If you did you would have to flood the country with inspectors.  A felling notice has to be served on the Civic Guards when it is intended to cut down trees. The Civic Guards have a fair idea of what is going on in a district, and the sergeant knows if any notice has been served in regard to a wood.  He will be able to deal with the cases, and possibly bring back a certain amount of fear of the law and a certain amount of co-operation for one reason or another between the owners of the woods and the Department.  It is possible, in view of that provision, that we may be able to administer this prohibition of this measure more successfully than the Land Commission were able to administer similar provisions in the Act of 1909.  I would like to have plenty of time to consider this Bill.  If the Bill gets a Second Reading I do not object to it being postponed until the autumn.  There is no immediate necessity for the Bill, but as far as I am concerned, if Senators think they ought to have a good look at the Bill and would like to study its details, I would be willing to postpone it to the autumn, but I would like to get a Second Reading this session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WalterNugentBart" hpid="Sir WALTER NUGENT Sir WALTER NUGENT">
      <NameTxt>Sir WALTER NUGENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill.  I think it is a good and very necessary Bill, and I hope it will not <Col N="887" /> be postponed.  I think every Senator is agreed that things are not as well as they should be, and if something is not done the whole country will soon be deforested.  I do not think any Senator said he would vote against the Second Reading.  Even Senator Bagwell, although he did not approve of the Bill, as far as I can understand. suggested the Minister should withdraw the Bill and introduce another. I have read the Bill very carefully, and it appears to me that an effort has been made in the interests of all the people concerned.  I cannot see how anybody with large plantations will be placed at a disadvantage by anything in the Bill. I think the position was ably stated by the Senator who moved the Second Reading.  In parts of the country the conditions as regards forestry are dreadful.  Portions of land have been bought by people who are only interested in the timber on it.  The forests have been cut down and the land turned into an absolutely wild state.  Every day that passes by the cost of replanting that area will be greater.  We all know that in lands purchased by the Land Commission in many cases woods are retained by the former owners, whereas the lands surrounding are divided among different owners, and we know what happens in these cases.  One by one the trees disappear. I quite agree that the present Bill will not prevent these acts of vandalism being committed, but it makes their committal much more difficult.  If notice has to be sent in before cutting a tree a person will hesitate before he cuts it, and the result will be that it will be easier to protect forests and acts of vandalism will be fewer.  This Bill has been fully debated, and I sincerely hope it will get a Second Reading. Every interest is more or less protected by the Bill, and I am sure that by amendment this Bill could be made as good as one could desire.</P>

      <P>As one of the few Senators directly connected with saw-milling and the import of timber into the country, as well as dealing with native timber, I should like to make a few remarks on this important measure. The Bill will be generally welcomed <Col N="888" /> by the trade itself and also by the entire country.  As the Minister has said, this country is very largely denuded of its trees, and on less than one per cent. of its area is timber grown.  I must protest against the expressions that have been used in this House and in the Dáil, and by the public, to the effect that members of the trade are wholly unconcerned with the results of wholesale tree-cutting, and they have been criticised with wantonly destroying the woods.  The Minister himself used the expression, &ldquo;This wanton cutting down of trees and woods.&rdquo;  I need not remind the House that they were largely cut down for a very specific and desirable purpose. There is a gentleman sitting beside the Minister who knows all about it.  I remember meeting him on many occasions. The timber was used up on a most important and memorable occasion.</P>

I wish that some of the suggestions that emanated from members of the Dáil would be borne in mind by the Minister, that is, that there should be a remission of taxation for farmers and landlords who plant their lands with wood.  Another matter to which I wish to refer is the question of orchards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir NUGENT EVERARD</NameTxt>
      <P>There are <Col N="889" /> one or two points to which I want to draw the Minister's attention, and which I think this Bill does not sufficiently elucidate.  Taking our stand on the Hill of Tara we can see what a beautiful wooded country there is surrounding. There are few demesnes and the scenic effects of the view are mainly due to the hedgerow timber.  I find in leases of about 150 years old where it was obligatory on the tenant farmer to plant hedgerows at so many perches distant, and if the tenant cut down he was liable to a fine of £5 for each tree he cut down.  It was the landlord's property.  It seemed rather drastic and tyrannical that the landlord could cut a tree down but if the tenant did it he would have to pay a fine of £5.  The effect of that has been, as you see, to beautify the country.  Only in exceptional instances did the landlord clear all the trees off the property he was about to sell, but I have known cases in which it was done.  I welcome this Bill as putting a stop to certain proceedings. There is a use for hedgerow timber that perhaps is not much appreciated by the Minister, and that is that it is a source of fuel supply.  Those of us who have visited Brittany, which is a beautifully wooded country, know that this hedgerow timber is used to supplement the fuel supply.  The trees are, I believe, the property of the district, and they are controlled by the district.  They can be pollarded every eight or nine years, and I am told it is very important as a supply of fuel to the poor people who live there, and, as Senators are aware, the greater part of the country is in the hands of peasant farmers.  It is not every tree that it is suitable to pollard.  There are some trees that spread their roots fifty or sixty yards along the ground and interfere with tillage.  There are other trees that do not, and they can be substituted for these pernicious trees when permission is given to cut them.  I have examined the Bill carefully, and I cannot help feeling that there is a restriction on the owner of property in the management of his woods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand that where an estate is about to be disposed of, and the owner does not care what becomes of it, there might be a malicious clearing on that estate of all timber, and that <Col N="890" /> should be stopped.  There are cases in which for other reasons a landowner may desire to cut down trees.  There are two reasons which are considered valid. One is clearing a wood for the purpose of re-planting, and the other is if it is in accordance with the general practice of good forestry.  There is a third reason, and that is where trees were put up as a screen when they were first planted, which might be 100 or 150 years ago, in order to hide an ugly object.  That object might not be ugly now, and it might be screened by other trees, and it would be an advantage from the point of view of scenic effect to cut that plantation.  What I suggest is that the owner should be given more or less control of the cutting of trees on his estate for reasons with which he alone is concerned.  The Bishop of Meath put up a Palace within view of the windows of a forbear of mine who did not like the look of it&mdash;this was about 1780.  A landscape gardener said: &ldquo;The Bishop is building an ugly lump of a structure and plant it out.&rdquo;  He did plant it out.  The Bishop's trees have hid the structure, and I should like to cut the plantation behind it and without any intention of re-planting, but I am debarred from doing so by this Bill.  I think that by a slight alteration of Section 9 that could be secured.</P>

This is one of the most important Bills that we have had for some time, and it certainly is not being treated with that consideration accorded to Bills far less important.

We are now asked to take up the Committee Stage, which means that we have been given only the forenoon of to-day for the consideration and drafting of amendments.  We had first on the Second Reading to discuss the matter and to sound the views of Ministers, as to what their attitude would be in regard to amendments, before they are put down, and I think it is quite improper to rush this now.  There is no necessity for rushing it.

      <P>This is an entirely new point that has been raised&mdash; the matter of postponing it from to-day until to-morrow, as opposed to postponing it from to-day until next week.  The grounds for Senator O'Farrell's objection to taking it to-day are that there has not been sufficient time to put down amendments, and that there is not sufficient time to consider amendments that have been put down. As regards the first point, I do not know what amendments will come forward, and I cannot speak on that.  In regard to the second point, I suggest that it is almost an insult to the intelligence of the House to say that, having read the amendment that is down, it cannot make up its mind on that amendment. The change proposed is a very slight one.  It is one that can be very easily understood, and one in connection with which arguments can be found immediately for or against.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment standing in the name of Senator Douglas:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 5, sub-section (2).  To delete the sub-section and to substitute therefor a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" />&ldquo;(2)  Every buyer of gas after the expiration of nine years shall have the right to demand of the undertaker that the meter by means of which such gas is measured shall be restamped according to law; and no such meter shall continue to be duly stamped according to law after the expiration of ten years from the last occasion on which it was duly stamped.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 5 provides for the compulsory reverification and restamping of every gas meter once every ten years.  That means a very considerable amount of expense to the ordinary small country gas company, and the worst of it is that in a great many cases it is quite a useless expense. I know that the Minister has received opinions very different from the opinions held in England.  The Minister has been advised that it is necessary that this should be done every ten years, that meters go wrong, and that this is quite a necessary provision for the protection of the gas consumer. The Board of Trade in England, after investigating the matter, arrived at the opposite view.  The amendment proposes to delete the sub-section, and to substitute for it a sub-section making the reverification and restamping of meters compulsory if the gas consumer requires it, and it gives him power to require it at the end of nine years.  I would respectfully submit that that gives complete protection to the gas consumer, and I would like to call attention to an amendment which the Minister is about to propose and which I have no doubt the House will accept&mdash;Amendment No. 4 on the paper.  Under that any consumer of gas can apply, any time he wishes, to have his meter inspected and verified. He will do that at his own risk, because if the meter turns out to be incorrect the gas company will pay for the verification, but if the meter turns out to be right the consumer must pay the cost.  There you have a complete protection for the gas consumer all along the line.  If you take these two amendments together he is protected during the nine or the ten years by the Minister's amendment, and he would be protected at the end of the ten years' period by the amendment I am <Col N="898" /> moving, because he can get his meter reverified at the expense of the company whether it needs it or not, and when I say at the expense of the company I mean that it will really not be at the expense of the company, because the cost&mdash;I would submit, the unnecessary cost&mdash;of the reverification of the meters will not be paid by the gas company, but will be paid in the end by the gas consumer, because the price of gas will be put up on account of this expense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator's view of the amendment drafted by Senator Douglas is different from what I have been advised that it does mean.  I gathered that&mdash;I may be wrong in my interpretation&mdash;what Senator Brown stated was this: that if Senator Douglas's amendment and my Amendment No. 4 were passed together there would be complete protection, because I think the Senator went on to say that under Senator Douglas's amendment all meters must be stamped every ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>

      <P>Then I hold that this would not give sufficient protection to the public, and I want my own amendment to be taken in substitution of the amendment moved by Senator Brown.  I presume that we can discuss this amendment and Amendment 4 together, because I think they cover the same ground.  The difference between them is this: Senator Douglas's amendment means that the consumer has a right to demand a test.  If the test shows that the meter is correct the consumer has to pay the cost; if the test shows that the meter is wrong the gas company pays.  After that Senator <Col N="899" /> Douglas's amendment goes on to say that only those meters as have been questioned shall continue in use for a ten years' period from the last occasion when they were stamped.  This was a Bill that was discussed in the Dáil almost entirely in a non-party spirit, and a big majority of the Dáil was definitely of the view that every meter, no matter whether questioned or not, should be tested every ten years, and they were specially alive to the situation that is created by the amendment put down in Senator Douglas's name, which would leave this gap as we have in the Bill&mdash;namely, that unless a person was sufficiently active in his own interests and was willing to run the risk of demanding a test, which might entail certain expense on himself if the test proved that the meter was right, that meters might go on being wrong for generations and would not be subject to re-verification at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil did want to have this system adopted: that everywhere a consumer has a right to demand that at any time, either in the areas in which the 1859 Act is in operation or the areas in which it is not at present in operation, the meter be tested, and if the test is carried out and the meter is correct the consumer pays, otherwise the gas company pays.  But whether there is a demand or not, after every ten years' period meters must be tested and verified.  It has been alleged that this will put a considerable burden of expense on the companies, but we have certain figures&mdash;I quoted them at great length in the other House, and I can quote them again if they seem relevant to the argument&mdash;and we have in fact discovered that it is the practice of the best gas companies to test, whether or not claims are made by the consumers, at periods which work out at less than the ten years' period that we have settled on, and we do not believe that we will be inflicting any great extra expense or hardship on the gas companies, but we believe that the public buying from these gas companies are entitled to the protection that this ten years' test gives.  If Senators believe that it is going to involve the companies in any big expense, and that the saving to <Col N="900" /> the public is not to be considered commensurate, they will have to vote against this amendment of mine.  But if any of them have been in touch with gas companies, or if any of them have been given returns as to the tests made, they would find that the best companies make these tests without any obligation by law to do so.  We are now making it compulsory, and we are only making compulsory what is the general practice.  This is the general practice of the good companies.  We are really imposing the practice of the good companies on the less good companies, and I think this is a small matter to ask the companies to do for the benefit of the consumer.  That is the point of difference between the Senator's amendment and my own.  Senator Brown simply wants to have it that only such meters will be considered not to be tested after a ten years' period as were queried and were subsequently verified.</P>

      <P>The difference is that Senator Brown's amendment means that within a ten years' period a meter must be stamped at the request of the consumer, and he went on to state that that is better, completely overlooking the fact that during recent years there has been a tremendous increase in the use of gas, and in every tenement house and every small house in the large cities meters are now in use.  If the Senator is going to wait for people to demand that these meters be tested he will be <Col N="901" /> waiting a long time.  The unfortunate housewife who is putting her pennies into a meter every time she wants to use gas will never dream of demanding a test, and she will never know that under an Act of the Oireachtas power is given her to have a test.  She will never bother about that.  I think the Minister is right.  Every piece of machinery that is being used should be overhauled within certain periods to see that it is carrying on its functions properly.  A gas meter is a most intricate piece of machinery.  Anyone who sees the intricate nature of these slot meters that are used by poor people will see that it is absolutely essential that even within a ten years' period there should be an overhaul, or an examination of them, to see that they are correct.  For that reason I oppose the amendment proposed by Senator Brown, and I support the amendment put forward by the Minister. As I understand, the Minister provides that under Section 5 there shall be a compulsory examination within each ten years' period, and that in the interim, if any consumer thinks that his meter is not correct and demands a retest, if it is proved on that test that the meter is correct the consumer who has demanded it shall have to pay for it. If it is the other way the company must pay.  I think that is fair and reasonable. I think that Senator Brown ought to withdraw his amendment and allow Section 5 to remain as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>2.&mdash;The annual value of lands which were previously subject to a purchase annuity payable under the Land Purchase (Ireland) Acts or any of them, but which annuity has since been redeemed, shall for the purpose of Schedule B be taken to be the first or original annuity payable before redemption, if such original annuity is less than the Poor Law Valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this recommendation is to place tenants who have redeemed their purchase annuities in the same position after as they were before redemption. It is quite clear that the income from a farm is the same after as it was before redemption of the purchase money.  In the present state of <Col N="904" /> the law, when the purchase money has been redeemed, the assessment for the purposes of income tax is increased from the figure of the annuity to that of the poor law valuation, which in most cases is a considerable increase.  The fact that that is so is a great deterrent to people who might redeem their purchase money, and I think it would be for the benefit of the country to encourage tenants to redeem their purchase money, if only from the fact that it would relieve the Land Commission of the duty of collecting the annuities, would save a good deal of clerical work, cost of postage, and other steps taken for the collection of these annuities.  I hope the Minister will look into this matter in a favourable light, and recommend that such an amendment be inserted in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been dealt with in a slightly different aspect previously by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A provision was inserted in the Finance Act of 1915 by which land could be assessed on the basis of the land purchase annuity.  The Finance Act of 1915 was the Finance Act imposing excess profits duty&mdash;that was the real purpose of it&mdash;and somebody somehow got an amendment put in to the effect I have stated.  It was an amendment for which there could be no justification whatever.  I suppose it was accepted, as amendments are sometimes accepted, to get Bills through.  It was found after the change of Government that if a man reduced his purchase annuity by redemption to, say, £1 the land was only assessable on £1, although the value might be very considerable indeed.  In the 1923 Finance Bill we amended that position to some extent.  We amended it where it was chargeable on the original annuity. What Senator Linehan asks us to do is a thing for which there could be really no justification, because it means that certain pieces of land would be for ever put in a more favourable position in regard to taxation than other pieces of land.  For instance, the Land Commission can only advance £5,000 for the purposes of the Land Acts.  In certain cases a tenant himself advances additional money.  If one particular farm <Col N="905" /> was bought for £5,000 the basis of assessment would be the annuity arising out of the advance of £5,000, while if an adjoining farm was bought for £10,000, £5,000 being advanced by the Land Commission and £5,000 being found by the tenant, then presumably that farm would be twice as valuable as the first one, yet if Senator Linehan's amendment were accepted, for ever and ever the farm that was twice as valuable as the first one would be counted as of the same value for income tax purposes.  That would continue if it was split up and passed to other owners.  It seems to me to be a procedure that is entirely indefensible, that because a tenant purchaser found part of the money himself, perhaps by borrowing, because the farm was bigger than would be covered by an advance from the Land Commission, that that particular land is for ever to receive favourable treatment for income tax.  I believe the amendment introduced in 1915 had really no justification, but in any case the effect will pass away ultimately as land purchase advances are redeemed.  If Senator Linehan's amendment were passed it would mean that for ever a farm twice as valuable as a neighbouring farm would be simply assessed for the same income-tax. Really on the merits I think that cannot be defended, and that what is in the 1915 Act is a wrong principle, and I do not think we should perpetuate or extend it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not much hope of having the recommendation inserted in the Finance Bill of 1928 unless we had the support of the Minister to carry it through.  I wish to point out that I do not think the Minister is correct in stating that if the amendment were adopted it would be a case of fixing an assessment value for ever, because there is a Finance Bill every year, in which any injustice could be remedied when ascertained by the income-tax authorities.  As regards the case I quoted of a tenant who paid down portion of his purchase money in cash, in addition to the advance from the Land Commission, at the present time that tenant&mdash;if there are any such &mdash;is only assessed on a very small <Col N="906" /> amount for income tax.  My recommendation if carried would not alter the position in any way.  I hope that the matter will be attended to by the Minister in a future Finance Bill and that some encouragement will be given to farmers who would be inclined to redeem the purchase money of their holdings.</P>

I would like to know what the cases are, apart from the question of principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 1, sub-section (2).  To insert after the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  No income tax or super-tax shall be charged in respect of compounded arrears of rent payable under the Land Act, 1923, until such arrears have been actually paid to the person entitled to the same.  Any income tax or super-tax that has already been paid on such unpaid compounded arrears of rent, either by direct assessment or by set-off against other moneys due, shall be refunded.  Where such arrears are payable in stock, both income tax and super-tax shall be likewise payable in the same stock at parity value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this is not to secure a formal amendment, but to raise the matter in the hope that the Minister may give me certain assurances.  As the House probably knows I pointed out yesterday that certain arrears that existed at the time of the passing of the Land Act of 1923 took the form of compounded arrears of rent collectable by the Land Commission and payable to the ownérs.  About half the arrears have been collected and paid over and presumably tax has been paid on them so that no question arises there.  My <Col N="907" /> recommendation is concerned with the uncollected part which, by the Act of 1927, is going to be added in the form of stock to the purchase money, and ultimately will be given to the owners. It has come to my notice that the revenue authorities are actually pressing for income tax to be paid on such compounded arrears which have not yet been paid.  They have not yet been paid, and we do not know when they will be paid.  Moreover, they are pressing to be paid in cash whereas the actual owner will only receive his money&mdash;when he does receive it&mdash;in stock.  I had a case brought to my notice.  I went to the proper authority and was told it was not their policy to press, and I understand no pressure has been put on in the case I refer to. I was surprised that a rather peremptory letter should have been written when I was afterwards told that it was not the policy of the authorities to press.  I know also that in cases where compensation is due under the Malicious Injury Acts to the owners, such a tax was in fact deducted from the compensation.  If it is not equitable to press for direct payment, I submit that it is equally inequitable to exact such payment by way of set-off.  I further say that I doubt even if the liability for tax exists.  The liability arises under Schedule A, which involved the contractual ownership of the landlord. The landlord had no power to collect when the tax arose and then came the Land Act of 1923 which wiped out the contractual relationship and he had no power to collect even if he wished to do so.  I do not suppose that any owner would go to the expense of taking such a case to the court, but I think it should be left in the hands of the Government for just treatment.  They are empowered to give it in the case of direct payment, but they are not giving it in cases where they have power to deduct by way of set-off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a little difficulty about this matter.  At present the whole procedure, and the procedure since 1881, is based on administrative concession.  Tax is due and is actually assessed on the valuation, and it should be collected <Col N="908" /> irrespective of whether the rents are paid or not, or of what amount of rent has been received.  If the rent is lost, or is less than the valuation, then the landlord would be entitled to receive repayment.  But when the Land League became vigorous there was a general withholding of rent, and the British Treasury then made it an administrative concession, whereby they did not require payment on the valuation, and the right of the landlord to reclaim repayment, if the rent was lost or was less than the valuation, was met by administrative concession.  They only charged when the rents were received and assessed on the amounts actually received.  We inherited that particular position, and we applied that concession to the existing situation.  Our policy is not to press, and if there was any pressure exerted on an individual it was an accident or was done by mistake or through misunderstanding.  There is no intention of pressing anybody for payment of tax in respect of this particular income until it has been received.  But repayment of tax actually in the hands of the Government is another matter. The strict legal position is that the Revenue Commissioners could and should, except for this old concession, collect on the valuation and only repay when it was ascertained, as I have said, that the rent received was less or was lost, in compliance with a certain section of the law.  It is therefore a big concession not to press, but it is a just concession I admit, particularly in existing circumstances, when the money is not in the hands of the Government.  But of course it will be going a definite step further to pay out money in the hands of the Government to those particular people.  I do not know whether in any case anything further could be done beyond simply taking care not to press. The position has been altered and made worse from the point of view of those individuals by the Act of 1923.  Where compounded arrears are payable in land stock, although the stock has a market value, it is less than the face value, and there is an arrangement whereby that stock is taken at face value in satisfaction of the tax.  I think the latter part of Senator Sir John Keane's recommendation is met.  I do not know <Col N="909" /> whether a great many very hard cases have arisen, but I feel that we would be getting very far from the law if we added another administrative concession to the present administrative concession, by means of which the revenue authorities have carried on since 1881.</P>
      <P>It is one thing not to insist on a tax after it is legally due, but it is going a very considerable step further to pay back to the owner a tax which is in the hands of the Government by way of repayment and which is legally due and was legally due and which could have been legally collected several years ago.  I think the Senator will see, when he asks for further administrative concessions on top of those already in existence, that he is asking us to go very far indeed from the strict letter of the law.  It seems to me that it really would be too much.  I do not know whether, in detail, there is anything that we could do further, but I do assure the Senator that these cases have been dealt with sympathetically, and if there has been pressure that pressure has been accidental and out of line with what is the general policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's assurance about the pressure, but I do not think he quite appreciates my point about the set-off. It is not a question of paying back a tax already collected, and it is not a question of any set-off.  This power to set-off is, I understand, restricted. Power, I think, is given to do it under the Malicious Injuries Act.  I do not think that the Revenue Authorities are in all cases able to set-off one source of debt against another.  But I think it is done under the Damage to Property Act.  There is one case of distinct hardship that has come to my notice where the amount of compensation awarded has had very considerable sums deducted from it on account of the tax for compounded arrears. These deductions were made in cash, whereas the Government do not pay all the compensation in cash.  I can give the Minister, if he wants them, particulars as regards that one case.</P>

      <P>I was referring rather to a case where a person was <Col N="910" /> entitled to the repayment of income tax and where we refused.  I take it that the Senator is asking that the full amount of the person's claim for repayment should be admitted, irrespective of the fact that the tax is actually and legally due in regard to compounded arrears which had not been received and would be collectable as soon as the compounded arrears had been received.  Perhaps there is some point in his argument when he is not referring to income tax which the Government and the Revenue Commissioners have and which might otherwise be repayable, but when he is referring to money due in respect of compensation, that is a somewhat different matter.  It is a matter that I have not personally examined, but I would undertake to look into it.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 2:</P>
      <P>Section 1.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  Income tax for any year shall be assessed upon the actual income accruing in the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I am moving this in order to get a declaration of policy from the Minister.  The Minister knows that in England now the previous year is definitely adopted as the basis of assessment for income tax.  The three years' average has now been abandoned in Great Britain.  I know that there are objections to it, but it must have been done for a good reason in England.  It has been continually urged by taxpayers and by people who have to handle the taxpayers' business that this should be done.  The present method I know is defended very strongly in official quarters, but it is very inconvenient to the taxpayers. It is inconvenient in this way: that you are asked in the month of May or June to send in a return of your total income for the current financial year. Of course, you do not know what your total income for the current financial year will be until the following April, <Col N="911" /> and as one is not a prophet it would be impossible to say in May or June what one's total income would be for that financial year.  Therefore, in preparing the return under the present system, a large element of guess-work must inevitably enter into the calculations made. There are certain concessions and practices which have grown from it and which have mitigated the inconvenience somewhat.  In the case of dividends it would obviously be impossible for anyone to forecast the amount of the dividends he is likely to receive in a particular year, so that what happens as regards dividends is that in practice the dividends paid in the previous year are taken as the basis.</P>
    <P>As regards salaries, very often a taxpayer does not know what his salary is likely to be in a particular year.  It may be reduced, or, on the other hand, it may be increased by the payment of a bonus or something of that sort.  In the case of foreign securities, the taxpayer is supposed to be able to give an exact figure as to what these are likely to bring him in.  Of course, it would be quite impossible for him to do that. In the case of people with mortgages abroad the income from them is continually fluctuating and cannot be ascertained until the year is completed. In the case of bank interest the system is highly absurd.  Those who have the misfortune to have to work on a bank overdraft cannot possibly know what their interest charges are likely to be until the year is completed, and yet you are expected in the month of May or June to send in a statement showing your total net income and setting off against it bank interest charges, the amount of which you cannot know until the end of the financial year.  As soon as the inspectors get the returns they proceed to make the assessment. In the case of everybody, especially dual residents, this, since the separation of the two countries, has become very complicated.  Calculations have to be made, and these have to be re-opened again at the end of the financial year.  If any of the figures given require correction, the whole thing has to be re-opened at the end of the financial year.  I should think that even in the interests of saving <Col N="912" /> work in the Revenue Department it would be much to their advantage to take the income for the previous year as the basis of income for any given year.  At the end of the financial year the whole matter could be re-opened when claims for repayments and adjustments could be dealt with.  I fail to see why the Government here should not follow the practice of the British Treasury in this.  I think it would be a desirable reform.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane seems to have made a very good case for the recommendation that he has proposed, but I am afraid that if I am to speak on the different schedules I must admit that they are altogether beyond me.  Some injustice may creep in under this.  Let us take the case of trading concerns which had been making profits and were destroyed in the year 1922.  While these concerns were out of business and their buildings flattened to the ground, the three years' average ran against the firms concerned.  It would be only fair that when these firms re-established their business and rebuilt their premises that they should have the benefit of the three years' average when commencing business again.  If this recommendation be carried, I hope the Minister will make provision for any such cases that have occurred.  I have a case that I could bring to his notice. Unfortunately, I myself was associated with two such concerns.</P>

      <P>I understood from Senator Sir John Keane that this is not a recommendation that he would press. Obviously, we could not carry out a change such as he suggests by a two-line amendment.  It would require probably five or six pages of the Finance Bill to do what he proposes.  I think that when the change was carried out in Great Britain that the section embodying it occupied five or six pages of the Finance Bill there, while there was also a schedule of minor alterations and adaptations.  So that the change could not possibly be made in this way.  To my mind, this amendment goes a great deal further, if it were adopted, than Senator Sir John Keane intends.  I think it would introduce a very radical alteration in the <Col N="913" /> charges under Schedule A. if we were to charge on the basis of income that accrued during the preceding year. Our view is that the change that has been made in Great Britain is a wholly desirable change, and our own intention is to follow it.  Whether we do that simply, or try to accompany it with certain further changes, I am not yet in a position to say.  If we had the opportunity of putting experienced members of the staff, which we have not had owing to the extra pressure up to the present, on a revision of the income tax code, then we could simplify it very considerably.  The conditions here are different to what they are in Great Britain.  The complexities which are necessary in Great Britain could, I think, to some extent be eliminated here.</P>
      <P>We hope to begin the process of simplifying the income tax code to some extent this year.  How soon we will be in a position to make substantial changes I cannot say at the moment.  I recognise the point that Senator Dowdall has mentioned.  The Senator, however, will recognise that it would be very difficult to make the sort of allowance that he suggests, because if we were to change over at all we would be bound to affect some businesses disadvantageously. If we were to change from the system of the three years' average, some businesses are going to be hit and others may gain.  I think, when the time comes, if we do decide to do it, we will have to take the plunge. I do not want to say that as a final word, but I want to enter a caveat. The Senator thinks that we could make the change without disadvantage to anyone.  If we are going to make the change we will have to make up our minds that on the whole it is desirable, and we will have to try to make it at a time when all the indications point to the likelihood of our being able to make the change smoothly.  If we decide to make it, I think we will have to make it with all the consequences of some firms gaining something by it, and others losing by it.</P>

      <P>It is only right, I think, that I should give a specific instance.  The Gresham Hotel was destroyed in the public interest <Col N="914" /> ostensibly&mdash;I do not use the word &ldquo;ostensibly&rdquo; in any offensive way&mdash; by the forces of the State.  That concern was making a number of thousands per year profits for years when it was working, but while the building was flat on the ground, and when it necessarily lost ground rents, considerable running expenses had to be maintained.  In that particular case at any rate, the directors became responsible for a very large sum of money in order to re-establish it.  A certain amount of compensation was awarded, but in addition to the heavy losses and the heavy interest charges on the money which had to be borrowed to re-establish the hotel, the Minister, while insisting on his pound of flesh while the hotel was down and out as regards the three years' average, coolly proposes now that it should come into the general pool and that no exemption will be made for income tax in the future.  That is wholly unjust and, I think, absolutely wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Recommendation No. 4:</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 5 to insert a new section, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>5.&mdash;In no case shall both super-tax and surtax be charged on the income of one and the same year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important matter, and I should be glad to get an explanation from the Minister as to how it is going to work.  I have got my own views about it, and I propose to propound them to the House.  The Minister can say whether I am wrong or not.  There has been a great deal of interest taken in this on the other side in public correspondence. I do not know whether it is that there are more surtax payers and super-tax payers there than here, or that they are more vigilant.  Undoubtedly this new arrangement with regard to surtax and super-tax is going to mean the payment of two taxes for the same period.  I know that it is going to work in this way.  Take the present year, 1928/29.  Anybody with an income of over £2,000 will be liable for super-tax for the year on the basis <Col N="915" /> of his income for 1927/28.  He will pay that tax in January, 1929.  That was the normal procedure, but now for the same period he becomes liable for the payment of surtax.  The way the thing is camouflaged is that the payment is deferred.  The double liability arises for the same period, but the payment is deferred.  He does not pay until January, 1930.  The defenders of this arrangement say that a person will not pay anything that he has not paid before. On the face of it that looks very plausible.  You are only paying out in January, and everything seems to be quite nice.  I suggest that ought to make one rather suspicious about it. Why should the tax for, say, the year 1928-29 not be payable until 1930?  The ordinary tax for 1928-29 is payable in two moieties in January and July.  Of course, the whole thing is that you give the whole show away.  It applies to the two payments in January, 1929, but one is deferred until January, 1930.  The liability is just the same.</P>
    <P>In the case of super-tax, where the taxpayer dies during the year his liability to tax is apportioned to the date of his death, but in the case of surtax, by some extraordinary arrangement which no one can discover, the liability applies to the whole year, so that if I were to die to-morrow, and I am unfortunately a super-taxpayer, I should only pay my super-tax for 1928/29 up to the date of my death, and whatever portion is due after that my executors would be liable for it.  My executors would be liable for the entire surtax for the year.  That is a very good example of the way in which people are taxed twice over in the same year.</P>
    <P>In the case of surtax, although a man only lived for one month in a financial year, his executors have got to pay sur-tax for the whole year.  In the case of super-tax, he only pays in respect of the portion of the year during which he was alive.  I have no doubt that this is a very dull subject for people who have not the good or bad fortune, as the case may be, to pay surtax.  I think the Minister, however, should arrange that people would not have to pay this double tax.  The Minister may not be able to do it this year, but I would ask him to consider whether, in the case of <Col N="916" /> surtax, he could not make the same concession in the event of death as is made in the case of super-tax.  Super-tax is payable up to the date of a person's death.  I do not ask this to be done this year, but I do not think that the taxpayer should have to pay twice. I think that the surtax should, as in the case of the super-tax, be apportioned up to the date of a person's death, and should not be payable for the whole of the financial year, as is now going to be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. GUINNESS Mr. GUINNESS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support everything that has been said by Senator Sir John Keane.  He has used precisely the arguments that I had intended to put before the House.  There is not the slightest doubt, I think, that for the year 1928-29 anybody who has the privilege to pay super-tax will be called upon to pay, not alone super-tax, but surtax as well.  One payment will be made in January, 1929, and, as Senator Sir John Keane has pointed out, the subsequent payment will be made in January, 1930.  On the Second Reading of this Bill, when this matter was alluded to, the Minister definitely stated that it was not intended that super-tax and surtax should be paid for one and the same year, but I am afraid that if he examined more closely the section in the Bill dealing with this, which is really a copy of the section in the English Bill, he will find, as Senator Sir John Keane has tried to show, that both will be payable for the year 1928-29.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Chancellor of the Exchequer admitted that by the change from one system to another he was going to obtain a sum of not less than £60,000,000.  If, as the Minister alleged, there is no money in it, I do not know how the Chancellor of the Exchequer in England is going to get £60,000,000 out of the altered system.  He must have some means of doing so which is not known to our Minister for Finance here, but if there is to be a gain of that sort I think it would be well that we should know what our Minister is going to obtain in the way of a windfall under the change proposed in our Bill. I think that undoubtedly a great hardship will be caused by this section.  A man's estate will, in the long run, be <Col N="917" /> liable for this additional taxation.  The recommendation which I have tabled comes to much the same thing as the recommendation moved by Senator Sir John Keane.  It asks that the super-tax payer should be left in the condition that he is in now in relation to his taxation during his lifetime, and that his estate should be left in the same relation in regard to super-tax as hitherto.  I do not think that the request is unreasonable.  If what the Minister stated be true, that there is to be no double taxation, then I cannot see how he will refuse to give an assurance which would be tantamount to accepting the recommendation so that a man's estate cannot be penalised by the introduction of this clause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that I said on the last occasion that sur-tax and super-tax would not be charged for one and the same year.  As far as I remember what I said was that sur-tax and super-tax would not payable in one and the same year.  Theoretically, super-tax and sur-tax will be chargeable on the year of transition, but they will be payable at different dates and they will be assessed on the basis of income in two different years. The effect of the change is that every person of the requisite income will, in the course of his life or after his death, pay an additional year's tax.  At present if a person comes into an income of £3,000 a year, for the first year he pays no sur-tax or super-tax.  He pays no super-tax because his income in the previous year was below the super-tax limit.  In the second year in which he enjoyed this income of £3,000 a year he pays super-tax because as I have said the super-tax is based on his income in the preceding year.  Having already one year an income of £3,000 he became entitled to pay super-tax the second year so that he really escaped super-tax for one year.  The change which transfers the basis of assessment of sur-tax to the actual year of assessment means that for every year that person is entitled to an income of £2,000 or over he is liable to sur-tax, and in the case of death that his estate will pay the sur-tax in respect of the last year.  It seems to me to be entirely fair and reasonable.  I see no ground <Col N="918" /> at all on which a person should escape the sur-tax for one year any more than he should escape income tax for the first year.</P>
      <P>The matter was debated, as the Senator has indicated, in the House of Commons.  It was quite clearly shown there that there was no intention of giving way on this point.  If we did something to give effect to this particular amendment and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in England stuck to his guns the position would be that we would lose a whole year's surtax of about £500,000, and because people on the other side stood fast&mdash;because most of the super-tax payers are doubly resident or liable doubly, and come under the double taxation and under the relief provisions&mdash;it would mean we would lose £500,000, and the taxpayers would probably gain&mdash;I have not made a close calculation on this&mdash; say, £150,000, and the other £350,000 would remain in the British Exchequer, for they would not be liable to make any relief allowance as surtax is not payable here.  On that basis alone the thing would be rather absurd.  In any case it seems to me that the change is entirely defensible, and the effect of it is that over a period it gives us one extra year's surtax revenue, and it means that every person with an income of over £2,000 a year pays a sur-tax at the appropriate rate in respect of every year that he has that income. That seems to me entirely defensible and correct, and I can see no sound argument against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will that burden be paid on a person's death by his executors?  I cannot see the justice of the Minister's statement.  He will not be receiving income; his estate will be divided and income will not be coming in, as his salary and the rest of it will have ceased, and yet his estate is liable for the tax he paid during his life.  His executors would have to pay it, but the income on which it is paid is not being <Col N="919" /> received by anybody.  The Minister argued that it was not going to be such a severe injury because the super-tax payers, being doubly resident, only £150,000 would come out of the £500,000 as a benefit to the taxpayers, because so many of them came under the provisions of the double taxation reliefs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>What I meant to say was that the taxpayers, in view of the existing position, and of the fact that the change is being made in Great Britain and that they are going to stand over it there, apparently the position would be, if we adopt the principle of this amendment, the taxpayers here would gain only a small proportion of what the Exchequer would lose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who are not doubly resident get the whole benefit of it.  It is no relief for us to be told that other people are not going to get the full benefit.  We who live here, and our executors, when we die, will be injured to the extent of a year's super-tax.  What should be made clear without doubt is that the full extent of the change means that in the event of death the estate is to be liable for a year's super-tax for which it was not liable before.</P>

      <P>I am not affected by super-tax, but it would appear from the argument of the Minister that you are made to pay when you are dead what you should have to pay when you are alive.  I understand that in the first year a person liable to super-tax does not pay that year, but his liability for that year has to be paid out of the estate when he dies.  That is quite fair, for a person cannot have it both ways.  If I were in the happy position to have to pay surtax I would be quite glad of the Minister's arrangement for I would have the benefit of the money while I was alive, and the payment of it would only be called upon when I was dead and when it would be no use to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things suggested to the Minister.  One is that double liability should not fall, but I can quite see the difficulty about <Col N="920" /> that.  There is the other matter which should be considered, I think, that is, the apportionment to the date of death. Formerly in the case of super-tax, under Section 6 of the Finance Act of 1912 super-tax liability was apportioned up to the day of death.  That was a fair arrangement.  Why should that arrangement, apart from the transition year, be departed from?  In the case of surtax, that seems to me doubly unjustifiable for there is no ground for putting on a tax on an estate that has no legal existence.  Once a man is dead the estate has no legal existence, and income tax should not be imposed under those conditions.  This surtax proposal seems illogical.  If a taxpayer dies before the 3rd April he will have to pay tax only for that year, and if he dies two days after he becomes liable for the 365 days.</P>

      <P>These two recommendations are so intimately related that I wish to discuss them together. For some years the country has been passing through a critical period, and we have not yet emerged from it.  Agriculture, the principal mainstay of the country, is in a parlous condition, and the Irish farmer who depends on agriculture for his livelihood is finding it difficult to meet his obligations and make ends meet.  Our industries, owing to foreign competition, and also owing to the fact that our own people refuse to support home manufactures, are also in a parlous condition.  The revenue of the country is falling away.  In view of these facts I think any suggestion that would in any way remedy this state of affairs ought to be considered by the Minister.  With regard to the first item, table waters in Ireland are excellently produced from the best materials, and they compare quite favourably with any similar article imported, but a certain class of the population here seem to regard anything imported as superior to the home article.  As to the mineral water industry here being in a rather precarious condition, I may mention that five mineral water manufacturers in the last year have amalgamated, and the underlying reason of that is to save overhead expenses.  In doing that they had necessarily to decrease the number of employees who had rendered faithful service.  By putting an additional five shillings on these waters it would materially help the mineral water manufacturers of Ireland.  With regard to wines, this section, I suppose, refers only to sweetened wines.  These would be rectified wines, and they are produced in this country from the best materials.  But the imported article is coming in and knocking them out.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be right to put an extra tax on all these articles I have mentioned.  With regard to medicated wines, these are flooding the country at present.  They are made out of inferior materials, and they pay only the lower class of duty, namely, 5/- per gallon and are sold at 5/6 per bottle.  The reason for that is they do not pay any extra duty, which puts them on a level with the home article.  It has been proved on <Col N="924" /> analysis that these medicated wines are really trash and are sold on a system of bonuses all over the country, doing great injury to the legitimate wine trade.  I therefore hope the Minister will favourably consider putting on an additional tax on these imported mineral waters and medicated wines, and so help the home industry.</P>

      <P>I am unable very well to connect medicated wines with home industries.  So far as mineral waters are concerned, sweetened mineral waters do enjoy the great advantage of protection.  It amounts to, allowing for the tax on sugar, something like about threepence or four-pence a gallon, and on such a comparatively cheap commodity as table water, lemonade and that sort of thing, I think that threepence or threepence halfpenny a gallon is quite sufficient protection. I would not be inclined at any subsequent stage to increase that. The present tariff on mineral waters was fixed knowing that it would have a protective effect, but I would not propose to go beyond that.  It might be that there might be some grounds for prohibiting the sale of medicated wines.  I think probably they are a fraud on the public, and a very inferior article is sold as possessing a virtue which it has not.  Perhaps there is a case for that.  I do not know whether the medical profession, for instance, would take that view.  Some individual members of the profession are induced to write testimonials as advertisements, but they, perhaps, might represent only a few of the profession. There might be some grounds for considering whether the sale of these so-called medicated wines, which I personally consider are frauds, should not be stopped.  If we are stopping it we should go the right way about it and have an examination of the matter and say that they might not be imported, that they might not be advertised and sold.  As a matter of public health, as a matter of preventing the public being induced to pay excessive prices for a particular brand of article, that brings us up to the question of patent medicines.  It would be very difficult to deal with the question of wines without going further, and <Col N="925" /> you could not deal with all the difficulties in the Bill.  It seems to me, if we are dealing with mineral waters or sauces which contain sugar, we should not impose as stiff a rate of duty as 5/- per gallon.</P>

      <P>On and after the 1st day of May, 1928, entertainments duty within the meaning of Section 1 of the Finance (New Duties) Act, 1916, shall not be charged or levied on payments for admission to any entertainment as respects which it is proved to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that the entertainment consists solely of one or more horse races and that the holding of the entertainment has been authorised either by the Turf Club of Ireland or by the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee or by both the said Turf Club of Ireland and the said Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Section 26.  To delete all after the word &lsquo;races&rsquo; in line 13 down to the end of the section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 26 of the last Finance Bill this year the entertainment tax on all race meetings has been remitted, but the Seanad will notice that the tax is remitted only in the case of races run either by the Turf Club of Ireland or the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee, or by both.  That means that the tax has still to be paid in respect of a number of small race meetings, popularly known as flapper meetings, which are held throughout the country under an organisation known as the Irish Racing Organisation.  They <Col N="926" /> are not what one would call, I think, high-class races.  They are not run under the same rules as those run by the Turf Club and the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee, but they do afford a certain amount of recreation and amusement in different parts of the country, particularly in the rural areas. I think about 150 of them are held annually.  In the majority of cases no entrance fees are charged to people entering the course, and where any charge is made it is small.  Some of those meetings are got up for the purpose of raising funds for some local purpose, but on the main they afford a cheap day's sport in the country to the local people.  It has been argued by somebody that at these meetings the best horses do not always win.  I admit that may be true, but I have yet to know races in which one could guarantee that the best horse would win.  Certainly, the frequenters of the Curragh, Punchestown or Baldoyle could not guarantee that the best horse always wins, or even does his best to win, so whatever objection there may be on that ground to remitting the tax it also applies to the big meetings.  In view of the fact that the amount of money involved is negligible I think the tax on the whole of those race meetings combined does not realise more than £100 per annum, and it would not pay the cost of collection. At present, there is no money in it.  It means a certain amount of trouble and annoyance, and probably militates against the running of these races.  It is a tax that is not worth retaining.  The Exchequer will lose nothing by it.  The effect of the recommendation is to enable the remission of the entertainment tax in respect of race meetings to apply to both the small unofficial meetings and the big official meetings.  There will be a good deal of discontent and comment if these little meetings have to pay while the big commercial race meetings are exempt from taxation.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see his way to accept this, and that the House will agree to the principle of having the same treatment for all.</P>

I am asking the Seanad to pass it and to let the Dáil have an opportunity of reconsidering the matter.  This amendment was proposed by the leader of the Labour Party in the Dáil.  I opposed it, but a large number were in favour of it.  When the Ceann Comhairle said it was carried I agreed, but a member of another Party challenged it and I succeeded in defeating it.

    <P>I put down this amendment in order to give the Minister an opportunity of elucidating certain difficulties that I have in understanding the term foreign <Col N="929" /> companies which are liable to corporation tax.  What is a foreign company? There is no definition of foreign company. It appears to me to be a matter of great doubt and might require legal interpretation.  I imagine a foreign company is one not registered in the Saorstát but doing business and receiving profits from trade here.  That is the definition on which I ventured to put down the recommendation.</P>

      <P>Such foreign company maintained in Saorstát Eireann a branch register of its members resident in Saorstát Eireann and that according to the law of the country in which such foreign company is incorporated...</P>
      <P>It goes on to refer to the question of domicile.  These words &ldquo;residence&rdquo; and &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; have very distinct and different meanings and they have been used in a rather promiscuous manner in the section.  Would the Minister explain what is the purpose in differentiating between them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be taken that this particular section for all practical purposes affects only companies which are situated in Great Britain.  To some extent it may affect other outside companies, but in the main it affects British companies.  In Great Britain the law is found in Section 36, paragraph <Col N="930" /> (b)  of the Companies Consolidation Act of 1908 which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>On the death of a member registered in a colonial register the shares of the deceased member shall, if he died domiciled in the United Kingdom, but not otherwise be deemed so far as relates to British duties to be part of his estate and effects situate in the United Kingdom for or in respect of which probate or letters of administration is or are to be granted or whereof an inventory is accepted and recorded in like manner as if he were registered in the principal register.</P>
      <P>That section shows that, really the question of where the shares are deemed to be situated depends not on residence but on domicile, and the effect of Senator Sir John Keane's recommendation would be that we might in effect strike out sub-section (2) of this section, because it would impose a condition which could not be complied with, and none of the companies could escape liability to the higher rate by setting up a colonial register.  It really relates to the Companies Consolidation Act of 1908 and is not a promiscuous use of the terms &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; and &ldquo;residence.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask for some further information as I really do not understand the position.  But under this new arrangement there is a penalty attached to any foreign company that does not establish a colonial register, and on such register has to be borne the names of shareholders resident, or is it both resident and domiciled?</P>

      <P>Resident within the country.  Can companies compel shareholders to enter on any particular register?  Is not that entirely within the option of shareholders as to which register they choose to be inscribed on?  At present I know it is open to shareholders to go on any of the registers which are kept, I understand, by a company.  It is outside my knowledge, but I think that is the fact. How can it be made mandatory on the company to compel a shareholder to go on any given register?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Again that relates to another section of the Companies Consolidation Act&mdash;Section 34 (1), which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A company having a share capital whose objects comprise the transaction of business in a colony, may, if so authorised by its Articles, cause to be kept in any colony in which it transacts business a branch register of members resident in that colony (in this Act called a colonial register).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This might have been framed in a different way, but it was thought better to frame it as it is.  It is a general section and refers mainly to British companies. It was thought better to frame this section generally rather than with specific reference to any British legislation, and the entire purpose of it is to provide that if a company here&mdash;that is a British company&mdash;sets up a colonial register in conformity with the provisions of the Companies Consolidation Act of 1908, then that company escapes the higher rate of tax.  If the company refuses to set up the register it pays the higher rate of tax, and we justify that provision on the grounds, that where a company which has shareholders resident and domiciled here, and is doing business here, has no colonial register, we are losing death duty to which we are equitably entitled, and which we would obtain if the colonial register were established.  In that case they would be liable only to our death duties.  It is not intended, and it is not believed, that we will collect extra corporation profits tax as a result of this section. It is believed, and I think it is certain, that we will succeed in getting extra death duties in respect of it, and we will get death duties which all impartial people have admitted we are equitably entitled to.  We cannot get them as matters stand, unless colonial registers are set up here by companies <Col N="932" /> which have shareholders domiciled here and are doing business here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I see the point, and I have every sympathy with the Minister's objects.  The only point is that there is no provision to compel a resident or person domiciled in the country to inscribe on the colonial register.  That was the point I wished to be assured on.  But if a person chooses to be obdurate and to remain on the British register is not the object of the clause pro tanto defeated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The following amendment is to be substituted for amendment No. 1 on the printed list:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  New section.  Before section 28 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>28.&mdash;(1)  This section shall apply to any person who before the establishment of the Board satisfies the Minister or after the establishment of the Board satisfies the Board that he fulfils the following conditions, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that he was a citizen of Saorstát Eireann on the 1st day of January, 1928, and</P>
      <P>(b)  that he was on the 31st day of December, 1921, not less than twenty-one years of age, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> (c)  that his principal means of livelihood during the whole period of seven years immediately preceding the passing of this Act was the practice of dentistry in Saorstát Eireann, and</P>
    <P>(d)  that he was not guilty at any time of any crime or conduct which, if he had at that time been a registered dentist, would have caused his removal from the register.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of the application of this section to a person who was a dental mechanic before the passing of the Dentists Act, 1921, the expression &ldquo;practice of dentistry&rdquo; in the foregoing sub-section shall be deemed to include the work usually performed by a dental mechanic.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every person to whom this section applies shall on passing either of the examinations in dentistry to be prescribed and held under this section and on making the prescribed application and paying the prescribed fees be entitled to be registered in the register.</P>
    <P>(4)  Two examinations shall be prescribed and held under this section, the first of which shall be held after the expiration of five months and before the expiration of six months from the passing of this Act and the second of which shall be held after the expiration of eleven months and before the expiration of twelve months from the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>(5)  An examination prescribed and held under this section shall if held before the establishment of the Board be prescribed and held by the Minister, and if held after the establishment of the Board shall be prescribed and held by the Board.</P>
    <P>(6)  Nothing in this Act shall operate to prohibit any person to whom this section applies from practising or representing himself or holding himself out as practising or prepared to practise dentistry or dental surgery during the period between the passing of this Act and the publication of the results of the second examination held under this section.</P>
    <P>(7)  Every person to whom this section applies who is registered in the register under this section and is <Col N="934" /> resident in Saorstát Eireann shall so long as he is so registered and resident be entitled to vote and be elected at an election of the elected members of the Board held after he is so registered as if he were registered in the register by virtue of a previous registration in the General Dentists Register under Section 3 of the Dentists Act, 1921.</P>
    <P>This is really the amendment which was on the paper that was before the Seanad yesterday, with the exceptions that I will refer to.  In letter-paragraph (b) to Section 28 (1) &ldquo;the 31st day of December, 1918&rdquo; has been changed to &ldquo;the 31st day of December, 1921.&rdquo;  That is in accord with what was agreed to yesterday.  Secondly, and consequential on that, letter-paragraph (c) of Section 28 (1) has two changes. The period of ten years is changed to seven years, and the phrase &ldquo;principal occupation&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;principal means of livelihood.&rdquo;  In addition to that, sub-section (4) of the proposed new Section 28 has been amended so as to allow for two examinations instead of one, and the new sub-section (4) of Section 28 reads:</P>
    <P>Two examinations shall be prescribed and held under this section, the first of which shall be held after the expiration of five months and before the expiration of six months from the passing of this Act and the second of which shall be held after the expiration of eleven months and before the expiration of twelve months from the passing of this Act.</P>

There is this change in addition: the old section said that an examination should be prescribed and held within a certain period.  We simply say now that an examination shall be prescribed, and we limit the period within which the examination will be held.  In addition there is a change in (7).  As it was on the paper before the Seanad yesterday sub-section (7) referred to &ldquo;so long as he is so <Col N="935" /> resident and registered.&rdquo;  We have now changed that phrase by inverting the order of the words to &ldquo;registered and resident.&rdquo;  We do not consider residence until registration arises.

      <P>I thought, in accordance with the view that was suggested by Senator O'Hanlon, that the House was to adjourn until Tuesday for the purpose of considering the Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Bill.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister state what is his anxiety for having the Bill taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our anxiety to have this Bill become law, if the Seanad will so agree, at the end of the week, and I understand that that is hardly possible if the Seanad only takes the Third Stage on Wednesday, because if the House is going to agree to that procedure, what has to be done is to pass the Committee Stage, the Report and the Fifth Stages, and an urgency resolution.  I understood that Senator O'Hanlon suggested that if the Bill were not taken to-day it should be taken on Tuesday of next week.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister may rest assured that the Bill will be passed next week in any case, although I do not see the urgency from the Minister's point of view, so long as it is passed before the Seanad rises.  I am not opposing Tuesday, except for the selfish reason that I probably will not be here, but I do not want to keep the House for that.  I suggest that the Bill will be passed in <Col N="938" /> time for the Minister's purpose in any event.</P>

      <P>There will certainly be two other Constitution Bills before the Seanad next week.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.10 p.m. until Tuesday, July 10th.</P>
