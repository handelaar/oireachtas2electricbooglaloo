    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I am not opposing this Bill, because I do not think anybody could reasonably stand up in this House, in view of the housing conditions existing in the country at present, and oppose this Bill. There is a need for providing houses in the country at present so as to relieve the present position of distress that is existing amongst the people.  Though not opposing the Bill, I must say that I am greatly disappointed that some greater effort has not been made to solve this very pressing problem before us.  I have stated here on former occasions that I believe, from my own knowledge of the existing conditions in the tenements and slums in this city, that in my honest belief most of the social evils from which we suffer in this City of Dublin are due solely, or are mainly attributable, to the bad housing conditions. For that reason I say I am disappointed at the poor effort that has been made under this Bill to deal with the terrible problem of housing.  There <Col N="1365" /> is no need for me to dwell or to go into figures with regard to the present state of affairs.</P>
      <P>Every Senator here knows, or should know, what the position is at the moment in Dublin and in the Saorstát. The mere contribution of a sum of £200,000, as provided for in this Bill, for the purpose of granting a subsidy to encourage building, or, as the President said, to end the present housing policy of the Government, is, to my mind, not adequately dealing with the position.  The President has distinctly stated in reference to this Bill that it was to wind up the whole of the Government housing policy.  He went further and he made a statement which has alarmed me considerably, when he said that the Government did not intend in the future to provide £200,000 in any one year to help to solve the housing problem.  To my mind that is a very alarming statement, and I think it is a serious statement.  I have no doubt that the Government do propose a future policy with regard to housing. What that policy may be there is no means of ascertaining at the moment. There is no means of ascertaining what the intentions of the Government are, but in view of the statements that have been made with regard to the amount of money that will be required to deal with this problem of housing, to my mind the contribution of £200,000 in any one year is not going to solve it. When speaking of this matter in the Dáil the President said that some people, when talking about tenements in slums, did not understand exactly what the position was.  I think I can claim to know what the position is.  I stated it here already, and I repeat it to-day, that I am the product of the Dublin tenements.  You have to live there to understand what the evils are. Everybody will say, &ldquo;We have sympathy with the poor people who live in these slums,&rdquo; but they have to live in them in order to understand what the difficulties are.  It is all very well to have sympathy with these people, but it is not sympathy they want, but bricks and mortar.  Sympathy is no use to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could shock this House, and if it were not for the presence of some ladies who are members of this House I <Col N="1366" /> would shock the people here by giving them a description of the conditions in the slums as I know them.  I could shock them, and society has got to be shocked in order to be brought to a sense of responsibility with regard to this problem.  The President paid a great compliment to the dwellers in the slums and tenements.  It is a compliment that I think is deserved.  The wonder to everybody is not that those people who are compelled to live in the slums are as bad as they are, but the extraordinary thing, considering all the circumstances, is that they are so very good.  In view of what the President said about the grand character of these people, surely to goodness they are worth providing them with something better in the way of housing.  In what I am saying I am speaking more particularly of Dublin, because I am familiar with the conditions there.  I know that there are in other parts of the country conditions as bad as they are in Dublin.  For that reason I think we ought to get some idea of what the intentions of the Government are in this respect.  In the other House there were certain suggestions made to try to fix the responsibility or to fix the blame for the present position with regard to housing on certain people.  One Deputy went so far as to say that there was a conspiracy amongst the builders and builders' operatives to hold up the people to ransom.  I do not know so much about that.  I have had a large experience in dealing with builders in the City of Dublin.  I do not think it could be claimed that there was such a conspiracy.  All kinds of statements are being loosely made by people who do not understand this problem, and who have not gone to the trouble to try to understand it.  It is all very well for people to be talking glibly and making suggestions of a solution of problems which they do not understand, and about things of which they know very little.  The problem is there and it will have to be faced.  The houses have got to be built for those people who need them and who are entitled to some bigger effort on their behalf than has been madé up to this.</P>
    <P>Greater efforts will have to be made to try to meet the situation.  There <Col N="1367" /> was a suggestion made that there should be a national housing programme entered into for the next fifteen years, and so on.  I think we ought to be told something about such a programme.  It is not this £200,000 that is going to deal with the housing problem.  More money must be available for the building of houses if this problem is going to be dealt with.  It was stated that in the future the country cannot afford to give more money for housing unless it gets value. The whole suggestion underlying that idea about getting value is that somebody is getting more out of the housing than he should get.  It is a well-known fact that a couple of years ago the Dublin Commissioners, who are now in charge of the housing problem in Dublin, went across to the Continent to study this problem there and see whether they could produce houses cheaper than they were being produced in Dublin.  They came back not alone with new ideas as to the construction of houses, but they brought back with them a number of foreign contractors. Foreign contractors were brought here to build houses with foreign material, and of these foreign contractors it was found afterwards that they, too, must have been in a conspiracy in this matter, because they were not a conspicuous success.  The proper way to deal with it is to set up a National Housing Council, and to put on that National Housing Council people who know their job, representatives of the builders, representatives of the builders' operatives, and representatives of the State that can handle the job and see whether houses could be produced cheaper and if the matter could be dealt with in the proper way, and not in a piecemeal way.  If it is done on a huge scale, the work could be done cheaper.  If it is going to be done to bring relief to those people at present it has got to be done in a big way.  Let the Government have a programme a few years in advance and let the builders' operatives know that the harder they work the better they will be respected.  At present the harder they work the more they are getting near to the time when they will be getting <Col N="1368" /> to the dole and the streets.  It cannot be said in recent years that it is the building operatives who are responsible for the present conditions, as the building operatives are being wiped out.  We have hardly any operatives because the houses are being built with foreign materials and foreign labour almost.  The money is leaving the country for foreign materials.  There was a reference to brickworks and other matters.  Now I know this problem. I have studied it carefully.  I have worked at the building trade myself. I do not think it will ever be solved by tinkering.  The only way in which it can be solved is by the establishment of a proper housing authority which will have power to do the job in the manner in which it can be well done in order to provide decent homes for the citizens.</P>

      <P>I would like to add a few words to what Senator Farren has said.  He has spoken strongly about the Dublin slums. He has not said a word that is too strong.  The conditions are deplorable. I have myself visited some houses and I have seen a mother and five, six or seven children living in one room sixteen feet square.  One of the children was suffering from consumption. That child went away to a sanitorium, was sent back after some time, got ill again, was again sent to the sanitorium, and again back home and so on.  That is not tackling the question as it should be tackled.  I do hope that the Government will see their way to do something substantial in the way of improving the slums in Dublin.  They are spending very large sums on public health in order to prevent consumption and for child welfare.  But the solving and the real solving of this problem will be found through better housing for the people.  If we start at the right end we would improve the houses, and perhaps such large sums will not be required for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. GOGARTY Dr. GOGARTY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>In the old days one of the chief sticks with which we used to belabour the old Local Government Board of which Senator Sir Edward Bigger was a member, was the fact that there were 50,000 people living in one-room <Col N="1369" /> tenements in this country.  I think in thirty years the old Local Government Board did not build as many houses as this Government has built in three years.  This is a problem that it is equally necessary that the Labour Party should tackle.  The reason why tenements are not condemned is because there are not enough houses to take the place of the tenements. A ship is condemned by the Board of Trade when she is unseaworthy. But a house that is uninhabitable and that has become a pest is allowed to remain there a pest centre so long as it is not relieved by the building of a new house.  Until there is a sort of permit required to become a citizen that condition will be indefinitely maintained, because people will continue to go into houses that are condemned as soon as the former tenants leave them to go into a newly built house.  If you build new houses in Fairview in order to empty the slums in Cumberland Street you find that the slums in Cumberland Street are again filled by new tenement dwellers.</P>
      <P>Housing conditions are just as bad in the country.  There was no general architect to control the building of houses and everyone built a house wherever he thought fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen a house eight feet below the level of the road, and which you could not distinguish from a manure heap.  I asked why it was not condemned, and I was told it was condemned by an inspector, but that such houses must continue to exist, as men could not be put out on the mountainside. The casual labourer is the cause of the slum problem in Dublin.  One thing that could be controlled by the Labour Party is the auctionings of labour on the quays.  That you have on the quays three times as many men as you can get employment for is one of the causes of the slum problem.  As long as the old filthy houses are there waiting for new tenants the slum problem will continue.  The tenement houses that are unfit to live in should not be allowed to be occupied again after they have been emptied.  The health condition in Dublin is low.  It is not as healthy as some of the cities in Great Britain according to the deathrate returns.  The happy-go-lucky <Col N="1370" /> places where the Danish ship went aground in Dublin, in the lowest level, are not healthy.</P>
    <P>Money is wasted in the attempt to cure tuberculosis.  If the money were spent on providing housing for the dwellers better results would be obtained. If you got a case of tuberculosis in an Irish village the victim is removed and put into a windy house in some other place, in order to try and effect a cure.  It would be better if instead of waiting to deal with people when they become seriously ill some sunny place were rented from, say, the Portuguese Government, and those suffering from tuberculosis sent there. The money spent on the tuberculosis campaign, if spent on providing houses for the people, would be the best means of preventing tuberculosis.  Some of the slum areas in Dublin, like Summerhill, are a disgrace to civilisation, and for that you cannot definitely bring the blame home to anyone's door. The difficulty in dealing with this problem is that you cannot put the people out of the slums until other houses are built for them.  Owing to the extraordinary use of modern transport, satellite towns could easily be built up around Dublin.  There are parts of Dublin highly desirable for building, such as Ticknock, where there is granite and a gravely soil.  Houses built in these outlying areas should have a fifth of an acre attached.  In connection with the Housing Commission which sat last year, I made a minority report, and I made that report not because I am a crank.  Houses should be built where land is cheap. With modern transport the greengrocer can go to Dalkey or Killiney, but it is the workers who want these healthy surroundings for their children.  Dublin is spread out to the greatest extent of any city. From Killiney to Howth it goes around the Horse-shoe Bay, but the congestion in the middle of the city is very high.  The moment tenement slums are emptied they should be knocked down, and if houses were built in healthy districts around the city, owing to modern transport facilities the workers would be able to dwell there, and that would relieve the congestion in the city.</P>
    <P>Under Board of Trade regulations I <Col N="1371" /> believe that every ship is bound to give eight hours' notice of its arrival.  You could bring casual workers from Cork in that time, and it would only be a matter of twenty minutes when the ship is brought to port to discharge, so that there need not be that concentration about the port we have with the resulting growth of slum tenements. The floors in these tenements are rotten, and the children who live in them rarely see the sun, for the sun is obscured with the smoke that lies over the valley of the Liffey.  I again repeat that the chief factor to be considered in any housing problem is the amazing factor of modern transport.  You do not get rid of the housing or slum problem by making the possibility of another one quite near the town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope this Seanad will realise the importance of the statement made by Senator Farren.  He speaks with authority and with knowledge on the question. Everybody is agreed that our slum problem should be dealt with.  Senator Farren says what the people in the slums want is not sympathy, but houses, and he gave us an indication. Speaking with authority, he pointed out the right way in which to deal with the housing problem.  If you could have a national housing authority, with our Ministry of Public Health represented on it, and if you could have the Committee formed on the lines which the Senator pointed out, and in addition to that you could have an extended programme spread over a series of years, it is quite possible that some practical solution would be found of this very pressing problem.  Objection has been taken to the amount of Government grant allocated, which, I understand, is £200,000 for this year. That is not a large amount, but it represents a fixation of policy, and it denotes that the Government is appreciative of the importance of this issue, and desires to deal with it as best it can.  It is largely a question of finance. It is a question of raising the money to build these houses.  Various ways have been proposed, but I think the subject has been treated in a piece-meal fashion.  What we want really is a <Col N="1372" /> large programme extended over a period of years which will enlist the sympathy and the goodwill of the dwellers in these slums, and enlist the sympathy and the goodwill of Irish labour, and also of those who represent the Irish taxpayers.</P>
      <P>In view of the statement made by Senator Farren, I think that this question is approaching a condition that is ripe for solution, and I suggest to the Government to persevere in its inquiries as to how far it can follow on the lines the Senator suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill involves such a meagre contribution of what is a colossal problem that I feel there is not much use in devoting a lot of discussion to it.  It merely continues the policy which has been in operation for some years now, and which certainly has not relieved in any material degree at all the housing problem.  Since the war we have built here, I believe, about 14,000 houses.  During the same period in Great Britain one and a quarter million houses have been built. In the year 1927 alone, 225,000 houses were erected in Great Britain.  I am afraid that our present rate of building is barely keeping pace with current requirements and that we are not overtaking the shortage that accrued as a result of ceasing to build during the war, and not relieving the shortage that occurred long before the war.  It is, of course, altogether a matter of finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President stated in the other House, that if we could be assured of getting good value for the money spent that it would be possible to get the money, and mention was made, I think, of a housing loan of £10,000,000.  It would be interesting to know in what respect we are not getting proper value at the present time.  Statements are being made repeatedly regarding the alleged restriction of output by the building operatives, but I think the charge has never been established, certainly it has never been established to my satisfaction.  I would like to have it fully investigated and probed but I do not think it has ever been established. Certain incidents have occurred recently which would go to show that proper value is not given by the master <Col N="1373" /> builders in this country.  One glaring example of that was given in the case of a contractor for houses in Cork where a British firm got the contract at £11,000 less than the lowest Irish tender received, and about £30,000 or £40,000 less than the highest Irish tender received.  While the British firm got the contract for the houses at this low tender and is giving at least as good material as that tendered for by the Irish master builders, they were able to pay their operatives a higher rate of pay than were the Irish master builders.  The men employed by the British firm were working, whilst the employes of the Irish builders were walking the streets on strike against a cut in wages.  I know a public utility society here that recently gave a contract for houses to the same firm, and thereby saved £55 per house as compared with what they would have to pay if they had given the contract to one of the Dublin contractors.</P>
    <P>Now these are incidents that cannot be overlooked, and they are considerations that should be borne in mind when charges of a restriction of output are being made against the building operatives.  Statements were also made in the other House in favour of building three-roomed houses in order to hasten on the relief of the housing shortage.  Unfortunately, our Dublin Commissioners have set a terrible example in that respect by building hundreds of three-roomed shacks. That really is going from slumdom to slumdom.  In order to get one of these houses, the applicant must have a more or less exceptionally large family.  He must have a family that the wealthy classes would look upon as large.  He must have six or seven in family in order to be able to get a three-roomed house.  What on earth sort of morality, hygiene or ordinary decency can be observed where you have a family of that dimensions in a three-roomed house?  I do not believe in relieving slumdom in a temporary way, seeing that you are only creating a future slumdom.  Strings of these houses have been built, some four-roomed and others five-roomed amongst them, on the outskirts of the City, in places like Glasnevin and Drumcondra.  One effect of that has <Col N="1374" /> been to pull down the value of the property that they surround.</P>
    <P>One of the finest thoroughfares in Dublin is really being ruined by the erection of these little slum shacks with large families in every one of them.  I do hope that if we are going to relieve slumdom at all, that we are not going to relieve it in a way which is going to create a new slumdom, and in addition take away from the value of decent houses that already exist, and in the end leave the position worse than it was before, because when they did build in previous days they did so with some sense of durability and with a certain amount of convenience in the houses.  They did not confine the houses, except in very few cases, to three-roomed apartments.  In the twentieth century it is a very retrograde step for anyone to advocate a three-roomed house for a family of large dimensions.  Moreover, the type of house which is being built is unfortunately of a very unstable character. One feels that some of them, within a decade or twenty years at most, will be tumbling down, and then the present generation will have the task of restoring them and relieving another form of housing shortage.</P>
    <P>I hope that during the Recess the Government will give some consideration to the question of making money available for the public loan fund whereby a more or less continuous programme can be embarked upon with some decent consistency of plan, policy and outlook.  That is the only way in which we shall be able to face this problem in a practical way, and not in the nibbling manner in which we have been dealing with it during the last four or five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the Seanad proposes to extend the operations of the 1925 and the 1926 Acts, and to place at the disposal of the Minister for Local Government an additional sum of £250,000&mdash;not the sum of £200,000 as some Senators have stated &mdash;for the purpose of winding-up what may be called the arrears of commitments arising out of the 1925 and 1926 Acts.  The moneys voted under the 1926 <Col N="1375" /> Act were fully allotted in June last. At that time we found ourselves with commitments on the part of certain local bodies to the extent of plans being in a greater or lesser state of advancement, for the erection of approximately 1,600 houses, and of private individuals with commitments of one kind or another to the extent of perhaps 800 houses.  It was felt that the Government were not prepared, as early as the autumn of this year, to place before the Oireachtas proposals for a new housing policy, but they decided that money should be made available in respect either of local authorities or private persons who had been rather dilatory in arranging plans and who had been committed, to some extent, to expenditure.  As I say, the Bill originally proposed to meet commitments in respect of local authorities to the extent of 1,600 houses, and in respect of private persons and public utility societies to the extent of 800 houses.  It proposed that houses should have been begun by the 17th October of this year, and completed by the 17th October next year, in order to get the advantage of the grant.  The Bill in the Dáil was amended to the extent of increasing the amount of money that is being made available, so that instead of a total of 2,400 houses a total of approximately 3,000 houses would be provided for.  The concession was also made in the other House that the building of the houses need not be begun until the 31st March next&mdash;at any rate that houses begun before the 1st April next, as long as they were completed by 17th October next year, would be eligible for the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains a provision by which the Minister for Local Government, in reviewing the circumstances in any particular case, may extend the period inside which the house will be completed in by not more than four months beyond the 17th October next. That is the proposal in the Bill, and I think there can be no objection on the part of anyone to that.  I have said that the Government were not in a position to put plans before the Oireachtas for a new housing policy. As the general question of housing has been discussed, I want to say one or <Col N="1376" /> two words in regard to it.  Senator O'Farrell has rightly said that there is not much to be gained by discussing the matter over this particular Bill.  I suggest that there is very little use in discussing it in the spirit Senator Farren did, and with the small contribution that he made.  Any new plans for a housing policy that will be put before the Oireachtas by the Government will be based on the clear understanding on the part of the Government that there is a housing policy to be continued, and that the problem is one that is not going to be settled in one, two, three or four years.  The Government are also satisfied that the problem is one that cannot be solved by the expenditure of State money in the way in which State moneys are being expended now&mdash;at any rate, comparing the return got for the expenditure of State moneys with the moneys being expended now, the problem cannot be solved in that particular way. Senator Farren suggested that the President made a statement to the effect that the Government will not in future, in any year, expend as much as £200,000 on housing.  I doubt if the Senator could quote that particular statement.  At any rate, I think he would find that it was taken from its context.  The position is that to expend £200,000 a year in respect of the general return that is being got for the money that is being expended now is not a policy that the Government would be prepared to continue.</P>

      <P>I will quote the President's own words.  They will be found at page 1148 of the Dáil Official Reports for 31st October last.

      <P>I suggest that statement was made in the way of a certain amount of conversation rather than in debate.  I suggest that the President's statement, in fact, was that the Government are not prepared to put up the same money per house and the same money per room as they have been putting up under the 1924, 1925 <Col N="1377" /> and the 1926 Acts.

      <P>Any new proposals must bear on the face of them the conviction by the Executive Council that they cannot continue to contribute the same amount of money per house or per room as they have been contributing, and that to do so would be to do something which so far from helping to solve the housing problem might make the problem a bigger one than it is.  Questions were raised by some Senators as to criticisms by one person or another of people engaged in the building trade.  All that I can say at the moment is that the proposals the Government will be prepared to put before the Oireachtas in regard to their housing policy must bear on the face of them the conviction by the Executive Council that the cost of house building at the present moment is too high, and I think that statements made here by some Senators will bear out the conviction of the Executive Council in that particular matter.  The condition of tenements and of the slums in Dublin has been raised.  The very fact that Senators have been emphasising that point must make us look very much more than we have been doing in the past to the financial side of this question and the value that we are getting for the money that is being expended.</P>

      <P>I say the saving of human life is more important than the question of finance.  The children that inhabit these houses have no chance in comparison with children in other districts. If the Minister asks for a return of the deaths in the slums amongst children and amongst the children of people who live in Merrion Square and compare it, he will soon see the difference between the conditions of children in the slums and those in Merrion Square.</P>

      <P>The Senator apparently was not prepared to shock his colleagues, or indeed any of us, by a statement of the facts as seen in the slums of Dublin.  I am quite prepared to say there are many Senators who <Col N="1378" /> know the facts of the conditions in the city to-day.  The problem of housing cannot be solved either by mentioning this or that particular instance, or saying: &ldquo;I could mention terrible instances.&rdquo; The problem of the tenements can only be solved by getting down to facts and figures, and to the finances and cost of building generally. I think it would be undesirable that our judgment should be warped or strained by any unnecessary labouring of the conditions that exist.  If we may not know to the last decimal point the suffering and ignominy that is there, we know sufficient about it to realise that there is a problem there and that when we talk about housing and the solution of the housing problem, we are driven, if you like, by a conception of what exists in some of these places, to say that expenditure along the lines that was absolutely necessary is not going to do what Senators who touch upon the problem would desire to see done there.  A consideration of the conditions that exist, in some very bad parts of the city, and in some very bad parts of the urban areas, are amongst those things that must drive the Executive Council, in considering these matters, to base its fresh housing proposal on a clear understanding that that problem cannot be solved except they get a better general return in respect of State moneys than what they have been able to get up to the present.  There have been reasons why that could not be got under the present Housing Acts. These considerations, I suggest to Senators, do not serve any good purpose by cutting across the discussion of the present Bill.  The present Bill makes provision for the allocation of an adequate amount of money in respect of a pretty considerable number of houses, and in respect of commitments that had been entered into as a kind of tail to the operation of the previous Housing Acts.  They mark a very definite stopping of the policy that existed ever since 1924.  I would just repudiate, also, the suggestion that certain Senators have made, that the Government, in making up its housing policy, has been acting in a piece-meal way.  I think the Acts that the Executive Council have instituted since 1924, and if you like, since 1922, show on <Col N="1379" /> the face of them a consistent and continuous policy.  It is only shutting our eyes to the existence of the problem, or trying to do so, for anyone to suggest that because only a limited amount of money is made available for one, two, three or four years, that is dealing with the matter in a piece-meal way.  There is a continuous problem to be dealt with, and we have dealt with it in a continuous way.  But it would not solve the housing problem if under the terms of the 1924 Act a sufficient amount of money had been made available to continue operations under the 1924 and 1925 Acts, say, for 10 years further.  It would be getting us deeper into a state of financial indebtedness without solving the housing problem.</P>

      <P>In section 5.  To delete the words and figures &ldquo;18th day of October, 1929,&rdquo; wherever they occur in the section, and to substitute therefor the words and figures &ldquo;31st day of March, 1930.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is really to make the Bill consistent with the amendment that was introduced while the Bill was passing through the other House.  The Bill as introduced made a grant available for houses that were started before 17th October of the present year and that would be completed not later than the 18th October, 1929.  On the Report Stage an amendment was inserted extending the time when houses might be started from the 17th October this year to the 1st April of the new year, but the other House made no provision for any extension of the period within which the house might be completed.  The result is that houses started on the 31st March next have got to be completed in less than six and a half months in order that the full grant may be got without any deduction from it.  That is really too short a period in normal circumstances to allow for the completion of a house from the time it was started, even in the case of private speculators.  It has been represented to me that in the case <Col N="1383" /> of public authorities the difficulties are sometimes greater.</P>
    <P>Delays are greater owing to the number of regulations that have got to be complied with.  If there were a case for a year between the commencement and the completion of the houses under the Bill as introduced there seems to me to be an equally strong case for allowing a similar period under the new conditions. If the Minister would agree to extend the period to the 31st December it would, I think, meet the case but I am trying to make it consistent with the original principle of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was considered when we were dealing with the extension of the time for the last day of commencing.  It was decided that there was nothing inconsistent with the position.  First there is no condition attaching to houses being put up by local authorities with regard to the final day for completion. They can be completed at any time. Once plans have been agreed to and the money has been allocated local authorities are not hurried in any way, so we are only concerned with private persons, and in so far as private persons are concerned, if there is no money available to be allocated in, say, February next, a private person cannot get any portion of this £250,000 because they cannot be allotted money that is not available for them.  So the extension of facilities for the date for the commencement of the houses to the 1st April, 1929, is simply to give the fullest possible advantage that persons can be given inside the limits of the amount of money available.  Persons cannot expect that this can go on from year to year.  If some money is available and a grant is made to persons before the 1st April they must have their houses finished by the 17th April, but the Minister has power under the Act to extend it for four months, that is until the 17th August, 1930, on full consideration of all the facts.  If the Senator would be satisfied with an extension to the 31st December, as he says, there is power under the Act to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to call attention to three or four points in this Bill, and I am doing so not so much for the purpose of criticism as for the purpose of getting information.  For that reason I sent a notice to the Minister, not only saying that I was moving, but explaining my reasons for doing so, in order that he might be fully prepared to give reasons.  He will have had an opportunity to look <Col N="1385" /> into the matter.  I wish now to inform the House of what I have already communicated to the Minister.  The four points I propose to touch on are the railways, the local loans, the Dublin sites and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>All these, I believe, are in the Appropriation Accounts, although I missed any reference to one of them.  I presume it must be enclosed in some other, so that one does not recognise it.  It has been hitherto in all the Appropriation Accounts.  One of these, the local loans, was mentioned in the Ultimate Settlement; the others are not mentioned in the Ultimate Settlement. At all events, they were not mentioned in any of the legal documents, but were found in the British White Paper. I do not know why the others were not mentioned in that document, but apparently they were not.  The Minister contented himself by stating certain facts and not explaining them.  Also, as far as I could see, he avoided giving any reasons why those charges should be made.  So much so that when a Seanad Committee was proposed to examine the question and see whether they ought to be charged, he objected to it, and it was, in consequence of his objection, defeated by the casting vote of the Chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view I take of our financial relations with Britain is that in the Treaty there were two clauses dealing with finance only.  One was Clause 5, which dealt mainly with the National Debt and pensions of soldiers in the war.  Section 10 dealt with pensions of police and officials.  Section 10 is still part of the Agreement, and I am not going to question it at present in any way.  Clause 5 has been repealed.  My view is, if no financial arrangements have been made in the Treaty at all there might, no doubt, have been a number of questions raised between the countries, but when two very far-reaching clauses of that sort dealing with enormous sums of money for which this country would be liable, they, by implication, kept out any other claims.  I do not say that there might not be some small adjustment necessary, but any large claims should be excluded, and I cannot see any justification for paying money not included <Col N="1386" /> in those two clauses.  None of the items I am calling attention to can be included under Article X, because that only deals with officials and police. According to my opinion, therefore, we should pay nothing except what came under that particular Article X.  It is quite clear that none of these items I mentioned come under Article X at all.</P>
    <P>Another financial arrangement was made in December, 1925, by which Article 5 was cancelled, and instead of that the Oireachtas decided to pay £5,000,000 in one sum, or divide it over a certain number of years.  Also, there were payments for destruction, and 10 per cent. was added for reparation. Those, as far as I know, are the only public arrangements that have been made of a financial nature, yet none of these items I mentioned come under these, either under the Treaty or under the Treaty Agreement. I think the Minister might explain why these things come under it.  I may say if they came under the Public Debt they were cancelled.  If they did not come under the Public Debt, or under Clause X., they should not be charged. We had no liability for these.</P>
    <P>Going into the different points, I will first take the railways.  In the Railways Act it is mentioned in all the books of the Appropriation Act of previous years that the sums allotted there are for payment of National Debt advances from the Commissioners for railways. Where does that come in?  It does not come under Clause X. or Clause 5, or, if it does come under Clause 5, it is wiped out.  I do not know whether any such arrangement under statute can be brought forward.</P>
    <P>Local Loans are definitely stated in the Schedule of the 1920 Act to be part of the National Debt, and are therefore wiped out.  I do not know why they are being included in this, or ever have been included since 1925. I cannot find the Dublin sites in the present list, but I presume it must be somewhere, because it has been in all previous ones, and in the books of the Appopriation Act, so I presume it is concealed under some other head.  I may remark here that, in all the previous Appopriation Acts, it is stated that money for the railways came from <Col N="1387" /> the National Debt Commissioners, but it is skilfully avoided this year.  The National Debt question is embarrassing, and not mentioned.  In regard to the Dublin sites, I presume they are the offices in Merrion Street.  It does not say which, but, as far as I know, we are paying annuities on them also.  They do not come under any of these three heads&mdash;the Treaty, 1921, Treaty of Agreement, 1925, or Ultimate Settlement.  I would like to ask the Minister where has he got that except by negotiations contrary to the statute and contrary to the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Every Government has in its hands large sums of money drawn from the Savings Bank and other sources.  They use that money very properly by lending it out for various purposes through the different Departments.  They become manager on the one hand and debtor on the other.  I expect that the money for these buildings was probably Irish money which was in the hands of the Government, either in the Savings Bank or in other holdings, because in Ireland there was a certain amount in the Savings Bank.  Of course, that must have been in the hands of the British Government at that time.  They took with one hand and lent with the other to re-build these places.  Yet we are expected to pay back the British Government money that was Irish money.  The Telegraph Acts come on in the same way.  While all these moneys were being handed out no claim was made for like sums from the British Government.  All was given to the British Government, and nothing was got in exchange.  I will not lecture on the matter, but I want to get some information from the Minister and some reason for this state of affairs.  I may say that it has not been, in my opinion, any great advantage for Ministers to keep these matters as secret as they did.  It has been used all over the country against them&mdash;and I used it myself to emphasise my criticism of the Government&mdash;that all these matters were kept as secret as they could be kept.  It has certainly done neither the Minister nor his Party any good to have these things said through the country.  They will be said again if <Col N="1388" /> explanations are not forthcoming.  A proposal to have the matter investigated was supported by about half the Seanad, but it was not passed, because the Minister said he would not attend and would not give any explanation.  I would ask the Minister when making a statement to tell us as much as he can about these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one item in the Bill dealing with appropriations and grants that I would like the Minister to inform us about.  Part I of the Appropriation Account deals with the year ended 31st March, 1928.  We are only dealing with that period now.  I daresay certain delays occurred, but it seems extraordinary that the accounts should come on at this time.  Another item in the Bill is for the salaries and expenses of the staff of the Irish Land Commission&mdash;£35,000.  Surely, in the ordinary appropriations the salaries and expenses of the office of the Irish Land Commission, as well as grants, were calculated in the total amount asked for in March, 1928.  How is it that our attention is only called to this £35,000 now?  We should have information also about the £39,000 for disability pensions, and about a contribution of £150,000 for the relief of unemployment. How do these items come before the House now in an Appropriation Bill dealing with accounts for March, 1928?  I suppose there is a reason for it, but it seems rather strange to bring these items before us now.  Part II. of the same Account deals with twenty-one millions of money.  This Bill is brought before the Seanad to discuss now, although we have only to-day and to-morrow to look into it.  It is hardly worth saying a word about it, good, bad or indifferent, by way of criticism or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say to the Minister that on looking over the salaries and expenses of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs I see that it amounts to nearly £2,400,000.  The Minister will remember that in his Budget he raised the cost of sending telegrams from 1/- to 1/6. I would like to know how much money the Minister made out of that increase. It is a crippling charge on Irish trade to charge 1/6 instead of 1/- for telegrams. <Col N="1389" /> In the British Post Office one is charged 1/6 for sending a telegram to the Irish Free State, so that the British Government is probably making a fair amount of money out of Free State citizens, because the Ministry here wishes to make 6d. extra on telegrams. It is bad enough to have to pay 2d. on letters that can be sent in Great Britain for 1½d.  I believe that is largely due to the enlarged Post Office facilities that were given in the days of the British Government, and that they were based on what Great Britain and Ireland could afford.  It is probably too expensive a service for this State to bear now.  It is likely that the Minister cannot give up that charge.  It costs 6d. more to send a telegram to the Irish Free State than to Belfast.  There must be a great deal of revenue in it to make it worth while continuing it.  I may say that it creates a very false impression on the other side of the Channel that we should be subject to this special charge.  People there say that, as we have to pay 2d. on our letters and 1/6 for our telegrams, this must be an expensive country to come to and an expensive country to deal with.  I am only drawing the Minister's attention to the matter so that he will be able to consider it before next March.  I think if it were at all possible we should do away with these annoying little things that give us a bad reputation across the water.</P>

      <P>The Minister's attention was called last year to the outstanding case of 18 Beresford Place, which was destroyed in 1916 and for which no compensation has been paid. The Minister undertook to look into the matter, and said that if it were found that there was no case comparable with the destruction of what was known as &ldquo;Liberty Hall&rdquo; he would sympathetically consider the payment of compensation.  Everybody knows that &ldquo;Liberty Hall&rdquo; was destroyed because it was the headquarters of the Insurrection of 1916. Other claims were paid by various Commissions that were set up to award compensation.  In every case where a claim was made to a Commission set up under the British régime <Col N="1390" /> it was pointed out that the people associated with Liberty Hall were connected with the Insurrection and that, therefore, they were not entitled to any compensation.  Liberty Hall is an outstanding case, and the Minister must admit that if any case was entitled to compensation it should have been one of the first.  It may be said that there was delay about the claim, but in view of the activities that went on since 1924 there was not much opportunity for putting the matter before the Minister for Finance in a proper way. It was raised last year and the Minister agreed to look into it.  We understand that he discovered there were fourteen or fifteen other claims, which were much smaller, and that the bulk of them would not amount to a sum that should be allowed Liberty Hall as a fair award.  For that reason the Minister was not prepared to go into the question.  I would like to put it to the Minister that he should get this matter off his conscience, as he, as well as everybody else, must realise that Liberty Hall would not have been blown down, and possibly this State would not have been set up, if Liberty Hall were not the centre of the revolution that took place.  I put it to the Minister that he should examine the matter again with a view to giving compensation where it should properly be paid.</P>

      <P>I am not sure that Senator Moore is simply looking for information and enlightenment.  If he were, I think he could have found a great deal more in the public documents than he seems to have found.  I would be very much inclined to let him explore them until he is better informed than he is.  I will say one word in reference to his remarks.  The Senator quoted two Clauses of the Treaty which referred to financial matters.  It is at once obvious to anyone who will look at them that they do not by any means cover the financial questions that have to be dealt with.  Very important settlements had to be arrived at; the whole arrangements about Departmental property and Departmental liabilities, special funds, our share of the Road Fund, the disposition of the <Col N="1391" /> Church Temporalities Fund, the question of arrears of taxes which had become due to the British Exchequer&mdash;which were in that sense a property of the British Exchequer&mdash;the question of the duty on beer which had been sent to England and consumed, and which really, at the taking over of financial control, gave us one million pounds net.  All these things are not at all covered by the Treaty.  Special negotiations had to be carried out to deal with them.  They were dealt with on a certain basis, the principle of which the Senator, if he chooses, could have traced under the heading of &ldquo;Working Arrangements,&rdquo; which were fixed in 1922 in the Transfer of Functions Order issued in March, 1922, and, I think, in special Clause of the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to enter into a disputation with the Senator. A general arrangement was entered into, and no other arrangement was possible whereby, if we took over Departmental property, we took over Departmental liabilities.  The question of the telephones is a case in point. We received the telephones, but we had no title unless we took the liability which attached to them.  In the case of the railways, apart from a general bargain which gave us, as I indicated, very advantageous results, it meant that there was about six million pounds revenue to which our claim was not very good, but, on the other hand, which the British Government might have very great difficulty in collecting. They could not have collected it in full. Some of it they could have collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the railways are concerned the arrangement come to to pay these annuities was part of the general agreement.  It was really advantageous to us.  To illustrate how little the Senator seems to have gone into the matter I will recall to the Senator his questions with references to the annuities in respect of the Government buildings.  He said that these buildings were probably built with sums <Col N="1392" /> advanced out of the Post Office Savings Bank funds, and he proceeds to say that these funds in the Post Office Savings Bank were partly Irish funds, and why should we now be paying the British Government?  Of course the position is, in so far as that particular point is concerned, that the British Government has to repay to the Irish depositors the funds advanced out of the Post Office Savings Bank money for these buildings.  The money had to be got back in order to repay the depositors.  Dealing with the question of local loans, this matter has been gone into to some extent before.  It crops up every year, and it is not worth while spending a good deal of time in dealing with the position regarding the Local Loans Fund. Local authorities borrowed money from the Local Loans Fund, and the authorities that borrowed that money undertook to repay it.  Nothing that happened in connection with the change of Government freed the local body from responsibility for making repayment.  Unless the British Government transferred the rights of the Local Loans Fund in the matter to us, we acquired no right to get that repayment from the local authority, because the Local Loans Stock was issued for providing capital for the local loans.  Money was lent out to the local authorities and they paid interest and sinking fund.  The interest went to pay a dividend to those who held the Local Loans Stock, and the repayment went to replenish again the Local Loans Funds.  So far as the Treaty was concerned, it made no change in the position.  The local authorities have borrowed from the Local Loans Fund, and they were still due to repay to the Local Loans Fund. If no further agreement had been made the position might have been that until these loans were repaid the Local Loans Fund would be recoverable from the local authorities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with it.  I am really not replying to the Senator very much.  If no further arrangement had been made, the position would be that until the debt would <Col N="1393" /> have been paid the Local Loans Fund would have continued to collect.  It would not be desirable that you should have a Department of the British Government actually collecting here, and the first arrangement made was that we would collect and repay, deducting the cost of collection.  Subsequently we made an arrangement whereby we pay an annuity of £600,000 a year for 20 years.  That arrangement will give us ultimately a substantial share of the Local Loans Fund.  For the first ten years we will collect substantially more than is required to pay the £600,000.  For the remaining ten years we will collect less than is required to pay.  The payments will continue very heavily for another ten or twelve years into our Exchequer, and in addition to that the final payment in respect of the loans will not be made until the year 2000.  Senator Jameson asked why we had not on Part I. of the Schedule items referring to the year ending on the 31st March last.  The position is that there is only one Appropriation Bill in the year.  What happened last March was that we voted any supplementary sums that were required by the Departments, and we also got a Vote on Account for the services for the present year, and before the 31st March, the Finance Bill, to which no schedule was attached, was passed for the purpose of getting authority to issue these sums out of the Central Fund.  Then another Central Fund Bill was passed.  Now we are taking the final instalment of the amount required for the present year, and are appropriating the various services in this Appropriation Bill and the sums that have been voted since the last Appropriation Bill.  The usual practice would be to discuss any items which had been the subject of supplementary estimates, but it would have been impossible to do so on the Finance Bill last March.  If any further sums are required for any Department they will have to be included in the Finance Bill, which has to be passed before the 31st March.  It will be possible to raise them in reference to matters such as the Post Office, charges for telegrams and letters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real difficulty here is the sparsity of population.  The position is, as the Senator is well aware, that in <Col N="1394" /> England, with the 1½d. post, it is possible to make a profit.  Here, I suppose, we do make a profit on letters. The main item of revenue is letter postage, and, in spite of the fact that it is 2d., we cannot make the Post Office pay its own way.  Of course if we had never been connected with the British Post Office, and if we had not some of the services now in existence, and which cannot very well be taken away, we might make the Post Office meet its outgoings; but it is difficult to see how more than that can be done as long as there is a sparse population. It may be taken that it is impossible unless there is going to be substantial contributions from the Exchequer for the Post Office to have charges as low as in England.  I am always desirous of having the Post Office pay its own way, for the reason that by that means we have some standard for our services. If we are paying a contribution of £400,000 a year, it is difficult to say that in order to increase the facilities we should not contribute £450,000 or £500,000 a year.  We are always urged, even by people who are crying out for economy, to open new telephone exchanges, and to give extra deliveries of letters, and all that sort of thing. In my opinion the best and the most comfortable position would be for the Post Office to pay its own way, and, if the receipts permitted, new facilities should be given, but that if they did not there should be no increased facilities. As far as telegrams are concerned, the case I made at the time the increase was agreed to was that there was a distinct loss of money on telegrams, and there seemed to be no reason why a man in Connemara or in the Dublin slums, who never sends or receives a telegram, should be paying his share any more than could be avoided of the £120,000 a year that was being lost on maintaining the telegraph service at the rate of charges that were before that in existence.</P>
    <P>It may be the subject of unfavourable comment outside, but it is one of the things people have to recognise, that if you have a small country with a sparse population, it is unreasonable to expect postal facilities at the rates they have in big countries, where the postman can carry 600 letters in place <Col N="1395" /> of the 6 a postman may be carrying here.  I do not see any way out of that difficulty.  With reference to the point Senator Foran raised, I believe that if application had been made for the payment of compensation, as it might well have been, in 1922 or 1923, that payment would not have been refused. Also, I am quite clear about this matter, that, if there were no other cases.  I would not hesitate to make payment in the Liberty Hall case even now. The difficulty is, that while we might consider the Liberty Hall case and ascertain the amount to be paid, if the Liberty Hall case were allowed in now, in other cases it would be extremely difficult to investigate and to determine the amount; and, if we open the door in the Liberty Hall case, we might have to open the door in cases we never heard of.  If Senator Foran's union had come forward in 1922, when only half the time that has elapsed now had elapsed, an investigation would have been easier than at present.  We would have had an interval of only six years then, and in their case we should have had a fair chance of being able to conduct an investigation; but, when twelve years have elapsed, the position is somewhat altered.  I do not deny that there is force in the argument of Senator Foran, but I think there is a certain blame attached to those he represents for not making their claim in some sort of reasonable time.  It is a really extraordinary thing that during the three or four years in which Senator Foran's union might have made a claim, and when the whole country were making claims, they allowed that time to elapse without putting forward their own particular case.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to have missed my point about the telegrams. As for the twopenny stamp, I admit that I did not raise any argument about that.  What I did say about telegrams was that while a charge of one and sixpence was put on here, that there is also made in England a charge of one and sixpence on telegrams sent to the Free State.  The British Government is making money out of us as well as our own Government.  A letter sent from England has only a three-half-penny stamp on it, but on telegrams coming from Great Britain to the Free State there is a charge of one and sixpence. That is a decided handicap upon the trade that is carried on between the Free State and England.  I have no doubt now that the matter has been brought to the Minister's notice he will look into it before he frames his next Budget.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that the Minister has felt the criticisms levelled at him down the country, and I expect he will feel more of them later on.  He did wave aside what I said about the Local Loans being part of the National Debt.  And when he was speaking he said he was not replying to me.  He was replying to me but he would not like to admit that he was replying to me.  On his part, it was a little bit of pride, I suppose. However, as a matter of fact, by the repeal or cancellation of Article 5 of the Treaty, the Saorstát was relieved from any portion of the National Debt. I think the Minister himself will hardly go so far as to deny that. What is part of the National Debt is another question.  The National Debt is described in the Act of 1920; in the Schedule to that Act the details are laid down and one of the things in the Schedule is that the Irish Local Loans Fund is part of the National Debt.</P>

The railway companies have a superannuation fund and they are contributory funds, and <Col N="1400" /> at one time the railway companies managed those funds themselves.  But the employees blocked many of their Private Bills in Parliament, until such time as Parliament insisted upon the companies giving the contributor a right to representation on the fund, seeing that they were contributing 50 per cent.

In other words, a free zone is an isolated, enclosed or policed area in or adjacent to a port of entry without resident population, and furnished with the necessary facilities for loading and unloading, and having deep water facilities, docking accommodation and able to supply ships' fuels and stores, and with ample accommodation for <Col N="1402" /> storing and re-shipping goods by land, water or air; an area where goods may be not only landed, but also mixed, blended, re-packed and re-shipped to all parts of the world without payment of any duty whatsoever, and without the vexatious intervention of Customs officials, but subject at the same time of course to all other laws re health, ship inspection, labour questions, etc. These advantages are increasingly being availed of on the continent of Europe to the great advantage and expansion of trade, as is well known here in Dublin in the Government offices.  I submit that the Government should seriously take into their consideration the establishment of such a free port and free zone in our country.  Public bodies, by resolutions galore, deputations, letters to the Press, etc., have, especially in the South of Ireland, drawn attention to the magnificent site suitable for this purpose in Cork Harbour. I allude to the island of Haulbowline and the adjacent islands and land connected therewith.  It is a melancholy contrast &mdash; the state of things in Cork Harbour compared with what existed under the British régime &mdash;I refer to the derelict state of the place.  The Ministers have expressed sympathy.  We have heard Senator Farren allude to the sympathy expressed with regard to the housing question, but there it ended.  Sympathy does not count much without some practical assistance.  The Minister indicated in the Dáil that he had communicated with some eminent firms, such as that of Messrs. Henry Ford and Son and others, with regard to the disposal of this place.  He suggested that they proposed advertising the letting of it on easy terms and giving it to someone who would utilise it in time to come.  I submit that that is placing not only the Government itself but the whole country in a most humiliating position.</P>
    <P>When the Port and Harbours Tribunal sat in Cork during the present year, evidence was given on this very question by Mr. J.J. Horgan, who had been Chairman of the Cork Harbour Board.  His evidence was most convincing as to the desirability of utilising Cork Harbour for this purpose.  I submit that Cork Harbour is the most <Col N="1403" /> suitable port in Ireland for this purpose. Mr. Horgan's evidence met with the warm approval and endorsement of other public bodies.  The Chairman and members of the Cobh Urban Council have encouraged me to support the proposal most warmly as well as other public men in the South of Ireland.  No statement has yet been made by the Government as to what they propose doing, though the Port and Harbours Tribunal held a sitting in Cork so long ago as the beginning of this year.  Perhaps the Government is waiting for the Report of that Commission which, I believe, is still sitting. I know that it has had a very big task namely, to examine into the affairs of 22 ports in the country.  I believe that the members of the Commission are at present in England.  To contrast the position to-day with what it was some years ago, you have only a mere handful of people employed on the island at Haulbowline at the present time. The Government are spending no less than over £20,000 a year on its upkeep. Under the British régime and in prewar years there were from 1,400 to 1,500 hands continuously employed there.  During the war there over 3,000 people there, the expenditure in wages alone being over £150,000 a year.  All that is now lost to Cobh.  The people are without employment and are going about the streets in a semi-starved condition.</P>
    <P>National freedom is all very well.  I venture to say that every member of the House is pleased that the Free State Government is functioning; but I think it should be accompanied also by some evidence of practical sympathy by granting a searching inquiry into the feasibility of this proposal. Everyone who has been to Cork Harbour must have been struck by the fact that Haulbowline would make an ideal site for the purpose named in this motion.  It is completely shut off from the mainland.  No matter how stringent the tariff conditions on the mainland may be, Haulbowline itself would be easy to protect.  The site is on the principal trade route between Europe and North and South America.  It is approachable at all tides and times. <Col N="1404" /> There is fine equipment there in the way of lighted buoys, with every modern appliance for a harbour of the kind.  It is in possession of a dry dock, with spacious storage accommodation and housing for its officials, etc. Notwithstanding all these facts, unless the Government is pressed by public opinion on the matter perhaps nothing will be done.  I think it is incumbent on everyone to endeavour to wake them up from their lethargy and indifference to face the facts, and to face what other countries are doing.  So far Great Britain has no such free port or free zone. I was making minute enquiries into the matter, and I venture to think that before very long we shall hear of something being done in that country.  We know that trade at Hamburg and Copenhagen is rapidly extending.  They are becoming great distributing centres. Norway, not to be outdone, has now opened Oslo.  Sweden and other places are following suit, as well as Esthonia, one of the new Russian republics, and Finland.  France in 1922 laid the foundations of a new harbour at Algiers to supply a free zone for Northern Africa.  Then that well-known character, Mussolini, whom some admire and others do not, has made the port at Genoa, which was formerly a very insignificant one, one of the most important ports in the Mediterranean.  It has now a free zone.  The United States, with all its potential wealth, has urgent need for expansion, but it is hindered to some extent by vexatious tariffs, in Europe.  I have consulted the staff of the freight department of the firm of Messrs.  Henry Ford and Son.  They warmly approve of such a proposal as I am now making.  They think it would be an ideal thing for the South of Ireland.  That information was given to me unofficially.</P>
    <P>They fervently hope that something will be done in the direction I have indicated.  Seeing that our country is advancing, as we thankfully believe it is, something, I suggest, ought to be done in connection with this matter. We rejoice at the statements made at the representative function held in Dublin last night which you, sir, attended. The statement made by his Excellency the Governor-General confirms the fact that our country is advancing. <Col N="1405" /> The Governor-General said: &ldquo;I claim that our economic ship is making steady headway towards the port of national prosperity.  Ships must take account of rocks and winds and currents.  I know of no rock ahead. There is none on the chart.  The sea is open.  To overcome the winds and currents we have courage and endurance to spare.&rdquo;  Let the Ministers exercise that courage.  They have shown wonderful courage in launching the Shannon scheme and in establishing the sugar factory and other enterprises. Surely, therefore, they should not fear to take further steps towards attracting shipping, commerce and the air service of the whole world to the great free port in the South of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we separate to-day there is a matter to which I should like to refer, a matter of national and historical importance. Seanad Eireann has now completed the sixth year of its life. Six years ago we assembled in a room in the National Museum, as one of the Houses of the first really free Parliament that had assembled in Ireland since the Normans landed on our shores.  Previous Irish Parliaments had asserted their freedom, but even in Grattan's Parliament that freedom was to some extent illusory.  When we met in 1922 we met as a free House of a free Parliament, and even though we do not legislate for the whole territory with the four seas of Erin, we stand as an integral part of the first unfettered Government Ireland has known since the landing of Strongbow.</P>
      <P>Our first duty was to elect a Chairman to preside over our deliberations, and we elected to that position Lord Glenavy.  Ever since that day he has occupied the Chair at our meetings. No chairman could have been more faithful in his attendance.  He has given such a lead to the deliberations of this House as only a man of his great experience in legal and parliamentary matters could have given.  When we look back on Lord Glenavy's career we see that he has occupied every legal position of first importance in the country. He has been in turn Attorney-General, Lord Chief Justice and Lord Chancellor, but I think he will not contradict me when I say that of all the positions he has held he will look back with most satisfaction to the one he now holds, and which he is shortly to relinquish&mdash;the first Cathaoirleach of the first Seanad Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking as I do now, to the assembly over which he has ably presided since its formation, and over which he will only for a few days longer preside, I think it is not necessary for me to elaborate my praise.  We have all seen his ability in the Chair, we have all had experience of his tact, of his wonderful rapidity of decision, of his great grasp of law.  He has left his mark on the legislation of our country. <Col N="1407" /> He has set a high standard for his successor to follow.</P>
    <P>There is one quality of his to which I should like to make special reference, and that is to his unfailing sense of humour.  Lord Glenavy has again and again been able, by a timely quip or sometimes even a particularly audacious pun, to turn wrath into laughter, and to leave friendship where strife was.</P>
    <P>We are an assembly of men of differing views; in some cases it is hardly untrue to say that our outlook is diametrically opposed.  Our Cathaoirleach is a man whose views have always been well known and forcibly and fearlessly expressed, but in this House we can say that, however opposed we may be in opinion, we are all friends.  I doubt if there is in the world a House of Parliament where there is so real a sense of unity and comradeship as in this Seanad, and if there is one man to whose conduct this goodwill is more due than to another, it is to our Cathaoirleach.</P>
    <P>He came in a time of storm.  When we first met, which of us knew, when he returned to his home, that he would not find that, instead of sitting at his cheerful hearth, he might warm his hands at his blazing roof tree.  Which of us knew that when he retired to rest he might not wake to sounds of war and death.  He leaves us in peace.  He leaves us, having learned that our differences can be settled by argument, and that our controversial artillery, if not infallible, is at least efficacious. But we must not forget that in accepting the post of Cathaoirleach, Lord Glenavy not only accepted the danger in which every member of the Seanad lived, but singled himself out for special attack.  I am glad to say that he did not suffer in person, but he did not hesitate to run the extra danger.</P>
    <P>This brings me to reflect that, besides our Cathaoirleach, there are others of our original members who are leaving us; men of distinction; men who have done honour to the nation in divers fields.  I shall not name them, but I think that we should, in our hearts, include them in the good wishes with which we speed our parting Chairman. They represent our literary, commercial and public life.  They, too, stood <Col N="1408" /> firm in 1922.  Some of them had to suffer in person and property losses which were irreparable, but not one of them flinched.  We hope that we shall have some of them with us in the new Seanad, but some we know we shall not have; they have decided to withdraw to private life; our thanks go out to them all.</P>
    <P>Our Cathaoirleach has decided not to seek re-election.  No man has worked harder than he; no man better deserves to rest; but I am sure that he will not lose interest in this House, in the formation of which he has had the greatest part.  He has guided us through the most difficult part of the journey, and has set us on a path.  In his retirement we may feel sure that his good counsel will be as generously available as it has always been to those who seek it.</P>
    <P>I therefore beg to move:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That at the conclusion of its Second Triennial period, Seanad Eireann desires to place on record its deep appreciation of the services of its first Cathaoirleach, the Right Hon. Lord Glenavy, upon the occasion of his retirement from the House.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very much pleasure in seconding the motion moved by Senator Bennett and in adding my testimony to the tribute so deservedly paid to Senator Lord Glenavy for his very capable chairmanship during the first six critical years of our new and inexperienced Assembly.  When we first met we had to contend with all the disadvantages that an Assembly meeting for the first time has to contend with, aggravated by political conditions outside of a very abnormal kind.  We were merely an assembly of people mostly unknown to each other, without Standing Orders or machinery of any kind, and without any previous Parliamentary traditions to guide us in our deliberations. We were faced with the task of formulating our Standing Orders, of creating the necessary machinery, and by our general conduct of public affairs of establishing an honourable Parliamentary tradition.  Taking all the circumstances of the times into account, I hope it is not too much to say that our efforts have been attended <Col N="1409" /> with a considerable amount of success. I can say, from intimate and personal knowledge, that a very great deal of that success has been due, particularly in the early and critical days of the infant Assembly, to the vast legal and Parliamentary experience and the great abilities of Senator Lord Glenavy.</P>
      <P>I have a vivid recollection of the early meetings of the Seanad, and the masterly and tactful manner in which he endeavoured to keep a very raw Assembly within at least the outward walls of the Standing Orders.  His task was by no means an easy one, particularly in the case of impetuous business Senators fresh from the disorders of directors' meetings.  Whenever any of these wayward innocents did manage to slip outside the pale his lasso was always long enough and strong enough to bring them back to the fold.  He has always been the able and fearless champion of the rights and privileges of this Assembly.  In this respect he has set an example which I hope his successor in office, whoever he may be, will firmly adhere to.</P>
      <P>No party affiliation or commitment and no expediency of Government or Opposition should influence by the least degree the mind or rulings of the Chair where the rights and privileges of the House or any of its members are concerned.  Although in no way interfering with the full and free discussion of all matters coming before the House, yet we have, under his chairmanship, earned for ourselves a rather unique and enviable reputation for being an Assembly of few words. Because of this distinction we have earned the jealousy and the envy of more verbose but less business-like institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many a Senator has had cause to thank the Chairman for having saved him from himself, by inducing him not to persist in an unwise or superfluous speech when silence was the most eloquent course to adopt.  For what he has saved the Seanad generally by his intervention on such occasions, we have very much to be truly grateful.  It will, as Senator Bennett has said, be a consolation to him, or, at least, a source <Col N="1410" /> of considerable satisfaction, to realise the distinction he enjoys as being the first Chairman of the first Seanad of the Saorstát.  The political and social condition of the country is very much different now to what it was when he first occupied the Chair.  As Senator Bennett has said, the Seanad first met amid the clash and tumult of civil war. Everything that made for public order, personal security and human progress seemed devoted to destruction.</P>
    <P>Barely six years have passed, but these have been years brimful of historic achievements, the most notable of which has been the elimination of national strife and the restoration of peace in the land.  Even though we are still, unfortunately, not immune from evils fairly common to most countries and peoples, such as unemployment, bad housing and so forth, it is a consolation to know that while Christmas of 1922 was marked by bloodshed, strife and considerable suffering, Christmas of 1928, whatever its drawbacks in other respects, will, at all events, be associated with the inestimable blessing of national peace.  The position is, therefore, very much happier on the occasion of Lord Glenavy's vacating the Chair than on the occasion when he first occupied it.  The tangible impulses of the nation are upwards and onwards to better days, and the Seanad has given the opportunity to almost all phases of public and economic thought to help on the infant State.  That is as it should be, and as it will be in the future if we are to act in the spirit of Parnell's dictum that Ireland cannot spare a single son.</P>
    <P>The Seanad, I am sure, unanimously thanks Senator Lord Glenavy for his unfailing courtesy, his splendid sense of humour, and for the capable and dignified manner in which he has presided over its deliberations for the past six years.  We wish him many happy days in which to enjoy his well-earned retirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add a few words to those already spoken by Senators Bennett and O'Farrell.  I had the privilege of being more closely associated with Lord Glenavy during the early days of the Seanad than perhaps any other member of the House. <Col N="1411" /> I did not make his acquaintance until we met in this House, and I would like to add to the category of his virtues, which has been already ably stated by Senator Bennett and Senator O'Farrell, his personal kindness.  I was a young man; I had the cheek often to quarrel with him, and I must have been a terrible nuisance.</P>
      <P>He treated me with every kind of kindness and forbearance.  I would like also to say, listening to the able address of Senator Bennett, and afterwards to Senator O'Farrell, that there is one other point I could possibly add to those referred to by them.  I think there is one, and that is that Lord Glenavy was always optimistic.  His speeches, right from the beginning of the Free State, were optimistic.  He was optimistic of the Seanad; he was optimistic of those of us who knew very little of Standing Orders and about Parliamentary procedure.  I am glad to see that last night again there was a note of optimism in a public speech he made with reference to this country.  I do not think there is any other man in Ireland who could get out of difficulties better than Lord Glenavy or anyone else who could have got us out of difficulties in the way he did.  On one occasion&mdash;I hope he will forgive me if I relate an anecdote&mdash;in the early days of the Seanad, owing to illness of a member of his family, he had to be absent for about a fortnight.  I deputised on a Committee for him, and agreed to certain proposals.  What they were are irrelevant to the story. When he came back he made one or two criticisms of the proposals to which I had already, in his name, agreed.  I felt, to say the least of it, nervous.  I made the best case I possibly could in excuse for my action, and said it might be rather awkward if anyone criticised these when they came before the House.  He said, &ldquo;My dear fellow, leave it to me.&rdquo;  As sure as anything a Senator did start on the very line of criticism, and you must guess my satisfaction to see my feeble arguments becoming mountains of arguments which convinced myself and the Seanad, and no one ever knew of my indiscretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not always agreed with Lord Glenavy.  I was politically opposed to <Col N="1412" /> him at the beginning, but this thing I can truthfully say, that whatever may have happened during the last six years, he has, as far as I am concerned, made a loyal friend, because of his personal kindness to me.  Senator Bennett said he thought there was a good deal of personal good feeling and courage. I think that was, in a fair measure, due to Lord Glenavy.  I believe it is absolutely essential to national progress that men and women should be able to fight even bitterly on political questions and retain personal respect for each other at the same time.  If we are able, with the loss of our Cathaoirleach, to continue with something of that spirit in this House, we certainly may have achieved something that we may be proud of, and which I know I will be proud of.  I have great pleasure in associating myself with the resolution proposed by Senator Bennett.</P>

      <NameTxt>Lord GLENAVY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean to pretend that I did not listen with feelings of very deep emotion to the splendid tribute of which I have been a recipient at the hands of my colleagues in this House.  When we assembled here six years ago, the first day we met, I say with all honesty and sincerity, that no man was more surprised than I was when some friends in the House said that they were going to put me forward for the Chair.  I did not expect it; I did not ask for it.  It had never been suggested, even up to that moment; and I did feel, in view of the fact that my political past was known to all of you, that it was a tribute at least to your belief in my honesty and sincerity of purpose and in your belief that throughout I was acting under the firm conviction that I was doing my best for the welfare of our beloved and native land.  I was appointed to the office, and we did pass through a very trying period.  I did not escape the observations and attention of those <Col N="1413" /> who were watching us at that time. They paid me the compliment of at least six separate visits to my private house.  I should say this, that I do not believe that, at any time during any of these visits, there was any intention or desire to inflict any personal injury or outrage on myself.</P>
      <P>During my time of office I endeavoured to keep steadily before my mind three purposes; the first was to uphold the dignity and decorum of debate in accordance with the Standing Orders of this House; the next, subject to obedience to Standing Orders, to give the fullest and fairest opportunity for discussion and debate to every member of the House, and finally, to uphold with all my strength and power the rights, privileges and dignities of the House as a whole and each individual member of it.  If I have accomplished anything in that respect I am vain enough to think there was at least some measure of justice in the tribute paid to me so eloquently by my friend, Senator Bennett.  I have been looking through the records of this House, and I find on at least six occasions it became my duty as Chairman to protect this House from attempts that were made either to infringe upon the dignity and the privileges of the House or some member of it, or else to influence or persuade the House to act in a way that seemed to me to be in violation of our Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I carry away with me this personal pleasure and satisfaction, that while on some of these occasions, my determination and ruling excited some hostile criticism, in the end and ultimately I think it was agreed upon all sides that the course I had taken was right and in the best and truest interest of the House and of the Constitution.  I have not very much more to say, except to remind you that during all these six years on no single occasion has it ever been necessary for me as Chairman to invoke the powers I have had under the Standing Orders for dealing with disorder or discourtesy.  I think that is a great tribute to the House.  It is no tribute to me, but it is a great tribute to the desire on the part of every member of the House to conform to our Standing Orders, and above all to treat its Chairman with respect and <Col N="1414" /> courtesy.  As a consequence, though a stranger to many of you on the first day we met, I am now in the proud position of being able to say that I am a friend of each and all.  More than that, I say, with all sincerity, that it is not only a case of respect and regard, but of real and true affection that I entertain for each and every one of you.  I should certainly be very ungrateful if that were not the result of a constant and unvarying experience of kindness and courtesy, and ready and prompt submission to all my rulings.  On consideration of every circumstance of my position I am glad also to bring away with me the recollection that only on two occasions during those six years have I been absent from meetings of this House, and never at a single sitting did I leave during the course of business.  That I felt to be my duty during our probationary period.  I am quite certain and satisfied that will not be necessary for your future Chairman, but during these experimental years I thought it my duty to discharge it in that sense&mdash;to give the best of my ability to put our proceedings on a basis not only of decorum and dignity, but on a permanent basis of goodwill.  I therefore carry away with me in my retirement a deep sense of gratitude to every member of the House, and while not conscious of any decay of an intellectual kind, perhaps it is not amiss that I should say that, inevitably I get indications occasionally of possible physical decay, and therefore I think it wise that, in due and proper time&mdash; interrupted years of happiness and pleasure that I spent as your Chairman &mdash;that it was due not only to you, but also to myself, and to the fact of my advancing years, that I should leave the work to be carried on by some younger man.</P>
    <P>I only wish again, in thanking you one and all, to express my obligations to your efficient clerk and assistant clerk.  I cannot speak too highly of the services they rendered to me and to you, especially by Mr. O'Sullivan.  It was recently suggested to him that his office was a sinecure, but I may tell you the extraordinary thing about him is that he is always able to provide work <Col N="1415" /> for himself throughout office hours&mdash; work for your benefit, work in your interests, work that he himself had originated, and of which you will ultimately get your full share and benefit.  I am also very proud of the assistant clerk, because I was originally responsible for recommending his selection, first of all, as one of the staff of the Oireachtas, and finally in the position which he occupies to-day.  I do not think you could ask to be served by two more competent, more efficient and more courteous officials.</P>
    <P>I also want to express my acknowledgments to the various Ministers with whom I came in contact in the course of my duties.  I thought it my business &mdash;and I went out of my way&mdash;to consult their convenience in every possible way.  On the other hand they met me with the same considerate spirit, and I have nothing but gratitude to tender to them for the constant, friendly, and intimate relations that existed between us.  It is a hard thing to say farewell, but it has to be said, and in saying it I can only wish for each and all of you, under the new conditions in which you will meet at the close of this year&mdash;<Col N="1416" /> conditions novel, not only as regards the constitution of your House, but also by reason of your increased powers and responsibilities&mdash;that you will jealously guard and protect those new powers, and that you will give an example to all of us by administering them, not in the spirit of party, but in the interests of your country.  So long as you do that, you need never fear for the position and reputation of this Seanad.  I am very jealous of it, and I leave it with confidence in your hands and in the hands of my successor.  I thank you one and all for all you have said about me.  I wish you health, long life, and prosperity to each and all. Before concluding may I just add one note, and that is to say that I think I ought to refer to the extraordinary diligence with which the lady Senators attended our sittings.  They were an example in that respect to all of us, and also on many occasions were very useful and helpful in giving suggestions on matters connected with our social welfare.  It only remains for me to say good-bye; God bless you.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.55 p.m. until December 12th.</P>
