    <P>Question proposed: That this Bill be read a Second time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this as the most important Bill that has come before the Seanad since it was established. It deals consequentially with Articles 14 and 15 of the Treaty, but really in effect that arises only from the very drastic proposal to delete Articles 47 and 48 of the Constitution.  So as to get a clearer idea of what is proposed to be done perhaps, sir, you will permit me to read these two Articles of the Constitution.  Article 47 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Bill passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses may be suspended for a period of ninety days on the written demand of two-fifths of the members of Dáil Eireann or of a majority of the members of Seanad Eireann presented to the President of the Executive Council not later than seven days from the day on which such Bill shall have been so passed or deemed to have been so passed.  Such a Bill shall in accordance with regulations to be made by the Oireachtas be submitted by Referendum to the decision of the people if demanded before the expiration of the ninety days either by a resolution of Seanad Eireann assented to by three-fifths of the members of Seanad Eireann, or by a petition signed by not less than one-twentieth of the voters then on the register of voters, and the decision of the people by a majority of the votes recorded on such Referendum shall be conclusive. These provisions shall not apply to Money Bills or to such Bills as shall be declared by both Houses to be necessary for the immediate preservation <Col N="798" /> of the public peace, health or safety.</P>
    <P>Article 48 reads:</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas may provide for the Initiation by the people of proposals for laws or constitutional amendments. Should the Oireachtas fail to make such provision within two years, it shall on the petition of not less than seventy-five thousand voters on the register, of whom not more than fifteen thousand shall be voters in any one constituency, either make such provisions or submit the question to the people for decision in accordance with the ordinary regulations governing the Referendum.  Any legislation passed by the Oireachtas providing for such Initiation by the people shall provide (1) that such proposals may be initiated on a petition of fifty thousand voters on the register, (2) that if the Oireachtas rejects a proposal so initiated, it shall be submitted to the people for decision in accordance with the ordinary regulations governing the Referendum; and (3) that if the Oireachtas enacts a proposal so initiated, such enactment shall be subject to the provisions respecting ordinary legislation or amendments of the Constitution as the case may be.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to knock out these two Articles in the Constitution.  I would ask the House to consider how serious this proposal is.  If the people had the right of the Initiative and of the Referendum, would the Union ever have been passed?  That perhaps may be regarded as ancient history.  To come to a somewhat more modern instance&mdash;during the Great War the Government of Australia, under its Constitution, used the Referendum on the question as to the advisability of its people being conscripted or not.  The decision of the people was that they would not be conscripted.  More recently, I think it was in 1923, the Swiss people used the Referendum on the question of the capital levy.  I have little hesitation in saying that the result of the vote on the question of the capital levy in Switzerland settled that question for Europe.  The people in Switzerland decided in the negative <Col N="799" /> against that.  We often hear prominent politicians of various parties speaking in this country of ours about the will of the people.  Perhaps it might take some of the swelling out of the heads of these prominent politicians if they bore in mind that the first preference votes at two out of the last three general elections for both the prominent parties added together did not give fifty per cent. of the electors on the register.  The vast number of the voters were so sick of the ineptitude, the faction and party spirit of either one party or other that they would not go across the road to vote for them.  When we hear those alleged representatives of the people speaking for the people, and saying that the will of the people must prevail here, we find Bills put before us that, if passed, will absolutely prevent, on vital issues, the people having the chance of expressing their will on a question which will not be mixed up with a series of questions, but will be an <i>ad hoc</i> issue presented to them. Here is a proposal to take away that right from the people.  Not only that, but it is further proposed, lest the people, of their own volition, might initiate a scheme, the Constitution having provided machinery for so doing, to prevent them in advance from doing so.</P>
    <P>This Constitution was framed by a committee appointed by men&mdash;I think in saying this I am not saying anything but the truth&mdash;more or less in harmony with the views held by the present Executive Council.  I have no doubt that some of the members of the present Executive Council were members of the Executive Council that appointed the Commission which framed the Seanad.  That body was a fairly constituted body.  In fact, I think that three members of that Commission have since been selected for judicial office.  That is a fair example of the class, character and mind of the men who composed the Commission which drew up this Constitution.  While I have no doubt that any Constitution formulated, when put into working, is bound to reveal some points upon which it may be desirable and necessary to have it modified or altered, <Col N="800" /> still I protest that this is not the way to do it.</P>
    <P>I am not going to impute anything to the Government that is dishonourable, but they must know that the people up and down the country will inevitably say that these provisions of the Constitution were never proposed to be deleted until a party proposed to take advantage of one of them for its own purpose.  Then it will be said that the Government regarded that as awkward, and proposed to delete the power given in that Article of the Constitution.  I regard the Constitution on the whole as satisfactory.  I do hope and wish that it will be kept out of the range of party issues, and that, if any amendments to it be considered desirable or necessary, they will not be made by any party.  I do not propose to criticise this Bill further, but what I am now proposing is that the consideration of this Bill be postponed and that a Select Committee of members of the Dáil and Seanad be appointed to examine the Constitution and report what alterations, if any, are necessary.</P>

      <P>I second that motion.  I have only a few words to say on it or on the Bill itself.  I want to make my protest against the Bill and against the manner in which it has been put before the House.  The extraordinary statement added to it in the Dáil applies, I suppose, to this House.  On a former occasion when a Bill altering the Constitution was proposed in this House, I said that the Government of the time were nibbling at the Constitution. Now they have given up nibbling. They are gobbling up section by section of the Constitution as fast as ever they can.  Within the last few days they have brought forward I do not know how many Bills&mdash;I really have failed to keep count of them&mdash;to alter the Constitution. It is really hard to follow them.  Anyway they are making sweeping alterations in the Constitution for which they themselves were responsible, in a Constitution for the protection of which they have been imprisoning people all over the country within the last few years, shooting them and doing various other things which I did not approve of.  At all events, it shows that those who are prepared to do these sort of things ought not to be in such a hurry to alter the Constitution in this wholesale way, and especially without consulting the people.  Worse than that is the degrading of the Constitution by imposing measures on it in a way which I find it difficult to get a suitable word to describe.  It destroys the public morals and in fact the whole Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministers have made statements to the public which they must know are not true.  They have stated that this Bill, <Col N="802" /> if it is not passed, will produce a state of war or disturbance in this country. It is hard to understand how any people with any intelligence could possibly make such statements.  The Ministers know perfectly well that there would be no disturbance if the Bill is not passed.  There might be disturbance if it were passed.  I do not think there would.  In any case there would certainly be a great deal more if it is passed.  Might I ask, who is going to create this disturbance?  Is it the Independents, or is it the Fianna Fáil people who are opposed to the Bill? They are not likely to create a disturbance on account of it.  Is it the Labour Party, or is it the Sinn Fein Party?  All those parties are opposed to this Bill. Are they going to rush to arms and cause a disturbance in the country if it is not passed?  That would be a very extraordinary thing to do.</P>
    <P>Are Cumann na nGaedheal going to rush to arms if this Bill is not passed, or are the Independents going to do so? The Ministers know perfectly well that none of these things is going to happen. Yet, they deliberately go out and make a statement that this Bill must be passed or else that there is going to be a revolution.  For my part, I repudiate not only the proposals in the Bill, but the lie that is attached to it.  I agree with the proposal of Senator Dowdall that this Bill should be withdrawn and a Committee appointed to investigate the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="LEAS-CHATHAOIRLEACH LEAS-CHATHAOIRLEACH">

      <P>I propose taking first the amendment proposed by Senator Dowdall and seconded by Senator Moore, that the consideration of this Bill be postponed and that a Select Committee of the Dáil and Seanad be appointed to examine the Constitution and report what alterations, if any, are necessary. That is what is now being debated.</P>

      <P>In discussing it and the Bill one is at a disadvantage because of the line which the discussion took in another place.  The merits or <Col N="803" /> demerits of this series of Bills, I think, have been very largely alouded by a constant reference back to things which have passed into history, and by the attempts to arouse ancient feuds, and the bringing of these as a regular tide across the whole subject of the merits or demerits of the Bill.  That is unfortunately characteristic of probably all of us.  Political animosities die very slowly in Ireland, and even when they are buried they are likely to arise again if they get the slightest opportunity. It is unfortunate that this disposition to harbour ancient wrongs and feed on them is not the monopoly of any one section in the community. It is found in places where one might reasonably expect a more enlightened spirit.  It displayed itself very definitely in Dublin yesterday on the occasion of a certain noted event.  Buildings that are normally covered with bunting and flags on such festive days as Empire Day, Armistice Day and the King's birthday were strangely bare and unadorned yesterday.  Racial animosities and hatred, arising out of the Great War, seem unfortunately to have been too much for even such enlightened institutions as Trinity College and the Bank of Ireland when it comes to honouring the brave men of a non-English nationality on a great, unique, courageous and scientific achievement. The attitude of institutions of that kind, and the equally boorish attitude of similar institutions in the city, constitutes a petty-minded, futile attempt to insult brave men because of ancient hatreds and animosities, and will only result really in earning for the perpetrators of them the contempt and laughter of all decent minded people. When one finds that difficulty on the part of certain people who talk of tolerance and forgetfulness of ancient wrongs and so forth and who display that desire to harbour ancient animosities, one is not surprised at less educated people harping back to ancient feuds and trying to discuss their merits and demerits on every occasion such as a discussion on a Bill of this kind affords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes to remove from the Constitution two of its most important <Col N="804" /> provisions, the two provisions that perhaps were most debated during the Constitution debates in the Provisional Parliament.  What are the reasons for their removal at this particular time? It is true, of course, that all of us are six years older than we were in 1922, and those who originally conceived and voted for these proposals, to the extent that they have any political existence at all, profess to have grown six years wiser in the interval.  As a practical demonstration of their wisdom, they propose now to expunge from the Constitution two of the Articles that were blazoned forth as the brightest jewels in a model Constitution.  If they had acted as the result of some experience of the difficulties and the risks attached to the application of these Articles and the practical working of them, then we might understand the meaning and the necessity of this Bill; or, on the other hand, had the Bill been introduced as a result of careful consideration of the whole Constitution by a Committee representative of all parties which saw in these Articles risks and difficulties that should not be incurred, then also the necessity for the Bill could be appreciated, but neither of these things happened.  The Government are no wiser in this respect now, as a result of practical experience, than they were in 1922.  We shall be told probably, without any attempt to prove the statement, that the Initiative, for instance, has proved unworkable and a failure in other countries, but it is not because of anything that has happened since 1922 in any other country that this Bill is being brought forward.  Anything in the way of practical experience, as regards the working of the Initiative, that the Government may have to-day they also had when they brought in these two Articles first into the Constitution. They are, therefore, declaring that they were either knaves or fools in 1922 by their action to-day.</P>
    <P>The Bill, of course, as everyone knows, is only brought in because an attempt was made to put the machinery of the Initiative into operation.  It is simply because an attempt has been made to put it into operation for a purpose which does not meet with Government approval, that the whole <Col N="805" /> pitch prepared for the game is now to be disturbed.  I think in all the six years that have elapsed since the Constitution was first under discussion, the Government could not have chosen a more unfortunate time for the introduction of this Bill.  They waited until 90,000 signatures were collected, and an attempt made to present the petition, asking that the machinery giving effect to the Initiative should be brought into operation.  The absence of machinery for receiving the petition is pleaded as a reason for its refusal, and then they proceed to solve the whole problem by applying the axe to two of the most important Articles in the Constitution.  Whether they are desirable or not, they are at all events very important Articles, and on an issue such as this, without debating their merits or otherwise, they proceed to cut them right out of the Constitution. Surely this display of reckless contempt for the Constitution by the Government cannot possibly fail to have the most detrimental reactions in the case of any Government of the future that is prepared to subordinate the Constitution to the party expediency of the hour.  The immediate advantage gained will in all probability be heavily counterbalanced by the very undesirable reactions of the future.</P>
    <P>It would be infinitely better to have no written Constitution than to have a charter which has no substantial stability connected with it.  I do not say that the Constitution should be a cast iron instrument, but the Constitution here as elsewhere, is the fundamental law of the land, and it should be treated with the greatest possible respect by all constitutional parties, but above all by the party forming the Government in power.  If changes are found to be necessary they should only be made after careful consideration, and after due regard has been paid to the views of each of those parties who may form the Government of the future.  If each party in turn adds to or takes from the Constitution in order to meet the particular party expediency of that particular day, then the Constitution, instead of being the sheet anchor of the law of the land, will become a wretched weathercock <Col N="806" /> serving only to indicate the type of party in power at any particular time.</P>
    <P>The most serious proposal in the Bill in my opinion, is the proposal to remove the Referendum.  I, any more than the Government, have no experience of the application of the Initiative. I can quite conceive that formidable arguments can be advanced against it on the grounds that it is cumbersome, expensive and slow.  I can imagine that arguments can be advanced against it on the grounds that it can be abused, but on these latter grounds there could be only arguments of assumption, because it has not been tried, and we have yet to see whether it would be abused.  With regard to the question as to whether it is cumbersome or impracticable of application, no attempt has been made to explore the possibilities along these lines, and there again it is largely a question of assumption.  But as far as the Referendum is concerned, it must be admitted that it is a simple, effective, and democratic safeguard for the people in the last resort against unwise, unwanted or oppressive legislation. It certainly saved Australia from conscription during the Great War, and it has been shown that the Government of the day were in favour of passing legislation which was emphatically repudiated by the majority of electors when they got the opportunity of giving their views on a definite concrete issue.  In this country I believe that we shall require safeguards such as the Referendum in the future. if we are going to judge by the history of the past, even more than we shall require to urge on slow-moving Government Ministers.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, that every possible consideration should be given, if the House decides eventually to consider this Bill on its merits, to the question of trying to save the Referendum.  Nobody can say that that is fantastic imagination. It emanated in the brains of the present Executive Council to a large extent, and I would not say they are faddists. At all events, it has been applied in other countries.  It is the last entrenchment on which the people can fall back in the event of a Government which has lost the confidence of the people, but still having a fairly long <Col N="807" /> period of office, embarking on some unwanted, oppressive or unwise legislation.</P>
    <P>Under the existing Constitution, Article 47, the Referendum can be brought about by a resolution subscribed to by three-fifths of the members of the Seanad, or by a petition presented by not less than one-twentieth of the electors then on the register.  I would suggest that it is still possible to save at least the Referendum, if all else goes, by making it possible for three-fifths of the membership of the Seanad, and two-fifths of the membership of the Dáil, to hold up a Bill for a specified period and demand a Referendum.  I do not see why it should go in addition to the Initiative, because the arguments that apply in the case of one certainly do not apply in the case of the other, and they are probably being struck out only because they are more or less interwoven into the three Articles of the Constitution dealt with by this Bill.  I think it would be much better that the Bills should not be proceeded with now because of the passions it will arouse, and, worse still, because of the excuse it gives for future Governments to use their discretion in the mutilation of the Constitution.  In matters of this kind we in this House have a great responsibility and duty to discharge.  If there is any justification for a second chamber it is that it should act as a moderating influence in matters of this kind, and above all in matters affecting the fundamental law of the land, which is the Constitution.  The procedure of rushing this Bill at express speed through the Oireachtas is something that cannot be defended.  I hope that Senators will realise ordinary decencies and not allow that resolution if it comes on later to be carried through.  We are supposed to be a break on hasty and unnecessary legislation, which I contend this is, and if we have the opportunity of acting in that capacity now when the powers and constitution of the Seanad are the subject of furious debate in the other House, and we fail to discharge our responsibility, then I think we would stand self-condemned.</P>
    <P>Some people who support the present Government in almost the whole of <Col N="808" /> their policy seem satisfied that because they were returned on the last occasion they and all connected with them are going to live happy ever after. Unless this country is going to be different to every other country with Parliamentary institutions there will be a change of Government sooner or later. If the Seanad allows to rush through the Oireachtas while it has the power to retard the progress of measures of this kind, legislation which proceeds to hack up the Constitution, then if some other Government comes along, a detail of whose policy would be the elimination of the Seanad altogether, I do not think members of this House then, whoever they may be, will have any moral authority for holding up that legislation. Certainly they will have no moral support from the great body of the people, because they merely take the word of a Minister in a matter of this kind instead of using their own discretion and sense of the fitness of things in order to do the right thing in an important proposal of this kind.</P>
    <P>It will be argued that the great majority of the people do not know the first thing about the Initiative and less about the Referendum, and that they only heard of it when it was brought before their notice.  Surely the same thing might be said about a lot of Articles in the Constitution, and a lot of laws of the greatest importance to humanity in general, that the great bulk of the people knew nothing about them until they were brought to their notice on some particular occasion.  That is no reason why you should proceed to cut them out&mdash;because you think people are ignorant of them.  The arguments advanced in favour of this have been arguments not of reason but of expediency, and they are largely arguments of assumption as to what might happen. I can see nothing serious happening by holding up this Bill until a representative Committee has time to examine the Constitution.  There may be certain amendments necessary, or at least a case may be made for them in regard to the forthcoming Seanad elections.  I do not admit a necessity for any change, but I am prepared to admit there are people who can put up a very plausible case for an alteration of the Constitution in that respect.  I see no <Col N="809" /> case made.  A motion was carried in the Dáil refusing the petition presented until such time as the Oireachtas have made arrangements for the reception of the petition.  Hence the petition cannot be received until these arrangements are made.  There is no indication that they are going to be made.  Where is the danger of holding the Bill over?  Where is the necessity for rushing it?  Let us not shut our eyes to facts and pretend we can fool everybody by pretending there is a necessity for the Bill when there is no necessity.  If only on those grounds I would be compelled to vote against the Bill, and I hope the Seanad will take a similar course and support Senator Dowdall's motion.</P>

The fact is that the Senator spoke of these two Articles as the most important provisions in the Constitution.  If they are important we are entitled to examine how their importance has affected the country during the last five or six years.  On only one occasion during that period has one of these Articles been utilised, or attempted to be utilised.  On one occasion I got a petition from two-fifths of the members of the Dáil to hold up a Bill.  The matter ended in a compromise and it was not proceeded with.  We did not get the 50,000 signatures required, and the Bill has now become the law of the land.  In the other case where there has been an attempt to utilise the Initiative let us examine what it is that was attempted.  An international agreement between two countries was made the subject of the Initiative&mdash;that we were to take out of the Constitution one of the essential Articles of an international agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In no other country in the world <Col N="811" /> would such an attempt be made to weaken and alter by municipal law any part of an international agreement, and so the persons knew who were preparing and getting the petition signed for that purpose.  Furthermore, I do not stand, and never did stand, for being more than the servant of the people, but I am not the people's slave.  The people can if they like dismiss this Government and alter the entire representation of the Dáil, but the people have no right to insist that either I or any member of the Executive Council should carry out the policy of those who are fundamentally opposed to us in connection with the whole Constitution, and particularly the Initiative, by means of which they intend to alter the Constitution.</P>
    <P>One thing alone characterises the whole proceedings in connection with the Initiative, and that is the lack of courage and of backbone, and a lack of conception of civic duty.  No party in the State should seek to make another party carry out its policy.  No party should at any time, if there are important national issues to be faced and dealt with, get those other than the heads of the people in question to take the matter up.  I have got no right to select a Parliamentary Secretary or a junior Minister to go and negotiate big important international changes with another country, and I would be a poor and base President of an Executive Council if I did so, and when they had done it denounce them for it.  Let there be no misunderstanding about that statement.  The Government is not clinging to office.  The Government wants the country to be run on sound democratic lines, and to preserve for the people the fruits of democracy by deleting two Articles which are a standing menace to the progress of democracy in this country.  We are told that in Australia on a certain occasion, the Referendum was used and that we ought to try and preserve the Referendum at any cost, no matter what happens to the Initiative.  I have in my possession a report of a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad Eireann.  The sixth recommendation&mdash;the recommendation that Senator O'Farrell suggested is, &ldquo;That <Col N="812" /> the Article in the Constitution dealing with the Referendum should, on the recommendation of three-fifths of the members of this House, be eliminated.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is as far as the Seanad is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This series of Bills is carrying out, perhaps more so than has ever been done by the Government of any other country, a series of recommendations of this sort.  This is the first measure.  It deals with more than was recommended by the Committee.  I admit that.  Last July we introduced into the Dáil a Bill to take out one of these two Articles of the Constitution.  In the election in Cork, in the election in Kilkenny, I mentioned these things.</P>
      <P>Any Senator who wishes to see what was the opinion of the people in that connection can look at the result of these two elections and see whether or not there was sound and solid support for the proposals that were then put before the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must examine the Initiative and the Referendum and see how they work.  It will be within the recollection of Senators that an election for the Seanad took place about three years ago.  At that election something like 23 per cent. of the people voted, and the reason for that is quite easy to understand.  In an ordinary election for the Dáil there are several well-known contestants in every constituency. They address the people, they hold meetings, they issue literature, and the people's enthusiasm is aroused.  Even those who have no interest in elections at all find that their attention is directed towards the issues which are in question.  That was not the case in the Seanad election. The whole country was one constituency; in few places were meetings held, and the result was that 23 per cent. of the people voted.  I put it now, for the consideration of the Seanad, whether on any ordinary legislative proposal there is that comprehensive canvassing of public opinion, whether or not it is likely that sufficient interest would be aroused in order to get the people to vote, and whether, even the protagonists <Col N="813" /> of the Referendum would be satisfied with a 25 per cent. vote on an issue that was put before the people on a Referendum.  Would it be satisfactory, what would be the cost, and how often would it be likely to be used? In the event of the people concerning themselves with hampering and hindering, with obstructing the ordinary progress of government, is it not likely that the Referendum might not come into very grave abuse, costing the citizens much money, disturbing their ordinary mode of living, and perhaps deflecting public opinion from much more important questions?  Even if we take the Initiative, the Constitution provides that 75,000 voters can ask the Oireachtas to put into operation provisions for the use of the Initiative. What percentage of the electorate is 75,000 voters?  Something about 3 per cent., and 3 per cent. of the people can then put into operation something which the other 97 per cent., or a considerable proportion of them, are against.  The cost would be considerable. These two Articles of the Constitution could be the prey of any well-organised party in the country who are utterly indifferent to the opinions of the vast majority of the people, and we are invited now to consider <Col N="814" /> serious amendments to the Constitution in such a way that all parties will be agreed upon them.  That is the new doctrine of democratic government&mdash;that all parties must be agreed upon a change&mdash;all parties but one, as far as I can see.  These two Articles are a menace to the good order of the State as long as they are there. They are not important; they never were important.  There are enshrined in the Constitution sufficient safeguards for democratic expression of opinion on the democratic government of the country.  There is no danger, either now or at any other time, that any Government here will be autocratic, will abuse its power, will infringe the rights of the people, will interfere in any way with the liberties of the people, and this is, to my mind, one of the last expiring sparks of the slave mind which stands out and says to the people: &ldquo;Beware of your Government. Government is a thing which you have never had before, a thing of which you have no experience, something to be afraid of and something to be watched.&rdquo;  That is not a true expression of sound Irish citizenship, and I hope that the Seanad will take that view of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that, after the eloquent speech that the President has just delivered, my remarks <Col N="815" /> will be in the nature of an anti-climax, but feeling very strongly on this matter as I do, I deem it my duty to give, I am afraid in some little detail, the reasons for the conclusions at which I have arrived, and which were embodied in the vote that I have just given.  I consider this Bill the most important of a bewildering bunch of Bills amending the Constitution.  It is important not so much in its matter, although that is important, as in the time and on the occasion of its introduction.  The Constitution is, I feel sure, not only in my opinion but in the opinion of the whole House, an instrument which should be guarded with a certain amount of reverence and dignity.  If it is to be amended, it should be amended with deliberation.  It should not be amended with haste, to meet a passing need, as it is being amended now.  If the proper methods were applied to amending the Constitution, they should proceed either from experience or from investigation. What investigation has there been into the merits or the demerits of the Constitution which have occasioned this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President referred&mdash;I may be taking him up wrongly&mdash;to some inquiry into the Constitution that took place.  Of course, if he means the inquiry of the Joint Committee of the two Houses, their report has been published. But I understand that there was another inquiry into the Constitution some months ago.  We do not know, except by hearsay, who was on that inquiry and we do not know what they reported.  But if there are these fundamental defects, or if these amendments to the Constitution are necessary, surely they should be made the subject of closer investigation and, if necessary, prolonged inquiry.  We have no particulars as to who conducted any inquiry, when the inquiry was made, or what was reported.  After all, this Constitution was, as many felt, a doctrinaire production.  It came at a time of sudden change-over, but, as Senator Dowdall said, there were on the Constitution Committee a great number of experienced people who have since been given high office, and this very Article itself was referred to in terms of commendation, in spite of what the President <Col N="816" /> said, by the late Minister for Justice. I will quote from the Dáil reports, in which the following was given as a quotation from one of the speeches of the late Mr. O'Higgins.</P>

      <P>So much, for the time being, on the matter of investigation. If these things were wrong should they not have been calmly and deliberately investigated, and should there not be deliberate procedure on the report that would come from that investigation? Another very forcible form of investigation would be experience. Of course, there has been no experience whatever here of the use of either of these two features.  It is true that we may have shed some of our early illusions, <Col N="817" /> but there again, that is no reason for suddenly turning our backs on what we considered at one time to be quite valuable Articles.  I want to draw a distinction in my attitude towards the Referendum and towards the Initiative. I regard them as being in totally different categories.  The Referendum does seem to be very far-fetched, but though I think that there might have been an inquiry, I would not stand up in opposition&mdash;it is not a popular thing to do&mdash;to the deletion of the Initiative alone.  I do not know that in any of the countries where it is in operation it has been used to any appreciable extent. But the Referendum is quite a different matter.  The Referendum is a proved and established method in popular Government. Switzerland is perhaps the best example of where it has been used on a very extended scale and in a very useful manner.  It is certainly an Article that should be treated with a certain amount of respect, and it should be amended only after investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possibilities of the Referendum are that it is a check on excess.  Any Government coming in for five years' unfettered office is liable&mdash;and certainly in Switzerland it has proved to be liable &mdash;to certain excesses, outrunning the popular will, and the Referendum is the only means whereby any of their actions can be referred to the people.  Of course, there are a great many people who do lip service to this idea of popular government.  I do not accept it as ideal, but I am faced with the fact that it is there.  If it were possible to put back the clock for a generation I think we might approach the whole subject from a different angle.  Another thing I would suggest is this: People may say that this is a pure abstract sort of political philosophy, but we have to look at the future in these matters. We cannot do anything in a hurry, without regard to its ultimate effects. Democracy is our master.  It may work in a crude way, but we have to realise the fact that it will have its say in the long run.  The method of referring specific measures to them and concentrating on one issue alone is in the Referendum, and to my mind that is a very good way of educating the popular vote and of enabling the people to concentrate their thoughts and to get away <Col N="818" /> from all the confusion and the mixed issues of a general election.</P>
    <P>One objection, of course, is that of expense.  I think if it were going to be used in the way that the President suggested&mdash;as an engine of obstruction &mdash;and if parties were going to take every malicious opportunity of bringing this Referendum into operation, it might be very annoying.  But there are many ways of getting over that difficulty without absolute repeal.  Is there no half-way house?  There are various methods by which you could amend this Referendum Article so that it could be used only on certain occasions, perhaps only so many times during the life of a Government, or that it could not be used to upset international agreements.  None of these avenues has been thought out.  I agree with the President that the use of the Referendum to involve the Treaty and the Oath would be very objectionable.  The only thing I have to say is that this will leave an objectionable feeling in the minds of the great mass of the people.  That is what you are up against.  You are not up against sixty Deputies in the Dáil; you are up against the people who sent them there. The people who sent them there are there all the time, and you have to face that.  If that maligned spirit is there it is going to come home to roost sooner or later.  Another objection that has been raised is with regard to the unsuitability of this matter to large States.  I do not know whether this could be called a large or a small State.  As compared with some of the cantons of Switzerland it is a large State, but I cannot see any difficulty in applying it to any State, and certainly not to a State of this size.</P>
    <P>The real objection, in my opinion, to the way in which this Bill is brought forward is that it appears to some people merely as a blocking measure.  I do not believe that this Bill is brought forward really after any fundamental thought as to the objections to either of these Articles.  It is brought forward because they are about to be used in, I admit, a very annoying way, and they are brought, forward merely to frustrate the move of a party, and because naturally the Government are apprehensive of the results of putting any <Col N="819" /> issue before the people at the present time, and they are apprehensive of the effects.  As a tactical move I agree that it is probably good, merely for the sake of party tactics in the next six months or year and the Government is perhaps very wise to do so; but as a stragetical move I consider it wholly bad, and after all, strategy must govern tactics. In the long run it will have a very bad effect in the country, and it will have reactions on public opinion and on the stability of the Government.</P>
    <P>Take this question of the Treaty.  I know that it would be very unfortunate if the whole of this Treaty issue were to be brought into the arena of popular voting&mdash;down to the hustings.  But surely it is only a question of time before that issue will have to be faced. The removal of the Referendum will only defer it.  The time is coming, unfortunately, when some party will get into power and will raise the question of the Treaty, and I cannot see that there is any more danger in having the question raised now.  It can only be raised as a matter of opinion in the country&mdash;that the country does or does not want this oath modified.  If it is not raised to-day it certainly will be raised sooner or later when there is a change of Government, and merely to avoid that momentary dislocation and all the upset that it will involve, it does seem wrong, it does seem altogether out of proportion, ruthlessly to cut away without inquiry an Article of the Constitution which could be of the greatest value.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the question of a mandate.  The Government say: &ldquo;We have the authority of the people for our action.&rdquo;  Well, I failed to find it. I looked up the President's speech, made on, I think, the 9th September, in Kilkenny, and I know he did say that if he was returned to office he would put it out of the power of Mr. de Valera and his followers to hold up any Bill by the Referendum.  I could not find any reference to it in his Cork speech, but in any case the speech he made in Cork was after the poll.  But it was never put forward as a cardinal plank in any election address that I saw.  In fact both of these elections <Col N="820" /> were so hurried that I do not think that there was anything in the nature of any popular manifesto, or any declaration of creed from any party.  I may be mistaken, but I have no knowledge that this was put as a fundamental, vital issue before the country. The Minister for Justice says that surely the policy of the Government should have been known on the occasion of the introduction of the Constitution (Amendment No. 6) Bill into the Dáil.  I looked up that Bill.  That Bill preserves the Referendum, so that any reference of that kind is misleading. Either the Minister's memory was at fault or he was trusting that our memories were at fault, because the Referendum is preserved in that Bill, which only said that Deputies who had not taken the oath should not be allowed to vote on any procedure that would bring about a Referendum.  The Minister for Finance, in referring to these Articles, said that they got into the Constitution by accident, that nobody noticed them very much, that they got there, that we never thought very much of them one way or the other.  I will quote his exact words if necessary.  That was strangely at variance from the quotation of the speech of the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins that I gave.  The Minister for Defence, Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald, speaking on the subject, took a rather extreme line. He said: &ldquo;I believe it is quite possible to have a better and a more democratic form of Government than existing Parliaments.  It is quite possible that there is a better way of forming a Government and running a country.&rdquo; But he did not give any indication of what the alternative is, and he leaves us entirely guessing as to what he would put in the place of the present time-honoured institution of Parliamentary government.</P>
    <P>I am reluctantly forced to the conclusion that this measure is a pure and simple piece of opportunism.  For that reason it is wrong, and it should be resisted. It is part of the Government's policy towards direct action, that policy of repression which is very attractive, the old policy of new Governments which become established, that people should be kept in order by force or terror in some form or other. <Col N="821" /> So far as disorder is concerned, I quite agree, and I claim to have consistently supported the Government on all measures necessary for the suppression of physical disorder.  But mental disorder is to my mind under a totally different rule.  You cannot suppress mental disorder by means of repressive legislation.  Ultimately the people are going to assert themselves, and if one side starts this policy of trying to get their own back, or trying to wipe the eye of the other party, the other party will retaliate, and the whole thing will bring popular Government into a very undignified and a very squalid condition.</P>
    <P>I feel that it would have been much better to proceed deliberately on these matters, to have trusted to time to exercise its healing effects, not to have adopted what always appears to me to be rather the sort of attitude that this country as a whole objected to before the Treaty.  I remember well one of the old order saying to me: &ldquo;I know these people.  The only thing they understand is the stick, and the only way we will ever govern Ireland is by the stick&rdquo;.  He was very emphatic.  I rather feel that that describes to a certain extent the attitude of mind that is behind this measure.  If it is so, I think it is most unfortunate.  If this is done by one side it will be done by the other; there will be a sort of ding-dong right around, and a number of the ideals, which I cannot claim to have fought for, but which others fought for and for which I suffered, will be lost and the whole force of popular government will be brought into disrepute.</P>

      <P>The opposition of certain Senators to this Bill is only a natural thing to expect, but it is certainly strange to find Senator Sir John Keane in opposition to the Bill, and practically in alliance with the Party which hopes to use these Articles of the Constitution, to smash the Constitution. I congratulate them, certainly, on their new ally.  Eighty years ago the London &ldquo;Times&rdquo; wrote that the Celtic race was disappearing with a vengeance.  It is certainly curious that a descendant of the Celts should find himself in a House of the National Parliament feeling something like a crusted Tory, while the aristocratic correspondent of the London &ldquo;Times&rdquo; should be the champion of democracy and popular rights and should be denouncing our native government for the curtailment of rights and for measures of repression.  I do not presume to be an authority on the Constitution, but, from the point of view of the business man, I think the Articles whose deletion we are discussing are embellishments which our Constitution could very well do without.  Of course, we now hear how vastly important they are, and what great principles they enshrine, and we are told how useful the Referendum was in killing conscription in Australia.  Conscription was killed in Ireland without any Referendum. It was killed in Ireland by the force of public opinion, and, as long as we have public opinion and representative government they are checks enough.  It is all right to talk about checks on a tyrannical and an unscrupulous Government, but it seems <Col N="823" /> to me instead of checks on a tyranical and unscrupulous Government these Articles of the Constitution really provide weapons for an unscrupulous Opposition to cause turmoil and confusion in the country.  It is only necessary to get five per cent. of the electorate, or twenty per cent. of the electorate in any five average constituencies and you can have a Referendum on almost anything. Now, it is to be on the oath, we are told.  Next time it may be on prohibition or some other fad.  In fact, I would describe these two Articles of the Constitution as government of faddists, by faddists, for faddists.  In a country like this, with the widest possible franchise, with proportional representation, and a general election every five years, the people have ample opportunity of expressing their opinion, and the powers of the Initiative and the Referendum are wholly unnecessary.  Not only are they wholly unnecessary, but they are unwanted by the great bulk of the people.  They do not want to be voting on questions submitted to them by Referendum.  People who have work to do think there is too much voting and too many elections. We had evidence of this in the elections for the county councils last week where in some of the counties no more than 37 per cent. of the people came out to vote on the very important business of returning men to handle and control hundreds of thousands of pounds of local taxation.  Is it likely that when only 37 per cent. came out to vote on a matter of such importance that you would get them to vote on a question like the oath?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing this question of the oath and these Articles we cannot close our eyes to the use that is to be made of them in the matter of the oath. In this connection one might well ask: Why put the country to the expense of a Referendum over what is now certified to be an empty formula?  All these objectors to the oath have now taken it themselves and do not seem to be anything the worse of it.  They are all great zealots for economy.  They are out for cutting down expense. They are out for running this country on half the cost of the present Government, and yet they propose to spend <Col N="824" /> from £80,000 to £100,000 for no earthly reason that I can see except that the fools of the future might escape the empty formula.  After putting the country to this expense and after all the turmoil, it is questionable whether the Referendum would effect their purpose, because I understand that as a matter of strict law, these two Articles of the Constitution could not affect the oath at all.  That does not matter to them. They do not care a scrap about the Constitution as long as they can make use of these Articles to make political capital and to buttress up their pretence that the people are overwhelmingly against the oath.  We all know what would happen.  It is not hard to see what would happen if this question were submitted to a Referendum.  The country would be again deluged with all the stale nonsense about the oath which we have been listening to since the Treaty was passed.  We would have a regular monsoon of futile drivel from all these gentlemen&mdash;from men whose fathers had taken the oath of allegiance to England, from men who had taken it themselves&mdash;including some of his Majesty's conscripts&mdash;men who had invested their money in England and who had grown rich on English dividends. We would have them all descending on the constituencies frothing at the mouth, denouncing the oath in the Treaty as being the cause of all our woes, denouncing everything English except her pensions and her Treasury notes.  The result would be that there is not a humbug in the country who shirked the fight when England was here but who would now see his chance of coming out and safely doing his bit, and, of course, he would come out and plump against the oath, while the bulk of the people, not caring two straws what oath their representatives took, and, perhaps, not realising the importance and seriousness of the issue, would not trouble to vote at all, and thus would be won a great victory for Irish independence.  This is the first farce that it is proposed to stage through the medium of these two Articles, a farce that would speedily become a tragedy.</P>
    <P>Remember that this is proposed after the country has pronounced its verdict on the question of the oath at three <Col N="825" /> general elections and I do not know at how many bye-elections.  If the people wanted the oath removed they should have given a majority to the anti-Treatyites, but when they failed to get that majority, when they were beaten, not once but several times, they now take refuge in this loophole to escape from their defeats.  When the Government attempts by this legislation to stop up that loophole and save the country the expense and turmoil of voting again on an issue already decided they are accused of dishonesty, of dishonourable conduct, and of attempting to deprive the people of their Magna Charta.  I submit that the dishonesty is not on the side of the Government, but on the side of those who seek to renew the quarrel with England by gross deception of the people, by pretending to the people that they have only got to vote for the abolition of the oath and lo!  the oath is abolished, knowing perfectly well that any attempt to abolish the oath will mean a renewal of the strife with England, because as we all know the basis of the Treaty settlement is that the Free State is to remain an integral part of the British Commonwealth, and consequently must recognise the Crown. Therefore any attempt to throw out the Crown by removing Article 17 removes the keystone of the arch of the Treaty and the whole thing comes to the ground.</P>
    <P>That is the game.  Having failed to smash the Treaty by civil war, having failed to smash it by abuse at three general elections, they now resort to the strategy of Article 48, and the Government that stood by the Treaty&mdash; some of whom gave their lives for it&mdash; are now solemnly invited to introduce legislation to destroy it by seventy-five thousand parchment revolutionaries under Article 48.  The fact that this Article lends itself to such an absurdity is surely enough to condemn it, and the Government would be false to their trust, they would be betraying the trust handed down to them by Collins and Griffith, if they did not take the steps proposed in this Bill to save themselves and the country from being placed in such a humiliating and ludicrous position before the world.  For thus safeguarding the dignity of the people we <Col N="826" /> are told, forsooth, that the Government are tyrants and are seeking to deprive the people of their cherished rights, and they are severely taken to task by Senator O'Farrell, amongst others.  I can understand the indignation of the opponents of the Treaty at the passing of this Bill, but I cannot understand the indignation being shared by a Party that supports the Treaty and wishes to see it a success and the country prospering.  I cannot understand a Party that wants more work and less politics in the country, more employment, more industries starting, voting to retain in the Constitution an instrument that can and that it is said will be used for the purpose of throwing back the political settlement into the melting pot and keeping this country in a state of constant ferment.  If I wanted the country periodically thrown into confusion, if I wanted taxation to be increased and unemployment increased, I would certainly vote against this Bill and vote for leaving Articles 47 and 48 in the Constitution, to be the playthings of the Party that avows that it is only constitutional until it is once more strong enough to use force.</P>

      <P>It has been stated that this legislation is in the nature of ad hoc legislation, that it is Party legislation, Party tactics, and that in any event, whether what you propose to do is the right thing or the wrong thing, this is not the right way or the right time.  These are all matters of opinion.  The way I look at the Bill is on its merits and the alteration it proposes to make in the Constitution, and that alone.  These other considerations do not disturb me in the least.  I am going to vote for the Bill, because I do not think the alterations proposed to be made in the Constitution are important. That is my opinion.  I am not going to be deterred from voting for it by considerations of the kind referred to.  The Initiative and the Referendum are excellent things in theory.  Academically they may be practical if everybody was patriotic and arranged their politics purely on the lines of trying to secure the greatest good for the greatest number, but we know human nature has hardly <Col N="827" /> arrived at that stage yet, and, as a matter of fact, I consider these Articles are measures that could be used by unscrupulous people, and by a small number of people, to keep us in a state of constant political disturbance.  I will vote for the Bill for these reasons on its merits, and I hope that those who think with me will not be deterred from voting for it by considerations that, while it may be the right thing to do, this may not be the right way or the right time to do it.  After all there is nothing sacrosanct about the Initiative or the Referendum.  Neither are things that we have thriven on or that have been in use for a period of years.  They are new things.  In all Constitutions we have things which are not practical, which are academic.</P>

      <P>As far as the deletion of Article 48 is concerned I am not much concerned about that.  I think Article 48 is unworkable, but I am somewhat concerned about the deletion of Article 47 unless something is substituted in its place.  Article 47 gives three-fifths of the members of this House power to demand that a Referendum of the people should take place on any Bill that may come before the House.  As I understand the matter the Committee of both Houses that went into the question of the Constitution made a recommendation altering the position, as the President said, to make it almost stronger, that a Referendum to the people could not be demanded by three-fifths of this House alone, but that two-fifths of the Dáil in conjunction with three-fifths of the members of this House would have power to say that a Referendum should be taken.  I think that is a very good suggestion, and I am not satisfied that an occasion might not arise when a Referendum of the people should be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can easily visualise what might take place which would make it necessary that a Referendum should be taken, and for once in a way I agree with Senator Sir John Keane, that we are dealing with the position that has arisen, but we are overlooking the fact that some time later action might be taken when there should be such a <Col N="828" /> safeguard as the Referendum.  In the future some party might be returned to power that would be responsible for tearing up our international agreements. That might precipitate war. There is no safeguard there then to take a Referendum of the people. Someone says yes.  I say if Article 47 is deleted from the Constitution there is no power to take a Referendum.  I say that some provision ought to be made so that there will be machinery at the disposal of the people for having a Referendum as the occasion demands. Most people say that we have had no experience here of dealing with the Referendum.  I have had experience in the city of Dublin of having certain questions submitted to the people.  Many years ago the Dublin Municipal Council proposed to introduce a Bill in the British House of Commons dealing with important matters that involved the rates of the city. At that time a small party in Dublin, mostly composed of people who afterwards formed the Sinn Féin Party, demanded that a Referendum of the people should be taken with regard to the proposals.  A Referendum of the ratepayers was taken, and the result was that the City Council's proposals were defeated.  That shows that the citizens of Dublin, when their interests were vitally concerned, did take notice and registered their votes against the decision of their elected representatives, when they were going to do certain things with the ratepayers' money.</P>
    <P>The time might arise when an important National question might have to be decided by a Referendum of the people, and for that reason I am in favour of retaining the power of the Referendum.  It is all very well for Senator MacLoughlin to talk about what happened in Australia with regard to conscription.  Conscription, of course, was passed in this country, but the Senator overlooked the important fact that the position was altogether different in the two cases.  The Government elected by the people in Australia attempted to impose Conscription on them, but here an alien Government attempted to force Conscription and the people said they would not accept it.  The Senator spoke about faddists, about government <Col N="829" /> by faddists, for faddists.  It appears to me the only government that would suit Senator MacLoughlin is a government of Fascists, and that we should be all going about wearing black shirts.  There is no use introducing questions about the oath in dealing with the elimination of Article 47 of the Constitution.  The question ought to be removed beyond that.  Issues might arise in this country that would be of far greater importance to the people than the question of the oath. That is what I am considering.  It is only right that some provision should be made for the retention of some form of Referendum, and for that reason I am opposing the Bill as it stands.  I am not very much interested in Article 48, as I am convinced it is unworkable, but I am anxious about the elimination of Article 47, unless there is something in its place that would give the people the right to have a Referendum on important issues.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, we consider, particularly <Col N="830" /> suited to this country in the circumstance of the time.  It will impress on the people more forcibly perhaps than would otherwise be the case that henceforth the law of this country is their law, is the creature of their will, is something which they can make, alter, or repeal, as it seems best to them.</P>
    <P>I agree with the last speaker that the Referendum is far more important than the Initiative, which, I think, would be difficult to work, and while on the point I think the Referendum should not be lightly invoked.  The Minister said, with regard to the Initiative:</P>
    <P>It keeps contact with the people and their laws, and keeps responsibility and consciousness in the minds of the people that they are the real and ultimate rulers of the country.</P>
    <P>I think the Referendum should not be lightly invoked.  I do not speak on this question as a Party man; I take no Party attitude on it.  I consider that we have far too much Party feeling on one side and on the other in connection with it.  I do not say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to all that has been said and done by the Party that I am supposed to be usually associated with.  I think this measure was introduced by the Government in the narrowest, and, to my mind, the most stupid Party spirit.  I agree really with Senator Sir John Keane, that in a relatively short space of time the Government will be sorry that they have not some machinery for instituting a Referendum.</P>
    <P>I would go further than the Committee that sat on this.  The Referendum is necessarily a very costly expedient, and I would be perfectly willing to assent to a modification of Article 6, and to insist that three-fifths of the members of both Houses&mdash;not three-fifths of one House&mdash;should be subscribing parties to the question of the Referendum.  I think it is only right that the Referendum should be retained in the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this question, we have to keep in mind that the preamble of the Constitution sets out that &ldquo;all lawful authority comes from God to the people,&rdquo; and in <Col N="831" /> Article 2, that &ldquo;all powers of Government and all authority&mdash;legislative, executive and judicial&mdash;are derived from the people.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In a democracy, the people are in some respects the sovereign, and in other respects the subject.  There can be no exercise of democratic government but by their suffrages, which are exercised by their own free will.  In this respect the people are sovereign. The people in whom the supreme power resides ought to have the management of everything within their reach; that which exceeds their abilities or opportunities must be conducted by their Deputies or Ministers.  In a country like the Free State the legislative power, in theory, resides in the whole body of the people, but in practice it is found more fitting and convenient that the people should transact by their Deputies what they cannot transact by themselves.  The people are well qualified for choosing those whom they are to entrust with part of their authority.  They have sufficient ability to choose, though not to be chosen. Though incapable of conducting the administration themselves, they are capable of calling others to account for their administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public business should be carried on neither too quickly nor too slowly, but it is the business of the Legislature to follow the spirit of the nation when it is not contrary to the principles of good government.  One danger of the Initiative is that people under strong excitement are more easily conducted by their passions than by their reason; it is, therefore, easy to make them undertake enterprises contrary to their interest.  As a check to hasty or panic legislation. the Constitutions of Rome and Athens provided that the Senate had the power of decreasing, or, if it thought proper, to make some trial of a law before it was finally established.  This principle, in a modified sense, is incorporated in our own Constitution in the powers given to the Senate.  Some Senators who have spoken submit that while the proposed deletion of the Initiative might be open to argument, the Referendum should be retained.  I would like to hear this point further argued. <Col N="832" /> In countries where the Referendum obtains, it has not achieved its purpose, and is rarely resorted to.  Switzerland has been mentioned, but statistics show that the Referendum is rarely invoked in that country.  If retained in the Free State Constitution, I think it would be seldom resorted to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>In this House, whenever the Government want a member of it to state the official point of view, I think it is generally recognised that they select Senator MacLoughlin.  He certainly is the big noise for the Government in this House, and for that reason one must attach a certain amount of importance to the statement he has made when dealing with the Referendum.  He ridiculed the idea that the Referendum had saved the people of Australia from conscription. He said conscription was attempted here, and we defeated it here without any Referendum.  Now everyone knows the way we defeated conscription here.  It was certainly not by constitutional means.  It was by means quite the reverse.  Does Senator MacLoughlin suggest, as a spokesman of the Government, that if a Bill is passed by the Oireachtas and becomes law in the normal course of procedure, it is to be resisted, if opposed by a majority of the people, and is it to be defeated in the same way as we defeated the Conscription Act passed in the British Parliament?  That is the hint that he throws out as to how the majority are to save themselves from legislation that is unwanted, from oppressive legislation passed by a Government that has not the confidence of the majority of the people.  It is displaying a mentality of violence, a mentality in which the Government conceives a great part of its legislation.  Because Senator Sir John Keane has supported the Government on numerous occasions, on a great majority of occasions, and sometimes on very questionable Bills, he is to be ridiculed to-day because he dare oppose them in this particular measure, once having supported them, and whether in his opinion they are right or wrong. That is the view point impressed on anyone who has at any time supported the Government.  You must not use your own intelligence.  You must not <Col N="833" /> speak lest what you say might be embarrassing. You must vote as people tell you.</P>
      <P>It will be noticed that the President spoke early in this debate, so as to give the keynote to his followers here.  Some people will always find themselves in opposition, no matter I suppose what Government is in power.  Equally so, there are people who always find themselves on the side of the Government, no matter what Party is in power.  I am very much afraid that there are people here who will always be on the side of the Government, no matter what Party is in power, unless perhaps a new electorate in its wisdom sends in here people who are capable of using their own free will and intelligence and exercising their own responsibility as legislators.  I would be very much surprised to learn that the majority of the members of this House are at all convinced that this is a desirable measure just now, that it has been brought in in a proper way, and that it is not setting a most injurious and serious example to all future Governments.  Inwardly I am convinced that there is a majority that feels that way, but they have not the courage or the audacity to go out and vote against the Bill, because it is a Government measure.</P>
      <P>What is this House for?  Is it merely to register the views of the majority in the other House?  What in the name of Providence is a Second Chamber for if it is to be merely a registering body? Before I came in here to-day I had been talking to many members of this House with regard to this Bill.  I gathered from conversations with them that privately you will not get a majority of them to say that this Bill should have been brought in.  It is time, I think, that Senators had a little assertiveness. I would appeal to those Senators whose tenure of office will expire in a few months' time to do the courageous and the responsible thing in connection with this Bill, and to vote according to their conscience.  They may not have a chance of coming back, but as legislators they can feel that they had done one good deed by voting against this Bill, and can say with a certain amount of truth that as legislators they had not lived in vain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just listened, I suppose, to the cleverest speech in the whole debate, but I was rather astonished to hear Senator O'Farrell make the statement that he has just made&mdash;that we in this House are in the habit of voting for or against the Government, not according to our own individual opinions and as we think right, but merely because we wish to support the Government, and that the Government knows that we are certain to support it.  I have sat in this House for about six years, and I certainly can say that is not my opinion of the mentality of the Senators who sit here.  The Senator is quite wrong when he makes that suggestion.  Senators, as far as I know, have always debated matters that came before them in the way that they thought was right and voted according to their lights.</P>
      <P>As regards this Referendum, there is a great fetish being made out of it.  I regard the Referendum very much from the point of view of the Seanad. Originally, when a few of us were settling with the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins and some other representatives of the new state of affairs in Ireland, we had great ideas with regard to the power of the Referendum.  I know that both we and the late Mr. O'Higgins considered that it was a weapon which the Seanad ought to have if it were to stand out against a Government trying to override the rights of certain classes of the people.  We believed that the Seanad should have the right of the Referendum so that it could try to save those rights for the people.  I cannot speak for the late Mr. O'Higgins, but from my own observations I have come to the conclusion that the Referendum is a weapon that the Seanad cannot use with advantage at all.  It is like a sharp-edged sword which you dare not use because you may do damage you did not intend.  It is like a boomerang, because if you make any mistake in the use of it it will probably come back and do more damage than any good you are likely to get out of it.  That is the practical conclusion that I myself have come to with regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From watching and seeing how, if anything had arisen during the years that have gone by, the Seanad could <Col N="835" /> have made use of their powers by making use of the Referendum, it was first and foremost made clear to me that it was perfectly evident to anyone that even if the members of the Seanad decided to move in a particular matter, they never had either enough ability, numbers or anything else to put a case before the country.  Therefore the Referendum by the Senate would, to my mind, be a very bad thing to use.  In our discussions on that committee, on which Senator O'Farrell sat, I believe all of us came to the conclusion that, so far as the Seanad was concerned, our powers under the Referendum were not a thing that we could possibly continue. We came to the conclusion that other and far better methods would give the Seanad the power which it ought to have in case we had an Executive Government in power that tried to do things which we believed not to be in the interests of the people, and not a purpose for which that Government had been elected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Senator to say that I think none of the Senators who spoke are advocating a Referendum capable of being invoked by the Seanad alone.  What I had in mind when speaking was a Referendum that would be capable of being invoked on the requisition of a certain proportion of the Dáil and Seanad combined &mdash;not the Seanad alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite right. I merely mention the Referendum as far as the Seanad is concerned.  I think that the Senator and myself came to the conclusion that the Referendum as a weapon to be used by the Seanad in the defence of the rights of the people was not a good weapon, and that we were perfectly willing to give it up.  I believe that applies really to the whole of this question of the Referendum.  It is a clumsy, useless and expensive tool. It is merely a great name.  When I heard Senator Sir John Keane advocate that we should still stick to it, it struck me that even his acute mind puts, if I may so express it, much more into that glass than it is capable of holding. The Referendum is a thing that the people who have the real interests of the country before them are unlikely ever to use.  While we have the method <Col N="836" /> of election in this country whereby the Government is put into office by the votes of the people, and while the Government in office has to carry out the measures it advocated while seeking the votes of the people, if we get a Government put into power by the votes of the people which is going to declare against the Treaty and is going to put us into all the trouble that we know would follow from that, I believe there would be no possible use in trying to stop that sort of thing by the Referendum.  If the people of this country put a Government into power that is going to carry out such measures that will put the country into a lot of trouble, then of course we will have to face that and no Referendum is going to stop it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot imagine a people who have just put into power a Government whose policy is to do away with the Treaty and the Oath and everything else turning around and, by a vote of two-fifths of the Dáil and Seanad, complying with a request from a large section of the people to have that particular issue decided by the Referendum. The thing is absurd.  As long as we have good representative government and as long as the measures which are going to be passed here for the country are put forward by a particular Party before the people before it is elected to power, as long as such a Government has got the support of the majority of the people behind it, there is no use whatever in a Referendum as far as the honest people of the country who have the interest of the country at heart are concerned.  As I said earlier, the Referendum is a tool that can be used for political purposes by what is really a minority so far as the opinions of the people expressed at the elections are concerned.  There lies the danger of it. The Referendum is of no use to people of goodwill in this country.  The danger of it is that it would be used by those who would do damage, but who would probably think it the right thing, though that was not the opinion of the common people of the country.  The other people would try to use it to upset the peace and good order of the country. It is there undoubtedly that the danger of the Referendum lies.  It is fifty times a greater danger than any possible <Col N="837" /> theoretical good that could ever be got out of these two Articles in the Constitution as they stand.</P>
    <P>During the six years that I have been here, and during which I have been interested in these matters, I have found out one or two things.  One was that our idea at first was that the whole of the people of the country would be the proper electorate for the election of members to this House.  I think there is hardly a member of this House or of the other House who does not realise that that is a mistake.  From practice, we have found that that is wrong, and I think everyone will admit it.  I have also learned from what I have seen, that the power of the Referendum, so far as the Seanad is concerned, is of no use.  I believe it is likely to be of more use to the enemies of the country than to the friends of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one phrase used in the course of the debate to-day on which I intend to found any remarks which I have to make.  It was a remark passed by Senator Bagwell that the danger of the Constitution as it is at present is that a small number of unscrupulous people can keep this country in a hectic state of excitement working towards amendment of it which by the very terms of the Constitution they are precluded from getting.  If that was the only excuse for what Senator Sir John Keane would call opportunism with regard to this measure, then I think it is a sufficient excuse, but I think that there is a good deal more than opportunism about it than that.  That word can always, of course, be applied; anyone can say, this is seizing your opportunity.  There must be an occasion for doing everything, and when people speak of rushing tactics and ask what is the necessity for urgency, and when criticism of that sort is put forward, the answer I think to it is this: That so long ago as the 27th July of last year the President proposed pretty definitely the same Bill that is now before the Seanad.  We were asked then to hold up that Bill, because its introduction at the same moment as the Public Safety Act, and because of certain circumstances that developed <Col N="838" /> here after the assassination of the late Minister for Justice, brought about a certain atmosphere and would put on the introduction of this measure then a colouring that nobody wished it to have.  In the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill the Labour Party, not being then present in the Dáil, but every party in the Dáil, the Farmers Party, the Party led by Captain Redmond and our own Party all indicated that the purpose which the Bill was designed to prevent was a purpose which everybody recognised was being engineered by people outside the Dáil and was in fact outside the Constitution. The arguments were then used: &ldquo;Let these people outside pursue their futile and useless course, let them waste their time, energy and money in getting these signatures, and, therefore, it must come to this that this particular movement will be useless.&rdquo; Deputy Baxter made a statement to which the President assented.  It is our policy with regard to the Treaty and with regard to the Constitution and with regard to amendments either.  This was the statement Deputy Baxter made:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If there are people who want the Treaty altered in certain respects there is in my view a constitutional way by which that can be achieved. They can come here and if they are sufficiently strongly represented they can, as the President said earlier, get this House to agree that the representatives of this country should take up the work of altering or amending the Treaty in the particular way and manner in which the country, or the majority of the representatives of the country, want it changed or altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the point Senator Jameson has referred to.  If that state of things comes about, the safeguards of the Referendum or Initiative are not worth the paper they are written on, any more than they would be worth the paper they are written on to prevent the other thing if it were possible of legitimate achievement.  This whole debate has been brought to the point where people have lost their perspective.  If we were to propose by an Act to remove elections at the end of every five <Col N="839" /> years' period and proposed to have legislation brought in and passed by the Executive Council without going before the Dáil or Seanad, there could not be a greater outcry or more ponderous arguments than have been used about the proposals to delete Articles 47 and 48.  We were told that they were almost the God-given rights of the people.  They represent nothing of the sort.  The people never had those rights.  Take any period in history up to 1922.  The people had no rights by Referendum, and on the assumption of independence in 1921 these rights did not automatically flow to the people. They were given to the people by a Constitution passed in 1921 or 1922, and depend upon Article 50 of the Constitution.  Article 50 sets out that amendments to the Constitution within the terms of the Scheduled Treaty can be made by way of ordinary legislation within a certain period.  Originally it was proposed to stereotype the form of the Constitution for ever, without allowing that eight years' period elasticity.  It was at the request of and because of reasons given by the Labour Party in the Dáil that it was extended to an eight years' period.  As will be noticed by a remark by the President in the other House, it is proposed to extend that period further.  How that is to be done has still to be considered.  People here should not consider that they are in the position of the Americans with regard to their Constitution.  We have not a Constitution in its final form, and they should not imagine that the mould of the Constitution is the final shape of the Constitution.  That has to be fashioned according to whatever this Seanad, acting with the Dáil, likes to put upon it.</P>
    <P>We intend to allow a longer period in which amendments to the Constitution can be made by ordinary legislation. People have not had full time to consider the final form of the Constitution, and to experience what are the good points in the Constitution and what are the evil points.  We stand where we always stood with regard to the Constitution&mdash;that is, that the Constitution has only force and effect in this country by reason of the Constitution <Col N="840" /> Act passed by the Oireachtas. That states that any amendments to the Constitution which are repugnant to the Scheduled Treaty are null and void to that extent; in other words, that the Constitution, with its numerous Articles, is tied by the Constitution Act in certain respects.  Outside that the Constitution is flexible and can be changed by ordinary legislation within the period of eight years.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, we propose to enlarge that period, or give its equivalent in some other way, but we do not propose to take away rights from the people which they ought to have.  We gave those rights to the people in Articles 47 and 48, and we believe the people will not complain if those rights are taken away.  We know we are going to be judged when the ordinary period for the elections comes for that, but not upon that <i>simpliciter</i>, but plus all the other sins of omission and commission that can be brought against us. We add that to the growing burden of all the allegations against us; we add that deliberately, and we propose to take away from the people certain powers which at one time, in an experimental mood, we thought fit to give them.  The late Minister for Justice has been brought into this debate, and, as the President has said, by people who, by their conduct since, have shown that they have no appreciation of what that man gave his life for.</P>

      <P>I refer only to Senator Dowdall.  The late Vice-President was referred to as having said certain things with regard to the Initiative and the Referendum.  I want these remarks of his, quoted twice in this House, to be pondered over.  I ask: could they not be applied to the Constitution minus Articles 47 and 48 with the same force as applied to the Constitution containing these Articles? The late Vice-President said that the people were to regard the laws of this country as the creatures of their will. So they are, and that is to continue. They will not have the possibility of dealing with the matters referred to here within the five years' period, but they are to be the supreme judge in <Col N="841" /> the end as to whether a party's programme has been satisfactory to them within the five years' period.  People who say that the people's rights are being filched from them by the removal of these Articles have no appreciation of what the rights of the people are. The people have a right to their judgment upon a Government at the end of the Government's period of office. They can say that on the fundamental issues they have been deceived, and they can throw them from office and put in people who will reverse their policy on particular matters.  They can make it clear what they want reversed and what they want abided by, that had previously been done.  If we had proposed to take away the rights of election, the rights of the people to choose their representatives at the end of a five-year period, there could not have been more nonsense talked than has been talked about the taking away of Articles 47 and 48, and that in a House where we get it stated by some people who, I think, sincerely oppose this, but say they do not care about the Referendum as far as certain people are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as certain people are concerned the Initiative we all know would be of no use.  With regard to the Referendum, Senator O'Farrell said that if we give this example to another government, what authority will this House have to refuse legislation which another government may bring in with a definite stated object of tearing up the Constitution. It will have the authority which any House will have of making up its mind honestly and sincerely when a concrete proposition comes before it.  Senator O'Farrell put the point of view that if the Seanad did not act according to his views it would not be acting conscientiously and that it was merely accepting a decision arrived at by the Minister.  I am not asking the Seanad to accept any decision of mine.  I am asking that the Seanad which is supposed to deliberate on this and make up its own mind will always have the moral authority to hold up any matter <Col N="842" /> they consider wrong.  We propose to give an extra check.  The Committee which sat to consider amendments to the Constitution recommended first the deletion of a certain portion of the Constitution which refers to the Referendum, and we are giving a greater check.  It is all part of the system of balance and check which a Second House in relation to the other House must always have.  The Seanad in future if legislation goes through will have the power to hold up any Bill for twenty months unless the Dáil decides to go to the country on it and gets a verdict against the Seanad, in which case it can come forward after a period, plus two months, has elapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask you to consider the situation we are in.  We are not taking away from the people rights which the people as of right possess.  These rights were given to the people in an experimental mood.  I say that deliberately, and I say that anything the late Minister for Justice said on the occasion of the introduction of these Articles will apply to the Constitution minus these two Articles, as well as with them.  When people talk about the Constitution, how they are sticking up for the Constitution, and how we are going away from previous promises.  I say they are dishonest in that, or fail to appreciate all that there is in the Constitution which has full force and effect by reason of the Constitution Act, which says that any amendments to the Constitution which are repugnant to the Scheduled Treaty are null and void to that extent.  The rest of the Constitution is flexible under Article 50, and we propose, and have, I believe, the assent of all parties to that, to allow that period within which the flexibility of the Constitution lasts to be extended.  I do not say in saying that that it is a light thing to tamper with the Constitution, and I do not say we are lightly tampering with it.  I said we announced our intention on the 27th July last and we had the support of every party then present in the Dáil, and of every party then directing its attention, to a particular movement that was on to upset the Constitution by an unauthorised use of the Constitution.  We thought it better to let these people spend their <Col N="843" /> time, energy and money uselessly proceeding along this futile course, and that we would only ask on the 27th July to hold up that Bill, because bringing it in under certain circumstances gave it a colouring the House did not want.</P>

      <P>I say certain aspects of it, but I do not say it went to the full extent.  I am making my case for the Initiative, but as far as the Referendum is concerned nobody has attempted to befriend it or argue for its being kept in the Constitution.  If there are to be amendments to it, and one does not object to the root principles of the amendments, it can be amended.  Personally, I do not see any change that could be made other than taking it out of the Constitution. Again, I want you to consider what you would do by taking these two Articles out of the Constitution.  One does not prevent the setting up of machinery for referring Articles to the people, and one does not prevent the establishment of initiating machinery, but one does not want to say it shall not be compulsory&mdash;it shall not be an Article of the Constitution which says it shall be done.  If people want to use the machinery of the Initiative or the Referendum they may do so, but we state definitely and clearly that we do not propose to do it or do not want to make any use of it, but people hereafter will not be precluded from utilising either the Referendum or the Initiative by taking out these Articles.  All they are asked is to say that these two Articles shall not be in the Constitution and not be compulsory on the Government to operate.  Senator Sir John Keane has spoken of systems of popular government, and he referred to the old-time ideas with regard to the method of refreshments and the method of the big stick.  One would not, I think, look to Senator Sir John Keane as an authority on popular government in Ireland, even though he has his new ally, Senator <Col N="844" /> Dowdall, with him for the purpose. I do not think they as a combination make an authority on popular government in this country.</P>

      <P>The Senator said he wanted to discuss this motion in no party spirit, and he referred to the Party with which he is supposed to be associated.  One does not know where the Senator will eventually carry his wandering feet.  Senator O'Farrell referred to, and it seems to be brought into this as argument, the attitude of Australia and this country towards conscription.  Senator MacLoughlin introduced it in a particular atmosphere. Senator O'Farrell takes from it that Senator MacLoughlin as spokesman for the Government was recommending to the people, including Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Dowdall, that if legislation be passed of which they did not approve their only resort would be to violence.  There is no such suggestion.  Senator MacLoughlin brought in his reference in that respect in a particular context and in a particular atmosphere.  The argument of Senator MacLoughlin was in answer to Senator O'Farrell as to dealing with legislation by an alien government.  If a government gets strong enough to bring in conscription it will do so only when it believes there is popular support behind it.  If there is not that popular support for its policy, it will not last long, and there are ways and means of overcoming it without violence.  Tyrannical government determined to go on in spite of popular opposition is not going to be held off its course in regard to conscription by a referendum.  The Senator has gone out of his way to insult his fellow-Senators by the suggestion that Senators vote simply as they are told, that they are swayed in the direction that the Government wants them, that they do not use their reason to decide <Col N="845" /> issues for themselves, and that they simply take orders and vote as they are told.  I suggest that that is an egotistical attitude for Senator O'Farrell to adopt, and that when he asks Senators to vote according to their conscience the suggestion is there that they will not vote according to their consciences but that he will vote according to his conscience.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Farrell said there are people who say certain things privately but who have not the courage to say them publicly.  That is an argument that should not be introduced, as it is open to the objection that the Senator has not quoted anyone who has said anything of the sort.  This argument on conscription does not fit into the setting.  In the Dáil we had the surprising spectacle that we had the one member of the Oireachtas who could be described as his Majesty's only conscript putting up an amendment that people who were in the Army, whether on full pay or on half pay or were retired Army people, should not be allowed to vote.  That was from a man who can be described as a conscript of his Majesty's Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fitting we should do so, for we have had enough of Senator O'Farrell's egotism.  Leaving conscription aside, we are asked is this House going to be merely a House for the registration of the point of view of the Dáil?  The Seanad should have a point of view of its own, and that point of view is surely expressed in the Report of the Committee.  In so far as this Bill goes outside, whatever the <Col N="846" /> view the Seanad put forward, there is an explanation given as to why these extra points should be included.  I ask the Senators to neglect what the Dáil has done, and to make up their minds as to whether it is right and suitable at this moment to take out these Articles, and to do it on the ground not of opportunism, but because it is a thing that should have been done on the 27th July last, when we first intended to do it, but when, in deference to certain points put before the Dáil, and in deference to other things, the matter was not then proceeded with. I ask the Seanad to recognise further &mdash;for I believe this House has some appreciation of popular feeling&mdash;that it is not acting simply as if an entirely nominated body aloof from the people, and to understand that there is a certain amount of popular feeling with regard to these Articles which we tested at the last election.  If it is complained that people are not being left their rights, remember that in July of 1927 we brought in an amendment of the Constitution in a particular respect, and we indicated that thereafter we intended to go the full length.  We were told it was a bad thing to test the people's feelings about, and we were criticised for springing an election and actually having the temerity to appeal to the people against the allocation of people in the Dáil who we believed did not represent the people.  We did test the point of view of the people about the change of the Constitution.  We are taking from the people no rights they ought to have, and which they would be angry or enraged by having them taken from them.  If they are enraged at that, then the day of reckoning will not be far off.  Remember, we believe, as the Minister for Agriculture said in the other House, that there are not five per cent. of the people who care anything about these two Articles, and we do not believe it will form any big item in the final account against us at an election, and we ask the Seanad to share in that belief.</P>

      <P>This is not the Minister's Bill as it was suggested by the cattle trade, in order to provide funds to compensate people whose cattle were slaughtered in the outbreaks of disease that occurred in 1925-26.  Many members will remember that I raised this matter three years ago in this House, and tried to impress upon the Government the necessity for compensating the owners of these cattle.  I pointed out the great hardship and injustice these people suffered, and that it was a disgrace that the British Government, the Northern Government and our Government should not have arranged to compensate people whose cattle were slaughtered three or four years ago.  The cattle trade did not ask for the Bill, but as it is the best way out of the difficulty they accepted it. It was my intention to move some amendments, but I have been requested by the cattle trade to accept the Bill as it now stands, and to ask the Seanad to pass it without amendment.  The cattle trade is responsible for the measure, and it is their privilege to tax themselves to provide the funds to pay compensation and to guard against other contingencies of the same kind which might arise.  The Bill is not contentious, and I ask the Seanad to pass it.</P>

      <P>As one who was interested from the start in this matter, and who took a deep interest in trying to see that these people would be paid for their cattle, I hold stronger views on the matter than perhaps my friend Senator Counihan.  I always thought that where cattle were slaughtered in the public interest there should be no hesitation in paying for them out of the public purse.  It was in the public interest these cattle were slaughtered, and England, with all her boasted sense of justice, should have paid for them. The claim was a very deserving one, and as England has so long been identified with our cattle trade I thought it a very small position to take up, to refuse compensation for the sake af four or five thousand pounds, when already <Col N="849" /> over five millions compensation had been paid to cattle owners in England.  It was miserable to refuse to pay because an Order in Council was passed contracting out of liability.  The cattle trade, with the concurrence and approval of the Minister for Agriculture, got this Bill introduced.  I am glad that it is non-contentious.  It is in the interest of the cattle trade that it should be passed, and we all hope that the fund that is to be provided will be ample to meet all future demands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Section 1, sub-section (2).  To insert after the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  No income tax or super-tax shall be charged in respect of compounded arrears of rent payable under the Land Act, 1923, until such arrears have been actually paid to the person entitled to the same.  Any income tax or super-tax that has already been paid on such unpaid compounded arrears of rent, either by direct assessment or by set-off against other moneys due, shall be refunded.  Where such arrears are payable in stock, both income tax and super-tax shall be likewise payable in the same stock at parity value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is put down in order to obtain from the Government some declaration of their policy and intentions in this matter.  Cases have come to my notice where demands or efforts are being made to obtain super-tax on compounded arrears of rent that have <Col N="850" /> never been collected or paid to the owners or those entitled to them.  As the House knows, a certain moiety of compounded arrears was made payable under the Land Act of 1923 and have been collected, and so far as that transaction is concerned there is no reason for complaint.  But under the Act of 1927 the uncollected amount, roughly the remaining half, is not to be collected in cash at all.  It is going to be issued in the form of stock and ultimately, when the lands are vested. added to the purchase money and paid in stock to the former owner.  Cases have come to my notice where pressure was placed on owners actually to pay super-tax on such futurities, or, to put it in another way, on the prospects of that stock that may some day arise. The argument is that the liability arises under Schedule A there and then. Whether the amount is ever collected or not does not come into the case at all.  Even on strict law I do not believe that that could be sustained, because under the Act of 1927 the contractual basis that underlies the whole of that is swept away.  The landlord's right to collect such rent disappeared by statute, but in any case it is hardly to be expected that owners would contest this, because if the Government wish to fight it they can go to the High Court and the Court of Appeal.  It is unthinkable that owners would be compelled to take that course.</P>
    <P>Whatever the law may be, we know that in practice the Revenue Commissioners have power to make concessions. I went personally to a high official in the office of the Special Commissioner with a definite case where pressure had been put on for such payment, and I was told that it was not the intention of the Revenue Commissioners to press.  In that case I have reason to believe that nothing further was done. I doubt if it was a unique case, and I should, at least, like an assurance from the Government that there have been no cases where such claims were actually met, because that would be&mdash;I do not like to use the words false pretences or language as strong as that&mdash; I suggest under misapprehension, as if the taxpayers had known how to handle the matter they would never <Col N="851" /> have paid it.  That only refers to direct payments; but there are other cases which I wish to deal with, where payment is actually being met by a set-off. Where the Government had liabilities to an individual for compensation they have, I know&mdash;and I can give private particulars to the Minister&mdash;deducted super-tax on these amounts that are going to be paid some day&mdash;no one knows when.  The legality of that is, I think, open to question, and certainly in all reason payments should not be exacted until the moneys come to hand. Moreover, these set-offs have been made in the form of cash, whereas the amounts are going to be paid in stock, and at least the set-offs should have some relation to the cash value of the stock.  In some cases, I think, this is a great injustice to the taxpayers.  I firmly believe that the Revenue Commissioners have power to act by way of concession, and I would ask the Minister if that attitude cannot be adopted and announced, and if any payment made owing to inadvertence or lack of vigilance on the part of the taxpayer will be held or credited against future liabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The first three amendments are amendments which I tabled, together with an amendment lower down, which is consequential&mdash; I think it is No. 12.  I tabled these to meet the point of view that was expressed by the amendment brought forward by Senator Hooper some three weeks ago.  I would like to have an expression of opinion from the House if these four amendments, which in fact, hang together, are to be considered as alternative to, say, the amendment which Senator Sir Edward Bigger has down, and to the amendments running from No. 7 to 15, with the exception of No. 12, also in the name of Senator Sir Edward Bigger. In other words, I would like to know <Col N="854" /> where I am before we begin to discuss this first amendment, and if an amendment either of the type that I have set down in Amendment No. 1&mdash;and I think that that even might be amended &mdash;or some of the amendments which Senator Dowdall and others have down, is to wipe out the Third Schedule, whether Amendments 7 to 15, with the exception of 12, would disappear.  I think that that was the arrangement that was made.  Senator Hooper brought forward an amendment, the net effect of which was this, that we were to do away with this nomination of people for inclusion in the schedule, putting on those people an examination before they were allowed to come on the register of dentists.  Senator Hooper's amendment set out certain conditions&mdash;that they were to be so many years in the practice of dentistry, to be citizens of Soarstát Eireann, and a variety of other things.  I went through the amendment when it was brought up in order to get some clarity on the matter, and I asked if it would be agreed that these provisions would be taken to include certain other matters that were brought in.  There was no means of deciding it, but I thought I had a certain provisional agreement for an amendment of this sort.  I hold that Amendment No. 1 will carry out all that the House seemed to agree to when I was speaking on Senator Hooper's amendment.  Certain Senators queried me outside the House with regard to paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of this proposed Section 28: &ldquo;That he was on the 31st day of December, 1928, not less than twenty-one years of age.&rdquo;  The reason for that amendment is this: Senator Hooper's idea was that a person who had been earning his livelihood by the practice of dentistry for a period not less than ten years before the date of the passing of the Bill should be allowed to go on the register.  I took that point, and I put a query to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked it to consider the fact that those who passed to the Dentists Register by way of examination could not sit for the final examination until applicants for the final examination were twenty-one years of age, and consequently that they could not practice before twenty-one years of age.  I <Col N="855" /> asked the House to agree that for those people coming on without examination a rule not less rigorous than that should be applied.  I took it that the House had agreed to that.  I may be wrong&mdash;it might not be the period that the House would insist on&mdash;but that it was the period which the House deemed it to be necessary for a man to be in the practice of dentistry before he went on the register and that that ten years' practice must have taken place after his twenty-first year, and then, if paragraph (b) operates, he must have been twenty-one years of age in 1918, seeing that the Bill is to pass in 1928, and we have to argue back from that. Certain Senators thought that a ten years' period is too much to impose on those practising dentists, although illegally practising, and they say that that period should be reduced to five years, and Senator Dowdall wants the age limit correspondingly reduced.  If the period of practice was reduced from ten to five years paragraph (b) must either be changed, having a man 16 years of age in December, 1918, or 21 years of age in December, 1923.</P>
    <P>I hold that the rest of the amendment carries out all that the Seanad seemed to me to be agreed on&mdash;that the person must be a citizen of Saorstát Eireann, must be of a certain age, must have been a certain number of years in practice, and must not have been guilty in the course of his practice of any crime or conduct which, if he had at that time been a registered dentist would have caused his removal from the register.  I make paragraph (b) cover the practice of dentistry, including the work of dental mechanics, and I make a further recommendation that if a person applied for the examination and succeeded in passing it he should be entitled to go on to the register.  There is no difficulty about allowing these people on the register, and consequently it will be done if the House agrees.  The fourth paragraph limits the examination that shall be held to five months and before the expiration of six months.  I think that that is entirely in line with Senator Hooper's amendment.  But it <Col N="856" /> has been pointed out to me that we did give certain people the right to more than one examination, and Senator Dowdall has an amendment providing that there shall be two examinations, one at the end of six months and the other at the end of two years.  That, I think, is far too long, but I do not think there will be much objection to allowing two examinations, one at the end of five months and before six months have elapsed, and the other at the end of the twelve months' period; but of course with this limitation that practice will be allowed to those who do not go in for the first examination only for the first period, and that those who have not entered for the first examination, or, having entered, fail to pass it, will not be allowed to practise beyond the five months' period unless they succeed in the second examination and are entitled to go on the register. This may have to be modified to meet that point of view, if the House wants to meet the point of view that there should be two examinations, one within six months and the other at the end of the twelve months' period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to see what view Senator Hooper takes on that when he puts forward his amendment. There is a view that it would be too hard to ask these people to have one examination only at the end of such a short period as five months, and that they should be given a longer period.  I would then be prepared to amend this amendment of mine so as to enable two examinations to be held, one not less than five months and not later than six months, and the other at the end of a year from the passing of the Bill.  In saying so much I have, more or less put forward my arguments against the other amendments that are to be proposed.  Senator Dowdall wants to reduce the period of the practice from ten years to five.  On that I would ask the House again to consider that there has been no Bill which has been viewed in a more detached way from the departmental side than this.  It has been viewed from <Col N="857" /> outside the Department that will have the administration of it.  I only came into this by accident.  Consequently, there has not been the same departmental anxiety about it as there would otherwise have been.  There is no prejudice about it, departmentally or otherwise.  The simple thing that Senators will have to consider is: Do they think it right to allow people with only five years' practice to get the professional status of fully-qualified dentists, because that is what is being given?  I ask them to bear in mind the Report of the Committee which was set up in Great Britain which definitely did point out that after examination they believed that a considerable amount of the defects that were then observable in the public health were due to the fact that such a large number of unregistered dentists were practising freely through the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to stress the fact that there is the consideration that in return for a certain number of years' practice, we are giving people for the rest of their professional live the fullest professional status.  They will be fully qualified dentists.  They will meet dentists who are qualified by way of examination on an equal footing.  They will have equal rights.  I think we should demand, as a consideration in return for that, that there should be a fairly lengthy period of practice.  In addition, I would like to point this out, that the British Act of 1921 was founded on the Report of a Committee set up in 1917, and which, I think, reported at the end of 1918 or at the beginning of 1919, and that the unlicensed and the unregistered type of dentist in that particular kind of practice were going to be done away with. There was no reason to believe that that legislation would not have been carried over to this country and, in fact, there is reason to believe that that legislation is law in this country. It has not been operated up to the present because of a defect of machinery which could very easily be got over, and people have been practising in this country under conditions that it must have been obvious to themselves were clearly and entirely illegal.  In return, however, for a certain amount of illegal practice we are going to allow <Col N="858" /> these people to become certified dentists. I urge these considerations against a five years' period, and I say that a ten years' period is just barely sufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Decidedly.  An examination was compulsory under the British Act of 1921.  There were two classes of people.  The British Act decided that people who had been engaged as dentists, that is, in full practice, operating as dentists in the fullest sense of the word, should be allowed on without an examination if for seven years immediately preceding the passing of the Act they had been engaged in dentistry. But there was a second class, the dental mechanic, and the dental mechanic, if he had an equivalent practice of seven years, had to pass an examination. We make no division here, but we say that all alike should pass an examination.  If the Third Schedule people, whose cases have been examined into by the various Committees, are of the calibre that the three Committees thought they were, they will have no difficulty in passing the examination. If they are not, they are not people who should operate as dentists.  Senator Dowdall wants to give a standard for the examination.  I did not advert to that in the amendment, because I took Senator Hooper's words, and I thought from the acclamation with which his words on that point were greeted, that there was agreement that the examination was to be of the type ordinarily set for a final examination, and that would be the type of examination which the Board or the Minister would have set. Senator Dowdall wants to make it another standard, and to that I object. We are giving these people a status that they have no right to expect.  In return we ought to demand from them, in the interests of the public, that there will be a certain period of practice and that they shall be able to pass an examination of a particularly difficult standard, such an examination as the ordinary man sitting for his final examination would be able to pass.</P>

      <P>I feel considerable satisfaction with the action that has been taken, and I would like to express my appreciation of the way the Minister has met the points put forward.  I would like to explain that my Amendment 4 is not intended in any way as a substitute for the Minister's amendment. I merely put it on the Paper in order to preserve the position that existed last day before the Minister expressed his willingness to reconsider the question.  I visualised the possibility that in this discussion there might not be agreement on this matter, and that it might be decided to adhere to the Third Schedule.  It was only in that case that I put down my amendment, in order to give the men excluded from Schedule 3 one final opportunity of proving, by examination, their competence, and consequently their right to be included on the register.  It seems that now Schedule 3 should go, and consequently it will not be necessary for me to propose this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> Some of the Minister's remarks seemed to me to suggest that he does not quite appreciate some of the points I made the last day; at least he and I were not of the one mind on some of them.  I suggested a ten years' period of practice to qualify a man to sit for this examination.  The Minister suggested that that ten years should start after 21, and he has embodied that idea in his amendment.  What really happened was that he suggested that whatever term were agreed to, it should begin after the man had reached 21.  I then asked him if he would suggest a period of years.  I certainly did not agree then to a period of ten years after 21, and I am opposed to it now. When I suggested a term of years he left the matter over for consideration. So far as I am concerned, he misunderstood me if he thought that I agreed to ten years after 21.</P>
    <P>Another point is in regard to the examination.  I agreed on that occasion that the examination should be the ordinary examination set for the dental degree.  My idea was that it would be a stiffer examination than the examination set under the British Act, and I did say, in speaking to my amendment, that I would be prepared to have the Dental Board fix any standard it wished.  I still adhere to that, but, of course, I take it that it will be a standard of practical competence. At that time I was arguing on behalf of men who were already excluded from Schedule 3.  They were more or less the outcasts of the applicants, and it was in order to get them some chance of proving their competence that I was willing, as I still am in case of necessity, to agree to any standard that the Dental Board might set up. For the same reason I was in favour of a ten-years' period, to give these men some chance.  I thought then that ten years was rather too long, but it was in the hope of getting a concession for them that I put that in.  In my original draft of the amendment I stated that a man should be seven years in practice before sitting for this examination.  If the schedule were to stand, I would still agree to both these propositions.  But now that Schedule 3 is gone, and these men are thrown into the common pool, I think it probably <Col N="861" /> would be better if the period was reduced from ten years to seven years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. HOOPER Mr. HOOPER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not.  On the question of age, under the Minister's proposal a man would be 31 at the end of this year before he becomes qualified, and when he sits for the examination.  That does seem to be an excessively high age to fix.  In a great number of these cases it would mean that a man would be fifteen years engaged in dentistry before he could sit for this examination.  It is well known that a number of apprentices begin work at about sixteen, and this would mean that they would be fifteen or fifteen-and-a-half years before they could sit for the examination. Surely that is far too long.  I have an amendment down that would make the age 26, and Senator Sir Edward Bigger also has an amendment to that effect.  I hope the Minister will see his way to agree to that.  I think these are the only points really that arise, and if the Minister could consider them, we could get agreement on the whole amendment now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardBigger" hpid="Sir EDWARD BIGGER Sir EDWARD BIGGER">
      <NameTxt>Sir EDWARD BIGGER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with this matter from a point of view on which the Minister has not touched, that is, from the public health point of view.  In the Free State we cannot dispense with a single competent dentist, though I am entirely against putting a dentist on the register who is not competent.  But if we provide a practical examination which will ensure that the dentists who have been engaged in dentistry for six years, as I propose, are allowed to go on the register, and make either the Dental Board or the Medical Council responsible for seeing that they are competent dentists, it would meet the case.  We cannot do without a single one, because there is a vast amount of ill-health and disease caused through lack of dental treatment, such as enlarged glands, tuberculosis, rheumatism, blood-poisoning, and septic pneumonia, especially septic pneumonia, which, as you all know, is one of the <Col N="862" /> most fatal diseases.  Every competent dentist in this country, or in any other country, is doing great work in preventing these diseases.  I have examined statistics, and I find that in England they have one dentist for every 3,100 of the population.  The proportion of dentists to the population in the Free State is something like half that.  I have made out a rough calculation, and I believe that I am right in stating that there are 300,000 people in the Free State who require dental treatment, but who cannot get it.  For that reason, now that we are going to close the door, we should be sure before we do so that we allow as many as we can in, so long as they are competent.</P>
      <P>This was the reason that induced the Minister for Health in England to bring in the 1921 Act.  I was in close touch at that time with the Minister for Health, and I was horrified when he mentioned that he was very anxious to get registered a very large number of unregistered dentists, but when he produced certain figures that I went into with him I found that he was perfectly right.  In the ordinary course of dental education, with a four years' course, the process is very slow.  After the passing of the 1921 Act there were 5,000 dentists registered in the United Kingdom, and in the next year over 7,200 unqualified men were put on the register&mdash; a 60 per cent. increase on the English register.  Here we are doing everything we can to prevent the same class of people getting on.  I think that that would be a dreadful mistake for the country.  Furthermore, the British Dental Board allowed mechanics not only to go on in 1921 and 1922, but they have been allowing the examinations to be continued ever since, and these examinations are to continue for three years more&mdash;until July, 1931. Every year a certain number of mechanics are allowed to go in for that examination, and if they fail in any one year they can go forward again.  They have been passing ever since, and in one year something like 400 passed.  We fall short of our requirements, and for every dentist that we exclude, if he is competent, we are condemning a certain number of people to ill-health, and possibly to death.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a few words on the Minister's amendment, and in support of what Senator Hooper and Senator Bigger said.  When I was appointed on the Committee to deal with this matter, let me be perfectly candid and say that I had not read a line of the Bill.  I had the idea, as I think the Minister has, that these men who were practising dentistry are quacks and what is usually summed up in the word &ldquo;quack.&rdquo; When I came into contact with my colleagues on the Committee, Senator Sir Edward Bigger and Senator O'Sullivan, I was amazed to find that they, as well as the members of the Dáil, regarded a great many of the unregistered dental practitioners as people who were fulfilling a very useful function to the community and doing very good service.  After I had heard all that I came to regard the question in a totally different light.  Within the recollection of most of us a medical register was provided here.  A dental register has been compiled in England, and we are now compiling a dental register in this country.  This Bill proposes to make provision &ldquo;for the registration and control of persons practising dentistry and dental surgery and for other purposes relating to the practice of dentistry or dental surgery, etc.&rdquo;  The manner in which these men become engaged in the practice of dentistry is that they are indentured apprentices who afterwards practise as dentists.  This procedure is followed by men who do not proceed by way of examination.  While the Minister's amendment does seek to meet Senator Hooper, I consider it very unreasonable and absolutely restrictive on a great many men who are well qualified to do all that is necessary.  By fixing the age and the date, the amendment prevents these men from practising and from becoming registered dentists until they are 31 or 32 years of age.  A considerable number of these men are 24 or 27 years of age.  They have served a long apprenticeship, and after doing that they practised for a number of years.  The effect of the Minister's amendment would be that these men would be ruled out automatically. They would be knocked out of the practice that they have built up, <Col N="864" /> and at a time of their lives when they certainly are not young.  They simply would be put on the scrap-heap and would probably have to seek another occupation in life.  I have a number of amendments down, and I am anxious to know whether I will move them now.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the arguments put forward by Senator Sir Edward Bigger and Senator Dowdall. I think that the proposal in the Minister's amendment would inflict great hardship on a certain section of the community, on men who have given the greater part of their lives to the practice of dentistry.  The Minister insists on the period of ten years.  I might mention the case of an applicant in whom I am interested.  He has had nine and a half years experience.  I think it would be very hard if he were ruled out.  In the first place he served <Col N="865" /> five years to dentistry in Belfast.  After that he came to a provincial town and established a first-class practice there. The people are so well satisfied as to how he does his business that they are flocking to him for relief.  He has even done more than establish a successful business.  He has got married and is rearing a family in the country.  He is prepared to live in the country, and do the best he can in the interests of his profession and of his colleagues.  He has been in successful practice for over four years, and I think it would be very hard lines indeed if such a man were obliged to leave the country.  If he is ruled out, it will be simply adding to the army of the unemployed.  I hope that the Minister will be able to see his way to extend the period so as to meet cases of that sort.  I hold that if men of this kind are driven out of practice that we will not get expert dentists to come and settle down in small provincial towns.  I think the public will be well protected when you require these people to pass the prescribed standard of examination before they are allowed to go on the register.  You have the guarantee that they have been in practice for a number of years.  I hope that in the interests of humanity and of the many deserving men who have been in practice for a long number of years, that the Minister will see his way to extend the period.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a few words on the Minister's amendment. Perhaps we might be able to arrive at a satisfactory solution with regard to all the amendments if we had a little good-will all round.  I must say that I have a good deal of sympathy with the stand taken by the Minister to see that the people who will be practising will have the necessary qualifications to perform the work properly.  I think we are all in sympathy with that point of view, but then of course we have to remember the extraordinary conditions that prevail here, and the number of people whose living is bound up with their work as <Col N="866" /> dentists.  They were sent to serve their apprenticeship as mechanics or dentists at a very early age, and they have now been practising for a number of years. The Minister has stated that as a compromise he would accept the figure eight.  Perhaps we might be able to arrive at agreement by making it 21 years of age on the 31st December, 1921&mdash;that would be seven years preceding the passing of this Act.  That is the compromise that I suggest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposition of the Senator is in fact to reduce the ten-year period of practice to seven. That as a consequence would entail that this 21-year period from 1928 must be substituted by something else.  You can substitute it in either of two ways in accordance with that view.  It must read either that he was 21 on the 31st December, 1918, or that he was 18 years of age on the 31st December, 1921.  As I said before, if that alteration were accepted there is another small point that I would require to have attention given to later.

The amendment now means, in effect, that the majority of the people who are concerned in this matter will have had to have been twelve years at practice before they are allowed to stand for this examination. I do not think it can be contradicted that it is the common practice, as I have said before, for these people to go and learn dentistry at the age of fifteen or sixteen years.  The majority, I think, go about the age of sixteen. If the age limit is fixed at 28, it means that they must have been engaged at dentistry for twelve years.  I say that is too long a period.  I have an amendment down which fixes the age at 23 instead of 21, which is now proposed. That amendment gives the age at 26, and the period of practice at ten years.</P>

      <P>It is not the question of the age of a man.  It is a question of how long he must be in practice.  If the House assents to a particular period I ask it to assent further to this: that practice is to be counted after the period of apprenticeship or from the period he actually begins to practise.  I have had people who sent certificates that they were apprenticed at the age of thirteen, and does the Senator like to make the case that they must have been fifteen years in practice? If a certain class of man is not allowed to sit for his examination until he is 21, why should you allow those people who have been practising illegally up to this to include a period of so-called practice they have had before their twenty-first year?  Senator Sir Edward Bigger spoke about public health, and mentioned that he had a close and intimate knowledge of the matter about which we are speaking.  I took that as a responsible statement, and I had it queried.  I am assured by the Department of Public Health that they have no fear about the future in the respect indicated by the Senator. Does he know many dentists who are rushed off their feet through work?</P>

      <P>I protest against this.  The whole Bill is founded on a statement made by the dental profession generally with regard to the 1921 legislation.  We intended to see it operating in this country and that if any particular legislation is brought in here to regularise the position, we were going to have the 1921 and 1927 classes.  I shall do all I can to ask the Dáil to refuse this amendment, if we are to weaken it and allow a period of seven years practice with a consequential arrangement as to age.  I ask <Col N="870" /> any man who is responsible in his attitude to public health to read the Report of the Committee in which it stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have considered most carefully the different representations which have been made to us and we are of opinion that in the interests of the public, more especially that section of it which is usually described as the working classes, dental practice by unqualified persons should be prohibited under penalty, and that the most satisfactory way of distinguishing a qualified from an unqualified person is by the formation of a register of qualified persons.  Unqualified persons should not be permitted to hold themselves out as willing to practise dentistry or perform dental operations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the basis of these recommendations was framed the 1921 Act.  From the Report of that Committee it was seen that practice by these people after the passage of that Act was going to be entirely prohibited.  Are we going to allow the residue of all the quacks of the United Kingdom who have come here to practise, when they knew it was illegal, and validate all that, and put that type of man on the same standing as the professional man?</P>

It is well for the House to remember that under that Act unregistered practitioners in England can still sit for the examination for three years to come.  We are limiting our unregistered practitioners to twelve months from the passing of the Act.  That is much more restricted and the examination in England was one simply of a practical character, in which a man had to prove that he could extract and fill teeth and do the other work usually done by dental practitioners.  I had some fear that the standard of examination should be up to the standard set students who passed through the University.  That really is not what the Bill means.  It is certainly not what I meant.</P>
