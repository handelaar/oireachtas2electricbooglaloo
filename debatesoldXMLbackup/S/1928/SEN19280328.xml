    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain provisions of this Order to which I object. They put taxation on certain areas of County Cork which hitherto had not been charged with the expenses of the Cork Intercepting Hospital.  It appears from the Bill that the necessity for this Order arose from the fact that the town of Passage West became an urban district recently, and it was necessary to apportion the charge for the maintenance and up-keep of the hospital at the Port of Cork between that <Col N="273" /> town and the adjoining rural areas.  If the apportionment had been made between the town of Passage West and the remaining portion of the rural districts, I would not have anything to say to the matter, but in making the Order the Minister has extended the area of charge to include the whole of the County of Cork.  He has included districts that are nearly one hundred miles away from the port of Cork.  He has included districts that have ports of their own which would be required to provide for any sea-borne cases of disease that might come into their ports.  I have been asked by the Committee of the Board of Health for the western portion of Cork to oppose this provision in the Bill, and I suggest to the Minister that he should make an alteration, whereby the charge will be confined to the existing area and not be placed on ratepayers who were hitherto not liable for the upkeep of this hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that when Senator Linehan hears what I have to say he will perhaps realise that we have proceeded in the only way possible in this matter.  The Cork Port Sanitary Authority is involved including the county borough, the old rural districts of Cork, Middleton, Kinsale and the urban district of Cobh.  In 1921 the town of Passage West became an urban district.  Since the passing <Col N="274" /> of the Local Government Act the rural districts of Cork, Middleton and Kinsale have been done away with and the sanitary authority for the whole county of Cork is now the Board of Health.  So that we had to transfer to the new sanitary authority the responsibility both administrative and financial, that rested on their predecessors, that is on the three rural districts.  A very small amount of money is involved in this matter.  The expenditure for the year ending March, 1926, was £705 0s. 0d. of which £425 0s. 0d. was borne by Cork city; between Cork, Middleton and Kinsale rural district councils, £211 0s. 0d.; and Cobh urban district £70 0s. 0d. The ratio in which the charge was distributed was 60 per cent. to Cork Borough; 30 per cent. to the rural districts, and 10 per cent. to Cobh. Passage which has become an urban district was not one of the rural districts and it could be argued that possibly it should bear five per cent. of the cost.  But considering the circumstances there and the comparison between Passage and Cork port it was decided that five per cent. of the charge would be entirely too great for Passage. What is proposed now is that instead of Cork Borough bearing 60 per cent. it is to bear 62½ per cent., approximately £450 0s. 0d.; instead of the three rural districts combined bearing 30 per cent., the county as a whole now bears 25 per cent., approximately £190 0s. 0d.; Cobh bears ten per cent., approximately £70 0s. 0d.; Passage West 2½ per cent., amounting to £17 0s. 0d.  The Cork County Board of Health must have representation on the Port Sanitary Authority and as a matter of fact has five members as against twelve for Cork County Borough; Cobh urban district two and Passage one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as administrative responsibility is concerned the County Cork Board of Health cannot escape it, and as far as financial responsibility is concerned it is a question of £190 0s. 0d. spread over the whole county.  I think Senator Linehan's argument is that the previous charge should be kept over the old area as a separate charge.  In the first place the amounts are very small and, speaking from my <Col N="275" /> knowledge of Local Government matters, I am personally very anxious to get away from small areas of charge for matters that really affect health and are of any public concern.  We find very great difficulty dealing with water and sewerage supplies with small areas of charge and I feel that we must very quickly get to the position in which the county at large must be the area of charge for these matters. As I say £190 0s. 0d. is spread over the area of the Cork County Board of Health which must bear the responsibility which was formerly that of the rural districts.  I think the matter is a very small one and that what is suggested might keep us more and more to these small areas of charge and hold up very important public policy.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Senator to consider that there is very little involved, and I do not see on what other lines we could proceed without working on a very bad principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  I think we must either accept it as it is or reject it, so that the Senator is quite in order in raising his objection now if he he is going to oppose the Second Reading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the amount of money involved at present is not large.  It is only a trifle, but that may be because very few seaborne cases of serious disease have come into Cork within the period for which the Minister gave figures.  It is quite possible, however, in case of an outbreak of smallpox, plague, or some other disease, that the cost might be very high.  It is the principle contained in this Bill that I object to, putting taxation on people who <Col N="276" /> hitherto were not liable for it, and doing so without the consent of those people.  If this Order had been submitted to the representatives of the ratepayers in these districts, and if they accepted the liability, I would have nothing to say to the matter.</P>

This is the time to object, and I hope that the Seanad will agree that this proposal is an injustice, even though the amount involved is small. I ask the Seanad to reject the principle put forward in the Bill&mdash;placing taxation on persons who have not hitherto been liable for it.</P>

    <P>Question: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming this Bill which at this Stage is like a death-bed repentance as we are going to make restitution to the people from whom we filched a shilling some years ago&mdash;the most defenceless section of the community&mdash;I regret that the Minister has not gone the whole way and come back to the position we were in before the cut in the old age pensions took place.  Under the provisions of this Bill it is proposed that certain people will get back the shilling that was taken off the pensions some years ago, but the question as to means has not been brought back to that stage.  I am glad the Minister has brought in this Bill even though it only makes restitution to certain numbers of the old age pensioners, but I regret that he has not gone the whole-hog because it appears to me <Col N="277" /> a premium is being put on thriftlessness. A person who may have been thrifty during life and saved a little money is going to be penalised because of that fact.  Most of the old age pensioners belong to the working class and many of that class pay contributions weekly to trades unions, tontine societies and friendly benefit societies so that when past their labour they will have some provision for their old age. The dreadful trades unions of which we hear so much condemnation have what is known as superannuation funds for men and women and after a certain number of years membership these people are entitled to an allowance.  The same thing applies to many of the friendly benefit societies.  What really happens now with the regulations that have been made with regard to the means is, that most of these trades unions and friendly societies have reduced the superannuation allowance to their members, because if they gave it the State would be evading its responsibility. Under this Bill a person would be entitled to have an income up to six shillings a week in order to get an increase of one shilling in the old age pension.  In other words, an income of £15 12s. would entitle a person to receive the full benefit of this Bill and get ten shillings a week.  If a person had seven shillings a week, the State would reduce the amount of the benefit by one shilling a week, and he would only get a pension of nine shillings.  Now that the Government is prepared to make some restitution to the old age pensioners it is to be regretted that they have not gone the whole hog.  Apart from party, I think every section of the community is satisfied that the aged poor should be provided for; people that have given their life's service in and to the State, in their old age ought at least to get what would keep them in decency and comfort. Having regard to the cost of necessaries to-day, no one can say that the magnificent sum of sixteen shillings is sufficient to keep body and soul together. I regret that the Minister has not come back to the position we were in before the change in the pensions was made.  Nevertheless, we are thankful for small mercies, and I congratulate <Col N="278" /> the Minister for having restored the cut to the poorest of the old age pensioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know if the Minister would give the House any indication of the policy of the Government with regard to the finding of the Committee on Unemployment, particularly in regard to its recommendations on the housing problem. That is a matter of course that involves finance and, to be effective, involves, I think, the floating of a housing loan. If anything is going to be done during the year 1928 it is essential that the Government should get a move on quickly because building is very largely a seasonal occupation and it is necessary that steps should be taken to utilise as far as possible the summer months and the finer portion of the year when we have long days and comparatively fine weather.  This is an exceedingly important matter at the present time because by tackling this question we would help to solve two crying evils, the evil of the shortage of houses and the evil of unemployment.  That Committee was set up to consider measures by which immediate steps could be taken to relieve unemployment.  The Committee acted in that spirit, acted with the greatest possible expedition, and delivered its findings I think in record time.  I hope the Minister will be able to assure the House now that its findings are not going to be hung up indefinitely.  Statements are being made these days on public platforms in connection with a by-election regarding the alleged intentions of the Government in regard to this matter.  It is a matter that affects the whole body of citizens and we would like to have some authoritative statement, not a platform statement, in regard to a matter of this kind.  We have before us the example of the Australian Commonwealth. In his last Budget statement, the Minister for Finance there indicated <Col N="279" /> that the State proposed to make available in the near future&mdash;I think he meant within the financial year&mdash;a sum of not less than £20,000,000 for housing purposes, to enable citizens to purchase or build their own houses and in addition to help local authorities and others to provide houses for the people.  That was done by a State that has at present a public debt amongst all the States of the Commonwealth over one thousand millions sterling.  We have a comparatively negligible debt and I do not know of any other commodity for which there is a more certain market than housing.  That market is available whether the houses are cheap or dear, whether prices are reasonable or excessive. I do not know of any other purpose for which the Government could more readily or more successfully float a loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think our credit is good enough for the flotation of a fairly substantial housing loan and I do not think it is helping the national credit for Ministers or members of their Party to state emphatically on public platforms that that credit is dependent on the result of one single by-election.  I take it that it is quite fair to make reasonable statements at an election for the purpose of getting votes, but I do not think the credit of the State should be publicly pledged or be said to depend entirely on the result of a by-election.  I hope whatever the result of the by-election be that the Government will take this finding of the Committee on unemployment seriously and try to act on the very statesmanlike and practical proposals submitted, the principal one of which was, the inauguration of a ten years' continuous housing programme which it was hoped would help to solve the housing problem and at the same time give employment to thousands of men at present out of work.  That would be of infinitely more importance and be of more interest to the citizens as a whole, particularly to the unemployed men, than any decision as to who was responsible for the starting of the civil war.  A tremendous amount of public time has been taken up recently discussing that question, but this all-important question of the present and <Col N="280" /> the future is being shrouded and obscured while these discussions are taking place.  It is time that someone demanded that we should deal with the wounds that were caused by that civil war rather than try to determine the impossibility as to who was responsible for it.  I would like to know if the Minister can give any estimate as to what are the remaining liabilities with regard to the property compensation. In the Estimates I noticed that a sum of over £500,000 is put down for the current financial year.  Can the Minister say if that is all that will be required, or can he state approximately what are our full liabilities there?  It seems to me that anyone having any claim arising out of the troubled period would have lodged them long ago and that the overwhelming majority of them would have been adjudicated on.  I would also like to know if the Government proposed to take any steps, as they are entitled to under the special Act that was passed, to compel the owners of property in the devastated area of Dublin to rebuild. These are very nasty eye-sores, particularly in the principal street.  Public money is available for people who own the sites if they would only build and I think it is time that the compulsory powers, which are available, were used to compel these people to build, or, at all events, to see that the sites are built on, failing which I think the Minister should utilise the grants and pass them on to someone who would be prepared to build under proper regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the question of housing, I think that what has been done since the change of Government is sufficient to indicate that we realise the importance of the problem, and that we are prepared to make a contribution.  We were very glad that this Committee on Unemployment gave a good deal of attention to the question of housing, because, as the Senator has said, it will tend to solve two problems&mdash;the problem of unemployment and the problem of decent and suitable accommodation for the people. We have already given careful attention to that Report; discussions have taken place between the various departments, <Col N="281" /> and preliminary steps at least have been taken towards securing that the conference which the Committee recommended shall be held.  As Senators are aware, it was suggested in that Report that not only should there be a Government contribution towards speeding-up the provision of houses, but that there should be a contribution by the workers employed in the industry and by the firms engaged in it.</P>
      <P>I think that it is absolutely necessary, if we are to overtake this question, that greater progress should be made in the future than has heretofore been made, and we are prepared to make, on behalf of the State, a generous contribution towards dealing with this matter.  There is a limit to what we can reasonably do; there is a limit to any increase in the assistance that the State can give, but I believe that as a result of the consideration that is now taking place, it will be possible to arrange for a very much more rapid provision of houses, and that it will be possible to arrange for a continuous programme which will be run over some period such as ten years.  I do not think it is necessary to raise a special housing loan, but if it is, we will not hesitate to do so.  It may not be necessary to raise a special housing loan, because large sums of money will not be required in any one year, and it is undesirable to raise more money than we want, because if we do, we will be paying interest at the rate of 5 or 5½ per cent. for money, and we would not be able to earn as much on it.  It may be possible, in the ordinary way, out of funds at our disposal, to provide any money that is necessary.  We realise the importance of long-term loans in this connection, because houses cannot be let at economic rents if loans have to be amortised in short periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not like to rely on my memory with regard to the total amount that is still due in regard to compensation, but I should say that at the end of this year no further large sum will remain to be paid.  I believe that all cases have been adjudicated on.  In many cases reinstatement conditions are attached to the awards. Reinstatement has not yet been <Col N="282" /> effected, and while perhaps unreasonable delays have taken place in some cases, the delays in others have been quite reasonable.  The people who have got awards may find the utmost difficulty in proceeding with reconstruction. Further sums may have to be raised, but a great deal of the reinstatement that was required has been done.  Even in O'Connell Street work is in progress, and I should say that by the end of the coming financial year not a great deal will remain to be done. I was under the impression that the powers with regard to the taking over of sites which was given by a special Act rested with the Commissioners of the City of Dublin, and not with the State.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that there are several lawyers in the House, and at the risk of getting into trouble, I should like to say a word or two about this.  It was only this morning that I learned for the first time, when I was looking through the Estimates, that there was an annual grant-in-aid of £325 to the Incorporated Law Society, or in other words, the State is giving a grant to the best regulated trade union in the world.  I wonder what would be said if Labour representatives went to the Minister for Finance and asked for a grant?  I am afraid that they would require to have an army with them if they went to ask for a special grant for some poor labouring men's trade union.</P>

I read of a case of an unfortunate man who lost his leg and who made a claim for compensation.  He was awarded £100, and when he came to get paid he got £40 and the lawyer got £60, and he asked the lawyer: &ldquo;Which of us lost the leg?&rdquo;  This is a small matter, but there is a principle involved in it. I do not see why the State should give a grant to any trade union, whether it is a professional man's or a working man's.  I am sure £325 is nothing to the legal profession of this country.  As the Minister did not give me any information, I thought I would give him my views as to how it strikes me, and I think it is altogether wrong.  Of course it was got under an old statute. I suppose some legal adviser to the monarch then reigning got the grant for some services rendered, but I do not think the legal profession in this country renders any special service more than anybody else for which their trade union should be subsidised at the expense of the State.</P>

      <P>I am in the same position in this matter as the Minister. I do not really know in respect of what this grant is made, but I cannot help thinking that some of the remarks made by Senator Farren are uncalled for, as far as my branch of the legal profession is concerned.  I am really doubtful as to the origin of this grant, but I am inclined to think, subject to correction, that it was restitution money to the Law Society for property taken from them by the barristers.  I am not sure of that, but I think there was some question involved between the Benchers and ourselves, and that it resulted in this grant being made to the Incorporated Law Society in respect of some property taken from it. However, I am sure that the Minister will look into the matter and give it all the attention that it deserves.  I do not agree with Senator Farren in some of his criticisms about the profession. I am inclined to think that very frequently labouring men earn a good deal more than professional men earn. I will not draw any comparisons between the value of the work, but will leave it at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter to which I would like to draw the attention of the Minister, and that is that the whole amount down for Fisheries is £16,000.  Now, Ireland is a country with an enormous sea-coast and we had and could again have very fine fisheries in it.  In the early meetings of the Seanad we had very considerable discussions with the Minister for Fisheries, mainly as regards inland fisheries. There is no question but that the Department has taken up the inland fisheries and has done a great deal for them.  But if we look at the fisheries which could be carried on in this country if the fishermen around the coast were properly looked after, such a sum as £16,000 is really quite unworthy of the Free State, and I do think that the Minister for Fisheries ought to put in a bigger claim and get more funds to have at his disposal.  Just think of our country for a moment and think what £16,000, both for our inland fisheries and our sea fisheries, is to give any Minister to work his Department or to help the fishermen.  Any of us who fish in the rivers know what it costs to keep up proper protection on a river, and those of us who spend a good deal of our time around the coasts know what fishing-boats cost to keep up and we know the hard life the fishermen have.  Here is a case in which I think our Labour friends ought to give us some assistance.  There is no body of men in the whole of the Free State who have to earn their living harder or at greater risk to their lives than the fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a money-making proposition fishing is a very fine thing indeed.  I believe that if the Department of Fisheries was looked after well and given a sum of money such as could lead to some useful purpose, we could make money instead of having to spend money.  We all know that we spend a good deal of money on agriculture, which is the mainstay of the country, and we know that our agriculturists believe that we do not spend half enough in helping that industry.  I believe that a great deal of money could be made which is not made simply because we are not looking after a great industry that is lying there <Col N="285" /> ready to be attended to.  Other countries do not act in that way. Denmark, Norway, and other countries spend large sums of money every year on their fisheries, and what is the result?  We import an enormous amount of fish, and our exports are a humbug compared with what they should be, with a huge industry like this waiting to be developed.  I would strongly commend to the Government the necessity for paying more serious attention to this question of fisheries than evidently has been given to it when such a sum as £16,000 is the whole amount to be handed over to the Department to protect our inland and our sea fisheries.  I am not saying how the money should be spent, but I am quite sure if the money is given to the Department they will use it judiciously and well, and I would only commend to the attention of the Government that far more should be given to the needs of the Free State fisheries than has apparently ever been given since we started.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLOUGHLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a county that is very much interested in fishing, I support Senator Jameson's appeal.  I certainly think that the sum of £16,000 is quite inadequate to be set aside for the development of fishing. For instance, I have complained for the last four or five years of the amount of poaching done by foreign trawlers round the coast of Donegal, and to prevent that poaching we had a boat that is nothing less than a joke, because it can steam about ten or twelve knots, while the trawlers it is expected to catch can steam fourteen or fifteen knots.  Certainly, the State should spend some money in providing a more up-to-date poacher catcher. Again, we have in Buncrana a pier on which the British Government, thirteen or fourteen years ago, after an investigation, decided to spend £35,000 or £40,000.  We have been knocking at the door of the Government for the last couple of years to try to get a grant to keep this fishery going&mdash;one of the most important fishing centres in Ireland, where 300 or 400 boats come in every year, and where upwards of 1,000 men are employed.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the President <Col N="286" /> saw the congested state of the pier, which is an extension of the stone pier, &mdash;a little wooden structure where it is absolutely dangerous for men to go with horses and cars.  I think that the Minister for Finance should look into this question and give some encouragement to the development of this great industry.  We are looking for industries to develop, and here is one at our very door which the expenditure of some money would make into a veritable gold mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir T. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think this question was going to be raised, but I am very glad that it has been raised, and Senator Jameson deserve our thanks for raising it.  This question of the sea fisheries of Ireland is a very large question; it is a question that has been with us for a great many years, and is likely to remain with us for a good many years to come.  The trouble about the question of sea fisheries is that for their proper development and protection a very large sum of money would be required, but that is no reason why we should not endeavour to make a beginning.  There are difficulties in the way.  No doubt the Minister for Finance will tell us that he has to raise considerable money in many directions for various purposes, and I do not suppose he will welcome the sea fisheries being placed upon his back also.  At the same time, the question will have to be faced and dealt with some time or other, and the sooner the better.  In the first place, we shall require proper protection for our fisheries.  Our coasts are frequented by steam trawlers and our protection against their depredations is very inadequate.  We have a ship called the Helga.  She cannot be in more than one place at a time, and in any case she has not the speed nor the seafaring capacities sufficient to enable her to do anything like the amount of work that she is expected to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Free State ought to have is a flotilla of fishery protection boats; but, of course, the provision of these and their upkeep would cost a good deal of money.  Then there is the question of harbour accommodation around the coast, which is a very large <Col N="287" /> question.  A great deal of money has been spent upon building piers all round the Irish coast, and no doubt, in many cases substantial benefits have resulted from the building of these piers, but a great deal more requires to be done.</P>
    <P>That all means money.  Then there is the subsidiary question, the very important question of loans to fishermen for boats and gear.  A system of loans has been in operation for a good many years, and it has not worked perhaps quite as satisfactory in all its incidence, but it has worked unquestionably, with the result that it has encouraged fishing in certain districts.  That is a question that will have to be considered and carefully investigated.</P>
    <P>There is one suggestion I would make, if we ever come to increase the facilities to fishermen for loans for outfit and fishing boats, and that is that we might utilise our home resources and build our boats at home as far as they can be built.  I am sure that the Minister for Finance will sympathise with that view.  We have very capable fishing-boat builders in this country, and no doubt if they were asked to co-operate in this work they would be able to give a good account of themselves. The whole question really resolves itself into one of money. Another very important point in connection with the development of our fisheries is the establishment of curing stations where we could freeze the results of our fishermen's labour and put it on the market at appropriate times when the fishermen would get fair prices.  That, it seems to me, is a direction in which we might very usefully make a beginning.  There are various places&mdash;Buncrana, for instance, and other points around our coasts that might be mentioned&mdash;where curing or freezing establishments could be started with very considerable advantage to the fishing industry.  That is one of the first things that they do in other countries, in Canada, America and different parts of Europe; wherever they have a chance of landing a large catch of fish they also have opportunities for freezing it and preserving it for the market.  I am glad that the <Col N="288" /> question has been raised, though I do not know whether the Minister for Finance can hold out a very hopeful view to us at the present time.  At the same time we ought to begin to see what we can do to help our fishermen, than whom there is no more deserving class in the community and no more industrious class, and I might also say, no more courageous class&mdash;people who prosecute their very difficult avocations under very considerable disadvantages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to emphasise the points to which attention has been called by Senator MacLoughlin and Senator Esmonde, as regards poaching on our sea fisheries.  I spend a considerable portion of my time in the West of Ireland, and from the windows of my house I can easily see boats, frequently within the limits, fishing continuously. One day last autumn I saw a little boat cruising along right under the cliffs.  I made inquiries and I found that it was a French boat trawling for lobsters and crayfish.  She could have easily been overhauled by any efficient Civic Guards, I should think, from the shore, with help of a canoe.  But she was there day after day, and as it was a very small boat, whenever there was threat of bad weather she made off to the nearest port.  Senator Esmonde has also spoken about curing stations. Some years ago a curing station was established in a place called Seafield, Co. Clare.  That has been shut up since the Free State commenced to function there.  There were quite a number of canoes fishing.  They had increased enormously in numbers, I think they had trebled in numbers, and I think a number of fishermen were earning a very good livelihood by catching mackerel and curing them.  I used to see vessels coming in to take away barrels of cured mackerel.  All that is dead.  I fancy the fish are there still and I fancy that with the exercise of a little enterprise and energy the industry could all be revived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another question to which I would like to call attention.  In addition to the want of development I think that a considerable amount of damage has been done in places.  We are all familiar with the Shannon scheme.  I have urged over and over <Col N="289" /> again the necessity for some precautions to be taken to preserve the supply of salmon in the Shannon, but I regret to say I have not been able yet to have that done.  I have been in communication with the Department for Fisheries, with which I have had a good deal of correspondence, but I have not yet been able to find out what steps have been taken to protect the supply of salmon in our most important river.  On another occasion here I pointed out that the Shannon fisheries have afforded employment to more than 1.000 men for generations.  None of us knows what the effect of the works will be on the fishing.  We hope that it may not be very injurious, but as far as I can make out, a policy of drift is being pursued.  There is no question about it that if the spawning salmon are allowed to go above the upper weir and to get into the lake not one of the young fish that are hatched out will survive the ordeal, and certainly the old fish will never come down alive.  It seems to me&mdash;and this is a view I have been asked to press over and over again by the fishing people there&mdash;that the only way to protect the Shannon salmon fisheries, which are of enormous value, is to prevent the spawning fish going above that weir.  I have urged the question and I have been told that it would interfere with the upper Shannon fisheries.  Well, the upper Shannon fisheries will be interfered with anyway&mdash;you cannot help it&mdash;and the only thing to do is to try to protect the lower Shannon.  I believe that if the fish were allowed access to the smaller rivers and if they were protected on the spawning beds below the upper dam, in all probability it would be the best way out of the difficulty.  I am very glad that this question was raised because it gives one an opportunity of calling attention to what is in my opinion a most important thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum referred to by Senator Jameson and Senator MacLoughlin is, of course, only the sum on account and it does not represent the total expenditure on fisheries for the year.  Perhaps I ought not to speak here in place of the Minister for Fisheries because I may say something <Col N="290" /> that he would not altogether agree with, but I confess myself rather sceptical on the question of the development of our sea fisheries.  It would be easy to spend a great deal of money on fisheries, and it would be easy to waste a great deal of money. There are only a comparatively small number of whole-time fishermen, fishermen who will fish all the time, who, if there are not fish in one place, will go to another place, and if there is to be any improvement in the industry, any improvement that is worth while, it can only be by encouraging that section of fishermen and by inducing additions to be made to their ranks. As to the fishermen who do some part-time work, something might be done to help them by way of relief, but it would be scarcely better than that. People talk about fish being all round the coast, but the market is elsewhere, and for fishing off our coast the Free State fishermen has few, if any, advantages over the Scotch, English or French fishermen.  I think that the development of the sea fishing industry will at best be comparatively slow.  If any sound proposals are put forward by the Department of Fisheries I will undertake to see that they receive sympathetic consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I would not undertake to consider such proposals as sympathetically as I would consider proposals from the Department of Agriculture.  I feel that the money that will be spent on agriculture will produce good results.  As to proposals for the expenditure of money on fisheries I would, in a great many cases, have some doubts as to whether good results would be produced. For some time I have resisted proposals for the expending of money on further patrol vessels.  Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde suggested that we would need a flotilla to keep off the poachers.  I would prefer to spend money in giving a pension to every fisherman on the coast, because I think it would be cheaper, than do what the Senator has suggested.  It may be that another vessel should be substituted for the present one.  There might even be a case for a second vessel because, as it has been pointed out, when the present vessel passes a certain point <Col N="291" /> she is expected not to be around again for several days.  In that way the poachers feel safe, whereas if there was a second vessel it might be following the first, and the poachers would have to be more careful.  There might be a case for some further expenditure there, but there would not be a case for expenditure that, if our fishing industry was a big thing already, would be justified.  When our fishing industry is, comparatively speaking, a small thing you cannot justify expenditure on protection that might otherwise be justified.</P>
    <P>When the figures of our expenditure on fishery development are compared with similar figures for other countries, we find that the provision for piers is all included in the Fisheries Vote for other countries.  In our case the expenditure on piers and harbours is included in the Board of Works Vote, although it may be largely, or almost entirely, for the benefit of fishermen. Care has to be taken, I think, in comparing the figures of our expenditure with the expenditure in other countries because, I believe, sometimes we have been criticised in a way that was not quite fair in this matter.  Senator McLoughlin referred to a particular harbour.  That is one, I suppose, of the three or four harbours in the country where there do seem to be some prospects of fishery development, and which, it seems, would produce some useful results.  I think I have already informed Senator McLoughlin that very careful and very sympathetic consideration is being given to the proposal in regard to that matter, and that a conclusion with regard to the pier at Buncrana will be come to very soon.</P>
    <P>Some of the points raised by Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde were, I think, matters that should be dealt with by the Minister for Fisheries.  I would not pretend to be able to deal with them.  I do know that the Minister for Fisheries has in preparation legislation dealing with lobster fishing, and also with regard to the institution of a National Brand for mackerel.  That legislation will be introduced shortly. The Government has recognised that this is a matter that deserves very careful <Col N="292" /> consideration.  I may say that the reason why the Department of Fisheries was set up was this: that we believed, if our fisheries remained as a section of the Department of Agriculture, that the Minister for Agriculture would not be able to give attention to them, and would be rather inclined to neglect the question of fishery development in favour of agricultural schemes which, as I have already said, give a surer promise of economic returns.  We set up the Department of Fisheries in order that there might be a member of the Government who would have sole care of our fisheries, who would be there to answer criticisms in regard to fishery development and would have to stand or fall in regard to his policy on that matter.</P>
    <P>My own knowledge in regard to the fisheries tends, perhaps, to make me look upon the whole matter in an unfavourable light.  I have applications for permission to give loans without proper security or without the usual security.  I have applications to write off or to give remissions of loans that were made years ago.  I understand that, before the change of Government, fishery loans were very often inadequately secured.  The people who got the loans very often looked upon them as grants.  I was of the opinion that a continuation of the old methods, which sometimes people say were more sympathetic than ours, would get us nowhere. Possibly, the position is that no real progress can be made by a moderate annual expenditure.  It may be that we will have to plunge as, perhaps, some Senators may think we have plunged, as regards the Shannon scheme.  If we have to make up our minds for a very big expenditure over a period of years and could see the prospects of developing the fisheries to anything like the extent to which they have been developed in other countries by such expenditure, I think that might be justified, and I would be prepared to take my share of the responsibility for that.  So far, however, I have not seen anything that would convince me of that.</P>
    <P>We talk about helping the fisheries. The real thing is that we have so few fishermen.  The fisherman who will <Col N="293" /> only, go out and take fish when he sees them come in shoals into his own bay, so to speak, in front of his own door, and who never fishes at any other time, is not going to do anything to develop our fisheries.  There are a great number of our fishermen who are reluctant to go away from their homes and devote themselves entirely to fishing as the fishermen in other countries do.  If we had men who had the same outlook as the French fishermen who come around our coast and poach here, then we would make some progress.  There are historical reasons, no doubt, for the present state of things, but because it is so that is no argument against trying to do more.</P>
    <P>The only thing I am saying to the Seanad in this connection is, that to make progress in regard to our fisheries is an extremely difficult thing.  It is a matter on which, from what I have seen of the financial effects of the previous administration, we could easily not merely spend but waste great sums of money.  You could, for instance, make loans far more easily than they are being made at present.  You could give loans to all sorts of people at the present time.  Probably a little loosening up of the loans scheme would simply result in this: that people would get the feeling that money was easily got.  Because they felt that, they would let it go easily, and in any case they would feel that there was more to be got in the same easy way.  The result of all that would be that the industry would not be put on its feet as an economic proposition.</P>
    <P>I remember that when the matter was under discussion in the Dáil that Deputy Johnson, who had given a great deal of study to the matter and had a great personal knowledge of the fishing industry and the disposal of the products of the industry, said that one of the best things that could be done for the industry would be to induce the people of the country to eat more fish, but Deputy Johnson, like myself, was not a Catholic, and perhaps under-estimated the difficulty of inducing people to eat more fish.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete the words &lsquo;Medical Council&rsquo; wherever they occur in this section, and to substitute therefor the words &lsquo;Dental Board.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to give the Dental Board the right to inquire into the training and experience required for future dentists.  The Bill as it stands gives this power to another body, the Medical Council, but for reasons which I intend to put forward I think the duty would be much better performed by the Dental Board.  The Dental Board, I submit, would be in a better position than the Medical Council to know what would be required for dental candidates.  It would be interested in drawing the attention of the universities and of the colleges holding examinations to any alterations that might be thought necessary.</P>
      <P>A dental board, for instance, would also be better up in the latest dental science and matters of that sort.  Furthermore, the Dental Board has certain functions with regard to outside universities.  Sub-section (2) of Section 29 of the Bill states that:&mdash;&ldquo;The Board may recognise for the purposes of this section any British possession, self-governing dominion, or foreign country in which there is in force at the time of such recognition legislation &mdash;(a) Providing for the registration by a public authority of persons engaged in the practice of dentistry; and (b) requiring for such registration a standard of training and knowledge which is, in the opinion of the Board, not lower than the standard of training and knowledge necessary for obtaining the right to be registered under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thereby, the Bill casts on the Dental Board the power to see that any person applying from a foreign, colonial or dominion university for registration as a dentist must have the knowledge and be up to the standard required to entitle him to come on the Free State Register, but it does not give the Board that power regarding our own universities and colleges.  It looks quite inconsistent <Col N="296" /> if there are two professional bodies dealing with the one question, one the Dental Board and the other the Medical Council.  I think that the Minister has fallen into a mistake, or is attaching too much importance to the English Act under which the Medical Council has certain functions.  The Seanad should remember that the General Medical Council in England has been performing dental functions during the last 50 years.  That does not apply to the Free State.  Here you have a Dental Board and a Medical Council.  The latter is composed entirely of medical men, while the Dental Board is composed of medical men and of dentists.  Therefore it seems to me that the Dental Board is the more suitable body to carry out this duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir EDWARD BIGGER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  That function is something like what has been in force in the English Council.  Speaking from personal experience of that Board.  I can say with all weight of knowledge, that the duty would be better done by the Dental Board, which is really interested in dental qualifications and dental work. I was going on to say that under the English Act the General Medical Council has been dealing with this work for 50 years.  Naturally, when that Act was being amended they did not give up all their functions, but I question if there had been a new Act passed in England, such as we are proposing here, that both from the medical and dental point of view there would not have been this overlapping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dental Board will be an important body.  It will be composed of ten members, three of whom are to be members of the Medical Council and possibly a fourth one appointed by the Minister.  That is, four medical men out of a total membership of ten.  The medical interests will be well looked after, but on the Medical Council there is not a single dentist.  It would be wrong, I think, to put the dental profession <Col N="297" /> in an inferior position to that, say, of the legal profession or other professions such as registered nurses, midwives, and so on.  In bringing forward this amendment I may say that I am not doing so either in the interests of dentists or of the medical profession, but merely as a member of this House. I think it is only right that we should try and secure that our legislation should be such that it would work as smoothly as possible.</P>

If he were here he would probably be able to enlighten us as to the reasons why this provision was made.  I understand it was made largely in consultation with the dental profession.  Being anxious to understand the matter, I consulted a leading member of the Irish Dental Association. He told me that an amendment on the lines of the one suggested by Senator Sir Edward Bigger was considered by them and that they did not desire it. I might say, in passing, that this is not a matter on which I personally feel very strongly, and I certainly would like to have heard the Minister before taking the course of setting my opinion against that of Senator Sir Edward Bigger.  It is only right, however, that I should state the reasons that were given to me as to why the Irish Dental Association felt itself opposed to an amendment such as the one before the House.</P>

    <P>The present position under this Bill is that the Dental Board will have full control over the register as to who shall be on it, as to why anyone should be removed from it, etc.  In the matter of education, it is clear from the section to which Senator Sir Edward Bigger proposes his amendment, that the standard will be finally set by the Medical Council, and in order that the dentists should be represented on the Medical Council, Section 43 of the Bill provides that three representatives of the Dental Board shall be on the Medical Council. Quite consistently, of course, Senator Sir Edward Bigger proposes to delete that power in a later amendment because, <Col N="298" /> if the Dental Board was to have a full say in the matter, there would be no reason why it should be represented on the Medical Council.  The position seems to me to be this: that it is desirable to have as close a connection between the Dental Board and the Medical Council as possible, especially if the present Dental Association desires it.</P>
    <P>At the present time the bodies who will grant diplomas, the standard of which is to be decided by the Medical Council and the Dental Board if the amendment is not carried, are the medical bodies and the universities in Ireland. I understand that the lecturers or professors in dentistry at present are only part-time men.  You have not, therefore, got men who are in a position&mdash;this was a point that was put strongly to me by leading dentists&mdash;to give their full time and such consideration to the standard of examination as can be given by the Medical Board. There is another reason which, I think, is of considerable importance.  It has also to be considered that after a great deal of discussion, a satisfactory arrangement has been reached, as we understand it, in regard to the Medical Council in its relations with the British Medical Council.  As Senator Sir Edward Bigger has pointed out, in England there are representatives of the Dental Board on the Medical Council. The Medical Council, through its representatives, controls the standard of education.  In view of the arrangements that have been come to between the two medical councils, it seems to me to be desirable, if that is what the Dental Board desires, to continue the same arrangements here.</P>
    <P>Without any information from the Minister on the subject, I think the Seanad should be very careful before it inserted an amendment of this sort. As I said earlier, the matter is one on which I have not much personal knowledge or feeling.  I have simply given the views expressed to me by a leading member of the Dental Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the education of dentists, I desire to correct a statement which has been made in the course of the debate.  As to the education of dentists, it was stated that <Col N="299" /> lecturers in dentistry were only part-time men.  But might I point out that is equally true of the medical profession. Professors of surgery, in almost all cases, are only part-time men.  The difficulty that was raised by Senator Douglas's informant would be met by the appointment of a member of the Dental Board on the governing body or Academic Council of the Senate of the National University.  It really carries no conviction to me that the lecturers in dentistry are only part-time men.  The same can be said with regard to the medical profession.</P>

I have reason to know that, amongst the dentists in the south of Ireland, there is a strong feeling against the amendment.  There is a feeling, I think, amongst members of the dental profession that theirs has been the Cinderella for many years amongst the great professions.  I am sure that Senator Sir Edward Bigger does not look askance at the dental profession, but judging by the amendment one would think that he did not wish to be associated with the profession.  On the <Col N="300" /> other hand, he wants it to be as closely associated as possible with the medical profession.  I hope that the matter will be left over until the Minister is present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Stage of the Bodies Corporate (Executors) Bill.  The intention of the Bill is to put corporate bodies in the same position as individuals for the purpose of extracting probate, and, therefore, to facilitate the appointment of corporations as executors.  In order to explain to the House the real object of this Bill it will be necessary to refer to the custom which is steadily growing of naming banks or other corporations as executors and trustees of a will.  In some cases the corporate body is appointed solely, and in other cases jointly, with an individual, and this practice has spread very widely in the United States of America, and is now becoming pretty general in Great Britain. Its advantages have not yet become widely known in Ireland, but several of the Irish banks have departments which are specially equipped for the administration of estates and are ready to act as executors or trustees. The duties of executors have become, owing to gradual changes in the law, more onerous, with the result that testators have been more reluctant to ask their personal friends to undertake the <Col N="302" /> duties, and their personal friends on the other hand have been much less willing to assume the responsibility. The reason why many persons are naming corporate bodies may be summed up briefly as follows:&mdash;It does away with the necessity of persuading friends to accept the responsibilities and anxieties of acting as executors.  It provides an executor who is sure to act and who does not require changing. No new appointment of trustees is necessary on account of death or otherwise. New appointments involve expense. It provides against the possibility of any loss by fraud or investment in unauthorised securities.  Where the corporate body appointed is a bank secrecy is secured for all transactions. The bank is always accessible, and the whole resources of the bank are security for the due performance of the work.  As the law stands at present in the Saorstát it is quite possible for a bank or other corporate body to act as executor or trustee by appointing a representative to act for them, and, as I have already pointed out, this is being done, and will continue even if this Bill should fail to become law.</P>
      <P>As the law now stands, however, there are no provisions enabling a corporate body, whether alone or jointly with an individual, to obtain a grant of probate, with the result that where a corporation is named executor in a will, administration with the will annexed must be granted to a syndic or nominee. This is an unsatisfactory proceeding which this Bill seeks to remedy by enabling corporations to act as executors either alone or jointly with individuals. This was done in Great Britain by the Administration of Justice Act, 1920, which does not apply to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have endeavoured to obtain the best legal advice in drafting this Bill, and the Bill has been submitted to the Attorney-General and has his personal approval.  He hopes it will pass.  The Rules of Court in the appendix were prepared in consultation with the probate officials, and I understand have their approval.  I have not yet met anyone who was opposed to the principle of the Bill, and I trust it will have the unanimous approval of this House.  I have, however, heard a fear <Col N="303" /> expressed that where banks are acting as executors they will rely solely on their own solicitors and not have the advice of family or other solicitors in the administration of the estate.  This is perhaps irrelevant, and does not strictly arise on this Bill, but I would like to say that as far as the Irish banks are concerned this fear is groundless, and in every case the banks advise the appointment of an outside solicitor. There is no danger whatever of the banks in any way ignoring solicitors in this matter, and I know it is their desire to act in close co-operation with the legal profession.  In conclusion, I would like to emphasise the fact that the only object of this Bill is to simplify the law, and it does not give any power whatever to any bank or other corporate body to act as executor except where it has been explicitly named in the Bill.  I beg to move that the Bodies Corporate (Executors) Bill do pass its Second Stage.</P>

      <P>I second the motion. Senator Douglas has stated with complete accuracy the present state of the law on this subject.  He has pointed out its defects and has also given the reasons which I think ought to appeal to the common sense of every member of the House to show that the legislation he proposes if not absolutely necessary would at least be for the public good.  It is quite unnecessary for me to say anything in support of the motion.</P>

I think the fact that Senator Brown is associated with Senator Douglas in the introduction of this Bill is in itself guarantee that the interests of certain friends of mine have not been lost sight of.  I think I am on pretty strong ground if I suggest to both Senators the desirability when we reach the Committee Stage to refer certain provisions to a Select Committee for examination.  If any amendments are to be inserted in the Bill they will necessarily be of a very technical character, and, therefore, it seems to me that our purpose would be better achieved by a small Select Committee to deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>I am indebted to the courtesy of Senator Douglas for an advance copy of this Bill.  I thoroughly approve of the Bill on behalf of the various institutions with which I am connected.  There is no doubt that, so far as banks are concerned, the proposals in the Bill would be a very considerable advantage.  At present there is no power in the country to grant probate of a will to a bank or any corporation. They have a roundabout method of procedure.  As Senator Douglas has explained, probate has to be taken out by a nominee, who is called a syndic. Supposing the syndic dies or leaves the country, then there are complications. The proposals in the Bill would certainly simplify the administration of bodies corporate in so far as they place themselves in the position of executors or trustees.  Undoubtedly there is very considerable difficulty in finding private individuals to act in this capacity, in view of the complications and the extraordinary responsibilities which would be imposed on them.  If this Bill were passed it would assist in the reform which is gradually taking place by which private individuals make bodies corporate trustees or administrators. I trust the Bill will be agreed to.  I am very glad to hear there is no intention or desire to interfere with the practice of family solicitors.  That will go on, as Senator Brady assures us, as satisfactorily as ever.  With regard to referring this Bill to a Select Committee, I would be guided very much in this matter by the views of Senator Douglas.  I think the Bill is a good one, and the sooner it is passed into law the better it will be for public convenience.</P>

      <P>I am in agreement with the purpose of the Bill.  It is a simple measure and looks innocuous, but one fears that some safeguard may be essential in the interests of the community. I understand that in America this practice very largely prevails.  I do not know whether it would be possible in this Bill to specify a scale of charges on which banks would be allowed to operate.  I am told that in America they collect rentals at the rate of a half and one per cent.  Are the <Col N="305" /> banks in Ireland going to undertake to collect at such a rate, or are they going to inflict on people who submit estates to them charges which might be altogether out of relation to the capacity of the estate?  I do not take it that these bodies corporate will act for love in these matters, and that they will be out to get some financial advantage.  In giving them this right we should try to secure that the privilege they are going to exercise should be given at a rate commensurate with the capacity of the community to bear the burden which they are going to impose.  I think the Bill is a very proper one, and I hope that some assurance will be given us in the course of the Committee Stage by the promoters as to the charges to be made under the Bill.</P>

      <P>Yes.  According to sub-section (3) of Section 2, you pass an Act and give to an outside rule-making authority power to amend that Act to the extent that the rules are concerned.  Unless we make rules by which we are prepared to stand I do not think we should make rules at all.  It seems to me as a layman that the matter should be left to the rule-making authority, and if not that definite and binding the rules should be included in the Schedule rather than leave it to an outside authority to make Rules of Court that may annul these rules altogether or amend them.  It is proposing to give a subsidiary body outside Parliament power to annul rules made by Parliament itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with the first point made by Senator O'Farrell.  As under this Bill we are giving corporate bodies power to obtain grants of probate, it was necessary to add to the Rules of Court passed by this House certain rules which should come into effect at once &mdash;these other rules in the Schedule. Therefore they might put an amendment <Col N="306" /> to this in the Schedule as an amendment to the Rules of Court. Once this amendment is passed it will put these rules in the same position as the other Rules of Court.  With regard to the point raised by Senator Bennett, it is one in which I have a good deal of interest, and I would like to hear it discussed very fully in Committee&mdash; that is as to whether it would be wise or not to insert a special scale.  I take it what the Senator means is a maximum scale above which no bank should charge.  He mentioned a half and one per cent.  I think the Irish banks have &mdash;one of them at any rate has&mdash;a lesser rate than the American ones.  I do not think there is any intention of increasing it.  There would be certain advantages in having a scale in the Act.  It would mean it would not be necessary to specifically name rates in the will. At present if an individual appoints a bank as executor he does not name any scale in the will, and no fees can be paid.  It would be a matter for a bank to decide whether it would act or not.  Presumably it might not, but if you put scales into the Bill and you appoint a bank as executor then those scales will apply unless other scales have been previously arranged.  It is a question as to whether scales should be put into the Bill.  If it is so desired I would not oppose it.  As I have pointed out, what the Bill does is it puts the corporate body in the same position as an individual.  Frequently people do not act as executors unless they are left something, but if they are not left something and do act they cannot obtain anything for acting, and as the Bill stands if the corporate body is not left something in the will it cannot obtain anything for acting.  As to putting in a certain scale of charges that is a matter that might be considered. With regard to Senator Brady's proposal I would not oppose that.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Ordered: That the Bill be referred to a Select Committee consisting of Senators Douglas, Brown, Bennett, Brady and Dowdall, three to form a quorum, and Senator Brady to be Chairman.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That, in view of the continued high freights on the shipment of live stock to ports in Great Britain, the Government be requested to confer with the Dublin Commissioners and the Dublin Port and Docks Board, with a view to the provision and erection of an adequate municipal lairage at the North Wall, with a right of berthage convenient thereto for any ships that may be chartered by the cattle traders or otherwise for the export of such live stock.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last May I drew attention to this matter in the House.  I raised the question of the exorbitant freight charges on live stock from Irish ports to Great Britain, and I pointed out that although the producer of live stock was receiving only from 15 to 20 per cent. more than pre-war, that the railway charges had increased by more than 100 per cent. and shipping freight had increased 200 per cent., while other charges were from 100 to <Col N="308" /> 150 per cent. higher than pre-war. Almost every expression of opinion in the Seanad on that occasion was in favour of the motion which I brought forward.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce promised on that occasion that he, in conjunction with the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, would investigate the matter and do something.  Almost twelve months have passed since, and nothing has been done.  To-day the screw is being tightened, and we find ourselves in a worse position with regard to shipping freights than ever before.  Competition is wanting, and the only way we can get it is by a municipal lairage where all stock can be housed and fed during the period of detention.  The Irish Cattle Traders' Association are not the only people who complain of high freights.  The matter was recently raised in the British House of Commons by Sir Robert Thomas.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They had to-day combinations in shipping the like of which neither this country nor any other had ever seen before.  The Royal Mail Steamship Company, for example, controlled tonnage amounting to the colossal figure of 2,460,564 tons gross. This octopus had its tentacles all over the world in conjunction with other similar combinations&mdash;German, Dutch and French.  This huge combine fixed rates, and fixed them so high that they could sail ships with half cargoes and still make good.  No one was allowed to interfere with these people, and they were gradually but surely driving the tramp out of the shipping industry.  Shippers were thrown entirely into the hands of the conference lines.  If anyone entered into one of the trades where this mighty conference existed they got a reasonable rate of freights.  He ran a line of steamers to South Africa in opposition to the conference lines, and freights on different classes of merchandise had dropped, since he began running his steamers, from 40s., 55s., 60s., 70s., and 80s., to 15s., 25s., 30s., and 50s. respectively.  That was what could be done when there was open competition in the open market.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say what the Government should do in the matter of regulating <Col N="309" /> the attitude of the shipping combine which has now acquired practically all our independent shipping companies, and we are left to-day with something of about a little over two per cent. of the total tonnage of shipping trading to Free State ports.  This is a serious state of affairs and is one of which the Government should take serious notice. The combine has us so completely bottled up that it can charge what it likes.  That applies more to the Free State than to any other country, because in other countries there is the possibility of some sort of competition. For instance, the traders of Stranraer a very short time ago complained of the high freight charges.  They threatened to bring in goods from Glasgow to Stranraer by boat.  In that case the London, Midland and Scottish Company brought down their rates as between Glasgow and Stranraer from 33s. 1d. to 26s. 6d. per ton.</P>
    <P>This shows what can be done by competition.  There are other reasons why we should have an independent lairage at the North Wall.  From the cattle trade point of view, it is most important that there should be proper accommodation for live stock at the port. The present accommodation is deficient. Cattle are herded together during the period of detention; they are roaring and goring each other in these exposed pens in which there is no room to feed or water them.  That is a great loss to the owners of these cattle, because they arrive in the British markets in a wornout condition.  That also gives a very bad name to our live stock in Great Britain.  The lairage question is a national one, and it should not be left to be dealt with by either the Port and Docks Board or the City Commissioners. I believe the Government should interfere as the question is a national one and a vital one to the success of the cattle trade.  Two-thirds of the shipping from the Irish Free State passes through the Port of Dublin.  I believe if we had proper lairage accommodation the port would be very much more attractive to exporters. At present Belfast is much more attractive, because the Great Northern Railway put up a proper lairage <Col N="310" /> there, and traders prefer to send their stock by that route.  In connection with the erection and upkeep of a lairage I want to say that the cattle traders are prepared to contribute the interest on the cost of the erection and upkeep.  We do not want this lairage to be erected for the purpose of making profits for the Port and Docks Board or the Dublin Corporation, and we would wish to have a say in the management of it.  In five years, between 1919 and 1923, the average number of stock exported yearly from Dublin Port was 325,202 cattle, 284,748 sheep, 80,418 pigs.  At the price charged until recently by the shipping companies for pen dues&mdash;sixpence for cattle, twopence for sheep, threepence for pigs&mdash; that wouuld amount to £11,508 yearly, and would pay five per cent. on an outlay of £230,160.  A lairage to accommodate the number of cattle that pass through the Dublin port would not cost anything like that amount.  The cattle trade will be interested to hear what the Minister for Industry and Commerce has done to rectify the position since he made a promise to do so last May.  On that occasion he said:</P>
    <P>The point to our advantage is that there is no monopoly in this instance. There are two sets of shipping lines, and there is quite keen competition between them.</P>
    <P>After he made that reply, I informed him that he was misinformed, and I sent him a copy of a letter that the cattle traders had received to prove that contention.  Previous to that, on the 13th April, the secretary of the Irish Cattle Traders and Stockowners' Association wrote to the managers of the different shipping and railway companies complaining of the high freight charges and pen dues and asking for some concessions.  We got a joint reply to all these letters from the secretary of the Irish and English Live Stock Traffic Conference, 22 Eden Quay, Dublin, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Your letter of the 15th March, addressed to the various shipping companies trading from Ireland to Great Britain, with regard to increase in rates between Ireland and Great Britain, has been under consideration <Col N="311" /> and, as Secretary of the Irish and English Live Stock Traffic Conference, I am desired to reply to it.</P>
    <P>It goes on to state the reasons why they cannot give a reduction on the freight charges, and continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>With regard to the pen dues at Irish ports, this matter was recently gone into and it was with regret that the Company found that there was no change in the circumstances to warrant any alteration in the existing charges.</P>
    <P>That proves that the Minister was misinformed with regard to competition on the different routes between Ireland and Great Britain.  The cattle trade will be also interested to hear what reply the directors of the Great Southern Railways will be able to make to the charge brought against them, that of refusing to give the site which we applied for three years ago.  On that occasion when we applied for the ground to build a lairage their reply was that they wanted the space, but that another site was available, but they might require the other site at some future date. There are five representatives of that company in this House and on that occasion, at all events, their action was not very patriotic.  The cattle trade believe that that reply was influenced by the combine.  We are sorry to believe that such a thing as this exists, and I would ask the Seanad to pass this motion to try to induce the Government to do something to relieve us of our burdens.</P>

      <P>I second the motion, and offer my sympathy and the support of the farmers.  Anything that tends to reduce overhead costs on agriculture at the present time will be welcomed and will have our support.  We consider that the present high cost of freights is an intolerable burden on agriculture and something in the way of reduction such as that suggested by the motion should be undertaken.  We believe that such a great industry as the livestock industry should not be looked at from a sectional point of view.  It is of national interest and it is specially of economic interest to dairy farmers, <Col N="312" /> tillage farmers, the smallest as well as the biggest.  We require a profitable outlet for our cattle and a profitable means of absorbing our foodstuffs.  We believe the seat of the unprofitable and the uneconomic condition of Irish agriculture is to be found in the livestock industry.  I attended two or three conferences recently in connection with this matter.  The case was put up that under-production by farmers was mainly responsible for the high cost of freights.  The high cost of freights has been denied, and the case is made that under-production is the cause.  I suggest that that should be reversed, that under-production is caused by high freights and that until the high costs are brought down we cannot have increased or economic production.  There is a feeling also that the standard of efficiency is hardly up to what it might be.  We are inclined to view the standard of traffic, especially livestock, merely from our own point of view, while, in such a matter, I think, we should regard it from the point of view of our competitors abroad.  In other countries, and in the Dominions that compete with us, they are in advance in the way of speedy equipment and cheapness of service with the result that I believe it can be said with truth we are losing a great deal of the proximity value of our position and a great deal of the value of our fertility and other natural advantages.  There is a feeling with regard to this that there is rather a preference given to classes of traffic.  There might be some remedy found for that.  There is a feeling that preference is given to incoming traffic by way of costs and by way of efficiency and that there is also a preference given to passenger traffic.  We hear a great deal of advocacy about the promotion of tourist traffic.  That I desire to support, but I think in connection with livestock anything that tends to increase and promote production should be looked on as being much more important than the tourist or any other traffic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion that was so ably proposed by Senator Counihan.  One cannot but feel that he has made a most impressive case for the urgent necessity for <Col N="313" /> such a proposal being taken up by the Government.  At present, apparently, there is only one company, and it is in a position largely to control, and has a monopoly of the cattle traffic in the port of Dublin.  That was the contention of Senator Counihan, and I believe it is correct.  In other words, one company has a monopoly of the export of cattle from Ireland.  Monopoly may be used wisely, and may be used in the interests of the community, or it may be used very unwisely and adversely to the interests of the community.  I think the monopoly enjoyed at the Dublin port in the case of cattle is certainly exercised against the interests of the community.  Cattle freights in Ireland are, I think I am correct in saying, rather 200 per cent. over what they were pre-war.  I am speaking more or less at random, but if I am wrong I will be corrected.  In parts of England the freights are only 16 per cent. above pre-war.  Under existing conditions it is perfectly impossible for any competing company to come in.  They have no lairage, no place from which they could put their cattle or arranging for conditions that are so essential for the export of cattle.  That is the condition of affairs which, in the interests of the most important industry in the country&mdash;the cattle-raising industry&mdash;should not be allowed to continue.  No vested interests, no monopoly interests, I think, should be allowed to stand in the way of the development of the country.  The agricultural portion of the question&mdash;the cattle-raising side of it&mdash;has been adequately dealt with by the Government. Legislation has been passed whereby cattle from this country should be much better in future.  They will be there in greater numbers, and more suited to the needs of the country. But if all the advantage of cattle-raising is to go to the shipping companies, then I think the progress of this country is limited, and will be limited, as long as that state of affairs is allowed to continue.  Senator Counihan pointed out that an alternative service is desirable and essential.  Sir Robert Thompson, in the House of Commons, suggested that that was the sine qua non of all progress.  If the contention of Senator Counihan, that any other line <Col N="314" /> but the existing line has no power to enter into the cattle-carrying business in Ireland, is true, I think the Senate will agree that the proposal is one which should recommend itself to the Government, and that a lairage should be erected forthwith.  The very fact which he pointed out, and which I should like to emphasise, that the mere pen charges were able to produce a sum of over £11,000, which would pay the interest on roundly a quarter of a million, which is more than needful to provide a lairage, shows that this is a scheme at any rate economically sound, because, in the first instance, before you start shipping, you have the mere fact that the exporting of cattle will provide means whereby all your expenses for lairage and berthage are covered.</P>
      <P>That being the case, I wish to urge on the Government the desirability and the necessity for providing an alternative lairage and giving the cattle trade of Ireland an opportunity of developing. I say without any fear that the company which has developed this has not a substantial interest in the people of the country.  I say that they are much more interested in securing high dividends for themselves than in recuperating this country after the financial difficulties through which it has been passing and from which it is now endeavouring to emerge.  I strongly support the motion, and I hope that this House will adopt it.</P>

      <P>I thought that this was the one occasion when the railways would be left out altogether. I understood the Senator who moved the motion was asking the Minister to induce the Dublin Corporation to take some action.  I was extremely interested in his speech, but I never dreamt that he expected any reply from the representatives of the Railways Company.  He said he hoped to receive a reply with regard to the refusal which the railway company&mdash;I think he meant the amalgamated company&mdash;made to the request from the Cattle Traders' Association.  Well, the suggestion was that the reply he got then was owing to dictation from or consultation with the combine.  I can assure him that there is nothing at all in that.  We <Col N="315" /> consulted nobody; nobody could have been more anxious than we were to give him the accommodation he desired, and our attitude is the same to-day.</P>

      <P>We would love to accommodate him.  I was a member of the board at the time.  I do not recollect exactly how we broke down, but I think it was that he wanted to take one piece of land and we wanted to give him another.  That was not because we were asked to do so by any combine.  It was put up to us by our responsible advisers, as far as I remember, that the land which he required might be needed for railway purposes.  It is a long time ago; I had no idea that I would be called upon this afternoon to deal with the question, and so I am not sufficiently conversant with the facts to explain why we could not give that piece of land, or whether the difficulty was an insuperable one.  Subsequently remarks were made about high freights&mdash;that we were charging 200 per cent. more.  We are not charging any such rate as that. Of course, the Senator is well aware that while we raised our charges there has also been an increased charge on everything we have had to buy.  I am not going into the question; but I can assure the Seanad that nobody will be more anxious than the Amalgamated Company to try to reduce the through rates on cattle and livestock if we were able to do so.  We suggested a conference. The conference is now in existence; two of the Senator's friends are parties to it, and also representatives of the Labour unions, of the Farmers' and of the Ministry.  I sincerely hope that good will come of that. I can assure the Senator that on our own account we have been urgently trying to obtain through rates to English ports.  We have asked for the cooperation of the Farmers' Union to enable us to join any project which we were able to put forward, in conjunction with the English companies, to enable us to move large amounts of produce on named days, when we could fix a rate.  The Senator is quite wrong in supposing that the railway companies <Col N="316" /> are taking up a <i>non possumus</i> attitude.  The very opposite is the case. As I said, I did not expect to have to reply to any charges, but as the question was fairly put to us to-day, I think it is really a question for the Minister to tell us what he proposes to do.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask Senator Counihan a question in connection with this.  His motion reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That, in view of the continued high freights on the shipment of live stock.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he goes on to say that that will be remedied by the provision and erection at the North Wall of a municipal lairage.  I want to know how the two are connected.  The only way I can see that they can possibly be connected is that by the establishment of a lairage at the North Wall shippers of stock will be enabled to hold up their cattle there until such time as a freight is available by a competing company, which may or may not come along, or that they may hold them there until the market is favourable.  Senator Counihan's speech, as far as I could understand, did not connect in any way the two points, that is to say, the high freights and the establishment of the lairage.  I should be glad if he could explain that for the information of the House.</P>

      <P>At a meeting of the cattle trade held in Kilkenny on 14th March, the whole question of high freights was considered, and it was the unanimous opinion of that meeting, where we had representatives from all parts of Ireland, that the only way to compete with the freights was to establish a lairage at the North Wall, where we could charter ships and convey our cattle from Dublin to ports in Great Britain.  We cannot charter ships without having some place to hold the cattle for inspection and detention, and we cannot do that without a right to berthage and lairage which we are prohibited from having at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not interested in the cattle trade, except in a very general way, but some years ago <Col N="317" /> a gentleman connected with the cattle trade chartered a boat, the City of Brussels, and in a very short time obstacles to a berthage for her were thrown in the way.  Charges were made at the Dublin Port and Docks Board, and the question was submitted to a committee of three, of whom I was one.  We unanimously agreed that obstacles were thrown in the way of finding a berth for that ship.  There is only one cross-Channel communication, with the exception of the Clyde Shipping Company, which is, of course, an altogether different concern.  I can quite understand railway freights being high in Ireland.  I am afraid that in the interests of the railway company, they cannot reduce freights materially until there is a larger volume of traffic going over the line.  I hope that the Agricultural Credit Corporation will do something to promote that increased production.  I sincerely trust that the Act will be administered in a way that will enable agriculture to get on its feet again, and to produce something like the production of 1913 and 1914. But while this country is in competition, as it is in competition, with free food from all parts of the world, we are under a very heavy handicap with the existing through rates and cross-Channel freights.  Some few years ago, when I, like many others, got interested in the Condensed Milk Company in Limerick, it was under contract to supply a certain quantity of condensed milk to London.  The Condensed Milk Company went out of business temporarily, and when it was in liquidation we got an authorisation to get the milk elsewhere.  We bought some 10,000 tons of condensed milk in Italy, and it cost us less to supply it from Italy to London than from Limerick to London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the terms of this resolution are quite satisfactory.  The only independent authority mentioned are the City Commissioners.  The Dublin Port and Docks Board, naturally enough&mdash;I make no charge against them&mdash;have to deal with the great combine that runs shipping from the ports, and no doubt they try to keep on some sort of satisfactory terms with what I might call their best customer. But I would like to have the City Commissioners <Col N="318" /> strengthened by an official from the Minister's Department who would let other parties see that they must toe the line in this matter. Senator Bennett referred to monopolies which were not run in the interests of the community, but if I were a director of a company my first consideration would have to be the shareholders, and I am charitable enough to think that they are running in the interests of the shareholders.  But the Department of Industry and Commerce should see that the freights must at least be competitive with the freights charged from other countries to Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNOR</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has my hearty approval.  I think it is a most important one for the Irish cattle industry, which is the staple industry of our country.  This question has been raised again and again.  It is twelve months ago since the question was raised before, and a promise was given that the matter would be looked into by the Minister, but practically nothing has been done since by the Minister. The Department of Agriculture has been successful in increasing and improving the breed of our cattle.  Naturally people are very interested and are anxious to facilitate and promote the interests of our cattle in every possible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are hampered and hindered considerably by the high freights and rates. As regards railway charges, we are glad to have here now as a member of the House, Senator Sir Walter Nugent, who is Chairman of the Amalgamated Railways. He is a very competent authority to speak on the question of rates.  We know personally that we have his sympathy.  We know that the present railway rates are about 120 per cent. over the pre-war, while the rates across Channel are more than 200 per cent. over pre-war.  The accommodation at the North Wall is simply monopolised by the shipping people who are in charge there.  Independent companies are practically shut out as regards getting a chance to have berthage.  There has been a successful opposition to the inauguration of new shipping.  The attempts made in that direction were more or less smothered by the people who are in control there, <Col N="319" /> and who also occupy the position of having freight-carrying steamers.  In consequence the venture has been more or less a dead letter.</P>
    <P>Now that there are so many members of these companies members of this House, we hope that the Government will take serious steps to have a change made for the better.  As regards the handling of the cattle across channel and accommodation on the boats, while we have not so much to complain about on that score there is still room for some improvement. Speaking on behalf of the cattle trade and those interested in the farming and grazing business, I desire to make an earnest appeal to the Government on this matter.  The position of these people during the last three or four seasons has been a pitiable one, and we ask the Government to co-operate with us in coming to their assistance.  We think there should be an all-round reduction in freights, and that the railways should try to effect through rates from this country to different parts of England.  They should do that in the interests of the trade.  A good deal could be done for the trade in the way of helping it along if a system of through rates were adopted and put into operation in Ireland.  I strongly support the motion.  I hope that the Seanad will give it sympathetic consideration, and that there will be no objection to it from any part of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'HANLON Mr. O'HANLON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator's exact words were &ldquo;no reduction.&rdquo; That is an attitude of mind to which the farmers of this country very strongly object.  I suppose that one may accept it that when Senator Dowdall was speaking in that fashion he was thinking mainly of his shares, as he himself confessed.  The position <Col N="320" /> is that our farmers are asked to do practically everything.  They are asked to produce more, to employ more, and to introduce more scientific methods of production.  They are asked to work harder and longer.  They have, in great degree, done all these things.  The farmers of the country have eliminated many of the small comforts of their homes.  They have reduced the wages of their unfortunate workers, who are as highly skilled as the workers in most occupations, to practically a starvation level.  They have themselves done without many of the little necessaries of life.  A lot of them are in an exceedingly bad way.  They are employing more scientific and better methods in many ways in their industry.  They are producing more, and, notwithstanding all that, it is very poor encouragement for them to be told that when they produce still more their freight charges will be reduced somewhat.</P>
      <P>If there is anything more discouraging for the farmers of this country, it is the attitude taken up on the part of the transport authorities here.  If the farmers have done the things that I have enumerated, then I think the transport authorities should at least come some distance and meet them.  It is time, I think, that they decided to give some consideration to this question of transport charges.  Unless they do that, I do not think the present condition of things is fair, nor do I think it is a far-seeing attitude on their part. The farmer is selling his produce at from 20 to 40 per cent. above pre-war prices, while transport charges, particularly cross-Channel charges, are from 100 to 200 per cent. over pre-war.  If that is a fair condition of things, then let it continue, but this House should give its answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the economic dictum preached by Senator Dowdall is one that will meet with the approval of men who take a far-seeing view of things in this country.  The position to be inferred from the motion is that you have in this country a monopoly that can charge what it likes on the produce and livestock leaving our ports.  I can say of my own knowledge that the people in the cattle trade have striven valiantly to get a site for lairage accommodation <Col N="321" /> at the North Wall.  They failed absolutely.  They have no lairage and no access to berthage, no access to warehouses, and no way of getting anything. If the charges at the port of Dublin are increased 100 per cent. there are two things that can happen. The cattle trade will have to pay the excessive rate charges on the livestock exported from the port, or else they will have to export cattle from some port other than that of Dublin.  That is a very unfortunate condition of things, and is a matter that should be remedied.  The cattle trade, may I say with great respect to Senator Counihan, if additional burdens have to be carried, will not have to bear them.  What would happen is that the increased burdens would be passed on to the backs of the unfortunate farmers.  If the cattle traders have to pay excessive freight charges, they naturally will not pay them out of their own pockets. The burden will have to be borne by the unfortunate farmer who sells a cow or a bullock or a pig.</P>
    <P>May I say that I was rather encouraged by the maiden speech of Senator Sir Walter Nugent.  I hope he will live up to that.  I know of my own knowledge that there are 23 acres of ground at the North Wall, portion of which is very suitable for lairage accommodation. When we are told that it was a question of one site as against another, it is quite true that the Chairman of the Amalgamated Railways made an offer of a site.  The site looked all right on the map, but when examined it was found to be all wrong inasmuch as it was not easy of access and there were bad exits.  To establish a lairage there was simply out of the question.  The Amalgamated Railways Company have, however, in another position there 16 or 17 acres of land which they are not using and are not likely to use for quite a long time to come.  Even if they were using this land for their own purpose, I do not know of any purpose to which, in the long run, it would be more conducive to utilise that land than in the establishment of a municipal lairage.  I believe it would be in the company's own best interests as well as in the interests of the country generally that <Col N="322" /> the land should be devoted to that purpose.</P>
    <P>I think it is one of the main functions of railway companies where, at a main port, there do not exist considerable lairage facilities to provide them themselves.  The Great Northern Company has done it.  The Amalgamated Railways Companies might, I say with great respect, do it with great advantage to themselves.  At the present time we are simply in a cul-de-sac.  The cattle trade can do nothing.  Something should be done and an opportunity given to the cattle trade and the farmers who are prepared to put up the money.  They will do something.  They will provide the capital; they will get expert advice and assistance on this matter, and they will do the work.  All they are asking for is the opportunity to do it.  I think that, for these reasons, the resolution is an eminently sensible and reasonable one.  The alternative is to allow the combines to operate.  If we have achieved in any way a measure of national independence, I am afraid that we are very far away from anything like economic independence.  All our livestock leaving this country and going through the Port of Dublin are going on ships that are controlled by combines and under shipping combinations whose centres are entirely outside this country.  That is not a right state of things, and I think we should tackle the position and try to mend it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>As a layman listening to this discussion and to the views expressed by those who are really interested in the cattle trade of the country, it strikes one that this is a question the Government might look into further.  The Minister, perhaps, may be able to give all the information that has been asked for, and may be able to clear up many of the things that have been said.  One of the points made is that the present lairage accommodation is not first class, and does not enable those concerned to send cattle across the water in the condition that they ought to be sent.  The second point is that there is not adequate berthage.  These are matters that I think a Government department could inquire into, and say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the points put forward.  If <Col N="323" /> the case made is proved, I have not the slightest doubt but that it is in the power of the Government to remedy these matters.</P>
      <P>If the lairage accommodation is not sufficient, and if cattle are not sent across the Channel in the best condition possible, then that is a matter of vital importance.  I would imagine that the Minister would be able to say from the reports of his inspectors whether this is the case or not.  An enormous number of cattle are handled at the port of Dublin, and I think we should be able to have some assurance from the Department's inspectors on the points that I have been dealing with.  From what we have heard, and I think the case has been pretty well proved, the present berthage and lairage accommodation are at the present time in the hands of the companies who take our cattle across the Channel.  It has also been proved, I think, that the cattle trade is not in a position to do what some big traders have already done for themselves&mdash;that is, to charter their own steamers, bring the steamers up to the point where they have berthage accommodation and take the cattle away.  That is another matter which I, as a layman at least, would like to have the views of the Government on.  If the Government made an inquiry, it would be well if we had their views on that matter.</P>
      <P>A different question, however, is how the Government are going to bring down the freights that are charged on the export of cattle.  I am not at all sure that that matter does not lie largely in the hands of the cattle trade itself.  It is perfectly evident, however, if they cannot get berthage and lairage accommodation that they cannot do much for themselves.  There is a case, I think, for a Government inquiry, and then let all the information obtained be given to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question before the House is one of vital importance to the country.  An urgent appeal has been made for an investigation.  Now that we have as a member of the House the Chairman of the Amalgamated Railways Company, he will undoubtedly be in a position to assist if an inquiry is set up.  He will be in a position to give to the Committee <Col N="324" /> all the ins and outs with regard to through freights and matters of that kind.  I think that if the Government will investigate the matter and get all the information possible with regard to through freights, relating particularly to the export of cattle, it would be very valuable indeed.  I think a case has been made out to show that the matter requires serious consideration.  I have no doubt myself but that probably the Government are giving it that serious consideration.  I hope that as a result of this motion all the information possible will be laid before the House.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with Senator Jameson that a strong case has been made.  The case put forward is unsupported by evidence.  I am afraid I am in the same position with regard to evidence or facts as I was arising out of the Conference which I said on the last occasion I would call. I presume when Senator Counihan asks me to state what has been done as a result of the last resolution by the Seanad that I have his authority to indicate what was the course of the correspondence and interviews I had with certain members of the cattle trade and what was the result.  It will be remembered that on the debate on the 13th May I said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would be prepared at a later date to take up with the Minister for Agriculture the whole question, and with him to approach the shipping companies and other important people in the first instance as to a determination of prices charged for freights and to inquire into the reason for these prices and to see if we could not get better accommodation.  When one sees the result of all this a motion of this kind might be put down again if people are not satisfied with the results.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That statement I have quoted was made in the Seanad, following a statement by Senator Brown, who put the point of view that it would be better to have an investigation to see if we could get agreement as to the charges made.  One of my officials wrote on the 18th June to Senator Counihan:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer to your motion in An Seanad on 13th May, dealing, inter alia, with shipping freights, <Col N="325" /> and to say that the Minister, who will shortly be investigating this matter, considers it would be advantageous that he should have before him a considered statement from those on whose behalf your motion was put forward setting out as precisely as possible the grievances for which a remedy is sought.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Your statement in An Seanad instanced certain grievances, but could not be expected in the time available to have set out the full case.  It will be appreciated that what is most necessary for the Minister's purpose is not so much the complaint that freights or other charges are high, since all traders benefit from their being low, but whatever evidence is available to show that they are higher than under existing conditions is reasonable from the point of view of the shipping companies.  The latter are providing, as private undertakings, services in return for a commercial profit, and what the Minister has to investigate is whether on the whole the rate of profits now being obtained must, having regard to the capital invested, be considered as unreasonable. If it is not, then, though the present level of freights may create serious difficulties for Saorstát traders, the Minister cannot fairly hold the shipping companies solely responsible for those difficulties.  A remedy would have to be sought in other directions. Before interviewing the shipping companies, therefore, the Minister desires to have the fullest statement which those acting with you, and having intimate knowledge of shipping services, are able to prepare, setting out the particulars in which you consider that a prima facie case against the shipping companies for making excessive charges in respect of all or any of the services they render can be established. If, further, you have cases to show in which unreasonable conditions connected with the handling of traffic and involving traders in unnecessary expenses are imposed by the shipping companies the Minister would like to have full information about them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I got a letter in reply to that signed on behalf of the Executive of the Irish Cattle Traders' Association by Mr. <Col N="326" /> John Cassidy and Senator Counihan. One paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Apparently from your communication the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not require to have anything further added to the statement made by Senator Counihan in the Senate on May 13th, setting forth the grievances under which the cattle trade labours in respect of high freightage charges on livestock.  Further details could be added to those already furnished, and it would be more within the competency and to the liking of the Executive to deal with that particular aspect of the position rather than to attempt to present a statement covering the case as to whether the rate of profit made by the shipping companies could, having regard to the capital invested, be regarded as unreasonable. Frankly the absence of the data essential to the preparation of a detailed and comprehensive statement on this aspect of the question puts it beyond the possibilities of this Executive, and it is felt that the difficulties in that respect will be fully appreciated by the Minister himself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then I got a statement with regard to the shipping combine, and how they acquired the Dublin and Lancashire Company, and how certain members of that company became directors of the British and Irish Company.  But there is not a word as to what I asked&mdash;not even a statement of a case as to unreasonable demands.  I wanted them to refer to the question of berthage, and so on.  In fact the excuse was made, &ldquo;We cannot give it to you.&rdquo;  After that, as I have explained, one of my officials had an interview with Senator Counihan.  After that the matter was left for some time.  Then there was the June election, and the tragedy that occurred after that, and a second election. It was not until the end of November that I was able to deal with this.  Again I asked my secretary to write to Senator Counihan, and ask him to call and see me.  When he called I had authorised my private secretary to explain to him the reasons for the delay.  Then follows a memo from my own private secretary:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I told the Senator that the Minister, on his return from a holiday <Col N="327" /> which he was taking to recuperate from his recent illness, would take steps, if the Senator so wished, to arrange for the joint conference, but that the Minister for Agriculture, with whom he had conferred in the matter, did not think that he could be of assistance, and would not be present.  If the conference was going to be held, my instructions from the Minister were to ask Mr. Ingram to collect all available information and to have it ready by the Minister's return.  Senator Counihan informed me that he did not think a conference between the two parties would now serve any useful purpose.  The cattle traders were about to put before the Minister for Agriculture a proposal for the establishment at the port of a modern-equipped lairage which, if adopted, would, among other beneficial effects, result, he hoped, in the easing of the freights situation.  He would rather that the matter should be left over for the present, and promised to inform the Cattle Traders' Association of our interview.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another conference was called between the officials of the Department of Agriculture and the shipping companies, to whom we put every information we had been able to collect with regard to high freights.  We asked for an explanation, and that explanation we intended to submit to a test. We did not get the meeting of the cattle traders to have that test applied. It was quite clearly proved that talk of 100 per cent. to 200 per cent. increase on pre-war freights is nonsense. Speaking of freights, the combines spoken of have given to the Cattle Traders' Association their figures. These figures go to prove as regards shipping companies that portion of the through rate is something less than 70 per cent. over pre-war.</P>

      <P>I have no brief for anybody in this matter.  I am only indicating the steps taken to try and get the people concerned, the shipping companies and the Cattle Traders' Association, into a discussion on this matter.  I failed then though I did what I could to get in one party.  I have certain information they gave me. That is open to a further test.  In addition to the meeting called by the Department of Agriculture at which representatives of the shipping company were present, there was a further conference. There was a big conference of people interested in livestock, and I believe they set up a sub-committee that was to meet with the shipping companies and representatives of the Great Southern and the Great Northern Railways Companies.  What happened?  A report is given in the <i>Independent</i> of the 26th December.  The report stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. M.F. Keogh, General Manager, G.S.R., presided.  Senator Counihan and Mr. C.F. McLoughlin, Secretary, Irish Farmers' Union, on behalf of the Committee representing farmers and exporters, urged that the companies were not justified in maintaining freight charges at their present high level.  Mr. D. Barry, O.B.E., replied for the carrying companies, and urged co-operative marketing on the part of the exporters as an alternative to a reduction in freight rates.  This suggestion was not well received by the Committee, and there were some heated exchanges.  It was stated by the exporters' representatives that if the carrying companies did not yield, exporters <Col N="329" /> would be forced to find alternative means of putting livestock and meat on the English markets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was agreed that another conference would be held.  I do not think the matter is beyond that stage yet.  A resolution was brought forward here on the matter last May but it was withdrawn, asking if I would try to get the Minister for Agriculture to get the shipping people and the Cattle Traders' Association together.  We did not succeed.  It appeared to be the wish of the Cattle Traders' Association that that conference should not be held, and for that they had their own reasons. That being the situation I had no opportunity of receiving a statement with regard to freights.  I had a statement with regard to railway freights&mdash;railway and pre-war rates from the Cattle Traders' Association to the effect that there was an increase of something between 100 and 200 per cent.  I asked for references, but the Cattle Traders' Association replied that they had not the data available.  A point I wish to make is that one has to take into consideration as far as the shipping companies are concerned from the point of view of the reasonableness or otherwise of their freights the amount of capital in their concerns.  I say, if freights, though justified by the capital involved, are still too high, then other provisions and remedies will have to be sought.  But as far as I am concerned I have not been able to get the Cattle Traders' Association to have any approach to the shipping and railway companies.  This resolution as it stands is innocuous but consideration has to be given to what emerges from it.  The contention that the freights are unreasonably high cannot be admitted without further investigation, and I do not think the Senators should commit themselves to the declaration that the rates are unreasonably high. It may come out after examination.  I would like to have that investigation carried further and brought to some point. Let the cattle trade bring their practical experience to bear on the figures that we have produced and let us see how they relate to capital.  The Government <Col N="330" /> is &ldquo;requested to confer with the Dublin Commissioners and the Dublin Port and Docks Board, with a view to the provision and erection of an adequate municipal lairage.&rdquo;  I assume that that means that the Government should confer with the Dublin Commissioners, and the Dublin Port and Docks Board, so as to get a lairage erected, presumably at the Government's expense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. COUNIHAN Mr. COUNIHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COUNIHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not particular so long as it is provided. The cattle trade will pay the interest on the outlay, and for the upkeep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The erection of the lairage is not to be at the expense of the cattle trade.  Therefore, this would involve the Government in expenditure, and the Senator asks the Government to embark on that expenditure without the necessary investigation having been made.  As to the berthage, I may not have been specific enough, and possibly the letter might have been written more clearly, but I thought I was precise in asking that if there were any difficulties about berthage, instances would be given. There is a Ports and Harbours Tribunal sitting.  It has three harbours still left, out of 24 assigned to it, to consider, Dublin being one.  It will approach the consideration of the port of Dublin in about another four weeks. If there are complaints put up and evidence given that the complaints are based on facts, that evidence should be given, I think, quite properly, before the Ports and Harbours Tribunal.  We could then get it quite clear as to what is the position of the Combine with regard to berthage for boats that other people may charter.  I do not think any case has been made.  There have been statements made.  Has there been an instance given to this House where the cattle trade was refused?  Senator Dowdall possibly gave the only concrete case.  There may be others.  I hear an enormous number of complaints, but nothing specific has ever come to me, and on that point I have no hesitation in saying that if complaints are well-founded about the Port and Docks Board not providing berthage where it was reasonable that it <Col N="331" /> should be provided, then I can answer that any Government action will be taken that is necessary.  But the case will have to be made.  One cannot come down and simply treat these people as if they were not in fact doing their duty before the case is made.</P>
      <P>Then there is the question about the site for the lairage.  Senator O'Hanlon was anxious about that.  There again if a case can be made that there is a site, that a proper consideration has been offered for it, and that it is unreasonably being withheld, it can be tackled.  I prefer to tackle it by going to the railway company and the Port and Docks Board to see if anything could be done.  I would rather approach accommodation in this way than have a fight before there is necessity for a fight.  Let us try to approach it in this reasonable way.  But the erection of the lairage is quite a different matter. Once a site is provided, and once it is clear that the Port and Docks Board can be coerced, if they are recalcitrant, into giving proper berthage facilities somewhere near the lairage, the next thing is the expenditure of the money on the provision of this lairage.  I suggest that that is for the Corporation and for the Cattle Traders' Association to consider, when they have a turnover of £14,000,000 per annum&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;rather than to approach the Government.  I think it is essentially a matter for the Cattle Traders' Association.  One of the items dealt with in the discussion raised consideration of the question of freights. That is a matter this House has something to say to.  We had complaints from time to time, not specifically from the cattle traders themselves, but from them joined with others, that the way in which live stock was shipped cross-Channel was inhuman&mdash;and this rather appealed to the cattle traders more than to other&mdash;that it resulted in damage to the beasts&mdash;which resulted in smaller prices on the other side.  Departmental regulations were issued on foot of certain representations that were made.  That has to be looked to when one considers the question of <Col N="332" /> freight.  A boat belonging to the British and Irish Company used to take about 600 cattle, but under the new regulations it can only take 450 head. Obviously, there has to be an increase in the charge per head on the live stock, but that increase is met on the other side, I am told, by the extra price now got for the live stock arriving in an undamaged condition.  That could easily be put up here, and that would be included in any consideration of the case.</P>
      <P>The House should at any rate hold its hand with regard to this motion until such time as it has been found that somebody has prevented the acquisition of a site for a lairage at a convenient spot on the North Wall, and that the Dublin Port and Docks Board is not giving facilities with regard to berthage when these facilities should be given; also that meanwhile this question of freights should be better considered by all the parties concerned, and that the Cattle Traders' Association should take this matter up seriously, as they have not done so far, and get into touch with the railway and shipping companies.  The Minister for Agriculture or myself could get the parties into a conference.  But let this matter be thrashed out and let us have more information than I must confess we have at the moment.  We have not proper information.  I have a statement from the British and Irish Steampacket Company with regard to freights.  That statement has been denied in this House.  I would like to have that question debated back and forward so that we could know where we are.  If the freights are unreasonable, are they reasonable from the point of view of those who put their capital into the concern?  If that were so there could be some question of a subsidy or something like that arising.  But at the moment there is not sufficient information on which one could be asked to pass the motion, and I would ask that this matter be held up, certainly until the berthage question is dealt with by the Port and Docks Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. FORAN Mr. FORAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FORAN</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister talks about a reasonable return on capital invested is he going to take any <Col N="333" /> notice whatever of the very liberal terms that this Combine, or octopus, paid to the Irish companies?  If he is to go on that principle then the cattle traders can get no reduction whatever in the freights.  These companies were taken over at far beyond their value, and if these people get a return on that capital there can be no reduction on the freights for the cattle traders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no definition as to what is reasonable or not.  It is for the conference to discuss, to see what return is being made, and to give to the House the facts afterwards.  All I can talk of is what was said in this letter of the 18th June: &ldquo;The latter (the shipping companies) are providing, as private undertakings, services in return for a commercial profit, and what the Minister has to investigate is whether on the whole the rate of profits now being obtained must, having regard to the capital invested, be considered as reasonable.&rdquo;  I asked for figures on which a judgment could be formed.  I do not say that my judgment as to what is reasonable or unreasonable should be accepted, but that we should get the facts.</P>

They have humbugged the Farmers' Union; they have silenced the Chamber of Commerce, and they got the Minister for Industry and Commerce to come up here as an advocate for them.  In reply to the statement that we did not give the Minister the information required, the information that we said was asked for by his Department was that we should show what would be a reasonable freight to pay interest on the capital of this combine.  We gave the Minister the case of the Brussels, the purchase price of which we showed was 500 times its actual economic value.  We could not be supposed to find out what was the outlay on the different ships of the independent Irish companies which this combine had purchased, but we pointed out to the Minister that these companies were bought, regardless of their values, to complete the monopoly and to get the whole thing into their hands, for the sake of charging what freights they chose.</P>
