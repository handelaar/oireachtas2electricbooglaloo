      <P>There are several substantial amendments to this Bill, and one of them in particular will require careful consideration, because I understand that a similar amendment was ruled out of order by the Speaker. It is very desirable that, if possible, in a matter of that kind there should be no conflict between the Speaker in the Dáil and the Chairman of your House. I do not at present know exactly the reasons which induced the Speaker to <Col N="656" /> rule it out of order.  It differs in one respect&mdash;which may have a great bearing on it&mdash;that the particular amendment was in this case raised for the first time on the Report Stage.  A similar amendment is now raised on the Committee Stage here, and how far that might have had an effect on the Speaker's mind I do not know, but owing to the regrettable absence of the Minister in charge of the Bill, which is represented as not being absolutely urgent, I think it would be in the interests of all parties if we did not take it to-day.  Therefore, with the leave of the House, I would suggest that consideration of the Committee Stage stand over for the convenience of the Minister.</P>

      <P>We are in the same position with regard to the Dentists Bill.  The House will recollect that a very important amendment was moved by Senator Hooper.  It was fully discussed the last day, and in the end it was arranged, as the Minister seemed to favour Senator Hooper's amendment, that it would require careful consideration in drafting, as manifestly it would, because it introduced a new scheme and a new idea, one which seemed to be generally acceptable to the House.  The House will recollect that the proposition was that instead of having a Third Schedule with selected names upon it, there should be an opportunity given to all these persons to pass a qualifying examination with a view to getting their names on the Register.  That seemed to commend itself and to meet with the sanction of the House, but it is manifestly a thing that requires consideration, which the Minister, unfortunately, was not able to give it.  I am afraid I must ask the House to let this Bill stand over also.</P>

      <P>We intend the principle of the amendments to deal with turf bogs and with occupiers who might not be rated occupiers.  There are clauses in several places through the Bill referring to rated occupiers, and simply because we are dealing with land it is proposed to take out the word &ldquo;rated&rdquo; and leave the unqualified &ldquo;occupiers&rdquo; there.  These are really drafting amendments to deal with the occupiers of bogs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has any objection to this amendment, but this perhaps would be the most convenient time to deal with the whole question of turbary.  When the Bill was first before us the Minister said that he recognised that some amendment was necessary, and that he was prepared to put down certain amendments.  He has put down very lengthy amendments. He was good enough to ask me to see his legal advisers on the subject of the amendments, and I did so.  I must say that I do not think they meet <Col N="658" /> the case.  They are very involved, and I think the amendment I have put down would much better meet the necessities of the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I prefer my amendment, and I will tell the Seanad shortly my reasons.  Nearly all the dissatisfaction which is taking place&mdash;and it has been very considerable&mdash;with the effect of arterial drainage has arisen from this cause, that people other than those receiving the advantáge have been called upon to pay for it.  My sympathies go to the Minister <Col N="659" /> in this matter, as it is a very involved and a very difficult question to understand, especially for those who have not been actively engaged in the working of these schemes.  The Minister has to take his advice from people who never had to administer a drainage district, and who have no experience as to where the shoe pinches in actual practice. No doubt to his legal advisers and to the people who generally carry out the preliminaries it seems very much simpler to tax the turbary, and that is what his amendment aims at doing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Turbary in that form has no value.  I mean that it will receive no benefit from the execution of the drainage works.  A cut-away bog receives no value when the turf is cut away.  The thing that is of value is the turf but, instead of taxing turf, they propose to tax turbary.  Unless the turf is cut and saved there is no benefit derived from drainage.  That there will be benefit in almost every district in which drainage can be carried on in the West of Ireland is unquestionable. The turf in most of these bogs has been cut down to the level that the water allows.  If you lower the level of the water unquestionably you bring a lot more valuable turbary in, and give facilities for cutting the turf, but you do not benefit the turbary until the turf is cut.  My contention is that the turf should be taxed and not the turbary. Perhaps I might explain the matter a little further.  I know many cases in which the landlords when fair rents were being fixed on the lands and who also owned the bogs, which were perhaps some little distance from the lands, were compelled to give rights to the tenants to cut turf.  Many of the fair rent orders contained such provisions. I can mention one case of this kind. A man owned a bog which was rendered valuable by reason of the execution of drainage work, but which was situate some miles from the rest of his property. <Col N="660" /> He derived his income from the rest of his property.  He derived nothing from the turbary but his tenants had the right to go there and cut turf.  When the Drainage Board applied to him for the rate fixed on the valuation of the turbary&mdash;exactly what the Minister's amendment proposes to do&mdash;he consulted his lawyers, who were very astute people, and they told him the best thing he could do was to transfer the turbary to a pauper.  He did so subject to the rights of the tenants to go in and cut turf.  No doubt, he had to give the pauper perhaps a few shillings to allow his name to be used, but the result was that, when the Drainage Board went for the rates assessed on the turbary, they could not get them.  That did not prevent people from going to the bog and cutting the turf.  They cut large quantities of the turf which was rendered valuable by the execution of the drainage work, but the Drainage Board found it impossible to levy any rate on the turf.  My amendment would meet that case.  My proposal is that where the turf is cut and where it is being removed it should be taxed.  The Minister's advisers and the legal people seem to see some difficulty about that.  They fear it will create some new officials, perhaps people who will be paid extravagant sums for collecting the rates on the turf.  But in practice that is a very simple matter, and has been in operation throughout the country for many years.  There is an official, well-known in the country, called a bog ranger, and there are many people quite willing to accept the position. It gives him a certain amount of rural importance and it makes him a personage in that part of the country. He collected the rate for every load of turf removed from the bog&mdash;and the bog ranger knows everyone&mdash;and retained a percentage, perhaps 1/- or 2/- in the £. on the amount collected.  There is no difficulty about doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is not done there is another re-action.  You will always find people seeking to evade&mdash;and very naturally&mdash; the obligation of contributing money for the benefit of somebody else.  In a district that I know what happened in one case was that the cost of the work originally was £1,400.  It was very small but, in addition to improving a <Col N="661" /> certain quantity of land, it enabled a large quantity of turf to be cut away. The landlord was an absentee and the agent was also an absentee.  The tenant had rights to cut turf but a great many people who had absolutely no rights at all availed of the opportunity to cut turf.  If there had been a bog ranger there to collect from them so much per load it would have been all right.  There was no machinery to enable such a person to be appointed and the rates recovered, and the people cut away until they cut the bog down to the level of the water again.  They then petitioned the Board of Works, saying that the drainage had been neglected, that the works had been allowed to fall into disrepair, and that it affected the lands which for all practical purposes were on a level with the water.  That was a fact. The Board of Works sent down inspectors to report and they reported that the land was on a level with the water and they concluded that the original work was never carried out.  They expended a sum of money which, if my memory serves me right, ran into half as much as the sum that was spent originally on the works in deepening the drainage again.  The same process was gone through after a few years when the people again petitioned the Board of Works to come and inspect the drainage on the ground that the previous work had not been properly carried out.  The Board of Works sent down a very competent engineer and he took levels.  He referred them to the usual bench marks and he found that not only had the original works, and the second works, been carried out but what had happened was that the surface of the land had been lowered by the cutting away of the bog.  They spent a couple of hundred pounds again and still there was no means of collecting money from the people who removed turf.  Eventually things got so bad that the Board of Works had to get a receiver appointed over the place.  What did they themselves do?  They then refused to allow the receiver to pay the drainage maintenance rate.</P>
    <P>I have letters here that I could read if necessary, but there is no use delaying the Seanad.  Further arrears had <Col N="662" /> accumulated and the other people stated they were not going to continue spending money improving this land for the Board of Works when the Board of Works would not pay their share of it.  Unless my amendment, or something to the same purpose, is included in the Bill, the Bill will not have the effect that I am anxious about.  The Minister's amendments do not meet that case.  I am very anxious this should be done, because arterial drainage, which is capable of doing an immense amount of good, has had a stigma placed on it that it is unsatisfactory, and it has been largely for the reasons I have mentioned.  If this amendment is inserted in the Bill I hope that it will lead to a similar clause being inserted in the larger Acts.  If the Minister will take it from me there need be no difficulty in the carrying out of this arrangement, as it is only people in Dublin who have no experience of how things work in the country, who think a system of putting a tax on turbary would not be satisfactory. Supposing a man is assessed with a certain repayment, and if, as might easily happen, no one goes to cut turf there, and if he receives absolutely no benefit, why should he be taxed?  If the turf is cut away the same valuation will probably remain on it.  I am not quite clear from the Minister's amendment if that is so.  I do not see how that could be avoided.  If so, it will hamper reclamation of the land.  There is a great deal of cut-away bog that might be reclaimed, I think it would be a very desirable thing that it should be reclaimed, but the man who reaps the benefit from it is the man who goes to the expense and trouble of reclaiming the land.  It would be an encouragement for him to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to oppose the amendment, because I think the Government amendment to Section 16 meets the case better than that of Senator Barrington.  The Senator took us into his confidence as to the interview with the Ministry and I share it to the full.  I do not think it is a wise thing to revert to the old system of the bog rangers in this particular matter.  I do not think it is a wise thing to have the council, every other day&mdash;which would probably happen under this amendment&mdash;considering whether the owners or occupiers were to pay a certain proportion of the drainage rates.  The point is whether the existing turbary is improved or extended, or whether facilities for working it are increased. If a drainage scheme has added to the value of the turbary land, that particular amount should be assessed separately and distinctly and levied with a drainage rate.  That seems to me to be a better plan than to have a council, as they would be empowered under this scheme, continually exercising thought as to whether a particular load of turf&mdash;and a load of turf is emphasised&mdash;had actually gained by drainage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  A load of turf in the country is what is put on the cart when it is brought out on to the road.  The turf is drawn out, in many cases, on sleighs, on donkeys, and on women's backs, and on arriving on the road it is put into a cart.  Then, in my opinion, it becomes a load of turf. Under this you should have on the road a man observing all the minor operations, and each load counted and separately assessed.  Is it desirable that that should be allowed?  Is it desirable to do what is outlined in the amendment, &ldquo;that the county council or joint committee shall fix and collect such <Col N="664" /> rate, either per turf bank or per load removed, as will, in their judgment, secure for the turbary owners or occupiers such a proportionate contribution&rdquo;? While this Bill lasts they will continually have to exercise their judgment as to whether a particular load of turf is enjoying an advantage under the main drainage scheme.  I do not think that could be done.  I think the proposal of the Government meets the position whereby every advantage gained from the drying of the land will be levied in connection with the existing rate.  I claim that that will equitably meet the case, and that it is an amendment which the Seanad ought to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with Senator Barrington's amendment, as a rough-and-ready way out of not paying the rate until you have the money in your pocket, but that runs counter entirely to the mode in which drainage rates are always levied. They have always been levied on what has been improved&mdash;on the agricultural land which has been drained, and on the rights to the turbary which have been improved.  It is not the turf that is rated; it is the right of turbary that is benefited by a scheme. Therefore the amendment of Senator Barrington runs counter to the legal mode in which these rates have always been levied and have always been quite easily collected.  The Senator need not be afraid that the rates under the Minister's amendment will be levied after the bog is cut away.  Under the Minister's amendment provision is made for the valuation of the rights of turbary so as to provide that the assessment will depend on the life of the bank.  If it is a long-lived bank the assessment will probably go over several years and be paid in instalments, but if it has a short life, or one the real value of which can be easily estimated, it will probably be levied in one lump sum.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that the amendment suggested by the Minister is the most sensible one.  It appears to me to be absurd that we should have people on the bogs to count the loads of turf that come out and levy so much on each load.  That would come to more for supervision and detective work on <Col N="665" /> the bog than the rates.  I think the most sensible thing would be to accept the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Senator is really fair to the people responsible in this matter when he describes them as people who have no experience of how these things work in the country.  I realise that it probably will be necessary for legislation to be introduced amending the 1925 Act, so that turf bogs under any drainage scheme under that Act will be dealt with in the up-to-date and systematic method proposed in my amendment.  I would like to set the Senator's mind and the mind of the Seanad generally at rest.  Senator Barrington has stated that in 80 per cent. of the cases in which drainage is carried out turf bogs, to some extent, will be improved, so that the problem is fairly wide.  If much drainage is carried on, you are going to have a lot of areas in the country affected by the drainage of bogs, which makes the matter all the more necessary to be dealt with in a systematic and thorough-going way. What is proposed is that when the scheme is being set out first, as well as showing the land that will be improved, and also the extent of the improvement, there will be a clear statement as to the turbary that will be improved, and to the extent that it is understood it will be improved.  When the report, after the work is carried out, is made it will include bog land.  In the same way lands pure and simple will be kept separate.  The turbary will be set aside separately.  Just as in the case of land, a drainage assessment will be made and a drainage rate struck.  In the same way for turbary improvements a turbary assessment will be made.  But it will be recognised that no permanent improvement is made to turbary rights by drainage.  Turbary rights are improved, but the improvement is not permanent.  Once the turf is cut away the improvement of the turbary rights is gone.  The report will show, as I say, the turbary <Col N="666" /> position separately, and the certificate that will be given based on the report, will state the people and the turbary rights that are involved.  It will state definitely the total amount that is to be charged to the scheme for turbary right improvements and the individual amounts that have to be charged to the owners of the turbary rights.  In each particular case, according to the circumstances, it can be fixed, whether there is to be a certain number of monthly, half-yearly or yearly payments. If it is the case that there is a particular bog area where turf-cutting is not in full swing, the certifying may be delayed for a year or two.  There is no reason why there should not be a setting-back of the main payment or the rate of payment to make the time for payment of the turbary assessment coincide, as far as possible, with the period during which the actual value would be received for the turf by the owners.  The amendment here says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(g)  the county council or joint committee charged under this Act with the carrying out of a drainage scheme shall, when fixing the drainage assessments in respect of such scheme, also fix the turbary assessments to be assessed on and paid by the respective owners of turbary rights benefited in respect of such rights by the carrying out of the scheme and shall fix such assessments in all respects as appears to them to be just and equitable having regard to the manner in and extent to which such owners are so benefited by the carrying out of the scheme and in particular may fix any such assessment as a lump sum payable in one instalment or in two or more instalments over a period of months or years or as an annual or a half-yearly sum of fixed or variable amount payable over a number of years.</P>

      <P>Yes.  That is following on (g) in the proposed new section.  I think the Senator must admit that we have in that particular clause full powers for the county councils.  It was suggested that a man, perhaps, will not cut his turf at all.  It may be that a man will not till his land at all.  If he is the kind of person who will not cut his turf at all, I suggest that it would be unfair, because of the improvement made available to him, that the amount of money that should be paid by him should be borne by the county council or by the other benefitees under the scheme, and that it must be made up in some way or other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the difficulty. As a rule the manner in which these things are done is that an auction is held, or there is a sale of a turf bank before the season commences.  The man sells it to the people who want to cut it, and they remove it, no doubt. Why should you make him responsible?</P>

      <P>If there is a case of a bog of 100 acres, clearly, under paragraphs (g) and (h), the circumstances of that particular owner and the likelihood of that turf being cut within four years, or within ten years, can be taken into consideration in the fixing of his rate.  But if a bog of 100 acres has got a very definite improvement as the result of a drainage scheme, we cannot face that problem by saying: &ldquo;Well, if this man does not realise his turf then the county council has to pay for the work that has been carried out, in so far as it refers to him, or the other benefitees under the scheme have to have added on to their turbary assessments the amount that he would otherwise have paid.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is really like the case of a person not tilling his land, and if difficulties of that kind are going to arise I would much sooner face them, even though subsequent legislation might be required to deal with them, with this as the basis to start off with <Col N="669" /> than the arrangement that the Senator suggests.  I feel that it would prejudice the carrying out of these drainage schemes generally if a big turbary right element were to enter into them, and if there were not a more systematic way of dealing with them than that suggested by the Senator.  The effect generally of this amendment would be that the turbary-right owners would be put in the same position as landowners from the point of view of applying a scheme to them, that they can protest against a scheme being carried out and they can use as much weight as they will be entitled to under the Bill to prevent it being carried out, to prevent expenses being put on them that they do not want to bear; that they will know beforehand, when the scheme is set out, and subsequently, when the report is set out, before the certificate is issued of people who are going to be chargeable for the benefit under these schemes, and they can make their protests and put up any arguments they like, so that full justice is being done to them and they are put in the same position as owners of land.  The only thing is that the total improvement of turbary rights is set out clearly when the report is made and the certificate issued, and the turbary assessment is collected over a shorter period, if necessary, or at any rate, over a period, and under general arrangements that are more in accordance with the turbary position.</P>

I have put up a case which, to my certain knowledge, has occurred, of a man who had no interest in a bog except that he was the owner, who could not make any use of it himself, but whose tenants had the right of turbary, and he transferred the bog to a pauper.

It cannot be suggested that because a man's property is in his hands that he is not getting benefit out of it, simply because he has to pay rates on it.  I think it would be simpler to put the question and get rid of these individual cases that are really not pertinent to the Bill at all.  It is suggested that turbary rights are more important than the cart-loads of turf. There are other rights in bogs.  The right of grazing must be considered also.</P>

      <P>What is to happen in the case of a large stretch of bog in a poorly populated area that may be drained?  A bog is valuable only in proportion to the population that is in the immediate vicinity.  If there is not a considerable population in the immediate vicinity of a bog, the bog is no use at all, whether it is drained or whether it is not.  Suppose one of these drainage schemes goes through, among <Col N="671" /> other places, a bog that has no population around it may be vastly improved, but it is no good to anybody because there is no one there to cut it. I wonder what will happen in such a case as that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question that must be settled by the land valuer and the land surveyor, who will examine the whole situation and say: &ldquo;Such an amount of money has been spent on this drainage scheme.  These are the lands that have been improved, and these are the turbary rights that have been improved.  The total cost of the scheme should be allocated in proportion between the lands and the turbary rights, because there has been that improvement.&rdquo;  Naturally, it will fall to the land valuer to say the extent to which the turbary rights have been improved.  If the turbary rights have not, in fact, been improved because they are in a place where they cannot ever be used, it would be the duty of the land valuer to say that they had been increased to the value of a farthing an acre, or whatever it might be.  But we could not solve in a piece of legislation problems which can only be dealt with by the land valuer.</P>

The position, as suggested by Senator Moore, is a very possible one, and it is not easy to see how you propose to meet it.  His supposition is this: You have a drainage scheme in a particular area which renders available for cutting a large tract of bog, but there is no market for it, no competition to provide a market for it.

      <P>The valuer would not know it in advance.  The county surveyor prepares his report first, and that goes up to the county council.  As far as he can, he gives the details in that.  The county council decides to go on with the scheme.  The county surveyor then comes back with his scheme, indicates the lands, indicates the turbary rights, and makes an estimate of the extent to which these are likely to be improved.  When that estimate is there, all concerned in the scheme are advised that it is to go ahead, that they are likely to be involved in it to make up the amount of the cost that will be chargeable against them.  If a man owns a large bog which he cannot possibly realise any benefit from, he will know, before the scheme goes ahead at all, that the county surveyor estimates that he will be liable for such an amount.  He can protest; he can make his case, and before the work is ever put in hand.</P>

      <P>I desire to have inserted in sub-section (i) an amendment to this effect:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Or is found destitute, notwithstanding the fact that the child's parent or parents are in possession of some property which it has been proved to the satisfaction of the court is valueless.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As one who, like many other members of this House, for many years acted as a Justice of the Peace, I know that cases like this arose occasionally under the British regime, where children whose parents were absolutely destitute were, nevertheless, in possession of some petty property&mdash;house property or land&mdash;and if these parents were not of good reputation, it was highly desirable that the children should be safeguarded by being sent to some industrial institution.  If this idea is not already covered in this admirable Bill &mdash;which I trust will always be associated with the name of Senator Brady a Bill which has been long called for and earnestly desired, not only in this country, but across the Channel&mdash;and if it does not clash with the principle of the Bill, I should like to have such an amendment inserted.</P>

      <P>I understood that amendments were being introduced to this Bill to make the duty of the magistrate quite specific, because I do not know what is going to happen about &ldquo;likely to continue&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;where the parents are unable and likely to continue to be unable.&rdquo;  Supposing that they do not continue to be unable what happens?&mdash;There is no provision to enable a child to get out.</P>

      <P>Since the last day the suggestions thrown out by you have been very carefully considered.  I am advised that the Bill as it stands carries out the purpose for which it is intended. I did not like to raise a point of order as against Senator Haughton's point, but Senator Bennett referred to the fact that Senator Haughton did not give any notice of his intention to move this amendment, much less table it. But I can assure Senator Haughton that the Act as it stands&mdash;and I think, with great respect, that this also applies to your difficulty, sir&mdash;gives the magistrate the fullest power to investigate the merits of each particular case, because if you look at Section 58, the section in which we are proceeding to make this small amendment, you will find that the magistrate has power to adjourn the case and satisfy himself, on inquiry, of all the facts regarding the particular application before him. I suggest&mdash;I do not know if I am saying more than I should say&mdash;that these words &ldquo;and likely to continue&rdquo; were inserted in the Bill at the suggestion of a very experienced magistrate.  I will say no more than that.  The Bill, as originally drafted, did not contain these words, but on his suggestion they were added.  I think it will be found in practice that a magistrate has vested in him the fullest powers of inquiry into each particular case, and that therefore it is absolutely impossible, assuming the exercise of judicial discretion, that the Bill would be abused. If, for instance, a case such as Senator Haughton indicated comes up before <Col N="680" /> him, and he finds that the parents are in a position to support the child.  I take it that be would refuse to send it to an industrial school.  If, on the other hand, that possibly the means were uncertain and precarious, that one day the parents might be in a position to support the child, and that another day they would not, he would have the fullest discretion, either to commit the child to an industrial school or not to do so.  As I said on the last day, the particular case which drew attention to the infirmity in this Act was before the chief magistrate in Dublin, Mr. Cussen, who actually refused, after the fullest hearing, to commit a child to an industrial school.  I hope the House will pass the Commit tee Stage now, as it is very desirable that this Bill would reach another place as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Might I ask Senator Brady what arrangement the Bill contains for the removal of a child from an industrial school when the parents have got work?  Not longer ago than a year a man came before a magistrate to ask that his two children be given to him, and he told the circumstances under which they had entered an industrial school.  He was in hospital, and there was poverty in his home.  The children were committed to the industrial school.  The man became cured, was able to take up his work and was at his work.  He applied to the industrial school for his two children, and they refused to give them.  He came before the magistrate.  Inquiries were made, and everything the man said was verified.  After an adjournment of a week or so the man got the two children.  I do not think that that practice is desirable.  I do think that when the Senator is making arrangements to put children in he ought to make arrangements to get them out in such cases as that.</P>

      <P>The question is the difficulty a magistrate would have in construing these words &ldquo;likely to continue.&rdquo;  How would any magistrate be able to prophesy whether the inability was likely to continue?  But if you do put these words in is there not great force in Senator Mrs. Wyse Power's suggestion that you should provide <Col N="681" /> some machinery for getting them out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanePower" hpid="Mrs. WYSE POWER Mrs. WYSE POWER">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. WYSE POWER</NameTxt>
      <P>Besides the parents having to go before a magistrate, I think that there ought to be some simple machinery, such as an investigation by the relieving officer of the conditions under which the child lives, so that the parent might get his child out without having to lose a day's work going before the magistrate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mrs. Wyse Power has raised a very important question.  She admits that there must be some investigation, and I think an investigation before a magistrate is much simpler than a consultation by the relieving officer with the Board of Health.  The Board of Health assembles only at rather long periods, and in practice I think an investigation by a magistrate would be better than what Senator Mrs. Wyse Power suggests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRADY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy with the point raised by Senator Mrs. Wyse-Power&mdash;namely, the desirability of the revision of an order of this kind. Perhaps the House will consent to allow the matter to remain over until Report, when we might meet the point.  I would again remind the House that this little Bill is not intended to alter the law generally regarding industrial schools.  Its purpose, as the title indicates, is to amend the law in one very small respect&mdash;namely, to alter the clause which obliged a child to beg before it is sent to an industrial school. That is the only object which this Bill seeks to attain, and however desirable an amendment of the whole law relating to industrial schools may be, in the meantime it is very urgent that this particular disability should be removed.</P>

      <P>I quite sympathise with you in all that, but do you not see that the difference in your Bill is this:&mdash;Under the old system the question whether a child should or should not be committed depended upon proof of a well-ascertained fact.  Now <Col N="682" /> it is proposed to be one in which there is to be great speculation, that is, the future ability of the parents to support the child.  There must be great speculation on that.  Therefore, I think it would be worth your while, between this and the Report Statge, to look into that.</P>

I have found definitely that it is 12/6&mdash; 7/6 from the State and 5/- from the local authority, so that the amount I meant the last day is supplemented by 5/- per head.</P>
