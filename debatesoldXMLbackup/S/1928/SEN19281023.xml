      <P>I do not object to this amendment, but I rise for the purpose of asking a question as to the manner in which this section will be worked by the inclusion of the amendment.  I admit that it is a logical extension of the other amendment that we have just passed, but I would like to know how the section is going to work.  At the beginning of the section it states that the Minister may make a prohibition order, except in the case of exempted trees, and this is one of the definitions of an exempted tree.  It does not seem to me to be clear as to who is to say whether the tree is exempted or not.  Is it the person who produces the felling notice, or is it the Government is to say whether a tree is exempted or not?  Say that I want to cut down a tree.  Do I specify in my felling notice that the trees that I propose to cut down are exempted trees within the meaning of this section? If so, does the Minister, through his officials, satisfy himself that these trees are exempted, or is it done the other way around.  Is it up to the Minister to discover, after I have produced my felling notice, whether the trees are exempted trees or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next question that I want to put to the Minister is in connection with paragraph (d) of sub-section (5), which deals with trees not necessary for the ornament or protection of the holding.  Who is to decide that question? Will it be the referees who are to be established under a later section of the Bill, or the person who wishes to <Col N="1247" /> cut the trees down?  The paragraph as it reads seems to me to open up a big vista of difficulties, because, after all, the owner of a holding may know what trees are necessary for the protection of his holding.  The owner of the holding, the Minister or the passing tourist, may entertain very different ideas on the question as to what trees are ornamental and what trees are not.  It seems to me to be a thing which nobody can definitely determine. I would like to know in what way the Minister contemplates that the question shall be determined.</P>
    <P>In the felling notice, a person proposing to cut down a tree may apparently claim exemption on the score that the tree is to be used as timber for the construction and repair of buildings, etc., or, among other things, for the making of farming implements. The tree may be intended for that purpose, but is there any guarantee that it will be used for that purpose?  It is not difficult, for instance, to conceive that a man wishing to put up a hay barn, and having some nice larch poles standing on his holding, may make application to cut them down for the purpose of building the hay barn.  But having got permission to cut them down, and having done so, he may find that these larch poles possess a certain value in the neighbourhood, and instead of using them for the purpose of building the hay barn, he may send them to the nearest saw-mill.  The man may go on intending to build his hay barn and continue to cut more trees on his holding, and, as in the first case, instead of using them for that purpose, he sends them to the nearest saw-mill.  That is perhaps an extreme case to give.</P>
    <P>The point that I want to bring out is this: is there any sort of a guarantee that the trees will be used for the specific purpose for which the exemption order was granted?  Under this paragraph of the sub-section, it is provided that trees may be exempted on a man's holding for, say, the putting up of hay barns on somebody's land which is &ldquo;in the immediate neighbourhood.&rdquo;  I submit that is a rather vague term to <Col N="1248" /> use.  The person in the immediate vicinity may be living a mile or two away. The wording of this paragraph seems to me to offer a tremendous vista of difficulties.  Reading this paragraph of the sub-section, it seems to me that a really ingenious person, wishing to cut down trees on his holding, could find a loop-hole almost for getting an exemption order in respect of any tree that he wanted to cut down.  As the clause stands, it does not seem to me to provide any sort of a real check on the cutting down of trees.  Perhaps the Minister may be able to give me some comfort on the points that I have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble about the Bill is that in one respect it is too lax and in another it is too strict.  With reference to the first point raised by Senator the Marquess of Lansdowne, a person applying for leave to cut down a tree would state in the notice for what purpose the tree was required.  Supposing he said he wanted to cut down a tree under section F. as being a dead, decayed or damaged tree, he states that in his notice.  He cuts the tree and sells it to a local saw-miller, and for doing so he can be prosecuted.  It may be possible to bring evidence before the court that in fact this tree which he said was an exempted tree because it was dead, decayed or damaged was sold for commercial purposes, and that the owner of the tree got the full value for it, and if that were proved then he would be convicted.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is the trouble.  Supposing he bona fide thought the tree was dead, but when he cut it down he found it was quite sound and sold it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty. There is really no answer to that.  If he proved that fact in court the judge would take it into account and would dismiss the case or impose only a nominal fine.  I do not see how you can provide against that.  Senator the Marquess of Lansdowne spoke of a case where a man deliberately cuts down a tree knowing that it is not an exempted tree and uses it for a commercial purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph D is the more difficult one, where it depends on the declaration of intention, which may be perfectly bona fide at the time, but he may honestly change his opinion after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot think of that occurring except in very rare cases. Where it does occur if the case is brought before the court and he proves he was absolutely bona fide the court would dismiss his case&mdash;that is, if the Department were foolish enough to bring it.  I do not see how you can meet that case by any possible amendment to the Bill.  It cannot be done. Life is too complex to cover every possible subtlety by a section in an Act of Parliament.  If he cuts a tree and finds he cannot use it as an exempted tree, for some other reason that has revealed itself after he cut the tree, that fact could be brought before the court and the court would deal with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty it appears to me is: Suppose the individual who cuts the tree has the intention, real or unreal, to cut it down for the repair of a building, but he does not do so, where is the provision for prosecuting him?  What offence has he committed? Such a case never comes up at all before a court as far as I can see.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  Take that case.  A man serves a notice to say that he wants to cut the tree and dispose of it for the purpose of using it for fencing his holding.  He cuts the tree, and then proceeds to sell it to the owner of a saw-mill.  It is not an exempted tree any longer.  All the circumstances must be taken into account.  The Forestry Branch prosecutes him and says: &ldquo;You have cut a tree without a licence.&rdquo;  He puts up the case that the tree is exempted.  How does he prove it is exempted?</P>

      <P>(1) Where a felling notice contains a statement that a tree is being cut down or uprooted for a specified purpose, it shall not be lawful for any person to use or deal with such tree or any substantial part thereof or cause or permit the same to be used or dealt with when cut down or uprooted in pursuance of such felling notice for any purpose other than the purpose so stated in such felling notice.</P>
      <P>(2) Every person who uses or deals with a tree or any part thereof or causes or permits the same to be used or dealt with in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds for every such tree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit any ingenious man could get through the Act five times out of ten, but if you administer this Act by employing inspectors who would have to visit every farm to see what was doing you would want four times more inspectors than there are in the Department, and a huge sum would have to be provided to do it.  It is not the way you can administer the Act. The only way you can administer the Act is by setting out offences specifically. People will get away with offences occasionally, but you can deter <Col N="1251" /> people by coming down on them when you get a good case.  We do not intend to administer the Act by inspectors but by getting good cases and by having offenders heavily fined, and consequently make other people less liable to commit offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I was not present at the Committee Stage <Col N="1252" /> on account of my health; but the Seanad kindly allowed some of these amendments to be carried on to this stage.  I put down an amendment to this sub-section which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 7, sub-section (5).  To delete all after the figures &ldquo;1928&rdquo; in line 5 down to the end of the sub-section, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;from the Land Commission and that the tree or trees had been allotted to the purchaser as part of the bargain for the purchase of the land.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put down the amendment because it did not seem to me that the statement in the Bill covered the matter completely of all the cases that might arise.  My view is&mdash;from what I know of what is happening in these cases and I am more or less connected with these matters&mdash;that the Land Commission sell a piece of land, pledging themselves to allow the owner to cut down the trees, that the trees belong to the purchaser. The purchaser may require to sell them in order to raise money for the purpose of stocking his land.  He has already made that sort of an agreement and made it before this Bill came on at all. Now the Bill comes in and he is prevented from doing what he had already agreed with the Land Commission to do and which the Land Commission had agreed that they would allow him to do.  The effect of the Bill would be that the Land Commission give with one hand and take away with the other. Perhaps the Minister would see some way out of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Colonel Moore's amendment is accepted it means that any tree growing on purchased land is an exempted tree.  That is the meaning of the amendment.  That is how it would work out in practice. The trees on the land are part of his security.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>An advance was made to the tenants by the Land Commission and the security for that advance is the land, the trees and everything on the land.  So that in fact this particular <Col N="1253" /> exemption would apply to every tree on every holding subject to a Land Commission annuity.  The effect of the amendment would be to give a free hand to every tenant to cut any tree he wishes, because it would work out as an exempted tree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only in cases where the Land Commission have already committed themselves to the fact that the trees belong to the purchasers. It would be only in such cases.  If the Land Commission said nothing and did not commit themselves by saying that the trees belong to the purchaser, then they come in, but where the Land Commission pledged themselves to one thing, then all that is reversed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission's advances are on the trees growing on the holdings, so that the Senator can take it that in the case of every purchased holding the land and the trees are the security for the advance. That is the position.  The Land Acts in all those cases provided that before any tree was cut the consent of the Land Commission was to be obtained. The only change I am making is this&mdash; that the consent of the Forestry Branch of the Department of Agriculture is to be obtained now instead of the consent of the Land Commission as formerly, so that it is as broad as it is long.  The owner must get the con of the Forestry Branch instead of the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the arguments we had here on the previous day in regard to the question of land mortgages, would the Minister say that the trees were a substantial portion of the securities for which the money was advanced?  In certain circumstances permission would be given so as to allow the trees to be cut and thus permit the bank to be recouped.  The position is that in the one case the State has advanced money through the Land Commission, and in the other case the money was lent by the bank.  The security for the advance is the land, the trees, and the buildings, and if the tenant finds himself in a difficulty and wants to meet his liabilities, <Col N="1254" /> why not allow him permission to fell his trees, so as to be in a position to pay his annuities?  He should be allowed do so in the one case as well as in the other.  I do not see any difference in the world, and whatever regulations would apply to one ought to apply to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of degree, but it is that degree that makes all the difference in the world.  Where the Land Commission makes an advance on the land you have a different position from where the advance is on the land and on the trees.  But, nevertheless, they do retain substantially as a portion of their security whatever trees are on the land.  That is how it works out in practice.  In an ordinary holding the land is the security.  At the same time, in order to see that their security is as full as possible they retain the right to dispose of the trees on that land.  I am assuming that the Senator is referring to the case put up by Senator Brown.  As I understand it, Senator Brown's case refers to a case where the main portion of the security is not the land, but the trees on the land.  It is only a difference of degree, but, from a business point of view, that makes all the difference in the world.</P>

      <P>I must be excused, being a city man, for interfering in this question.  I am still of the opinion that the same facilities should be offered to the tenant in this case.  If it is fair where the bank has advanced money that the trees can be cut down ad lib, it should be equally fair where the State has advanced money for the tenant to cut down the trees in order to meet any liability to the State.</P>

      <P>In the case mentioned by Senator Farren he wants to discharge the interest and in another case he wants to discharge the liability for part of the capital.

      <P>Section 5, sub-section (3).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;the total fine in any one case not to exceed one hundred pounds if the Justice is of opinion that the offence was not committed wilfully but as the result of a bona fide mistake.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the Bill as it stands is much too severe.  Its possibilities in matters of this kind are rather infinite.  For example, there might be a misunderstanding between the owner of the trees and the man appointed to cut them down; or there might easily be cut down some trees for which a licence had not been obtained.  Then, again, there could be a misunderstanding in regard to some trees other than the trees for which the licence had been got.  If the terms of the Bill as it stands were strictly carried out it might easily mean that a man, through some misunderstanding or other, would become liable to a fine of £500.  In the circumstances, I think that the amount mentioned in my amendment is reasonable.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 11:</P>
      <P>Section 7, sub-section (5).  To delete paragraph (h) (inserted in Committee) and to substitute the following paragraph therefor:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(h)  a tree in respect of which it is stated in the felling notice that the land on which such tree is standing is subject to a mortgage or charge subsisting at the passing of this Act and that such tree together with other trees (whether included or not included in such felling notice) standing on such land is a substantial portion of the security for the payment of the moneys secured by such mortgage or charge and that such tree is being cut down for sale with the intention of applying the proceeds of such sale in or towards payment of such moneys.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is in substitution for an amendment which I proposed.  The principle of that amendment was accepted by the Minister.  It was simply a question of proper drafting, and I am satisfied with the amendment as it now appears. I had an opportunity of considering it with the draftsman and he explained to me that the wording that now appears is there for the purpose of making it correspond with the other portions of the same section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I had better explain my attitude.  There was a <Col N="1257" /> clause inserted in this Bill in the Dáil and it was agreed to by me.  Various parties spoke to it.  It refers to trees which were sold before the passing of the Act.  That was a case of a bona fide contract being entered into.  The contract was legitimate within the existing law and it was feared that retrospective legislation would interfere with that contract.  That is wrong.  It seems to me if that principle is admitted that I have no logical grounds to accept the amendment.  In the amendment there is no question of principle involved; it is a question of expediency.  When I read it a case came to my mind where a bank lent money on the security of three hundred acres of land which, if cleared of timber, would not be worth more than £5 or £6 an acre.  The land itself is almost valueless.  It would not be worth more than £1,500, but with the timber it is worth £2,500.  If a mortgage was taken on the right to cut timber that seems to be a case where a conditional contract was entered into under which a third body had the right to cut the timber and had in fact paid for the timber.  If once you allow contracts for the sale of the timber made before the passing of the Act I cannot see any reason why it could be otherwise than free from interference by the Minister or the Forestry Branch. It is a totally different case from that put up by Senator Moore.  That case refers to a man in the country who has a line of beeches or a small copse growing by his mearing and he wants to cut down those trees.  Those trees would be a negligible part of the security and the land in that instance would be the main security.  There is no reason why in the case where trees form a large proportion of the security for the Land Commission, the tenant should be allowed to sell them freely. It might mean that instead of selling the timber the tenant might sell the land&mdash;sell out the whole place.  There will not be much agitation, because it is timbered land.  If the tenant were free to put up the timber for sale it would be a different case altogether.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to move amendment 12:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1258" /> New section.  Before Section 8 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>8.  Whenever a prohibition order has been made and served in relation to trees situate on land one-third of which is afforested, such land shall as and from the date of the order cease to be liable to rates and taxes, and if such land be subject to land annuities these annuities shall not be collectable while the order is in force.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment and another amendment lower down on the paper have the same object in view.  In my opinion this Bill consists entirely of pains and penalties.  The State is taking over and confiscating things that do not belong to it; they are things the State has no claim over.  The owner of land or his ancestors have planted trees and for a great number of years the rights of grazing or agriculture on that land are sacrificed.  The proposal, under the Bill, now is that the State shall come in and take hold of these trees.  The State shall become the partner, the very powerful partner in the ownership of this land.</P>
    <P>It has that power of direction, if it chooses to exercise it, to almost any extent.  Now, I am not against preserving the trees&mdash;I am very much in favour of it&mdash;and everything I say is for the purpose of doing so.  But I do not believe that the trees can be saved by putting penalties on people who have sacrificed a good deal already for them, who are fond of them and who have kept them there under great difficulties, perhaps for several generations. If the State wishes to come in in this matter, I think that it ought to take some share in the partnership expenses as well as anything else.  I do not see how it is reasonable for the State to come and say to a certain person: &ldquo;You have got that land under trees. You will not be allowed to use it for any other purpose.  You cannot cut down the trees and use it by planting potatoes in it, or in any other way. You must leave it as it is, because we wish it to be so.&rdquo;  You are doing nothing to encourage the planting of the trees, because there is not a single thing in this Bill which encourages the <Col N="1259" /> occupier to plant.  If you put people into that position they will take no trouble about preserving their forests; they will be only too glad to get out of that position as soon as they can.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has already said, it is very easy to get out.  I have something to do with a certain forest, one of the oldest forests in Ireland.  Supposing I were put in that position, and they said to me: &ldquo;You cannot cut the timber.  You cannot use the land for any other purpose, because there are trees on it and it is useless for any other purpose,&rdquo; what interest would I have any longer in that forest, which has been there from times primaeval, and which forms a part of the beauty of the country?  If I am put in that position, I say: &ldquo;Very well, the sooner it is cleared of trees the better.&rdquo;  I cannot do it, because I would be prosecuted, but anyone who likes to come and cut it can do so.  There are plenty of poor people around there who have sufficient turbary sometimes, but who, in a bad season, have no turbary to speak of, and if they come, I will shut my eyes to anything that is done, and nobody will know, because it is miles away from a police barracks.  It seems to me that there should be certain co-operation between the State and the owners once you begin to take rights away.  Up to now, the owner had a right to preserve his trees as well as he could, and he had certain reasons for doing so.  That will now cease, and unless you give him some sort of interest in the matter, help him to replant, or enable him to allow the trees to stand without expense, you will not get him to do it.  This Bill will do a great deal more harm than good, in my belief, and therefore, as I do not expect the State to do what it really ought properly to do&mdash;that is, buy the land&mdash;I am only taking a certain intermediate course, and am saying: &ldquo;Why charge for land, the owner of which cannot use it for any profitable purpose?&rdquo;  He cannot use it for grazing, because if he did, the trees would soon go.  Therefore, I suggest that some sort of an arrangement ought to be made by which the owner would <Col N="1260" /> benefit from the trees standing on his land.  I think that if it is really desirable, in the interests of the country, to have timber, the State ought to take some step to help by means of a partnership.</P>

      <P>The Senator wants powers to be given to the Minister for Finance to compensate in some way people who planted trees and cannot cut them.  That is really what it comes to.  There is power already in the Forestry Act, 1919, and in this Bill we repeal any limitation of that power. Section 3, sub-section (3), clause (d) of the Forestry Act of 1919, says: (d) &ldquo;Subject to any directions which may be given to the Treasury the Commissioners shall have power to make advances by way of grant or by way of loan or partly in one way and partly in the other and upon such terms and subject to such conditions as they think fit to persons (including local authorities) in respect of the afforestation (including the replanting) of land belonging to those persons.&rdquo;  That gives power to the Minister for Agriculture, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make a grant to anyone in connection with afforestation.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;By way of grant or by way of loan.&rdquo;  I assume that is the purpose that the Senator wants to effect.  I suggest that this is a much better way of doing it.  He suggests exemption from rates, taxes and Land Commission annuities.  Whatever view the Senator may hold, he will agree that there would be a number of implications in relieving lands of rates and taxes, and also of annuities.  As regards the rates, the county council has budgeted for a certain expenditure, and they cannot proceed if for this reason or for that reason certain lands shall be free of rates, because it would upset their whole budget.  The same applies to taxes.  The considerations applying to annuities are so big and so contentious that I do not want to go into them.  But you can do the same thing in a different way.  If the Minister wishes to do it, he has power to <Col N="1261" /> make a grant or loan, and that is what the Senator wants to effect.</P>

      <P>I would like to support this amendment, because otherwise this section will be an absolutely dead letter.  There is no use planting a tree unless it is a tree with proper roots to it.  If it is merely a case of a man cutting down a tree and bringing along the sergeant of the Civic Guard to show him a tree or trees planted somewhere on his holding, the section is not worth the paper it is written on.  If the trees are not fenced properly, the first time cattle come along they will destroy them.  Even if they were fenced, the Minister knows that after putting a tree in you have got to look after it and to relieve it for the first few years or it is purely money wasted.  You have also got to see that the trees are properly rooted.  I think something more is wanted, if this is not to be a dead letter, because the trees will inevitably die unless they are properly tended.</P>

      <P>I think that Senator Moore's amendment is a reasonable one if the Forestry Department is out for reafforestation.  We assume that they have big nurseries.  This amendment deals with a licence granted under a specific condition, the condition being <Col N="1263" /> replanting.  We all know that in afforestation the provision of trees is hardly a tithe of the cost.  It is draining, fencing and getting rid of vermin that cause most expense.  I think that the proposition should be accepted by the Government, and that the amendment is a very reasonable one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think also that this is a good amendment.  Anybody who is in the habit of planting trees will agree.  The question of getting small trees is a very important matter.  There are two aspects of the question to be considered.  In the first place, we have to consider what is a proper tree that will grow in a particular locality, and on that aspect one can obtain better advice from the Forestry Branch than from any other body.  In the second place, you want trees that are small and properly rooted, and I think that the Forestry Branch might look after that to a certain extent too. Then there is the question of the expense of replanting.  Everybody who has planted trees knows perfectly well that the cost of the trees compared to the cost of planting and care of the trees is practically infinitesimal.  At the same time, it would be an encouragement if, when a man wanted to plant trees or to replant a plantation, he would be certain that he would get the trees from the Forestry Branch.  That would help him to a very great extent in deciding to replant his plantations.  We know, of course, that the main expense in planting trees is caused by fencing and draining, but the question of getting trees properly rooted is a question of great importance, as is also the question of getting suitable trees for the locality.  I think that the Minister, having got on so well with the Bill, might at least give this help to people who want to replant by giving them trees.  The Department can make them a present of trees which they can obtain from the Forestry Branch.</P>

      <P>I would like to say something on the first of these amendments, because it affects the amendment standing in my name later.  This amendment as an administrative improvement of the Bill is, I think, very desirable.  I think that some machinery of the kind will be found to be necessary. I pointed out at the very beginning of the debate that the administration of this Act will set up very considerable difficulties, and I think something of this kind is needed, too, as a substitution for the machinery which proposes to be set up in the amendment standing in my name.  In that respect I do not welcome this new clause, because I do not think it is anything like an efficient protection against arbitrary and unreasonable action as the one which I had proposed, but I am quite prepared to vote for this &mdash; it will probably be carried in any event whether I do or not &mdash; provided that, ipso facto, my amendment falls to the ground.  I think the two are necessary, but the one does not really exclude the other.  The form of appeal which is suggested in No. 18 would be, say, a final appeal, and this other a preliminary one.  I do not want to take up the time of the House by arguing the point, unless the Minister intends to say when he comes to amendment 18 that it is obviously not necessary, because it has been agreed to.</P>

In considering this matter I have looked to the future as we ought to look in the case of permanent legislation.  In the immediate future, I do not anticipate that this Act will be applied in an unjust, arbitrary or tyrannical manner, but it might be.  I think the Minister's powers are too unlimited. He is improving the position, to a certain extent, by the insertion of the new sections, 16 and 17, which have just been passed, but they fall very far short of the purpose of the Act for a number of reasons.  In the first place <Col N="1268" /> referees will be appointed by the Executive Council.  The Minister himself will be a member of the Executive Council, and human nature being what it is and he, being in close contact with his colleagues, they would be exceedingly likely to take his advice and appoint his nominees.  In that way the referee would practically be appointed by the Minister, that is, by the very man whose decisions they would be called upon to investigate.  That, I think, is not by any means a perfect arrangement.  Then they will be paid such fees as the Minister may direct subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance.  They would be selected for each inquiry from a panel.  Their employment would be a profitable one. Their fees would be over and above their expenses.  Their position will not be permanent, and they will naturally be interested in being appointed. Therefore I claim those referees are not sufficiently independent.  They would in fact be very much in the Minister's pocket.  There is no need for any appeal at all, if the Minister is always going to act in a just and wise manner but it does not follow that in future Ministers will not act in a very different way.  That is why there should be some appeal from the Minister. It will be observed that a Minister is not bound by the amendments which have been passed to accept the advice of the referees at all.  The case is reviewed.  He has the ultimate say in the matter at the finish, and there need not be any redress at all.</P>
    <P>If there were an ultimate appeal to the Judicial Commissioner there would be a different state of affairs.  There you have an authority which has a permanent appointment.  He has not looked for the job; he is not dependent on the Minister for the warrant of his office, and he would have the power to reverse the Minister's decision. I do not think it would in the least be likely to lead to a great flood of appeals.  There would be expenses, and people would not be at all likely to avail themselves of the machinery unless they felt they were suffering under a great injustice.  I think the fact that such a method of appeal existed would be a great deterrent to <Col N="1269" /> unjust action on the part of the Minister, and for those reasons I propose my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>Having appointed a referee, I take it the intention of the Minister is to accept the report of the referee.  He takes power, apparently, to accept or refuse the report of the referee.  I think he should say that the referee's report should be accepted in the matter.  If that is so, I cannot see any objection to the method of the Act. A referee is to be appointed for five years and Senator Bagwell suggests that he would be more or less under the influence of the Minister.  Looking at it humanly, is it not the case that he will outlive the Minister as the Minister has to face his electors meanwhile? So the referee is a person likely to be independent of parliamentary influence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that the Minister has made an honest effort to give some sort of an appeal in this Bill. I agree with Senator Bagwell that the panel of experts does not really provide a satisfactory appeal.  I know there are great difficulties in an appeal to a legal tribunal in a case of this kind, but I do not think that this panel which the Minister proposes to set up is an entirely satisfactory appeal for the reasons given by Senators.  I wonder would the Minister accept Senator Bagwell's amendment if it were only to apply to what I might call big cases, that is cases under what was Section 9, I do not know what it is now, where a general licence was refused to deal in cut forestry.  I think those are the real cases where an appeal would be valuable and necessary, and perhaps if it were confined to those cases Senator Bagwell and the Minister would agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion made by Senator Brown I do not think that it would improve the position.  No matter who is Minister for Agriculture there will be very little interference by the referee.  In fact there will be no interference with those carrying out forestry operations on a big scale.  Neither a judicial commissioner nor a referee will in fact be wanted in such cases, and appeals will mostly be taken in respect of smaller <Col N="1270" /> estates.  I am against an appeal to a judicial commissioner.  It is unsound from the point of view of the judiciary and also from that of forestry.  I cannot understand Senator Bagwell's point of view, namely, that he is going to be absolutely safe with an independent judge and unsafe with a dependent Minister.  It is the independence of the judge which is the difficulty. He should, of course, be independent and there should be no influence to prevent him interpreting the law.  It seems extraordinary that apropos of forestry the whole point of view with regard to the judiciary should be changed.  You would be making a judge an administrative officer and saying that he shall have certain forestry qualifications and a certain policy.  I will no doubt be told: &ldquo;No, you are not doing that as the judge will examine questions of fact.&rdquo;  Everyone, however, knows that it will not work out that way in practice.  You will have a judge who has had nothing to do with forestry, but who has all sorts of theories about it.  You may have a judge who was never on any lands, who has no knowledge of forestry, and whose views are almost certain to be unsound on it.  He may think that under no circumstances should a man be allowed to cut a tree.  He may be the sort of man who likes the trees in Stephen's Green, probably the only trees he ever sees.  I think there is no denying that.  Nobody has any control over him.  It is not essential that he should have a knowledge of forestry. He has no experience of farming or agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet Senator Bagwell feels safe in his hands, but most unsafe in the hands of a man who has to get returned first by a constituency and then be nominated to the position of Minister for Agriculture in which capacity he has to defend every action of his in the Dáil.  I do not understand that point of view.  In seven or eight years time the Senator would, perhaps, find that he had made the mistake of his life, and that he was going from the frying pan very much into the fire by putting himself in the hands of an independent, uncontrolled, arbitrary, and, perhaps, ignorant referee. I suggest to the Senator that his amendment does not improve the <Col N="1271" /> Bill.  In the first instance the Minister must state his reasons openly, and, secondly, the applicant can appeal to the referee, but the Minister may, and, I think, rightly, be able to turn down the opinion of the referee.  What controls every action of the Minister is the fact that he can be challenged in the Dáil, and he is in a much weaker position if the people challenging his decision have the opinion of the referees behind them.  He is, so to speak, out in the open and cannot change his hand.  The referees must of necessity know something about their job, and it is not for the Minister or the Executive Council to repudiate them. As I say, if the Minister turned them down he could be challenged in the Dáil and would have to justify himself. Apart from all these considerations. I think it is a wrong step to give what are not judicial functions to a judge.  That is what it amounts to.  If it were carried you would have to allow the trees to be cut as applications were made, and it would make the administration of the Bill impossible for the Forestry Branch.  They could not do it.  I am against the principle entirely.</P>

I was considering all cases, large and small, in an impersonal way, and it was on their behalf that I endeavoured in some way to restrict the enforcement of the decision of the Minister.

      <P>May I say that Senator Bagwell surprises me, and I desire to assure him that I do not take any personal point of view in the matter. Various Senators have stated that things may be all right at present, but that you could never tell what may happen in five years.  I think that point of view is unsound.  I think that the checks on any one Minister will be the checks on the next.  If the Senator were in as close touch with the Department as I am he would know that it is the Head of the Forestry Branch who counts and not the Minister.  That will always be the way.  I am not arguing the matter on account of any personal feeling, but I think that it is wrong to give administrative functions to a judicial personage.</P>

      <P>This covers something a little bit different from Senator Colonel Moore's amendment.  In connection with this matter of scenic beauty a good deal has been said.  We can all see a case arising in which the owner of a wood wants to cut it down because he is hard up, or for other reasons, and perhaps he will re-plant. Great pressure may be put on the Minister to prevent him from doing so, because the wood is considered to be a national asset, and is a thing which a great number of people enjoy.  Great pressure might be put on the Minister in a case like that, and I think that there is a great deal to be said for his exercising his powers in such a case if the owner is compensated.  If the owner is not compensated, then I think it is absolutely robbery.  As it is a thing which is quite likely to arise, in view of the power given to the Minister I put this amendment down.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That this Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The finding of the Joint Committee on which this Bill <Col N="1274" /> has been based was one of the findings of that Committee on which there was perhaps the greatest degree of unanimity. As the Constitution stood originally, members of the Seanad were elected for twelve years and members of the Dáil for four years.  Subsequent amendments of the Constitution extended the life of the Dáil to five years, and when this Joint Committee met the initiative was taken by a representative of this House on the Committee with a view to reducing the period of office of members of the Seanad, because it was generally agreed that twelve years was too long a period while the Dáil was only elected for five years.  An amendment to have the period reduced to six years was opposed and negatived, only one member voting for it out of ten members of the Joint Committee who were present.  The position, therefore, is that when this Bill becomes an Act members of the Dáil will be elected for five years and members of the Seanad for nine years.  In other words, as compared with the Constitution as originally agreed upon, the lifetime of the Dáil has been extended by 25 per cent. and the period of office of Senators has been reduced by 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>Personally, I have no predilection in favour of nine years as against six, except to the extent that the more you assimilate conditions of election, etc., of the Dáil and Seanad the more you are likely, under the existing method of election, to make one a replica of the other.  Even as it is, I am afraid that in course of time the Seanad will become to a certain extent a replica of the other House; but unless there is some material difference in the period of office of each that condition of affairs will come about sooner and it will be more marked than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only with great reluctance that I feel compelled to refer to one or two wild and misleading statements made in connection with this House in another place.  I do so more in sorrow than in anger, because a greater medley of nonsense has rarely been uttered.  I should pass over those statements and treat them as the meanderings of a child were it not that to allow some of them to pass without comment might <Col N="1275" /> create genuine misunderstanding in the minds of honest but prejudiced people outside.  It has been said that with statistics you can prove anything &mdash; at least to your own satisfaction.  I never realised the significance of that assertion until I read the astounding conclusions of a speaker elsewhere, after he had waded laboriously through the public records of the Seanad.  A veritable wizard of frenzied finance he has proved himself to be.  Like Charles Lamb's Chinaman, who burned his house to cook his dinner, he misrepresented the whole Seanad for the purpose of dealing with some members of it who did not attend regularly.  Dealing with the bad attendance of these people he told his startled listeners that if every member of the Seanad attended every meeting Senators would be paid at the rate of £4 10s. per hour but as the average attendance is only two-thirds of the total, they were paid for their labours at the princely rate of £6 15s. per hour.  For downright whimsical nonsense and inaccuracy this statement must be almost without parallel. As one who has been a very regular attendant here for the past six years I only wish the speaker was dealing with negotiable currency and not in fairy gold.  Whatever his delusions, he must have known that, presumably on the principle adopted in the Biblical vineyard, the man who came in at the eleventh hour was paid at the same rate as the worker who toiled for the whole twelve.</P>
    <P>As a matter of curiosity, and in order to show how ridiculous was the basis of calculation adopted, I tried to apply the same unique method to the other House.  The result was startling.  I find that in the first year of the present Parliament the Dáil met on eighty-one occasions.  Taking the speaker's method of calculation, each sitting cost the taxpayers £982 for the salaries and travelling allowances alone of the members of the House, including Ministers, without making any allowance for the salaries of officials, reporters, attendants, and the cost of heating, lighting, printing, etc.</P>

      <P>It is frequently stated in the Press, and without contradiction, that you rarely find more than two dozen Deputies at the same time in the Dáil unless when they come in to vote in a division without having listened to the discussion.  That statement is not contradicted and, certainly, there have been numerous demands for counts to see whether there were twenty Deputies present.  According to this particular speaker's method of calculation a Deputy is only working when he is in the Chamber, so that taking that as a basis, each working Deputy costs the taxpayer £40 18s. 4d. per sitting of five and a half hours which works out at the rate of £7 8s. 8d. per hour.  And even on the basis of an occasional longer sitting of seven hours I find the payment is at the rate of £5 16s. 11d. per hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have merely applied this basis of calculation to show how humorously absurd are the deductions drawn by this speaker.  In fact he was as unfair to himself and his colleagues as to the members of this House.  Yet people who should know better profess to treat this remarkable statistical wizard seriously, and proceed to erect pyramids of words upon this crazy foundation. Personally I should be disposed to leave arguments of that kind to a certain section of the mosquito press which lives on that type of argument but a leading politician who wishes to be taken seriously should try and observe a better sense of proportion when dealing with the amendment of the Constitution.  It is time that some people finished sowing their wild oats. Statements have been made that would make the duties of a Senator commence when he enters the Chamber and end the moment he leaves it.  Nothing could be more absurd than this assertion. Many of us get much more correspondence, on public matters, and act for more people than the average Deputy, to say nothing of the work of the various committees of the House. We are approached by people from all parts of the country while a Deputy concerns himself only with his own constituency.  I have had times out of number to take up cases in which the applicants allege that they got no attention <Col N="1277" /> from their Dáil representative. A man who waits until he comes into the Chamber to consider what amendments he is going to move to Bills and what he is going to say in connection with them instead of being a public asset is a public nuisance.  It is perhaps this practice that accounts for the rather lengthy speeches heard elsewhere.  The less a speaker has to say the longer he takes to say it.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that the Senator has now disposed of the substance of the complaint he had to make, and that it is not quite in order to make this elaborate comparison between the methods by which members of the two Houses perform their duties.  I did not stop the Senator in view of the one point he wanted to clear up, but I suggest to him not to proceed any further because it is really not strictly in order.</P>

      <P>I do not want to set a bad example while criticizing disorderly conduct elsewhere.  But I want, at all events, to make clear, what I believe is the opinion of the majority of the people in this House, that we do not believe that Parliamentary efficiency depends upon the amount of oratorical output.  What the public thinks of these oratorical pyrotechnics has been very accurately described by an impressionist writer in one of the daily papers in the past few days.  He says: &ldquo;Progress was reported.  It was difficult to discover what progress had been made unless progress which takes us a day nearer to the grave. Coming out through the front gate into Kildare Street, said one visitor to another: &lsquo;All this talk would put years on you.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say in conclusion that, despite discussions of the kind to which I have referred and discussions of a similar kind which will undoubtedly occur in the future, I hope the Seanad will still be an unfavourable hunting ground for stage Irishmen and &ldquo;Eloquent Dempseys,&rdquo; but that it will address itself seriously and conscientiously to its work without being influenced in any way by cheap and irrelevant criticism elsewhere and that in any improvements which it may be <Col N="1278" /> able to effect in its procedure as a result of experience, it will care nothing whatever about the gallery and try and not forget the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to give legislative effect to previous Acts passed by the Oireachtas, and to make provision for the carrying out of future elections to this House.  The alterations necessary for taking away from the people the power they possessed, formerly, of electing members to this House, make it necessary that other arrangements should be made.  This Bill is purely in order to make the necessary arrangement consequent upon the changes that have been made. There are some clauses in the Bill that require careful consideration.  The manner in which it is proposed to hold the election appears to be anything but democratic.  It is proposed that in future elections for members of this House the voters shall vote by post. I object to that principle.  I think it is unfair and unjust.  Members of the Oireachtas when exercising the functions they are empowered to perform should be compelled to come here and perform that work in a proper way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason in the world why the ballot papers should be sent out <Col N="1279" /> by post to the members of the Oireachtas. I have read the arguments put forward in the other House by the Minister in charge of the Bill.  With all respect to him, I say they were not arguments but merely excuses.  I do not think that any argument could be put forward in favour of sending ballot papers by post to members of the Oireachtas.  Previously, when elections to this House took place under the ordinary system of election, we expected the farmer, the labourer, the shopkeeper and all classes of electors to leave their business and suffer the inconvenience of travelling to the polling place appointed to register their votes.  In some cases they had to travel many miles to do so, and the same regulations still obtain with regard to election to the Dáil and to local boards.  The people are expected to do that, and have done it.  They are abused when they do not go in large numbers to vote.  It is said that the people who have votes should exercise them, and that they do not display good citizenship if they remain away from voting. We are all anxious that the people of the country should take an interest in the carrying on of the business of the country, but here it is proposed that there should be postal voting for the elected representatives of the people themselves.  These elected representatives are not asked to make any sacrifice. If they have to leave their business, they are at no loss by doing so because they are recouped by the State. If they have to travel any distance, the State provides them with the cost of the conveyance they avail of.  I submit that it is very undemocratic to institute this system of postal voting.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why I oppose the proposed system, and it is this: If the electorate for this election do not take a sufficient interest in the matter to come to Leinster House, or whatever other venue is selected for the purpose of registering their votes, I think that they are not entitled to have their votes recorded.  If they do not think it worth their while to come and ask for a ballot paper, I do not think they are entitled to get it.  There is no justification, in my opinion, for <Col N="1280" /> sending out the ballot papers by post simply to convenience people so that they can mark them at home and send them back.  Personally, I think it would be a far greater inconvenience to have to go before a Peace Commissioner and make a long declaration that I was &ldquo;Thomas Farren&rdquo; than to come here, or to whatever place is appointed, and record my vote.  Since I became an elector I have always gone to the polling place appointed, demanded my ballot paper and marked it according to my choice.  It appears to me that this new arrangement is proposed simply to suit the convenience of a few people.  It is notorious that there are members of this House who never attend.  I want to be quite frank about this and to say that I think it is most unfair and unjust that this arrangement should be made to facilitate people in order that they may reelect themselves, people who have been members of this Assembly for a number of years and whose record of attendance has been disgraceful.  I think that is unfair and wrong and for that reason I oppose this proposal.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed my opposition to the principle underlying this Bill and to the manner of election.  We made our protest when the Bill was going through this House because we believed that it takes away from the people their right to elect members to this House.  But there is no use now in crying over spilt milk.  On account of the changes made in the earlier Bill, it was necessary of course that other alterations should be made.  In my opinion the greatest blemish in this Bill is this proposed system of voting by post.  I hope that on the Committee Stage members of the House will take the necessary steps to have alterations made in the Bill so that those qualified to vote at the election will be obliged to do what the humblest citizen of the State has to do in an election to the Parliament, and as was the case up to this as regards the election of members to this House, namely, to come along and ask for his ballot paper and get it at the venue appointed where he would then record his vote.  As far as I can see, the other matters dealt with in the Bill are matters of detail.  This <Col N="1281" /> question of postal voting is in my opinion the one blemish in the Bill, and on the Committee Stage I propose to take steps with a view to remedying that.</P>

      <P>I desire to support what has been said by Senator Farren, and I hope that the change that he has indicated will receive support when the Bill is in Committee. The practice of postal voting has not been justified, and no very serious attempt has been made to justify it. The first Seanad, or that portion of it that was elected by the Dáil, was elected by direct vote.  The Deputies had to be in their places to vote.  It was much more dangerous and inconvenient in those days, in December, 1922, to come to Leinster House and vote than it is to-day, or will be, I hope, in the future.  The panel for the 1925 Seanad election was formed by the direct vote of members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and not by postal voting.  That was an important vote because a candidate could not go forward for election unless he was placed on the panel, so that, in effect, you had a preliminary election of a rather wide kind on that occasion. Still, that was not done by postal voting.  The voting for the formation of the panel for future elections under this Bill has to be by direct vote also. Members of either House cannot vote by post.  They will have to come here and vote in order to put a candidate on the panel for election.  It is quite possible that that vote for the panel may be the final and decisive vote. What is there to prevent each interest represented putting on the panel only just so many candidates as it feels it will be able to elect when it comes to the final election?  On this occasion, instead of having 38 candidates nominated, you might have only 19.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister on whom does the responsibility lie to see that two candidates are nominated for each vacancy?  I can quite conceive a position in which the Seanad would put on the panel only 7 or 8 candidates, and the Dáil might only put on 11 or 12.  You might find that when the panel was formed there were only 19 candidates for 19 places.  I <Col N="1282" /> would like to know as a matter of law and procedure who, in the opinion of the Minister, is responsible for filling the panel in the event of such a position arising which is not very probable, but at all events is possible.  The point that I am putting shows that the election for the panel is just as important as the final election and might, in effect, almost prove to be the final election. Yet, it is to be done by direct vote, whilst the final election is to go through the formula of postal voting. That may mean sending ballot papers to all parts of the world, wherever the roaming birds of either House may find themselves when the election comes along.  The election is to be by members of the Oireachtas, and the voting should take place in the Oireachtas. Fancy when it comes to electing a president of the Executive Council sending out ballot papers by post to Deputies, and not asking them to turn up to vote.  The election of a President and the election of an Executive Council are surely important matters, and yet if Deputies are absent through illness, accident or public business, or through any other cause, no account is taken of that, because then they are voting as trustees for their constituents and they have to come and exercise their votes in person.  I cannot imagine, for instance, this House taking a decision, when we proceed to elect officers of the House, that we would have voting by ballot.  It would be absurd.</P>
    <P>This election is different to an ordinary election where each man acts for himself, for on this particular occasion he is acting as a trustee for the people who placed him in the position to vote. As such, he should be here to vote and not vote by ballot.  Some arguments were advanced to the effect that it might mean unnecessary expenditure to bring Deputies and Senators to Leinster House, that the time may arrive when there would be no autumn sessions, and that it would be incurring unnecessary expense to bring people here to Dublin. As matters stand, they have to come in any case for the formation of the panel. If voting is direct they could place the members on the panel, and the next day they would have the final election without going home.</P>
    <P>If the State has to pay their expenses <Col N="1283" /> it is saving considerably by the new method of election.  The last Seanad election cost £44,000, and, according to the President, the cost of preparing the register was £4,000 or £5,000 additional, so that this method of election saves nearly £50,000.  Now, we have the economy ramp when it comes to a question of saving a few hundred pounds. The Seanad election should be important enough in view of the powers possessed by the Seanad to bring people here to vote even though it should cost a couple of hundred pounds.  I cannot hold with this mania of trying to avoid inconveniencing members of the Oireachtas. Surely they realised that a certain amount of inconvenience was involved in becoming members of the Oireachtas?  If they come once in three years to Dublin, when otherwise they might not come, I do not think they have any real cause of complaint. Senator Farren has referred to the question of the chronic absentee, and that is certainly a very burning aspect of this question.  I agree it might not be a very keen one in the future, and that the new Seanad may comprise none but good attendants, but it is possible we may have in the future people elected for nine years or less who would feel they could take things easy, or circumstances may turn up to prevent them from attending. It is setting a bad example to find that a person who comes here only once in the year, or less, can exercise such vital influence in electing his own successor, or re-electing himself, or otherwise reconstituting the House.</P>
    <P>This applies to the other place as well as to the Seanad.  Speakers elsewhere seemed to think that the only danger lay in connection with this House.  We had the case of a Deputy some time ago &mdash; he is not now in the Dáil &mdash; who for a whole year did not attend the Dáil.  His case was called attention to on a good many occasions. Such a Deputy on this occasion would have the same voice in electing members to the Seanad without turning up. The argument will be used that the absentees would be present when it comes to an election, but we would like to put them to the trouble of attending at any rate.  We would like to see some <Col N="1284" /> of them here.  They come so seldom that they would brighten the monotony of the place.  If they come no more than once in three years we will be glad to meet them.  I am opposed to the postal section of the Bill, and I will try to bring about a more democratic method.  There is plenty of time for inserting amendments if the postal voting is done away with.  If not, we are rushed for time.  If the postal voting is insisted on there need be no such long interval as a fortnight from the time the ballot papers are sent out until they are returned.  I hope the House will remember that when discussing the merits and demerits of postal voting on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Farrell objected to certain nonsense talked in the other House.  On the other hand, Senator Farren takes a lot of it to his bosom, and he asks us to discuss this matter on the plea that this particular form of election is to facilitate a Senator in Monte Carlo who is anxious to return once in three years and perpetuate himself in the Seanad.  I suggest you ought to get rid of ideas such as that and discuss the proposals in the Bill upon the issue of whether they are the best kind of proposals to enable members of both Houses to do their business in the most satisfactory way, whether from their own point of view or from the point of view of people who pay most attention to their work here.  It is said that Deputies and Senators are paid for attending to their business and, therefore, they ought to be prepared for all the inconveniences likely to arise.  I think we ought to realise the very great amount of labour Senators and Deputies take on themselves in attending to discharge their duties, and we ought to convenience them and make matters as easy for them in the discharge of their duties as we possibly can.  It is also suggested that Senators have to come here in any case in order to form a panel shall be formed in whatever way the Dáil and Seanad by regulation say, so that ought not to influence us.  I submit that we ought to accept the postal <Col N="1285" /> voting on the grounds that it is the most convenient method.  As I said, the question of democracy does not enter into it.  I would feel as democratic in the case of a general election if I got my voting paper by post, marked it at home, and sent it back again.</P>

      <P>Because of the difficulties in dealing with the bigger electorate it is not feasible and practicable. The more practicable way is to have the individual voters go to the poll.  It is not correct to say that voters have to go a long distance to the polls. During the last four years everything possible has been done to reduce the size of the voting areas.  I doubt if it would be possible to point out any place where a voter has to go more than three or four miles to vote.  If it would be possible to bring the voting paper into his home I would not see anything undemocratic in it.  It is right to say that the Oireachtas may not meet in the autumn, and it is undesirable that Deputies or Senators would be brought from different parts of the country to do work as electors which they could do as effectively and as conveniently at home.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>By arrangement of the Cathaoirleach a Committee of the Seanad met to consider the matter during the Recess, and I think the Committee in their report recommended that persons who were sick or who, for other solid reasons, were not able to assist at the voting here might be allowed to vote by post.  I suggest that the considerations that made the Seanad Committee make that recommendation in their report are considerations that should make postal voting be adopted as a way for voting. I do not see in what way you can make special arrangements for people who <Col N="1286" /> are sick or people who had really important reasons for their inability to be present to vote by post if you do not extend postal voting generally.  When the Seanad comes to the Committee Stage the matter can be discussed generally. I want to say that there is no necessity for coming together to form a panel if the Oireachtas is not meeting in the autumn.  The two Houses can form their own panels and make their own arrangements.  But the panel can be formed by post.  It will mean that you will have to set up two ballot papers, but there is no great difficulty about that compared with the difficulty of coming to Dublin and attending here twice.  I do not think it is feasible to come to Dublin one day to vote for your panel on that day, and then to vote for your candidate on the following day. That is a matter that I would like to look into seriously from the point of view of the officers who are dealing with the elections.</P>
    <P>I think that the convenience of the Senators, as well as keeping down expenses, are matters that ought very seriously be taken into consideration, and we ought not leave out of consideration in this matter the question of costs.  The people we wish most convenienced in this are the Senators who are giving the best attention here to the business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, a very important factor about this Bill is the question of time.  I heard Senator O'Farrell's remarks about postal voting, and the Minister's reasons for adopting it.  As regards this method of <Col N="1287" /> election in electing the Seanad, I am afraid we are making just the sort of blunder we made originally when the method of election to the Seanad was put on the whole country.  That was first mooted when a few of us met over in London and adopted it and put it into the Constitution.  I doubt if the various objections to it, the pros and cons, were sufficiently debated.  If they were it probably never would have been adopted.  In saying this, I am accusing myself, because I was one of those who thought a reasonable argument might be put up for it.  I admit now, on my own part, that that was a blunder.</P>
      <P>Here now in this Bill we are up against the question of very short time. I agree with a great deal that Senators Farren and O'Farrell stated as regards postal voting and the advantages of the Senators being here present, except perhaps for some reason, sickness or otherwise, when a Senator could not be present, he should be allowed to vote by post.  I say that because I do not think any Senator should be deprived of his vote for these reasons.  I think that in regard to a small House like this, where we are trying to elect new members, and where the electors do not know the men to be elected very well, that we ought to attend here and take care that our power in the election is not weakened in any way.  I am aware that there may be cases where a man or woman may not be able to attend, but though not attending he or she may know a great deal about what is going on.  I do not think it is wise for this House to take any steps that would deprive any Senator of his or her right to vote.  So that, to a certain extent, I do agree with postal voting.  There are a great many reasons against it.  Ordinarily the members of the House should be able to attend.  Therefore, I agree with the two Senators who have spoken.  The difficulty I see in this matter is this&mdash;it is a difficulty to which the Minister has not referred&mdash;suppose we pass an amendment doing away with postal voting and that the Dáil stands to its guns, then a deadlock arises, and what are we going to do?</P>

      <P>I can answer that.  I have looked into the question, and if the contingency that the Senator refers to arises there is not time, but that is not the fault of the Seanad. I should mention here that before the adjournment of the Oireachtas to the 10th October, I caused my opinion to be conveyed to the Government that a meeting on the 10th October would not give this House reasonable and proper time to consider these Bills.  However, the Government thought differently. We are now in the position that if an amendment is inserted in this Bill at the Committee Stage, an amendment that would form the subject matter of disagreement on the part of the Dáil, then this particular Bill would not be got through in time to enable the election to be carried out in the manner and on the date which the Bill is providing for.  That is really a matter for consideration when the House comes to the Committee Stage of the debate. Nobody has challenged the principle of the Bill.  It is on the Committee Stage that this matter can arise.  Then these details can be discussed more properly in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of some importance to us in the preparation of amendments.  I do not know if there are many Senators here who would at this stage raise a question which would upset the Bill, but apart from that, it is more or less a waste of time to take the trouble of introducing amendments knowing that if we get the Seanad to agree with us in these amendments we are creating a situation which we do not want to create.  It is quite reasonable to raise the question and emphasise <Col N="1289" /> the fact on the Second Reading that we must more or less swallow this Bill as it is here, for this time.  But I do think that this Second Reading debate is of use in letting it be seen that this Bill establishing a method of election, seems to be much the same as the provision that was put into the Constitution. It is tentative, and it is an experiment, and I think the Seanad would be wise in adopting this attitude. We have no line in any other country to guide us.  But I believe this Bill is quite tentative and, with that in our minds, I do not think it would be wise for the Seanad to push forward amendments to stop the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason I am making these remarks because, although I feel strongly in favour of the points raised by Senators Farren and O'Farrell, I doubt if it is wise to force them to their logical conclusion.  I think we should get a clear expression of opinion from the House as to whether or not they are in favour of the postal arrangements for the convenience of members of the two Houses, which is the solitary reason that so far I have heard.  There are a great many reasons which could be brought forward showing why the meeting of the members of both Houses for consultative purposes, so as to select right men for Senatorship, is very advisable.  Anybody can see how desirable it is to have a meeting of Senators and Deputies to discuss matters and compare notes as to what men are best qualified.  The presence of as many Deputies and Senators as possible for the purposes of the election is of the vastest importance and it would be far and away more convenient than the system of staying at home and filling up election forms.  These are the things that have not been given sufficient weight to in the preparation of the Bill. I do not think we have time to give consideration to all those matters at the present time.  I believe we ought to let the Bill go through, perhaps with some technical alteration.  I am afraid we shall have to adopt this postal arrangement and swallow it whether we like it or not.  To a good many of us, at any rate, it is most distasteful and we do not think it is the right thing to do.</P>

      <P>I agree entirely with Senator Jameson in his remarks against postal voting.  I do not go so far as he does in feeling that we could not at any hazard take the risk of holding up the Bill.  Why should we not hold it up?  After all, there is a very easy method suggested in this Bill of taking a plebiscite of the electorate, the electorate being the Seanad and the other House.  If this House with its sixty members says that this method of voting is not the method which ought to be adopted, and if a large section of the other House agrees, then it is obvious that the electorate is against the system of postal voting and that ought to be a direction for the Government that postal voting is not, in the opinion of the electorate, the system which ought to be adopted.  It would then be up to the Government to take the opinion of the electorate and rearrange the Bill accordingly.</P>

      <P>I feel that a very large number of people are making up their minds on the question of postal voting based on the case of the Senator who lives in Monte Carlo; I am quite convinced of that.  Do not also let a decision be taken on this matter on the ground that the Minister or the Government is to blame for the fact that there has been delay and that you are to a certain extent caught up in the matter of time here.  As far as I and the Government are concerned in this question of the Seanad election and things arising out of it, we have gone as far as we possibly could to meet the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be remembered that when Senator O'Farrell introduced a motion asking that a Committee of the two Houses be set up to consider the changes in the Seanad, I urged on the Seanad the inadvisability of setting up that Committee.  I said that I was prepared to introduce legislation which could be thoroughly reviewed in plenty of time and I suggested that it was a reasonable way to approach the question. The Seanad did not agree with that, and then I supported the setting up of a Joint Committee.  The question arose in the Seanad on the 18th February and the Joint Committee was <Col N="1291" /> set up on the 1st March, but it did not report until the 15th May.  The Government had the necessary legislation actually introduced into the Dáil on the 7th June.  Senators will realise that with the strain the members of the Executive Council worked under they needed a Recess.</P>
    <P>We met earlier this year than in any other year; we re-assembled on the 10th October.  We re-assembled at the earliest possible date that some of us could manage and in sufficient time to meet the various matters that have been met in connection with the Seanad election.  Senators want to give a certain amount of consideration to this matter, quite naturally.  Amendments to this Bill are ready and there ought to be very little difficulty in discussing them to-morrow, so that very little time will be lost in that particular way.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad requests the Government to approach the Great Southern Railways Company with a view to the discontinuance of the singling of various portions of the Company's line pending the consideration of the matter by the Railway Tribunal before which it is to be brought.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the action of the Great Southern Railways directors has made it incumbent on me to raise this matter here.  I would very much prefer to say what I have to say before the Railway Tribunal.  I have the greatest sympathy with the directors of the Great Southern Railways Company, and I do not want to cast any reflection on the work which they propose to do.  I believe if they handled the motor services <Col N="1292" /> and the bus traffic with more foresight and better judgment two or three years ago they would not be in the position in which they find themselves to-day.  My sole and only reason for taking up this matter of the singling of the railway lines is the effect that it will have on the live-stock trade of the country.  I feel that I can speak with some experience upon that question.  I have attended the loading of live stock at stations where there were single and double tracks, and I have travelled on cattle trains on single and double tracks.  I say that the singling of the line from Galway to near Dublin, and also the singling of the Waterford line, is a most retrograde step which the directors will regret if it is put into operation.</P>
    <P>One way traffic is the whole trend of modern regulations by traffic authorities to-day.  Walk up O'Connell Street and you will find a white line dividing the footpath and an arrow pointing the way to pedestrians and instructing them as to the side to keep.  The railway companies are doing the reverse of that.  Directors of the railways will say, and have said, that if they are to give cheaper freights for the carriage of merchandise and live stock they must economise by singling the lines.</P>
    <P>My reply to that is that I have considered the question, and I say with all the force at my command that cheaper freights will not compensate the live-stock trade for a bad and inefficient line.  We certainly want cheaper freights, but, above all, we want quick and efficient transport.  Senator Sir Walter Nugent stated in his communication, on the singling of this line, to the Mullingar Town Commissioners, that with the new system of loops and signalling the railways would give a better service even with an increase of fifty per cent. in the traffic.  I cannot see how that can be done, and I think it is not possible to do it.  This system of looping will entail a lot of delay.  It will make it necessary for cattle trains to be shunted and to lie up at sidings, and I am afraid this looping of the loop will be an expensive pastime for the livestock trade of the country.  I am firmly convinced that the trick-of-the-loop will not succeed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> In my experience, most of the damage which occurs in the transit of livestock is caused by lying up at sidings.  The cattle then become restless, lie down, and are trampled upon.  It will be impossible to avoid that, in putting trains in on the sidings to lie up when it will be necessary for some other trains to pass.</P>
    <P>The Great Southern Railways are certainly financially in a bad position, if all that we hear is true, but this economy which they propose to carry out, I am afraid, will not relieve the situation.  To my mind, it is like a drowning man grasping at a straw, and the new stunt of singling the line and of loops will just about have the same effect as the straw would have in the case of the drowning man.  I put a certain proposition to the Chairman of the Great Southern Railways on behalf of the cattle trade last April.  At that time I proposed that he should lease, hire or buy boats from the London, Midland and Scottish Railway &mdash; they have a number of them lying idle &mdash; and that he should run a service from Dublin to Birkenhead, and from Dublin to Glasgow, to start with.  I pointed out to him that, in my opinion, all the live-stock and merchandise would be booked through to the other side by these boats, and I guaranteed on behalf of the cattle trade that we would canvass the traders of every town and village in Ireland &mdash; I said that we had members in all these places&mdash;to instruct the merchants and manufacturers on the other side to send their goods by the Great Southern boats.  This would ensure return cargoes.  But the Great Southern Railways are, I am afraid, like the rest of the transport companies with which they are mixed up.  They are possibly the weakest member of the Transport Conference.  They are held in the grip of the Transport Conference, and they cannot move without the consent and the acquiescence of the majority of that Conference, which is controlled by the steamship companies &mdash;by the combine, in every way.  For that reason my proposal was turned down.  If that proposal were adopted it would go a very much longer way to put the Railways Company in a sound financial position than the proposal to single the lines.  The motion states that <Col N="1294" /> we want an opportunity to lay the case before the Railway Tribunal, and I ask the House to agree to it.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the motion.  I am not conversant with the West, but when this proposal, which seemed to me a sweeping and rather important one, was mooted I consulted some of the largest traders in the West, and unanimously they held the view that has been expressed by Senator Counihan, that cattle and sheep bought at the fairs would be delayed in transit if there were a single line, notwithstanding what system might be instituted. Having regard to the opinion of these men, who are really big practical traders, and who know the losses and injuries inflicted on them by delay, I was impressed by what they said to me. Further, if there was any development of trade in a commodity so perishable, let us say, as fish, any delay in transit of such a commodity on its way to the market would be very vital.  In those circumstances I think the motion which Senator Counihan has introduced is deserving of support, and I beg to second it.</P>

      <P>I am rather glad that Senator Counihan has raised this question.  I can assure him that the attitude of the Railways Company is to try to make the position perfectly clear and plain to everyone.  I am very glad to have this opportunity of explaining our position to members of the Seanad.  The Senator referred principally to the cattle trade, but, of course, what governs one trade governs them all.  He argued that we were singling the line on grounds of economy, quite regardless as to whether we gave good service or not.  That would be an imbecile policy.  What we are trying to do is to take advantage of modern improvements and appliances, to see what is being done in other countries, and to try to do the same, if not better, in Ireland. In Scotland the whole country is run by single lines, and they have not adopted even these modern improvements we propose to adopt.  In America, as anyone knows who has been out there, the whole prairie country is covered by single lines, and thousands of cattle &mdash; compared with which our wretched contributions are a <Col N="1295" /> mere bagatelle &mdash; are handled on the single lines, even under the old conditions. What are we doing?  We are simply making use of modern inventions. We propose to furnish our lines with loops, which have been so much laughed at because they are not understood.</P>
      <P>At present Senator Counihan complains of shunting.  He told me privately that the main difficulty that the shippers had to contend with in moving their live stock was the shunting difficulty. Of course, Ballinasloe is not well done, because we have not got any loops yet.  We have nothing except two lines, and when we relieve one we block the other.  In view of the opinion of our experts, of the English companies, and of the best traffic experts we could get on the other side of the Channel, we are perfectly satisfied that we will give a service not only as good as but better than that we are giving at present.  Then it was put to me not so much by the Senator as by others, that we would interfere with the development of the country.  The other day we discussed Galway as a port of call. No one is more anxious to see it as a port of call, or a terminal port, than I am.  We have set up a committee to try to see how we can increase the export of produce from Ireland, in conjunction with the English systems which are co-operating with us.  If, at the same time, we are singling the line in such a way as to obstruct the traffic on this side so as to make the increased carriage of stock impossible, we would be lunatics.  Do you suppose that the London, Midland and Scottish and the Great Western would cooperate with us if they thought we were doing that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We realise and we are satisfied that the portions of the line we are singling will be able to carry any conceivable increase in traffic better than we are able to deal with it at present, that if we get 50 per cent. of an increase we can handle it just as well.  What is the position?  It is simply this, that we are not running the line economically at present.  We have two lines, of which one is absolutely non-productive.  All the work we are doing on this particular <Col N="1296" /> section under discussion we can do as well or better under the other system.  The greater part of our expenses arise from the purchase of rails, for which thousands and thousands go out of the country every year, and if we are using rails for non-useful purposes is it good commonsense?  On the one side we are pressed for fair wages and we want to pay them.  On the other side we are pressed to lower rates, and we want to do so.  Can we do that if we take advantage of no modern inventions and go on as we always have gone on?  People will say: &ldquo;That is Scotland and this is Ireland. Nothing succeeds in Ireland.&rdquo;  We are not so simple.  We think we are as capable of doing work properly in Ireland as people are in any other part of the world.</P>
    <P>I want to try to meet all the points. When we meet all the arguments that are put up to us we are suddenly met with this attitude: &ldquo;Oh, yes, that is quite all right.  You have answered everything we have put up to you, but nevertheless this is a retrograde step.&rdquo;&mdash;like &ldquo;The Snark&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I have said it, therefore it is so,&rdquo; and no arguments to support it.  We say that it is a progressive step, and we say that if we do not take it we are not doing our duty.  If you take the other point of view and say that the railway company should not be run as a business concern that it should be run simply to give employment, regardless of whether it pays or not, the alternative would be the State control of the railways and to have the taxpayer pay for the luxury. But as long as the company is going to be run as a limited company, having due regard to the interests of the shareholders, the general public and the country at large, you must allow us to use our discretion as best we can.</P>
    <P>I notice that this motion is a very mild one.  It only asks the Seanad to request the Government to approach the Great Southern Railways Company with a view to the discontinuance of the singling of various portions of the country's line.  All I want to say is that we are dealing with large sums of money.  We have to spend a large amount of money for rail and sleepers every year.  We have to make our arrangements.  The new singling will <Col N="1297" /> cost a good deal, and the looping will cost a good deal, and if you hold up a big scheme like that indefinitely you hold up an enormous amount of money. We cannot buy these things in a minute.  We have to make our arrangements a long time ahead, and if we have to wait for an indefinite period it will be a very great loss, not only to the shareholders but to the country at large.  That is the reason why we hope that the Minister will not agree to allow the postponement of this question.  We have made our arrangements.  To give you an idea of the magnitude of these matters, I may tell you that one penny in the ton in the price of coal means £1,000 a year to the Great Southern Railways Company.  I hope I have met the various points that have been raised.  I will not detain the House further.</P>

      <P>From the point of view of the Government I have only to say this, that so far, in all the agitation that there has been about the proposed singling of the line on certain sections, we have always been treating the situation just as to-day, when Senator Counihan speaks of delay. The root of the matter is in the promise of the Chairman of the Company that there will be no delay owing to the singling of the line.  Any argument that rests on delay is absurd. On the other hand, Senator Dowdall stated that well-informed traders said something to him.  I do not care what they say.  The only people with a precise knowledge of what is going to happen are the railway directors, who can be brought to book before the Railway Tribunal.</P>

      <P>He probably had better sense than the Senator in leaving it as it was.  This is the very question about which, if there was no Railway Tribunal, there would be a motion requesting the Government to set up a committee to examine the proposal. There is a committee &mdash; the Railway Tribunal <Col N="1298" />&mdash; and I am asked now to put a demand before the Railway Tribunal that they should discontinue the singling of various portions of the Company's line pending the consideration of the matter by the Railway Tribunal, before which it is to be brought.  This is the first time I have heard that it is to be brought before the Railway Tribunal. I had a very important deputation visiting me from the West more than a month ago.  I then suggested that the Railway Tribunal was the better place to have this thrashed out, that it was only there that precise information could be got and examined. Some people said that economies could be achieved by this, and others said that economies would not result.  There has been no attempt yet to bring it before the Railway Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking back at my past course of conduct towards the railways company I hesitate to accept this motion.  I have been persecuting the railways company for two years past to effect economies in their system.  I have been telling them that so far their whole equipment and their whole facilities had been on the scale that was in existence when the railways were under the control of the British Government, that they are more than what this country can afford, and I have been asking them to bring their equipment in rails, rolling stock and facilities down to what the country can pay for.  They are proceeding to do what I think is the first courageous piece of thinking, the first big advance towards economy, and there is an outcry against it.  I say here publicly that they are really deserving of nothing but the greatest commendation for this attempt to single the line.  It is quite clearly a matter within the powers of the company under the Act of 1924, which gave them power to group lines with a view to better organisation and with a view to more economic working. On the face of it there is nothing unreasonable, as far as I can see, to the public and nothing imprudent from the point of view of the company's revenues in this proposal.  Further than that, if this proposal does involve any prejudice to anybody who has a right to be protected the Railway Tribunal is there to give that protection.  The people <Col N="1299" /> who feel that they are being prejudiced have so far slept on their rights.  They have not gone before the Railway Tribunal, they have not even, as far as I am aware, taken the preliminary steps towards going before the Railway Tribunal.  The apprehensions that are expressed by the public are, to my mind, based on no precise data.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. COUNIHAN Mr. COUNIHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COUNIHAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a moment.  There is the further point that inasmuch as the company is barely able to make ends meet one must come to the conclusion that they are giving services that the public are not able to pay for, both with regard to the transport of human beings and of cattle.  They must therefore reduce services or else increase freights.  But the whole of the company's proposals taking everything into consideration, seem to be reasonable and if people thought they were not they should already have gone before the Railway Tribunal.  On the question of the experience of the working of the singled lines, not so very long ago there was a proposal made by the company to single a stretch of twenty miles between Attymon and Galway, and there were very much the same fears and apprehensions expressed about that section as about this other section, but I have not yet heard any complaint made as to the working of that portion of the line which has been singled, or of any other portion singled, even before the amalgamated company came into existence, although the portions singled before amalgamation were singled without any advertence to improved methods of singling and working. There has been no complaint about undue delay.  A question was raised here about the cattle and their general ill-health.  That was the most humane statement I ever heard from Senator Counihan.  If their condition deteriorates obviously there is going to be loss, but where on the face of it is deterioration going to arise in the handling of cattle by reason of the line being singled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> There is the other point about insurance. It has been said here that it is better to keep a double line the whole way along the system as an insurance. It prevents the block that may occur if there is an accident.  Then the question of business comes in.  Is it worth while paying a huge insurance to guard against the time an accident may occur? When the question of delay is mentioned, bear in mind the terms of the Company's letter to the people of Mullingar that with the improvements, singling, and better working methods the same amount of traffic and 50 per cent. increase can be handled as quickly.  That is a deliberate statement by the chairman of the Railway Company that can be tested in open court.  Ballinasloe has been mentioned. I would never ask anybody to run a business on the lines by which the Railway Company have been asked in this country to keep their stock, equipment, and railway facilities to meet peak loads.  Ballinasloe represents the peak load as far as cattle coming from the West are concerned.  No one would keep a system to meet the single occasion on which Ballinasloe presents the problem, and it is quite unreasonable to ask the Railway Company to keep their lines all through the system ready to meet that emergency.  I do not know if there is any necessity to pass this resolution.  The matter has been ventilated and various points of view expressed.  I do not think the Railway Company will proceed immediately to the singling of the lines as long as there is any evidence given to them that this question will be raised before the Tribunal.  I think the Railway Company can be relied on as reasonable people if there is any definite step taken to show that the matter is going to be raised.  I would not reverse my policy towards the Railway Company and ask them to hold this matter up unless there was definite evidence to show that the thing was to be raised at once.  I praise the proposal as a commendable step, and I think it shows an effort on the part of the directors to meet the situation.  A small delay will not matter, but it cannot be held up for any length of time; there must be some evidence given, and <Col N="1301" /> so far no evidence has been given that the people were objecting to this.</P>

      <P>I did not mention Ballinasloe, and never suggested that railways should be kept for the sake of Ballinasloe.  Only I suggested to the traffic manager of the Great Southern Railway that as Ballinasloe fair was going on perhaps he might work Ballinasloe as if it were a single line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir WALTER NUGENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I told you just now that could not be done, because in order to handle the traffic at Ballinasloe we have got to block the other lines.  We have no sidings there, therefore what you asked the traffic manager to do was impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. COUNIHAN Mr. COUNIHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COUNIHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only case where I mentioned Ballinasloe.  I want the House to realise that Ballinasloe has always worked well, and that in connection with the live-stock trade of the country the traffic is spasmodic. For three or four days in one week you might have a number of big fairs in the South, with ten or fifteen specials passing over the line.  The rolling-stock is not so plentiful.  It would have to come up on Monday, go back, say, on Tuesday, and come up again on Wednesday in that way.  With all due respect to Senator Sir Walter Nugent, I contend that we would have a terrible lot of delay, and as far as the cattle fair is concerned it would be very detrimental. I am only concerned with the cattle trade.  With the passenger and other traffic it will not have the same effect. The cattle trade is in itself in the interests of the farmer.  Everything that will affect the cattle trade will affect the farmer.  If you are going to leave the principal industry in this country to be handicapped in this way by single lines, I say it is bad business. From my experience of singling lines, I say that all the damage that occurs to live stock occurs when cattle are shifted into the sidings.  Senator Sir Walter Nugent's speech had a greater effect on the academic mind of the Minister than had my practical experience. Consequently he is backing up the railways, and I suppose he believes justly in it, but I am stating positively from the point of view of the cattle trade that it will be a most detrimental <Col N="1302" /> move as far as the live-stock trade of the country is concerned.</P>

      <P>I do not see my way to support the resolution.  If the singling of the lines is going to do an injury to any trade, cattle trade or any other, the Railway Tribunal is the proper tribunal to consider the matter and it has jurisdiction.  If the Railway Company reduces its facilities unreasonably, the Railway Tribunal has power to deal with it.  I assume from the form of the resolution that the case is to come before the tribunal and is to be raised by somebody, not by the cattle trade.  If that is so, the House ought to be very careful about passing any resolution pending litigation.  The only ground on which you could urge the Government to take the step which Senator Counihan asks us to ask them to take is that more or less substantial injury will be done pending the hearing of the case before the tribunal.  We cannot come to that conclusion without more or less prejudicing the case.  We have no evidence to do it, but, whether we have or not, we as a House have no right to do it.  We should not pass any resolution which might in any way prejudice any case that may come before the Railway Tribunal.  Might I suggest to Senator Counihan, if there is real injury going to be done to his trade between this and the time the case comes before the tribunal, he will have a very good case to bring if he has even one instance of delay.  If he is able to point to one such case between now and then, he will have a magnificent case to present, and I suggest that it would be much better for him to wait until then.  Meanwhile, I suggest, we should not deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>Some of us who live, or have been living, in districts where double lines of railway have been stopped and single ones put in their place can speak of the great inconvenience caused by that system.  I have been travelling all my life on a line in the west of Ireland.  The double line stopped at Castlerea and when I get to Claremorris, even on a fast train, I have to wait for at least half an hour. I have been hearing objections raised to that for years but now I am told that there is a new invention which will revolutionise all that and make a single line do as much as a double one.  I am not willing to accept that statement though I have no doubt it is given in good faith.  I do not accept it because once a double line is torn up we cannot go back on it, whether the new system succeeds or not.  We will be told, if it does not succeed, that it was very unfortunate but it had to be done.  The West is always suffering by these tricks and dodges.  I believe that all the people in the West strongly object to this proposal and there will be a great movement of opinion against anyone who carries it out.  What will happen if we have only a single line and delay occurs?  It will be poor consolation to say, &ldquo;We believed that it would be otherwise.&rdquo;  I support the motion of Senator Counihan or anyone else who objects to tearing up the line.</P>

      <P>I feel that I cannot support the motion mainly for the reasons mentioned by Senator Brown. I believe that the Railway Tribunal is the proper authority to deal with the matter, and we should not at present try in any way to prejudice the decision of that Tribunal.  For that reason I am surprised at the rather emphatic ex parte attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I would have thought that a person in his responsible position would not in a case <Col N="1304" /> of this kind have made any statement that might be quoted as evidence in support of the Railway Company before the Tribunal.  I appreciate the speech made by Senator Sir Walter Nugent.  He could make no other speech than the one he made.  I do not know sufficient about the matter to discuss it on its merits.  He would probably be able to justify his statement afterwards.  I feel that a person in the position of the Minister should not unduly prejudice the hearing of this case when it comes before the Tribunal.  I do not believe in asking a government to come and see any particular firm and ask them not to do or postpone doing a certain thing.  The whole is greater than the part, and I believe in this case that the mountain should come to Mahomet rather than the reverse.  For that reason I think that Senator Counihan would serve his purpose equally well by not putting the motion to the House, as it might prejudice the case before the Tribunal.</P>
