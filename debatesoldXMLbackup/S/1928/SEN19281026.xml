      <P>I have to announce that in pursuance of Standing Order 61, relative to private business, Deputy Hugh Law has been appointed by the Cathaoirleach and the Ceann Comhairle as Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Limerick Corporation Gas Undertaking (Pensions) Bill, 1928, and of the Joint Committee on the Waterford and Bishop Foy Endowed Schools (Amendment) Bill, 1928.  I have also to announce that the Joint Committee on Standing Orders relative to private business report that they have nominated Senators O'Hanlon, O'Rourke and Duffy to serve on the Joint Committee of the Limerick Corporation Gas Undertaking (Pensions) Bill and on the Joint Committee of the Waterford and Bishop Foy Endowed Schools (Amendment) Bill.</P>

      <P>The next motion that it is necessary for the Seanad <Col N="1360" /> to pass does not appear on the Order Paper.  Before Item No. 3 on the Order Paper is taken, it will be necessary for the House to pass the Rules that have been drawn up to regulate the coming elections for vacancies in the Seanad. I might mention that these Rules, which were circulated a fortnight ago to every member of the House with an invitation to send in any suggested alteration or amendment, have resulted in the fact that no alteration or suggestion has come in, so apparently the Rules are acceptable to the House.  I might mention that they are substantially the same as the Rules that were in force for the election three years ago, with some modifications made consequent upon the changes made by the Seanad Electoral Bill.  The Rules themselves are stated to have been propared and approved by the Chairman and Deputy Chairman, but in truth and in fact they were prepared by the Clerk, Mr. O'Sullivan, and we had no difficulty in adopting them.  I might mention that in preparing them the Clerk had the very valuable assistance of Mr. Wilfrid Brown, an experienced and very efficient official in the Local Government Department connected with elections.  If these Rules are passed by the House to-day it will be necessary at once for the Clerk, and I have given him directions to that effect, to send out nomination papers to any Senator who wants one, and also to send out to outgoing Senators the form which enables them, if they wish, to have their names placed on the list of candidates.  These will be sent out as soon as the House has passed the Rules. The Clerk, of course, will be in attendance at the office to receive the papers each day when they come back from the Senators who desire to send in nominations.  Senators will see all that provided for in the Rules, and we hope that in preparing their nomination papers they will have regard to the Rules, which are not complicated.  If they comply with the regulations in the Rules they will have no trouble about the nominations.</P>

      <P>It is necessary to pass a further resolution, and accordingly I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, pursuant to Rule 13 of the Seanad Election Resolution, 1928, the voting in connection with the 1928 Triennial Election shall take place at the sitting of Seanad Eireann to be held on Tuesday, 13th November, 1928, between the hours of 3 p.m. and 4.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That will carry out the idea and the desire apparently of a great many Senators that the two lists should not be made simultaneously because the Rules in the other House provide that the date for their selection shall be the 8th.  Ours does not come on until the 13th so that Senators will have ample time to see the results of the list in the other House.  The purpose, therefore, suggested here will in that way be accomplished.</P>
