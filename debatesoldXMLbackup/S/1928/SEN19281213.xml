      <P>The first business on the Order Paper is the motion in the name of Senator Jameson, but the second item&mdash;Appointment of Committee of Selection&mdash;will take a little time.  The Minister for Local Government has very kindly lent us Mr. Brown, of his Department, for the purpose of counting the votes in connection with that election.  I therefore propose to take item No. 2 first, and, while the votes are being counted, we can proceed with the other business.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>This is pursuant to Standing Order No. 97 and a <Col N="54" /> formal notice is unnecessary.  The Committee consists of eight Senators plus the Leas-Chathaoirleach, who is ex-officio Chairman.  Division lists will be distributed, and Senators should place the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, in the order of their choice, against the names of the Senators for whom they wish to vote. They may mark up to any number, but should bear in mind that the Committee consists of eight Senators.  Of course, they should not vote for the Cathaoirleach or the Leas-Chathaoirleach, nor should they sign the paper or make any other mark upon it.  When each Senator has filled in his voting paper he should fold it and drop it into the box which will be placed immediately in front of the Chair.  When every Senator who wishes to do so has voted, the papers will be collected and the next business on the Order Paper will be proceeded with while the count is proceeding.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the question of the revision of the remuneration of the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach be referred to a Committee consisting of seven Senators, and that the following be appointed to serve on such Committee: Senators Connolly, Dowdall, MacLoughlin, Moran, O'Farrell, Sears and Jameson.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a few remarks made yesterday by Senator Farren that I might deal with first.  He imputed motives to me in bringing forward this resolution. Senator Farren and I have sat together <Col N="55" /> so long in this House and have so often taken different sides that I had hoped he would leave me to say why I do this, and not impute motives to me.  I do not like the imputation of motives.  He must know that what he said came from his imagination, and I can only answer by denying the imputations and trusting that the House will take my word that these were not the motives which actuated me in moving the motion.  One of the things which he imputed to me was connected with a Bill which I believe has been introduced into the other House for the reduction of the salaries of Senators.  He seemed to imply that this was part of a combined move to reduce the salaries of the Seanad from top to bottom.  I never heard a word about that Bill until I was in England the other day and somebody told me that Senators were going to have their salaries reduced.  I knew nothing about it until then.  It is only fair to say that I think such a proceeding in the other House must be injudicious, to say the least of it.  That one House should proceed to deal with salaries of the other is likely to cause a great deal of ill-feeling and trouble.  If such a thing is to be done that is not the right way to do it.  The only way such a thing could be done would be if Senators themselves, and especially those to whom the salary is of importance, moved in the matter, and if they themselves, from patriotic motives, make up their minds that our salaries ought to be cut down; and it is from them, and from them alone, that such a motion should come. Those of us not in any shape or form dependent upon the salaries should not move in the matter.</P>
    <P>When the Seanad was about being established I held the view that it would be a great thing if we could get a body of Senators together without any salary. I think everyone here present would say that if we could get such a body together it would have a reputation for independence and might be relied upon. But it was pointed out to me that we could not possibly get such a body; it was pointed out that there were a great many people who ought to be Senators, and who would prove very valuable as Senators, but whom we could not ask to <Col N="56" /> serve unless they got decent salaries. Then I thought that some others who could afford it ought to act without salaries.  It then became quite evident that to have paid and unpaid Senators would never do, and that it was not the right thing for people who could afford to do without the salary to apparently make a patriotic offering by not taking their salaries.  That would not be right.  Therefore, I fell in with the idea that we should all be paid the same salary and that we should all be put on the same level.  I say that if the salaries of the ordinary Senators are to be interfered with the motion to do so should come from this House and from a certain number of Senators.  I should deprecate greatly that such a step should be taken by the other House, and if such a step is taken it will make it very difficult for the Seanad to deal with the matter when it comes up here. We have had difficult situations to deal with frequently in our relations with the other House.  It required a good deal of tact at times to keep us working along together, but this action by the other House would cause a great deal of trouble, and I hope that members of the Dáil will see that and will avoid the occasion of any such friction.  The question might be solved if we were to appoint a Joint Committee or something of that sort, but the place where the motion should be initiated is in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>As regards the salaries mentioned in this resolution, Senators who have been here for the past six years will remember that these salaries were fixed at a time when the Seanad was rather standing upon its dignity.  We thought that our leading officers should at least be paid on the same scale as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Dáil.  I am avoiding attempting to use the Irish description of these officers, because I would only offend the ears of Irish speakers if I used badly pronounced Irish words.</P>
    <P>We thought that we were upholding the dignity of the Seanad in that way. It would not do that it should appear that our officers were not in as good a position as the others.  That situation has now disappeared; the Seanad does not depend for its reputation or for the <Col N="57" /> way in which it is looked at on the salary of anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past six years also we have come to recognise that there is a difference in the amount of work that is required from the Speaker and the Deputy-Speaker of the Dáil as compared with the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Seanad.  Our work, although it is vastly important, is concentrated work, work of revision.  Our debates have never taken as long as those in the Dáil.  A great deal of the ground that we have to go over is covered in the Dáil.  A great many amendments have been made to Bills before we get them.  When they come before us they are in a more or less approved form, and it is not very often that we meet very strongly controversial points that take up a good deal of our time.  Therefore we do not sit for anything like as long a time as the Dáil, and the difficulties in the work of our Chairman and Deputy-Chairman are nothing like those in the other House. This matter will really be for the committee to consider, but I doubt whether such salaries as are paid to our Chairman and our Deputy-Chairman can be justified from the point of view of the amount of labour that is incurred in carrying out the duties of these offices. We do not sit nearly as much as the other House; we do not meet with such difficult questions to be decided, and there certainly ought to be some difference in the pay of the officers of the two Houses.  That is all that I am suggesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are matters that it is very difficult to discuss in the House, and also in the presence of the two gentlemen who <Col N="58" /> hold the posts the salaries of which I am now discussing.  I tried to have the matter discussed yesterday when we had no Chairman, to get the committee appointed, and to have the matter discussed before any individuals were concerned in the case at all.  That was the reason why we tried to get the House to suspend the Standing Orders yesterday. But as the House decided otherwise, we have now to consider whether these two salaries can be justified in the light of the present state of affairs.  I have spoken to a good many Senators who have been acquainted with the work of the Seanad in the last six years; I have asked them to say whether they thought we could stand over these salaries, and every one of them said that they did not think we could, that to leave them as they were was leaving the Seanad open to attack as a body that was not taking care of the economies of the country.  Amongst the gentlemen I consulted was one who had been asked to go up for the Chairmanship, but who was prevented owing to health considerations, and he agreed with me that the salary of the Chairman was too high.  All the Senators I consulted held the same view.  Therefore I thought it wise to put down a motion so that the Seanad might take on to its own shoulders the responsibility either of leaving the salaries as they are or of appointing a committee to consider them.  If that committee, having considered them, came to the conclusion that they could justify them, I do not think that any of us would quarrel with their decision.  But the matter would be far better and more freely discussed, with better opinions formed about it, in a committee than in this House.  I need not tell you how I feel in the present circumstances in bringing such a motion before the House, and I only do so from the very strongest feelings of duty and in the belief that every one of us, in the present financial state of the country, should do everything possible to see that the Seanad will have a reputation for taking care of these matters to the best of its ability.  Senator Johnson proposes to move two amendments to my motion, the first being to delete the words &ldquo;of the revision&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The only other matter is with regard to the membership of the Committee.  The names have been very carefully selected from the various shades of opinion in the House. If they are not selected in that way and if the list is thrown open our experience is that it is very difficult to get quickly a carefully selected committee. Most undoubtedly I think that it should be small.  Again, our whole experience is that the best work comes from a small committee.  I will wait to hear what Senator Johnson has to say. I have merely given my reasons for putting down the motion in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Jameson has tabled a very important motion, and I think we might discuss it generally on the main principle, before Senator Johnson moves his amendments. I thoroughly agree with Senator Jameson in his desire to promote the independence of the Seanad.  I am a believer in two-chamber government, and I think it is essential to the proper working of two-chamber government that the Houses should be independent. Having regard to the attacks made on the Seanad&mdash;attacks that have escaped me&mdash;I imagine if the Seanad is seriously attacked and the issues relating to its existence developed and debated, the Seanad will be perfectly able to render a good account of itself.  With regard to Senator Jameson's proposal, that a committee should be appointed with directions to reduce the salaries of <Col N="60" /> its chairman and deputy-chairman, while I admit at once that it is open to the Seanad to take whatever steps it likes in connection with its principal officers, or indeed with any of its officers, at any time, if it has serious and substantial reason for action in the matter, I take the liberty of suggesting to the Seanad that this particular motion is somewhat premature.  I think we could very easily discuss such a motion in twelve months' time, if we thought fit, or at a future date when we have had practical experience of the working of the new Seanad, because this is really a new Seanad, appointed under different conditions.  My suggestion is that we ought to give the new Seanad an opportunity of proving itself, and some months hence we shall be in a better position to realise the extent and the nature of its work.  I think the work of the Seanad is much more likely to be increased than diminished, owing to the very welcome addition to various sections that hitherto, perhaps, have not been adequately represented amongst us.  I imagine that this Seanad will sit for longer hours in future.  I imagine that it will deal with various questions with which it has not dealt heretofore, and, though I do not approve in principle of the particular machinery by which this Chamber has been brought en rapport with the various political schools into which this country is divided, at the same time it must be evident that we are much more likely to have lengthy debates, and to have discussions on various topics that we have not discussed before, and in all probability we shall have an increasing influence on legislation, which is, after all, all to the good, and was what this Seanad was really appointed to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make no apology for the Seanad that existed for the last six years.  It came into being under unsettled conditions. We did the best we could; there is no doubt about that.  None of our opponents or antagonists can reproach us with failing in our duty.  We did our duty according to our lights and according to our opportunities.  We certainly did the best we could.  I had reason to complain, as many members of the Seanad complained from time to time, that our opportunities for discharging <Col N="61" /> our duties were seriously curtailed. For instance, the circumstances of the time required that all sorts of Acts should be passed through, that all sorts of co-ordinating legislation should be enacted, and that all sorts of sudden emergencies in legislative matters should be met and remedied.  There is no doubt about it, judging by the legislative assemblies of the world, that the Oireachtas surpassed itself, and there is no legislative body in ancient or modern times that could hold a candle to it in the matter of the number of laws that it produced.  I do not know how many laws went through this Seanad, perhaps hundreds, but the conditions under which some of these projects of legislation were brought before us left a good deal to be desired, and on many occasions we did not get proper notice, or proper time, for the adequate discharge of our duties.  In spite of all that we did the best we could, and certainly amended many Acts in very important particulars.  If we did no more than that, we should have certainly justified our existence.  Times have changed, and we are now living under much more peaceful and less hectic conditions.  We have now connected ourselves with the various schools of political thought that are in existence in this country.  The country itself has settled down finally on constitutional lines, the only lines on which it can possibly, rationally, and in a civilised way progress and prosper. There is no doubt about that.  Now we have representatives in this Seanad of all the political schools into which this country is divided, and that is a matter which must rejoice the heart of every Irishman.  However much we may differ in details in the matter of politics we are all Irishmen, and we all have the interests of this country and of its people at heart.  It is a matter of intense relief and delight to the people that this Seanad is representative of every section of political thought into which the country is divided.  I suggest, therefore, that the Seanad might continue as at present organised in every particular until such time as we are able to take stock of the new situation. I am perfectly satisfied that it will have more work to do, and that we shall have to sit longer hours, and <Col N="62" /> probably the reporters will agree with me that our debates are much more likely to be interesting, but however that may be, I think it would be very much better to allow the Seanad to prove itself and to have experience of its continuation under the new conditions. If, in six months or in twelve months' time, it is apparent to us that our work is diminishing or is not as exacting as it used to be, then it will be quite time enough for us to propose a remedy.  I hope, therefore, to carry the Seanad with me, no matter how much we may differ on other questions, in this: that in the matter of its own domestic economy this Seanad is supreme, and that it will resent and, if necessary, take action in relation to any body who trespasses upon its dignity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. GOGARTY Dr. GOGARTY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to preface my remarks, before opposing the motion that is under discussion, by saying that no matter what playful innuendo Senator Farren may have made against Senator Jameson, it has not altered either Senator Farren's opinion or the opinion of the House as to the honesty of purpose and patriotism of Senator Jameson.  We all know what Senator Jameson's time is worth. We all know that his time is so valuable that a multiplication of his salary by ten would not pay him for the time that he spends in this House.  My objection to the proposal to diminish salaries is because it arises from a wrong-headed notion of economy, inasmuch as it touches wages and not expenditure in this country.  This idea may spread if we attempt to create such a position as that which would result if the motion were carried.  I am opposing the motion because the position is invidious, and because, under certain conditions, I and many other members of this House would accept no salaries.  I will tell you later what the conditions are.  It would naturally be an invidious thing for the Seanad to insist that the salaries be not tampered with, because though at present the motion is limited to the salaries of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Seanad, there is at present a Bill in the lower House which proposes to reduce the salaries of all the Senators.  That Bill, notwithstanding <Col N="63" /> what Senator Jameson has said, is promoted by a body of men who find their representation in this House is receding.  I must saiy, in justice to Senator Jameson, that privately he did broach the question of the Chairman's salary before, but publicly there was not a word while the Chairman happened to belong to the landlord class or, what is worse in this country, the residuum which represents that landlord class: that is to say, all the stiffs and all the pensioners which the British Government have left behind here, and who were not able to escape.</P>
      <P>If the salaries which Senators receive here are reduced to such limits that they will no longer enable a Senator to live in this very expensive city to devote his time to Parliamentary work, it will mean, in the long run, that the masses of the people of the country will not be represented here.  Men who understand and sympathise with the masses will not be represented here, men who, unlike the pensioners who were filled with dimming memories of an ancient Civil Service that was always retrograde or at least stationary, will find no representation.  In the long run it is a matter of the representation of the people here.  Therefore, if the salaries of the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman are interfered with, there is no guarantee whatever that the salaries of every other member of the House will not be interfered with, so that in the end you would leave the House open only to representation by stiffs and pensioners.  We are not going to be worked into that in spite of any amount of misrepresentation which my attitude, and that of others, in resisting the motion may give rise to.</P>
      <P>But there is another explanation of this economy campaign.  We are told that it is a sop to Cerberus.  We hear of economy in salaries only by the way.  It was born in the noodle of the man whose policy of violence cost this country eleven million pounds.  De Valera's policy, which is still retrospective, retrograde, reactionary and rickety, has hurt this country more than Cromwell did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The blowing up of Mallow Viaduct <Col N="64" /> cost the country more than Cromwell, who, after all, only rounded up a few fly boys in Drogheda who had escaped from the Civil War when England was a Republic.</P>

      <P>Who destroyed the Mallow Viaduct?  If the people of this country had the humour of a cat they would laugh at the idea of economy coming from the side of the House that it has come from.  A sop of that sort to Cerberus is perfectly useless.  De Valera's policy is to &ldquo;simplify&rdquo; the standard of living in this country, not alone by docking the salaries of Senators but of other people as well.  His policy would make the standard of living in the country lower than it is.</P>

      <P>I am rebutting policy, and anticipating criticism, and for the confusion that naturally arises in Senator Dowdall's mind I have no responsibility.  I am merely pointing out this, that it is the intention, and has been deliberately so stated, of the Fianna Fáil Party to lower the standard of living in this country.  I was going on to say that people are beginning to look upon De Valera as the representative of the Back-side of Irish life.</P>

      <P>I do not want to make any other further reference to the Fianna Fáil Party.  My point is this, and I submit it is quite easy to appreciate it: that once economy begins in a wrong-headed direction, and I think I have proved that this is an attempt to begin it in a wrong way, it will proceed along the whole line of the Civil Service.  Economy in wages is false economy, because you cannot get good work for bad money.  There are many directions in which expenditure in this country might be reduced, but it is not my province to point out the curtailments that might be made. But I may point out that we have had an exhibition of Dives legislating for Lazarus, an exhibition from people who cannot naturally from their outlook realise that if the Seanad is made impossible for representation of the masses, the country will naturally fall back into a condition and outlook which, as I have said, will not be national.  The proposal that I was going to make about the Seanad salaries is this.  Five or six years ago the Seanad discussed this matter privately. <Col N="66" /> If there was a Bill brought in forbidding anybody in receipt of a British pension to be allowed to become a legislator in the Oireachtas, I am sure that every Senator would serve in the Seanad free.  I again stress the point that an economy campaign of this kind will, in the long run, hit representation of the masses in this House.</P>

      <P>Before dealing with anything Senator Gogarty has mentioned, I would like if possible to keep to the matter under discussion, the appointment of a committee, and to deal with it on its merits.  In the first place, I do not think a committee is the way in which we should deal with the matter proposed.  As I see it, a committee, if set up, would come to certain decisions, or it would not, and it would report back to the House and this body would have to analyse the report and go through every detail of what the Committee had done.  I may be wrong in that, but I think that is what the result would be.  If we are to discuss the salaries of the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman, I think the proper place to do so would be here. I would not be content to sit on a committee which would have to report to the House and then have the whole matter re-opened.  With regard to the salary of the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman, in spite of the protest, which I accept, from Senator Jameson as to their attitude on the matter of the salary for the last six years, I am quite satisfied with Senator Jameson's personal assurance on that issue.  I am not satisfied that the matter, which has become a burning one at the moment, should not have been dealt with five or six years ago.  It is a matter of cynical amusement to find that all this issue is now being brought up under the altered conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the economy of the country, and the standard as set by Governmental administration in this country, I would say that our fundamental point of view on that is that economy must be practised, and economy as a standard example to the country must be shown and demonstrated at the head of affairs if we are <Col N="67" /> to hope to have any economy permeating right down the mass of the people.  This country has been faced and is being faced with a great deal of expenditure.  Senator Gogarty may have very different views to me as to how that expenditure was created. We will leave that for the moment, but the fact remains that what is necessary to maintain the dignity of the governing classes in Dublin&mdash;pardon the expression for want of a better one&mdash;what is necessary for the maintenance of the dignity of these people, ourselves included, and the Chairman of the Seanad, the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil, the President, and all these people, does not seem to re-act to what is necessary for the dignity of the ordinary citizens in the State.</P>
    <P>In other words, it is rather ironical and paradoxical to find that in Dublin in Government circles it is argued that it is impossible to maintain the dignity of certain offices on salaries under £1,700, £1,500, or £1,000 a year, or whatever the case may be.  Yet, when we come down to the plain working people we find that 32/- a week is sufficient on the Shannon scheme for the ordinary labourer, who has difficult and very heavy work to do for 8½ hours a day. I hold that whilst we all would like to feel that we would earn as much as possible&mdash;mark the word &ldquo;earn&rdquo;&mdash;and be adequately compensated for all our work, we should not lose sight of the fact that the big bulk of the people in this country are earning money and not being paid it, and that the salaries, wages and standard of living for the under dog are an outrage on humanity. I speak as an employer.  I am paying at present the highest wages we can pay in our particular line of industry, and higher than most, and I know the majority of the workers are not getting a living wage.  Economic conditions will not enable me to pay more, but that does not blind me to the ordinary sense of justice, and I know that many of my employees and their families are not getting a decent livelihood.</P>
    <P>On the question of dignity, I hold it is more dignified to have the mass of the people living at least not below a standard of frugal comfort than to have <Col N="68" /> the maintenance of certain institutions, and certain displays and certain window-dressing, if we might call it so, for the edification of foreigners, and who from that might proceed to our slum areas and find there a very unedifying contrast between the standard that prevails amongst the ruling classes and that of the under dog, who has to supply the nucleus for all of us.  I think the question of dignity is very much abused and misunderstood. Decent dignity is what is needed in this country, and dignity goes with character and not display of garish wealth or entertaining.  Dignity means being honest, paying your bills, and having some Christian humanity for the people among whom you are living, but dignity and display while we have the existing conditions prevailing throughout the country to me is all wrong.  It is not dignity.  It is hypocrisy and window-dressing, which is not deceiving even the foreigners who come over here, and I have met a good many of them.  In other words, in my opinion the standards in this country are wrong.</P>
    <P>In the first place, we followed the British Imperial forces in this country automatically.  We felt because the British Empire had for the maintenance of its alleged dignity to maintain certain definite governing influences, certain things that stood for the imposition of authority, certain things that dominated and tyrannised perhaps the populace, that we have to live up to their standard.  That is, we are faced with a contrast between the great incubus called the British Empire and this struggling people of 2¾ millions. The sooner we adjust our point of view the better, and try to live according to the conditions as they are in this poor country.  It is a question of a point of view.  I hold that in all Governmental activities, in all our lives&mdash;and I do not claim to be immune&mdash;we are setting an entirely false standard and one which we cannot afford.  I am speaking now more as an economist than as a politician or as a member of any party. This country has got to get down to a bread and butter basis, paying its way and trying to live decently and cleanly if simply.  We are a struggling and not a wealthy people, and in this maintenance of the various classes of officials <Col N="69" /> we ought to cut our cloth according to what is available.  Our attitude in regard to the salary of the Chairman of the Seanad is that it does not require to go to a committee.  Our feeling is that the Chairman should be paid a salary somewhere about £750, an adequate salary for whole-time service, and the Vice-Chairman ought to be an honorary official.  When Private Bills are brought forward they could be placed in the hands of the Chairman, who will then probably earn his salary.</P>
    <P>If they are not, he will not earn his salary and we put this forward not so much for the few hundred pounds to be saved but as a standing example to the country of what ought to prevail until such time as the main body of our people are in a fit condition to afford more.  I do think, and I cannot stress it too much, that it is quite wrong, quite unjust and quite humiliating to any sense of decency to find the contrast that exists between what is necessary for the dignity of an official in Dublin and a workman at Ardnacrusha.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter mentioned by Senator Gogarty, I do not know whether he would like to develop an acrimonious spirit within the Seanad or not, or whether he wishes to indulge in attacks on people who are not here to defend themselves.  I want to say if the whole issue of the civil war, its precipitation, its rights and wrongs are to be gone into here, we are in a position to hold our own with Senator Gogarty or anyone else.  I do not propose to deal with it because I do not feel it is the spirit of the House that it should be dealt with, but if Senator Gogarty wants to adopt this attitude we will have to act accordingly.  He may feel that de Valera, as he mentioned, caused losses in this country. It might also be argued that when the Republican army was destroying barracks and mansions and holding things up generally throughout the country that it also caused serious material losses.  These issues are in my opinion things of the past.  That does not mean that we are running away from them.  The controversial elements of that will never be finished with so long as the present generation <Col N="70" /> stands.  If Senator Gogarty tries to introduce them here, we will have to be prepared for them.</P>
    <P>The point at issue is the question of the Committee.  I would not like to act on the Committee.  It is a matter for the entire Seanad.  I have expressed my views frankly as to how I feel with regard to the Chairman's and Vice-Chairman's salaries.  That is all I have to say.  When the matter of the Senators' salaries comes up we can discuss that in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on this motion of Seanadoir Aindrias Mac Seamais.  I am quite sure before the discussion is over Seanadoir Aindrias Mac Seamais will be convinced that a new era is dawning on the Seanad.  Whether the Senators are sorry or not, the Cathaoirleach is going to be put to the pin of his collar to keep the discussion at the level which is required by Standing Orders.  I have no intention of imputing motives to the proposer of this motion.  As a matter of fact, I think it would be wrong to forget the very valuable assistance which those whom the proposer represents afforded to this State when its existence was in jeopardy.  We are not forgetting that, but I want to say that he is unfortunate in the circumstances of his proposal.  It comes at a time and under conditions for which, no doubt, he has no responsibility, but which inevitably have created in the minds of many an atmosphere of suspicion, whether well grounded or otherwise.  I think that impression was considerably strengthened by what seemed to me, and to many others, the unseemly haste with which it was sought to precipitate this Seanad into discussing the motion yesterday.  It would not have relieved the situation in any way.  If the discussion had taken place and the committee were appointed, they could not have met and given a decision prior to the election of the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach unless that election had been adjourned for a very long period.  The only effect of such a procedure would have been to have held up the ordinary business of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this motion, and the manner of its introduction, gave rise in my mind and, I think, in the <Col N="71" /> minds of many others, to the belief that action taken in another place was flurrying this Seanad into making, in a spirit of panic, some gesture that would placate public feeling and dissipate the idea that it was not doing its duty. While that atmosphere exists, we can take no action without dealing, in my opinion, a very serious blow to that intangible thing which some people have referred to as the dignity of this House.  We have had a very interesting lecture on dignity, but I think there is a dignity in this Seanad as part of the Oireachtas.  This Oireachtas is the highest Assembly in this land, the greatest in this nation, and we have got to regard it as an institution of which we should be proud, and one we should try to make great, strong and revered.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that certain new adherents to this Assembly seem to have changed their attitude, seem to have found that there is some use in the Seanad, and are prepared to make some use of this institution in order to amend legislation which comes from that part of the Oireachtas which certain other spokesmen have declared is the only part that should be left in existence.  I am glad to see that change.  It is an indication of better times.</P>
    <P>There is a small point I want to make.  I am not aware that, save the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach, there is any member of this House drawing a salary.  I think it is a wrong term to use, and I think it should be emphasised that this allowance which is made is not a salary to members, but merely an allowance for expenses.  That should be cleared up.  I think that it is a serious injustice to many men who attain to an assembly like this to have that particular phrase harped on.  I would resent the suggestion that that is the inducement which makes citizens aspire to become members of this assembly.  To right-minded citizens that is the least inducement.  To myself it is the most distasteful part of my association with the assembly that such an allowance has to be made, but it is part of modern democratic institutions, and those who take pride in the institution and membership of it do so, not because of what it brings to them, but of what they can bring and contribute to the <Col N="72" /> building of the State and the making of the institution an instrument for national good.  Therefore, for these reasons I strongly support the suggestion of Senator Esmonde.  I think he put up a very good and almost unassailable argument.  How can you tell, even those of you who have had experience of this assembly in the past, what is going to be the fate and what the duties and work of the Seanad in the near future?  The Agenda Paper today contains another resolution in the name of Senadoir Tomás MacEoin, indicates if the motion is carried that the position of Presiding Officer or Senator will be nothing in the nature of a sinecure, and Senadoir Tomás MacEoin is only beginning.  Before he is finished, so far as I can see, the Minister for Finance will have to introduce a supplementary estimate to deal with remuneration if the services of Senators are to be adequately remunerated.</P>

      <P>I say that you cannot foresee it and if those who are veterans in the ranks of Senators and who have had six years' experience here cannot see it I wonder how my friend Senator Connolly, and my colleague Senator Sears, who are as innocent as new-born babes as to the work of Senators, are going to sit on a Committee and give a judgment which will be of any service to the Seanad in making up their minds.  In six months hence, we will have some opportunity of judging this matter on its merits and in the light of experience.  We will have some opportunity&mdash;this is of vital importance to the value of the decision arrived at&mdash;of discussing and considering it in an atmosphere which is not tainted as the present atmosphere is, with the suspicion and apprehension that there is some ulterior motive behind all this discussion which has suddenly sprung up.  If we want to inspire confidence in the decisions and deliberations of this assembly, we want definitely to cut that kind of thing out, no matter from what side it springs.  If there is one section of the country that should be more guarded than any other and which should try to make itself, like Cæsar's <Col N="73" /> wife, above suspicion, it is the section which has at its disposal the power of finance and the power of the Press, silently and insidiously to mould opinion.  If we are going to make the institution something which will win the full confidence of all sections of this State and wean sections already in revolt against it from that revolt, and make them realise that this Oireachtas is their Parliament, flesh of their flesh and bone of their bone, we must have our decisions immune from this atmosphere of suspicion which surrounds this proposal and which also surrounds a similar proposal in another House.  That is my reason for opposing this motion.  I would like to see this question discussed in all its bearings on its merits but that cannot be done on this motion.  For that reason, I oppose it and if it is put to a division I will vote against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Milroy has reminded the Seanad that the scale of remuneration is wrong, that new-born babes such as Senators Connolly and Sears are not competent, because of lack of experience, to discuss this question.  Unfortunately for that analogy the present scale was fixed by new born babes six years ago who had not any experience then, and who have only been obtaining experience through the years that intervened.  I felt, when putting down the amendment which stands in my name, that it would be impossible to discuss the proposition without regard to all the circumstances, not alone in connection with allowances, but with the whole cost of Parliamentary institutions.  The present scales were fixed in the early stages both in the Dáil and Seanad and were clearly tentative, clearly the result of mere arbitrary views, without experience, and I think it is quite reasonable to say that periodically such scales imght be reviewed.  It is not my view that that is implied by the word &ldquo;revision.&rdquo;  It is implied in the speech of Senator Jameson that the Seanad should decide without regard to all the circumstances being considered that there should be a change, an alteration by reduction.  It is conceivable that consideration of this matter might <Col N="74" /> even result in advice to increase.  I do not, however, think that that is likely, and I would certainly vote against any such proposition, but consideration might well lead to that conclusion if, as I think Senator Connolly suggested, the House is being carried away by the example of British Imperialism. Those of us who follow the news of the day in other countries recently read the scales paid to members of the Cabinet in Great Britain, and we learned that £5,000 a year is a mere fleabite, a mere bagatelle, according to Imperialists whose example we are supposed to be following.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that it is fair to say that the scales have been based and that the other salaries of the Ministers and officers of the Dáil and Seanad have been based upon the British scales.  Though there is much to be said for the views expressed by Senator Connolly, regarding the standard, I do not believe that it is the right thing that we should assess merit or dignity by the amount of the remuneration. I think that one has to consider all the circumstances in which the mass of the people are living and the reactions of that consideration upon the scales that may be fixed for our own officers.  I am reminded that in 1925 a discussion took place in this House upon the very question that was raised by Senator Connolly when a motion was moved by Labour Senators protesting against the scale of wages fixed on the Shannon Scheme. Only four, other than the Labour Senators, supported the view that 32/- a week then being fixed was inadequate. I am glad to commend Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde for being one of the four.  Amongst those who are opposing this motion were some of those who thought that that was quite an adequate wage.  I think that the question of the remuneration of the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach ought to be considered, but I do not think it can be assessed openly in this Chamber.  Certain figures were mentioned by Senator Connolly.  He discussed the commercial value of the officers.  I think he would be the first to admit, if one is going to treat it as a commercial proposition, that to discuss <Col N="75" /> the commercial value of the officers here openly in this House and across the table in the way issues are discussed is quite impossible.  If changes are to be made, they will necessarily have to be made by a discussion in Committee where many factors have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>It is stated that the scale of salary &mdash;in this case the scale of salary is the correct term&mdash;cannot be isolated from many other questions.  I think they should not be isolated from other questions.  One has to remember that the relative position of the two Chambers has to be considered, and we have to be content with the proposition that the scale of salary of the officers is not an indication of our acceptance of a different status.  We have become familiar in recent years with the idea of equality of status and difference of functions.  I think the Seanad has claimed in the past, and none has claimed that more persistently than those with whom Senator Jameson acts, that there is to be no subordination attributed to the Seanad as compared with the Dáil.  We have to be satisfied that the question of salaries or their amounts is not an indication of any subordination.  Supposing that the salaries of the officers are reduced, I think it is possible before this issue is decided that other questions will arise.  We will have to consider the type of man or woman who is accepted in the future, as an officer to preside over the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I think, also, and it was stated here, that the position of Ministers and the position of Deputies and Senators and similar matter will have to be considered in the light of the experience of the past six years and in connection with the possibilities of the future.  After all, it is not entirely true that the social conditions differ in this country from the conditions in neighbouring countries, but the material, shall I say, for manning political institutions differs in quantity.  We have not the reserves, the men of leisure, professional men who can afford the time for the study of political affairs, and there will need to be, in my view, some consideration given to the necessity for attracting or, at least, <Col N="76" /> making it possible for people to devote a great share of their time to the serious study and application of the bigger questions of politics in this country if it is desired that the Parliamentary institution should be maintained, and that it is by Parliamentary methods that the country shall in the future be governed. You have the fact, and there is no use blinking it&mdash;it is as well at least that the Seanad should be reminded of it&mdash; you have a Ministry, mainly of young men who have broken their professional careers for over five or six years, living on salaries that are commensurate with the scales that are now in question.  As time goes on, they will inevitably be displaced&mdash;and some would say the sooner the better.  But when they have been displaced, what is their future? What is it going to be?  Back to their professions.  They will require to recover their positions.  Then these men will have to devote their time to their professions and leave politics aside. What will be the effect of that?  A new Government of similarly inexperienced men will take their places.  They will have to devote their whole time and, if possible, even more than their whole time to the work of political study, and their professional life and their business life will be broken.  In course of time they, too, will be displaced.  By whom?  By the men that they displaced, and in turn they will again have to go back to their professions and to their businesses.  They will not be able to devote their time to the careful study of politics and an entirely new body of men, equally inexperienced, will come forward.</P>
    <P>This raises a very serious question for the Seanad and for the country, and it is quite appropriate to the discussion that is now under way.  The whole question of the future political government of the country is involved in this question of salary, and while I would like to see generally a moderate scale of salaries and earning generally in the higher ranks, one has to take into account the requirements of the situation, and that you cannot take untrained men from the bench or office or shop and place them in Government positions in this country, prepared to leave <Col N="77" /> entire control to the Departmental official.  You may say that would be perfectly justifiable and that the country would be better governed as a result. You may make that claim.  If you do that, then give up the idea of parliamentary government.  So that we are really in touch with a much more serious question than the mere few hundred pounds that is at issue as between the salary mentioned and the salaries that have been paid.  It is for that reason that I have thought it well now to move the amendment or to put down the amendment that stands in my name.  If a committee is to be set up to consider this question, it should not be with a prejudgement that there is to be a change downwards.  It is to be a reconsideration with an entirely free view which the committee may have regarding all the circumstances that are impinging upon this question at issue.</P>
    <P>I ask Senator Connolly when he is touching on this question of the burden upon the country, the relative dignity of the workman and the official, and the cost of the official class, to concede that as far as the workman and the general economy of the country are concerned it is no greater burden to place on them a salary of £1,700, £1,000, £2,000 or £3,000&mdash;if such salaries were to be paid &mdash;to men who are serving their country as civil servants, than it is to pay such sums to men who are acting as directors of companies, to professional men, or to men in service of a similar kind.  There is no greater burden in the case of an official person than in the case of an unofficial person in private trade or industry. When people, and especially those writing to newspapers owned by men of considerable wealth, draw the attention of the country to the burden placed upon the general public by the excessive amounts drawn by civil servants and Ministers, and the like, they should bear in mind that the burden is equally great if the money is drawn by way of dividends upon investments or by way of payment for managerial experience. I have touched upon my reason for asking for the deletion of the words &ldquo;of the revision.&rdquo;  I ask the Seanad not to come now to any decision as to whether there should be a change <Col N="78" /> whether that change should be by way of a reduction.  I also ask that there should be no committee appointed by name by the mover of the motion. The Senator mentioned that this matter had had very careful consideration.  By whom?  By the Senator.  As I gather from the reading of the motion, it is a question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have listened attentively to the speeches made, and it seems to me that it would not be a very difficult matter to change the motion so as to meet the wishes of other Senators.  The idea of a compromise was put into my head by what Senator Johnson said. He asked the House to take the two amendments concurrently, and I was going to appeal to Senator Jameson, having heard what Senator Johnson said, to amend the motion something in this way: &ldquo;That the question of the remuneration of the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach be referred to a committee consisting of seven Senators to be appointed by the Chairman or the Committee of Selection.&rdquo;  It seems to me from the speeches I have heard that that would meet with agreement from all parts of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Perhaps there may be a small number who would not agree.  As each argument was made, it seemed to me that Senators were in a certain amount of agreement. As Senator Johnson said, they felt it might be a proper thing to look into the remuneration of the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach; but before the matter was looked into the committee should not be bound to consider the remuneration from the point of being downwards only.  If you appoint a committee do not tie the hands of that committee.  With regard to the appointment of Senators on the committee, Senator Jameson said he did not mind whether the committee would be nominated by himself or by others.  One Senator stated that he disliked the idea of serving on the committee.  Having regard to all that has been said, I think Senator Jameson ought to amend his motion by accepting the suggestions of Senator Johnson.</P>

      <P>I must congratulate Senator Johnson on the admirable speech he made when introducing <Col N="80" /> this amendment.  I may also add I am delighted to see him here.  I will vote for the Senator's first amendment, because it withdraws the direction to the committee to reduce the salaries of our Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach. I shall also vote for the second amendment, and I will vote against the resolution, no matter how much it is amended, for the reasons that I gave in my speech.  I do not wish to emphasise the matter, but I certainly think it would be a most injudicious resolution for the Seanad to agree to at the present time.</P>

      <P>We have had a variety of opinions expressed in this discussion. I rise to support the proposal made by Senator Esmonde.  In doing that, I must say I am very glad Senator Jameson moved his motion, because when I saw it on the Order Paper and remembered that it was of the same character as a motion that was made in the Dáil, it filled me with profound suspicion.  I regarded it then as a political manoeuvre.  Having heard Senator Jameson move his motion, I now see that it is the motion of a kindly gentleman who, for six years, has been labouring under a sense of anxiety and wrong that the Chairman of the Seanad was in receipt of a salary of £1,750 a year, in addition to a pension of £4,000 per year, but that during all that time Senator Jameson was dissuaded, let me say, deterred, perhaps appalled, by the basilisk eye of the gentleman who then occupied the Chair.  If Senator Jameson was diffident about moving his motion in the last six years, was there no person of his Party with greater assurance or with greater courage to face Mr. James Campbell, now Lord Glenavy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COMYN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say no more on that subject but emphasise the gratification which I feel that the impression which I had formed on seeing the motion on the Paper was a wrong impression, so far as it regarded Senator Jameson.  There were, however, one or two things in the speech of Senator <Col N="81" /> Jameson to which I should like to call attention.  He stated that the motion had been carefully considered and that the personnel of the Committee named had been carefully considered. Might I ask where and when were the personnel carefully considered?  Was it in Kildare Street, and if it was in Kildare Street, in what part of Kildare Street?  I will not go further than to say that the governing body of this country is located in Leinster House and that the personnel of any committees which this Seanad may choose to appoint will be selected in Leinster House and nowhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view of our Party in relation to the salaries of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman has been stated by Senator Connolly, the leader of this little group.  I do not say that a salary of £1,750 is too much for the work, but I say that, having regard to the financial condition of the country, it is perhaps more than we can pay.  If this country flourishes, as no doubt it may, and as I hope it will, we may increase, and increase considerably, the salary of the Chairman, and in addition to that a flourishing country may give him allowances as well.  But our position is that in the financial condition of the country we think a reduction in the salary is necessary, not because it is more than the holder of the particular office is worth, but because it is more than perhaps, in the circumstances of the country, we can afford to pay.  Our Party is committed to a general reduction. The office of the Chairman of the Seanad is the highest office in the gift of the people of this country.  We think it right perhaps to begin at the top.  The office of Vice-Chairman is only second in importance to that of the Chairman.  That is my view of the dignity of the office from a constitutional point of view, and also, I am happy to say, from a personal point of view.  We have had a discussion on this question of salaries.  I for one will never consent to have a discussion of that kind submitted to a committee. There are no backwoodsmen in this House.  I hope we are all men and women who are ready, willing and able to do our work.  If you appoint a committee to discharge the duties which you ought to discharge yourselves in <Col N="82" /> open debate before the people, you will not continue to hold the respect of the people.</P>
    <P>What is the proposal in this resolution? That two men should be selected from each group, that they should sit in private&mdash;the world outside will say, in secret&mdash;that they should whisper amongst themselves what is to be the salary of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman, and that they should present to this House a fait accompli, a settlement which the ordinary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It amounts to that, because an agreement arrived at by representatives of every group in all human probability would be accepted by this House, notwithstanding the opposition of any independent Senator. All things considered, it is better to debate this question fully in the House, but better still, I say, to leave the matter over, to leave it to the consideration and discretion of the two able gentlemen whom we yesterday appointed to the respective offices; give them time to think and to see what the duties of the office will be.  It is perfectly obvious that the proceedings of this Assembly will become more lengthy, that the duties of the Chairman will become more onerous, that the whole thing will become more lively, and that Senator Dr. Gogarty and his stiffs will have to look to themselves. Therefore, in all the circumstances, I suggest with great respect that the time has not arrived to continue this discussion further; that we have not the material, and that the best thing&mdash;and I put it to all parties in quite an impartial and national spirit&mdash;is that the motion should be allowed to drop for the moment until such time as the Chairman considers it might be brought forward again.</P>

      <P>Senator Esmonde emphasised the fact that this is a new Seanad, and that is a point I would like to make particularly in moving that the debate be adjourned.  Anyone present yesterday and to-day needs no argument to convince him that we are a new Seanad. We have the satisfaction of having in this Seanad a new group which completes its representation, and there is no one more glad to see that group here than I am.  The presence of that group will, as Senator Comyn said, altogether change the tone of business in this House.  Without agreeing with him or differing with him as to whether the proceedings will be more lively or not, at all events, there will be a cleavage between two points of view and that is extremely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have the advantage of the entrance into this House of one of the ablest Parliamentarians in the Free State&mdash;a man who discharged, I might say, the whole business of the Opposition in the Dáil single-handed for three or four years.  No House could have <Col N="84" /> introduced into it a man of the industry and ability of Senator Johnson without having its work, I might say, doubled and trebled.  These are very important reasons as to why this motion is now inopportune.  A committee set up would not be in the position to have the facts before them.  I submit that the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of this assembly may have their work trebled and, therefore, while that uncertainty remains any committee considering this matter would not have efficient data before them.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to the speech of Senator Connolly, and while I agreed with the greater portion of what he said, I was surprised to find that a man engaged in industrial pursuits and with long industrial experience such as he has had should take such a short view on the question of salaries.  With regard to the size of salaries, I submit great weight should be attached to the points made by Senator Johnson.  Let us look round and see what are the salaries prevailing in commercial life, in banking life, in county council life. We may have men in the future as Chairmen who are not well off, as far as the goods of this world are concerned, as our past Chairman.  We may have Labour Senators as poor as myself sitting in the Chair.  Why should not they be paid salaries adequate to the dignity of the position?</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson pointed out a consideration with regard to men in political life that I have often heard discussed before.  Men may be in this Chair, giving to the State the advantage of their knowledge, of their integrity, of their experience for four, five or six years, and then they may be flung out of it to take up their professional life again.  There is a possibility of great injustice being done in that way.  I submit that Senator Connolly had his table of values upset altogether when he mentioned the sum of £750.  I saw an advertisement in the Dublin papers recently from an English tea firm offering their representative in Ireland a salary of £1,000 a year.  I saw where a municipal body in this country advertised for a tramway manager at £2,000 a year.  There are professional men in the small towns of Ireland earning £2,000 and £3,000 a year.  There are <Col N="85" /> county council officials earning over a £1,000 a year.  Perhaps the argument had a wider scope than this resolution, but any man who is qualified to give to this State his services, in an important position, has to consider whether a larger salary might not be got from the nearest bank or the nearest railway company or the nearest county council.</P>
    <P>Are not the affairs of this State, small and poor as it may be, of more importance than the distribution of tea, or the running of tramways?  There is a great deal more to be said about salaries than dismissing them in that summary way.  I am sure that when Senator Connolly looks more closely into the matter his view on that question will be as level and as sensible as the views he expressed in other portions of his speech.  I submit that the House has not sufficient information before it to discuss this question, and I propose that the debate be adjourned for twelve months.</P>

      <P>I am aware of that. Listening to the debate this evening, I seem to have been transported into an atmosphere of unreality as to the conditions which operate in this country, that what is at issue in this motion is after all, a fleabite in the expenses of the country, and that a steam hammer is being used in order to drive in a pin. The greatest saving would be, perhaps, <Col N="86" /> £300 or £400.  The opposition is unreal, and the arguments are unreal, and, as a matter of fact, I expected that instead of opposing the motion, every Senator would have been impressed by it.  For that reason I want to suggest to Senator Jameson that he should add, after the word &ldquo;Leas-Chathaoirleach&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and the allowances of Senators,&rdquo; so that the whole question of sixty members constituting this unit should be brought before a tribunal set up to consider it.  Is there anybody here who does not know the circumstances of the country?  I come from the country, and I know that there is an insistent demand that the expenses of Government and of Government activities must be reduced.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has definitely stated that there will be a Budget deficit next spring. Who is going to support the imposition of further taxation, or how is he going to balance the Budget?  Instead of quibbling all the afternoon about saving £300 or £400, the question the House should have been considering was &ldquo;How much will the sixty Senators lose in the good cause of trying to balance the accounts&rdquo;?  That is the position, and for that reason I oppose the adjournment.  The matter will have to be brought to an issue.  These salaries were fixed when the Senate was set up.  At that time the cost of living was 120 points above pre-war. To-day the cost of living is 60 points above pre-war.  Is there no relevance to that in the question?  If the cost of living has fallen, the salaries have increased in a similar proportion, and the £360 which was considered a reasonable sum five or six years ago is to-day 50 per cent. higher than when the amount was fixed.  These are the reasons why we think there should be a Committee to inquire into this matter. For this reason the public expects the matter to be handled in a business-like way.  This atmosphere of unreality, and this question of living in a kind of vacuum, forgetting the circumstances that exist, is a waste of time, and not acting in a business-like way, so as to enable the Minister for <Col N="87" /> Finance to save money and enable us to pay our way and confront the world as an honest nation.</P>

      <P>I hope that we are going to conclude this discussion this afternoon.  The debate, in fact, tends to outrival the famous Treaty debates.  We are engaged here on the most solemn orations in regard to questions in which not a single person outside this House has the slightest interest. So much has been said about dignity that I think it would have tended far more to the dignity of this House if we had disposed of the motion one way or the other, without all the fulsome orations that we have had to listen to.  I had the other experience of listening to equally eloquent orations just about this time three years ago, in support of a wage of 32/- a week for workers on the Shannon scheme.  It is surprising how some people can wax eloquent in support of high salaries where they themselves are concerned, and be equally eloquent for miserable wages where ordinary workers are concerned. I do not desire to express any opinion on the subject matter of the salaries of the two officers of the House. I think that is really a matter that could be best discussed and settled by a Committee, but I appeal to the House to terminate the discussion and vote on the merits of the motion.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Senator O'Farrell has said, that the plain issue before the House ought to be dealt with, and dealt with by a vote. This House is accountable for the salaries of these two officers.  When they were fixed it was by the direct action of the House.  That is the question we <Col N="88" /> are dealing with now.  The question of the payment of members depends on the Oireachtas and not on this House. They are two totally different things. We must take on our own shoulders the merits of settling this and we must decide it one way or the other.  If the majority of the Senators consider that the salaries should be left alone, say for a year, or for some definite time, and that the debate should then be resumed, that would be one opinion.  If the majority consider that the salaries are too high, then we have arrived at a decision, and that matter ought to be settled first.  Then the question as to whether it should go to a committee or not arises.  That also would have to be voted upon.  I agree with Senator Johnson that now that we have a Selection Committee that would probably be the right body to select the committee, if this matter is to go before a committee.  There was no Selection Committee when I drew up this motion, but a Selection Committee has been appointed, and if the House decides to refer the matter to a committee, that committee should be selected by the Selection Committee. There are two questions before the House, and I would ask the Chairman to put the first one.  The motion that is now proposed means that the matter would be adjourned sine die.</P>

All those who vote that the motion should be adjourned sine die vote for the continuance of the present salaries of the two officers; those who vote against it consider that the salaries ought to be looked into by a body appointed by the Seanad, or, as some members seem to think, by the Seanad itself.  It is a direct yea or nay, and I think we have had enough of debate to-day to enable us to decide that now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment to Schedule, Part I.:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the following words and figures:&mdash;3 Edw. VII., c. 36; the Motor Car Act, 1903; the whole Act; 10 and 11 Geo. V., c. 72.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move the amendment merely for the purpose of getting, if I can a statement from the Minister as to what the position is in regard to the regulation of road transport.  In this respect the law is absolutely obsolete.  In the case of the Dublin Metropolitan Division, the Carriage Acts of 1853, 1854 and 1855 have to be relied on mainly for the control of motors and buses on the streets, and, of course, the various Corporation by-laws made in connection with them.  The Motor Car Act of 1903 is quite insufficient, in most cases, to provide either local authorities or the Civic Guard with the powers that are necessary.  In the country the position is even worse.  The Jurisdiction Acts of ancient times are mainly relied upon, and also the Towns Improvement Act of 1854, which enables local authorities to make certain by-laws governing hackney cars and motors. Very few of the local authorities have availed of these powers.  We find in the report of the Inter-departmental <Col N="91" /> Committee on the control and regulation of road traffic the following statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In recent years by-laws were sanctioned for the Urban District Councils of Bray, Dundalk and Killarney. In the rural districts of the Saorstát, and in the great majority of the towns, no control for hackney carriages of any description exists.</P>
    <P>The Inter-departmental Committee was appointed in April, 1927, to go into the whole question of traffic regulation.  It heard a considerable amount of evidence and presented its report to the Minister on the 1st September.  Since then, as far as we know, nothing has been done with a view to giving legislative effect to all or any of the proposals of that Committee.  At least, no legislation has been introduced.  Now, one of the recommendations of that Committee was that the speed for motor buses, which had recently been raised to 20 miles per hour, should be further raised to 25 miles per hour, and that the speed limit for private motor cars should be entirely removed.  These were the recommendations, but, of course, they have not been translated into law.  Yet we find that an extraordinary condition has arisen.  Prosecutions were brought before a District Court against bus drivers for driving at 22 and 23 miles per hour.  There was one case where a man was prosecuted for driving at over 25 miles per hour. The legal limit is 20 miles, and yet the District Justice dismissed two cases and imposed a nominal fine in the case of the bus driver who exceeded 25 miles per hour.  He went further and suggested to the Civic Guards that, in view of the recommendations of the Inter-departmental Committee on road transport, for the future they should not institute any prosecutions against any driver unless he exceeded 25 miles per hour.  In other words, the recommendation of the Committee was to become the law of the land before it was enacted by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice was questioned on this matter in the Dáil, and his reply was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> I have seen the report in the Press of the case mentioned by the Deputy, and I have consulted the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, but on consideration of the report of the Inter-departmental Committee on road traffic he is of opinion that, in certain circumstances, a speed of 25 miles per hour is not excessive for single decked omnibuses.  I intend, accordingly, to issue instructions to the Gárda Síochána not to prosecute in future in such cases on the sole ground that the speed of the omnibuses exceeded 20 miles per hour.</P>
    <P>Now we have the rather unique position of the Minister telling the Guards that, in certain circumstances the law may be violated and he supports that later on by stating &ldquo;that statute law very often lags behind actual requirements.&rdquo; Well, if it does lag behind actual requirements, in this case, we know where the responsibility lies.  It is a rather extraordinary position to leave it now to a Civic Guard to say whether or not he shall institute a prosecution against a driver who has exceeded the statutory limit.  I would like to know from the Minister if the other recommendation of the Inter-departmental Committee is to be acted upon, and if instructions to that effect have been issued to the Civic Guards. that is the removal of the speed limit altogether in the case of private motor cars, because the public would like to know what is the position and whether there is a speed limit at all, and if so what it is.  Is it to be 25 miles per hour the same as that for the buses, or is it be to 20 miles per hour as laid down by statute law?  This is a question that requires some clearing up. The Dáil adjourned until the 20th February next and consequently no legislation can be expected before that time. A considerable amount of chaos exists and will continue to exist in regard to the administration of the law generally. It will depend upon the view of an officer of the Civic Guards as to what action shall be taken in the interest of public safety.  The matter is too important to be dealt with in any slipshod or careless way.</P>
    <P>According to the last issue of the Trade Journal for the nine months <Col N="93" /> of the present year over 12,000,000 miles were covered by motor omnibuses plying for hire, and 21,750,000 passengers were carried, and yet admittedly according to the report of the Inter-departmental Committee there is no effective legislation in existence which enables the Guards or the local authorities to control effectively that ever-growing traffic.  There are certain powers, I think, that might be utilised with greater effect.  One of them is the power to insist on the cleanliness and roadworthiness of the vehicles.  This power is not administered as stringently as it should be.  Then there is the question of overcrowding, which has become, in certain hours of the day, a fearful menace.  I had the personal experience about three weeks ago of travelling in a bus licensed to carry fourteen passengers which had twenty nine passengers on board together with the driver.  The emergency door at the end of the bus was so pressed against by passengers that nobody could open it.  I was wondering what was going to happen in the event of a collision, or in the event of the bus being overturned.  I know that the Civic Guards cannot watch every instance. I know there are certain routes in which there is crowding in narrow buses, and which are not so safe as one would desire.  That has become notorious, to say nothing of the racing that takes place for the capture of passengers.  I hope the Minister will be able to assure the House that he is going to take some steps as early as possible to introduce comprehensive legislation in regard to this all important question of policy.</P>
    <P>Steps are being, or have been, taken in Northern Ireland with a view to regulating traffic, and further steps are being taken for co-ordinating it, if possible, and preventing cut-throat competition.  According to to-day's paper steps are being taken in Great Britain to introduce comprehensive legislation along the same lines.  I would say, in passing, it seems a pity that the Minister for Finance, when promulgating his new policy in regard to the taxation of motor omnibuses, should have thought fit to make his announcement of policy at a political party meeting in Mallow instead of to <Col N="94" /> a House of the Oireachtas.  I think a statement of that kind, outlining a new policy in regard to roads, and to a considerable extent in the incidence of taxation, should have been made within the Oireachtas for the first time and not have been given merely as an item of interest at a party meeting. These are the reasons why I move this amendment, and not that I want to press a division, but I hope the Minister will be able to give some information as to his views and intention on this subject of road traffic.</P>

      <P>I was very glad to hear Senator O'Farrell say that the object of his amendment was to get an explanation from the Minister.  As I understand, the substance of the proposal of the Minister is that the Motor Car Act of 1903 should remain in operation until the 31st December, 1929.  The effect of the amendment is that the Motor Car Act of 1903 should last longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COMYN</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I am in favour of the discontinuance or the expiry of the Motor Car Act of 1903 provided that in the interval before the 31st December, 1929, a new and comprehensive Act is brought into operation. With some knowledge of the law, I conclude that that must be the purpose the Minister had in mind, that he intends to bring in a new statute modifying certain of the anomalies in the Act of 1903.  Senator O'Farrell is quite right in saying that the Act of 1903, Section 9, gave us a speed limit of 20 miles.  We all know&mdash;as a certain distinguished man said, we do not live in balloons&mdash;that that section was more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  I hope that in the new legislation which will be introduced within twelve months a more reasonable provision will be substituted for the speed limit.  I think I will not support the amendment, and I imagine that if Senator O'Farrell gets an explanation from the Minister he will not press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is if Senator <Col N="95" /> O'Farrell's amendment is carried the Motor Car Act of 1903 will cease to have effect as from the end of this year.  I hope it is not the Senator's intention to bring about that, because if it is, after that date Senators going home in any decent-sized bus will have to travel at the rate of four miles an hour, and but for the interposition of the Act of 1920 they would have to be preceded by a red flag.  I think the Senator must be aware that the purpose of the State in setting up the Inter-departmental Committee in 1927 to deal with the control and regulation of road traffic was to survey the whole position from the modern standpoint and consolidate and codify our whole legislation with regard to road traffic. That Committee reported only recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the purpose and I hesitate very much to prophesy.  When it is a question of examining a very big matter and considering the recommendations of a committee whose operations extended over twelve months, taking into consideration the limitation of parliamentary draftsmanship I hesitate to prophesy that we would be in a position within the next year to do without the Act of 1903.  At any rate, there is a fairly reasonable possibility that that will be the position.  The legislation that will be introduced as a result of this Report will deal with the consolidation and amending of our road traffic legislation.  We will have the whole thing before us in one Act.  So far as the position with regard to buses and their speed limit is concerned, I do not think that anyone could wish in the case of a matter such as the speed limit of buses to allow the strict letter of the law to interfere with the spirit of the law.  At any rate, on a discussion of a matter like that, if persons definitely object to the matter being taken up by the Minister for Justice in consultation with the Minister for Local Government and with the police authorities who are watching road traffic from the point of view of having it run in an ordinary, efficient and non-dangerous manner and if anyone has an objection to taking a lenient view of transgressions of the law, more in the letter than in the spirit, I think the proper place <Col N="96" /> for discussion is not in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, because the Expiring Laws Bill would be an appalling thing to get through the Oireachtas, if pieces of legislation were to be dealt with in that particular way. All that the Minister for Justice and myself are doing in the matter of the particular speed limit is that, while paying full attention to the spirit of the law that requires certain limitations on motor cars, as far as the requirement, say, of commercial vehicles, such as buses, are concerned, we are acting in a sensible way and not imposing unnecessary restrictions.</P>
    <P>I have not given any consideration as to whether a relaxation might not be made in the case of private motor cars but I am convinced that the same relaxation does exist.  However the position is that it is intended that legislation based on the Inter-departmental Committee report will supersede the Motor Car Act of 1903 at the earliest possible date, so far as the Department of Local Government is concerned.  In the meantime, the Motor Car Act of 1903 is a very valuable Act.  Considering the marked development of road traffic which has occurred recently and considering its age it is standing the strain not too badly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Schedule, Part I.  To delete the following words and figures:&mdash;</P>
      <P>9 &amp; 10 Geo. V., c. 92, the Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act, 1919, Section 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment in my name is to delete the words relating to the Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act, 1919. In connection with the suggestion of the Minister in dealing with the last amendment, that reconsideration of these various Bills might lead to an immense amount of time being wasted, it is essential that the House should realise what they are doing when they are asked to re-enact Bills.  Under this <Col N="97" /> Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, there are some Bills, I think, which ought to be considered seriously when they are not merely formal Bills.  In regard to the Aliens Restriction Act, 1918, it is proposed to re-enact again Section 1. This Act was passed during the war period and, I presume, was considered necessary at that time.  Section 1 of the Act has been re-enacted ever since. It seems, unless Section 1 is re-enacted, there is no power in the hands of the Minister to regulate the introduction of alien labour of any kind, or undesirable aliens of any kind, and perhaps it is justifiable that this should be re-enacted year by year.  I think a new and more appropriate form of legislation should be introduced for this country.  I put down the amendment with the view to finding out what the policy of the Ministry is with regard to the administration of this Act, and to find out whether it is their intention to introduce permanent legislation applicable to this country as distinct from this mere chance section of the British Act.  I want to learn from the Minister if he will give us information as to how this Act has been administered during the last year, the number of expulsions of undesirable aliens that have been made, the number that have been refused admission to the country, and the number, if any, that have been allowed within the country to live within a prescribed area.  This is the kind of information that ought to be available, and ought to be placed before the Oireachtas before they are asked to re-enact Bills of immense importance to numbers of citizens of other countries, and even to citizens of this country who may not be formally naturalised.</P>
    <P>It was explained, I think, a year or two ago, that there had been some kind of reciprocal arrangement made in regard to admissions to this country of people who were objected to by the British authorities, and refusal on the part of the British authorities to admit people who might have been objected to by the Irish authorities.  It is necessary that we should know what kind of arrangement has, in fact, been made and how it is working, what are the prevalent principles by which the exclusion <Col N="98" /> of aliens from this country is applied.  If a name is submitted by the British authorities, do we take that as sufficient or are we to ask the reasons why a person is objected to being admitted into the country?  This raises a very important question as to the interference, even by arrangement, by the British Foreign Office with the landing into Ireland of what they deem to be undesirable people.  People who may be undesirable to British political affairs may not be undesirable to Irish political affairs.  It is important to know what is the principle under which this Act is being administered in regard to the admission, or refusal of admission, of aliens.  I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some figures in relation to the numbers that have been refused admission or those who have been expelled from the country, and, generally, the reasons for their expulsion, how many have been expelled or refused admission on political grounds, and what were the political grounds which animated the Minister in ordering their expulsion or refusal to admit them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. COMYN Mr. COMYN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COMYN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the observations which have been made by Senator Johnson.  It is highly desirable that in the case of Acts which are put into the Schedule for amendment or repeal the Minister should be ready, as I am sure he is, to give an explanation to any Senator who may require it. Senator Johnson has asked a question which will, perhaps, necessitate some thorough explanation.  He has asked why Section 1 of the Aliens Act, 1919, has been re-enacted year after year and why a thorough and comprehensive statute dealing with aliens has not been passed either in this country or Great Britain.  The answer is rather peculiar.  That section was drafted by Sir John Simon.  It is the most effective machine for its purpose that could possibly be devised, and perhaps that is the reason why draftsmen, year after year, have not interfered with it. I am not opposed to the continuance of this measure, because I do not see any prospect of any measure in substitution for it.  I agree with what Senator Johnson said, namely, that a full record <Col N="99" /> should be kept and be available for Senators as to the transactions, if I might so call them, under this Act&mdash; how many aliens have been excluded during the twelve months, how many have been excluded for political reasons, how many detained, because there is power of detention in that section, and the reason for their detention. I hope that the Minister will be able to give the House as complete an explanation as possible of these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is well that the Seanad should completely understand the meaning of Senator Johnson's amendment.  That amendment proposes to repeal Section 1 of the Aliens Act.  Unless the Expiring Laws Bill comes into force the Aliens Act perishes if Senator Johnson's amendment is carried.  The result of his amendment will be that any alien who likes and any number of aliens may come in and flood the labour market of this country.  It certainly comes rather as a surprise to me that this amendment should be brought forward by one of the best known Labour leaders in this country because a priori I thought, considering the state of unemployment which unfortunately exists here, that the desire would not be cherished by Senator Johnson that aliens from any other country could come in here by the thousand and flood our Labour market.  If the Senator succeeds in carrying his amendment any number of undesirable aliens will be able to enter this country to the detriment of our people.  The Senator has asked upon what principle this Act is administered.  It is administered in this fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got, at the two ports of the Saorstát at which foreign liners call, namely, Cobh and Moville, immigration officers who examine persons who come in and see that they are fit and proper persons to enter the country.  We decide who are fit and proper persons to come in.  If it is shown that a person is likely to become a public charge, is <Col N="100" /> mentally unfit, or is of unsound mind, he is not allowed to enter.  Moreover, if an alien comes here to take up employment, he must get a permit from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and prove to his satisfaction that he is going to take up employment here which there is no citizen of the country suitable or able to perform.  A great number of persons have been refused permission to enter the country because they would be ousting native Irishmen from positions in the country, and, with the present state of the world labour market, I do not think that it would be fair that Irish people should be ousted from the native market by foreigners.  If a person is a criminal, he is also kept out.  Senator Johnson asked me to give him statistics regarding the number of persons who have been kept out of the country during the current year.  I am not in a position at the moment to do so.  If the Senator wishes, however, to have statistics given, it can be done by means either of Parliamentary question or a substantive motion.  I cannot possibly foresee what speeches are going to be made here, or what information is going to be asked for.  The real principle which Senators have got before them, and the one thing which they will have to decide in regard to this amendment is, whether they do or not wish the Irish labour market to be flooded by alien labour.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of the continuation of the Expiring Laws Bill.  The information that the Minister gave as to the working of the Act is very interesting.  He tells us that at Moville and at Cobh vessels are examined for undesirable aliens.  I would like to know from him if there is any examination of aliens coming in through Holyhead or through Liverpool, or of people coming from England generally?

I do not think it is desirable that we should put up any restriction in the way of people coming from England, considering that we send a great many more workmen&mdash; labourers&mdash;into England than they send here.

      <P>The Minister has thoroughly evaded the question I put to him, by trying to direct the attention of the House solely to the position of the undesirable alien or cheap foreign labour.  I am fully aware of the risks run regarding the importation of foreign labour.  I am quite familiar with the number of men whose work could have been done quite well by Irish engineers employed on the Shannon.  I am quite familiar with the fact that a considerable number of men are necessary in the new work of the sugar industry, at Carlow.  But the real question I put to the Minister&mdash;I hope I made it quite clear to him&mdash;was whether or not any regard was paid to political objections?  There are undesirable aliens who are unhealthy, there are diseased, undesirable aliens, undesirable through physical reasons. There are aliens who are considered undesirable by the British Government for political reasons, but who may or may not be undesirable from the point of view of the Saorstát Government.  What I am anxious to know is what is an undesirable alien in the mind of the Saorstát Government? Have the Government a standard of undesirability of their own, or do they merely imitate and take those standards fixed by the British Foreign Office or the British Home Office?  I heard the Minister say a minute ago that some person was promptly removed.  Was that person's undesirability because of his political antecedents?</P>

      <P>I am perfectly satisfied that such a person should be removed.  If it is not indiscreet on my part, I would like to reply to the Minister's rather unfair suggestion of being taken by surprise.  I wish to inform the House that the Minister was not taken by surprise. The position I want to have explained is&mdash;what are the factors that determine the Minister's action in refusing admission to undesirable aliens apart from their physical condition, <Col N="103" /> and apart from their labour activities, or apart from the fact that they may be coming here to take up employment? We have, let us say, a foreign princess coming in here or we have a man posing as a Grand Duke of Russia or a proletarian leader from Russia or a Fascist from Italy.  Has the Minister any standards by which he will refuse admission on political grounds&mdash;has he any standards which differ from the standards of the British Foreign Office or the British Home Office?  Or does the Minister take the implication that such-and-such a person, Johann Schmidt, say, is an undesirable alien in Britain, and therefore, that he may not be allowed into Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no obstacle in the way of a person coming from Holyhead into Dublin, but if such a person were entering Cobh from New York and if he were considered an undesirable alien by the British Government, he would be refused admission to Ireland, because once being in Ireland, he would be able to slip into England by Holyhead.  Is that the position?  I am anxious to know whether the Minister has any standard by which he judges this matter apart from British standards, or is it simply an echo of the British Foreign Office or the British Home Office policy on which he acts? Is that his policy in regard to aliens who are undesirable and are these the reasons why they are undesirable?  The Minister has not given any answer to these questions that I put.  It is perfectly clear to me, and, of course, to the majority of the House, that the effect of the amendment, if it were passed, would be not to leave open, on the 31st December or after the 1st January, the gates to the importation of undesirable aliens who are all anxious to come in and enjoy the handsome wage that is going in this country, but to send the Bill back to the Dáil.  The Dáil would probably have to be called together again and would refuse to accept the Seanad amendment.  That is the real effect of the passing of this amendment if the Houses passes it.  There is only one effective way of getting information from Ministers on the Expiring Laws <Col N="104" /> Bill and that is by putting down amendments such as this.  Consequently, I adopted the only plan that would have the effect of extracting from the Minister any information at all on the matter.  I hope that some day, either now or in the near future, we will get from the Minister for Justice, or some other Minister interested in this problem, a statement of Ministerial policy regarding aliens who are desirable or undesirable from the political point of view, what type of person has been excluded from the country, and what is the reason for the exclusion.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not answered my question.  I want to know who are the people classified as aliens, and whether all people other than those who are Irish-born are classified as aliens.  I want to know whether British subjects are to be classified as Irish, and I further want to know if there is any restriction on the people coming over the border&mdash; any restriction on aliens.  A great number of people come that way, and I do not know whether there is any check put upon them.</P>

      <P>Persons who are members of the British Commonwealth of Nations are not regarded as aliens.  As far as Senator Johnson is concerned, he did mention to me the other day that he was going to bring this matter forward, but he did not leave me under the impression that he wanted statistics of the particular nature that he asks for now.  He mentioned that he wanted statistics with regard to the importation of noxious drugs.  If Senator Johnson wants these particulars that he asks for it is easy to put down a motion, and I am prepared to get all the information possible.  I do not carry statistics of this nature in my head.  The usual course, in order to obtain statistics, is by means of a Parliamentary question in the Dáil, and by means of a motion in the Seanad.  If the Senator puts down a motion I will meet his wishes with the greatest of pleasure.</P>

    <P>I would like the Senator to give me a concrete example of any particular person he has in mind, if he has anybody <Col N="105" /> in his mind, or if he has heard of any case in which he thinks there has been abuse in the administration of this Act.  If he will mention any single concrete case I will have it investigated. Persons are not kept out because of their political views.  Nobody is kept out because he holds political views.  Aliens have been excluded because they had criminal tendencies, and criminal tendencies and political views are perfectly different things.</P>

      <P>Schedule, Part II.  To delete the following words and figures:&mdash;</P>
      <P>No. 9 of 1923; The Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923; the whole Act so far as unrepealed; No. 13 of 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be remembered by those Senators who assisted in the passing of the Act of 1923 that this Act, comprehensive as it seemed to be at the time, was only a temporary measure.  In fact, the extent of its operations were to be confined to fourteen months.  There was a promise that at the end of fourteen months, or at least by March, 1925, there would be a new Bill embodying the best of the schemes proposed and included in the schedule of the 1923 Act.  There were given to the Minister very considerable powers of modification of the Act, and the schemes embodied in the schedule.  Many of these schemes have been, in fact, modified by <Col N="106" /> order of the Ministry of Local Government. I desire to know from the Minister how far he has got in regard to the introduction of a comprehensive scheme bringing this Act up to date.  A Poor Law Commission sat since, and certain recommendations were made by that Commission in regard to the granting of home assistance and in respect to the poor law scheme as a whole.  We hoped that there would have been some indication of Government policy arising from the recommendations of that Commission.  What I am anxious to know is where the Government stands with regard to the report, whether they are on the point of bringing in a Bill to embody all or any of the recommendations of that Commission, and, generally, where we are in regard to the whole question of poor law administration and the modification of the present schemes.  There has been a very considerable amount of dissatisfaction with the schemes that are at present in operation, and with the administration of them.  I am not going into any detail, nor will I ask the House to consider for any time the complaints made.  I think the Minister should give an indication of where he stands in regard to the report, and what he intends to do in the near future in the way of new legislation.</P>

      <P>I wish briefly to endorse the remarks made by Senator Johnson.  I was a member of the Poor Law Commission.  For two weary years we sat and we dived into a whole mass of legislation.  We rather feel that our work is wasted or, to a certain extent, deferred, because these matters were put before us at the time as pressing.  Some of the recommendations that were made&mdash;incidentally I will strike a personal note and say some of the minority recommendations&mdash;were, at least in my opinion, exceedingly valuable.  I would specially refer to the recommendations made in very specific terms, which have never been challenged, with regard to the simplification of some of the exceedingly archaic forms of local government accounts.  I do really press the Minister on this point as we have very little opportunity of raising it except by the <Col N="107" /> rather cumbersome method of putting down a motion.  We have little opportunity of raising matters of administration in regard to which some of us claim to be qualified to speak.  I am glad that Senator Johnson, with his great knowledge of parliamentary methods, has afforded me this opportunity.</P>
      <P>There are, I submit, very pressing problems requiring legislation embodied in the report of the Poor Law Commission, to the preparation of which a large number of people voluntarily gave their time and research.  I hope the Minister will give us an assurance that steps are being taken to embody some of those recommendations in legislation.</P>

As we are talking on this, I hope that in the coming year the Minister will find time to put the Poor Law Commission's Report, or portion of it, at all events, into law. Senator Johnson and others are not satisfied, apparently, with how things are being done.  As Senator Sir John Keane said, a great deal of very valuable time was given voluntarily for over two years by members of the Commission, and it is time that some recognition should be given, at all events, to the outstanding portions of that report, if not the whole of it.  It is with that view alone that I speak, and I ask the Minister if he can at all, to put some portion of it before us before the <Col N="108" /> Expiring Laws (Continuance) Bill comes up next year.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator Comyn, I think his difficulty arises out of not realising that in the schedule here there are a certain number of Acts which will expire at the end of this year, if we do not pass this Bill. We are simply asking for power to extend them for another twelve months. Further consideration, if extension is required, will take place on the Expiring Laws Bill next year.  The Preamble to the 1923 Act is suggestive of the work that requires to be done before a permanent Act could be introduced. Senators and those connected with local administration know that there is a mass of legislation, extending as far back as 1838, which forms the whole legal scheme for the relief of the poor. It is a very complicated business.  The 1923 Act abolished the workhouses and boards of guardians, put the administration of poor relief into the hands of a central body in the country, provided central institutions for the relief of the poor, and provided that persons, without restriction, once they were subjects for poor relief, could be relieved either inside or outside an institution. Since the introduction of that measure both persons administering local government and poor relief and the officials have very great difficulty in knowing where they stand from the point of view of law.  That is fully appreciated in the Department and a considerable amount of work has been done in the Department in connection with it.  In fact, there exists at present the first draft of the proposed legislation which, looking at all the legislation dealing with poor law relief from the beginning of the last century down to the 1923 Act, looking at the 1923 Act, and at that part of the Poor Law Commission's Report which requires legislation to put it into effect, looking at the position in a comprehensive way like that, will codify, consolidate and amend the existing legislation dealing with the whole of the system of poor relief, and will replace all the poor relief legislation which has gone before it.  I quite realise the valuable service given by the members of the Poor Law Commission and the length of time they spent over <Col N="109" /> the matter was an indication of the importance of it and of the wide amount of matter that has had to come up for review.  It is well worth while that we should get a complete, codified and consolidated Act dealing with poor law relief.  As I say, I actually have in the Department the first draft of that proposed legislation.  That will have to be further sifted by passing through the parliamentary draftsman's office, after I have given further consideration to the terms of the first draft.  Without hoping to do too much in the matter of a big piece of legislation like this during the coming year, we are approaching as quickly as I think reasonably can be expected of the Department, and those others concerned, the time when we will pass through the Oireachtas a piece of legislation that will codify and consolidate our whole poor law system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My hope in this matter was that we could get from the Minister a statement, which I do not remember to have been made last year &mdash;perhaps my memory is at fault&mdash;as to the manner of its working, and whether there has been great satisfaction or dissatisfaction.  Nothing I have seen by way of criticism has removed my support of the principle embodied in the Act, but we have seen, time and again, comments and complaints from members of local authorities regarding the manner of its administration and, <Col N="110" /> as it seems to me, a considerable amount of misapprehension has arisen. Whether that misapprehension has arisen from some false direction or a misunderstanding of the import of the Act, I cannot say.  My hope is that the Minister will be able to give some reassurance, and perhaps guidance, to some of the local authorities that have complained.</P>
      <P>My point is this: In the Act there is provision made whereby the local authorities may purchase locally, if they are prepared to take the risk that the goods purchased locally are as good and as cheap, that there is no loss to the local exchequer by the purchase of these goods, in preference to purchase through the combined purchasing scheme, and that only in the case where there is misuse of the powers of the local authority with regard to purchasing is there any liability on that purchasing authority.  There may be some obligation.  I am not sure whether, in the innumerable orders coming from this Department, an obligation is imposed upon the local authority to purchase a certain class of goods only through the combined purchasing scheme, but it is correct, I am sure, that provided the local authority can satisfy the auditor that no loss has been occasioned, either in quality or price, by purchasing locally, there is no liability of a surcharge.  That, I think, is the position.  If it is not the position, it is the position as believed by some local authorities, and it is the position as I read the Act, and as I understood it at the time it was passed.  There are many local authorities who feel that they could purchase locally as cheaply and with greater satisfaction with regard to quality, but they say they are prevented and prohibited by the central authority.  I should like the Minister to explain what is the position in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have there been any orders issued by the Department which, in any circumstances, compelled the local authorities to purchase through the combined purchasing scheme?  Or if they are prepared to take the risk and know they are getting better value, locally, than through the combined purchasing scheme, are they at liberty <Col N="111" /> to do that?  That is a matter of some importance.  I know that a good deal of local dissatisfaction has occurred, partly because of loss of local trade and partly because of the plea that local shopkeepers should be supported. I do not think that that has any weight, or should have, but if the local manufacturer could supply an article of better value than under the combined purchasing scheme, and that no loss, because of price, is occasioned to the local authority, I think it is true that they are entitled to purchase, locally, and I would like that confirmed or contradicted by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COMYN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Johnson that the fact that a statute of this description has to come up as a temporary measure for continuance is one that needs explanation.  There are many provisions in this Act which, at first sight, would seem to be most excellent&mdash;combined purchasing, testing of commodities, conferences&mdash;and I wonder why an Act of this description is not made permanent.  No doubt when it was introduced originally, it was intended to be experimental.  The experiment now has lasted more than three years, from 1925 to 1928.  I feel greatly obliged to Senator Johnson for bringing on this motion, as we had not an opportunity of considering the Act. I looked through the Act, and it seems to me to be a most excellent piece of legislation.  It would be a matter of interest to know why it is only a temporary measure, because in the case of a temporary measure there is that insecurity about its continuance which is very injurious both to the trading public and to the local authorities themselves.  The House ought to get some explanation from the Minister as to whether or not he is going to include in the new comprehensive Act, which I understand he is considering, anything in the nature of a permanent statute dealing with matters of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing that I suggested, up to the present, in regard to legislation in course of preparation, referred to this particular Bill.  It is inevitable that permanent legislation <Col N="112" /> dealing with combined purchasing will be passed.  The reason that this Act is now in the Expiring Laws Bill is that, originally, I think, there was a certain amount of opposition and query as to whether it was advisable to have a central purchasing system.  The Dáil passed the Bill, so far as my recollection goes, for a period of five years, but that period was cut down in the Seaned to three years.  This Act would have expired in June last but it was included in the Expiring Laws Continuance Act of last year.  I think, from what has been said here, everyone realises that the principle of the Bill is quite satisfactory and sound.  I did make a statement in the Dáil on the Expiring Laws Bill last year, dealing with that particular matter, and explaining, that although a certain amount of combined purchasing was going on from 1922, the Act had really been less than three years in practical operation.  The class of work that required to be done in connection with it, was of such a kind that we have not experience over a sufficient length at the present moment to definitely come to conclusions as to the particular principle that ought to be enshrined in permanent legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson referred to the question as to whether local bodies can purchase other than through official contractors. If an article of equivalent value can, to the Auditor's satisfaction, be purchased, locally, there is nothing to compel the local body to purchase from the official contractor.  I do not know whether my recollection is right in this particular matter; but, I think, Senator Johnson was responsible for the introduction of that provision in the Act himself.  It has been very faithfully acted on in the administration of the Act.  But I do suggest that it has a very serious weakness and that when we come to pass permanent legislation it should not permit of something that is going on at the present moment.  I will just deal with that particular point.  Contracts are entered into for a period of six months, but the contractors have no idea whether they are going to get an order for a single article, or a single yard of stuff, yet they are asked to quote a price in that <Col N="113" /> particular position.  A very considerable amount of thought has been given to the matter as to whether we could not so arrange things that an estimate would be given, at any rate, of the approximate amount of any particular class of article or material required over the period that the contract should run.  If contractors knew that they had a prospect of getting an order for a fair bulk, I feel that they would be able to quote prices materially lower than at present.  At present, because a contractor does not know what he might expect, he quotes a price not as low as he could quote if he knew the amount of the order.  That leads on the part of purchases made locally, to conditions like these: there is a certain mental hospital and the Local Government price for a certain class of tweed is 4/11d. per yard.  That can be purchased locally at 4/10d.  A certain class of black cashmere is quoted at 9½d. per yard but it can be purchased locally at the same price.  A certain class of sheeting is quoted at 1/7d. per yard it can be purchased locally at 1/7d.</P>
    <P>A certain class of diaper is quoted at 2/6¼ and it is purchased locally at 2/6. In discussions with those who have been administering the Act, I find that, at any rate in certain areas, there is a tendency for the local body, in conjunction with local traders, to take the official list and make local purchases, either at the same prices or at a farthing a yard or a penny an article below them, and I think that the local bodies are not getting good service in that way.  In the beginning of last year, having given certain thought to the question as to whether we could not purchase in bulk such articles as tars, bitumens and matters of that kind which were required in very large quantities, I caused arrangements to be made by which an estimate of the amount required by county surveyors during the current year would be made. In looking for tenders for these materials we gave that estimate, and to a very large extent, as a result of that, we succeeded in getting one contractor to supply a particular class of stuff at a price lower than the others by means of an ordinary competitive tender, a number of county surveyors <Col N="114" /> being brought in to advise on the whole matter, as well as the Advisory Board which acts in connection with the operation of this Act.  We succeeded in getting what was, I believe, a reduction of 11.5 per cent. on the cost in that way.  In all, in connection with the different classes of these materials, there were 3,722,007 gallons purchased, and the total cost was £132,911.  On the prices for the previous year that was a saving of £15,374, or 11.5 per cent.  That required a considerable amount of organisation and co-operation on the part of county surveyors, but I think it was an effort in the right direction, and that it promises, if we could extend it to other matters, to give very much greater economies to local bodies in their purchases.</P>
    <P>Recently I had a deputation from some of the woollen manufacturers, and as a result of further consideration of the question as to whether we ought not to contract by bulk as against by time, I have communicated with local bodies with regard to ninety-eight articles under the headings of linens, woollens, suits, caps, shawls, blankets, and matters of that kind, and I have asked them to give, for the purpose of the contracts we will be entering into for the months from April to September, estimates of their requirements so that approximate quantities may be quoted when we are looking for tenders.  We hope in that way to lead up to a position whereby local bodies will organise their requirements so that contractors will know for a definite half year the approximate amount of materials that will be purchased.  I hope that that will convenience contractors very much, and particularly convenience local manufacturers of woollens and such things, as well as providing additional economies for local bodies.  In this matter I feel that we should, so to speak, take our sticks one by one and break them.  We have a certain amount of experience, and the local bodies had a certain amount of experience in connection with the purchasing of tars last year.  I hope that over a wider range of matters they will have a certain amount of experience this year in organising their purchases. I feel that if we were able to develop <Col N="115" /> along that line we would cut out local buying, with very great profit, and we would be able to assist contractors materially.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with which we are carrying out additional experiments at present, and that is in endeavouring to make more use of a particular class of coal from Castlecomer.  Certain institutions are making further trials, under suitable conditions, of a class of coal that has been fully examined by our Combined Purchasing Department and rather satisfactorily reported upon.  The whole position has been under review. It is not easy to move quickly in the matter, but I think that another couple of years' working will put us into such a position that we could see upon what lines permanent legislation should be introduced, and I would submit to the Seanad that, as the present Act is giving a certain amount of satisfaction&mdash; there is a certain amount of dissatisfaction also&mdash;it would be advisable to have another couple of years' experience before introducing permanent legislation.  In the meantime, as far as any information with regard to the progress of the matter is concerned, the report for the years 1922 to 1925 which was issued last year, and the report of the Local Government Department for the year 1926-27, which was issued this year, both contain information as to the progress made under combined purchasing.  I do not think that it would be easy to arrange to give an annual report on combined purchasing on a Bill like this when we include it in our annual report.  I anticipate that it will be possible to issue our annual report for the year ending March, 1928, before next March, and in so far as formal reports go, I do not think we can move much more quickly than that.  Nevertheless, the fact remains that in so far as the operation of the Oireachtas is concerned, any information or any statistics that we have in the meantime may be obtained, either by correspondence or in any other way that Senators wish.  I appreciate the fact that Senator Johnson does not mean to drop the Act, and I think that no one really does.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister, in connection with the working of the National Health Insurance Act, whether there is any arrangement with the English authorities to deal with a case of an Irishman who is insured in England, where he worked for ten years, and who afterwards became disabled and was sent home.  Is the Minister aware that when that man was twelve months home the National Health Insurance Society in <Col N="117" /> England refused to pay any further benefit?  There is no law dealing with the matter at present, but I would like to know if the Minister would consider it between this and the next time the National Health Insurance Bill is introduced. The case I have mentioned came to my knowledge this morning. The man was working for some municipal authority in England and was insured there.  He was disabled, but his family, some of whom are unemployed, finding that he was stranded in England, brought him home.  He is home twelve months now, and the Municipal National Health Society in England refuses to pay him any longer.  I hope the Minister will give the matter consideration.</P>

      <P>The question I am asked is: will I give consideration to bringing in legislation to control a National Health Insurance Society in Great Britain?  I could not undertake to do that, but I will undertake to give consideration to any difficulties that any Senator brings to my notice.  In fairness, I would like to have these difficulties in writing.</P>

      <P>If the Senator will bring up a concrete case it might be dealt with, because I am perfectly certain that there are cases of that description that occasion great hardship.</P>
