      <P>With reference to the Public Bills, I should like to say for the information of the House that it would be possible within our Standing Orders to take the Report Stage of these Bills to-morrow.  but I understand, with reference to two of these Bills, that the Government would require further time for consideration of them, with the possible view of amendments being inserted here to-day.  In any case they would prefer if the Report Stage was not taken to-morrow. I think possibly that that will also meet the convenience of the Senators interested in the Bills.  The result would be that, presumably, they would come on next week.  As I am at present advised, I see no prospect of any additional Bills between now and next Wednesday, and accordingly I propose at the end of to-day's sitting to adjourn the House until this day fortnight.  On this day fortnight, and on the following day, I hope we will be able to get through the remaining stages of these Bills.  That will give ample time to the Government and to the Senators interested to be ready with any further amendments that they may wish to suggest for the Report Stage.</P>

    <Title>PUBLIC BUSINESS. - LOCAL GOVERNMENT (RATES ON SMALL DWELLINGS) BILL, 1928&mdash;COMMITTEE STAGE.</Title>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="406" /> SECTION 1.</P>
    <P>(1)  In this Act &mdash;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;rating authority&rdquo; means the council of a county, a county or other borough, or an urban district;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;small dwelling&rdquo; means a hereditament or tenement separately valued under the Valuation Acts whereof the valuation under those Acts does not exceed six pounds and the whole or any part of which is actually used or is adapted for use as a dwelling, and also includes any other hereditament or tenement which by virtue of any other provision of this Act is for the time being a small dwelling for the purposes of this Act;</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; means, as the case may require, either the person for the time being receiving (whether on his own account or as agent or trustee for another) the rack-rent of the small dwelling in relation to which the word is used or the person who would for the time being so receive such rack-rent if such small dwelling were let at a rack-rent;</P>
    <P>the word &ldquo;rack-rent&rdquo; means rent which is not less than two-thirds of the valuation under the Valuation Acts of the property out of which the rent arises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendments:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 1, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;whole&rdquo; in line 23 to insert the words &ldquo;of which is used.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 1, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 23 the words &ldquo;actually used or is.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two amendments may be taken together.  The Bill applies to any dwelling the valuation of which does not exceed £6 and &ldquo;the whole or any part of which is actually used or is adapted for use as a dwelling.&rdquo;  The effect of the amendments is to take out <Col N="407" /> the words &ldquo;actually used.&rdquo;  As I see it, a stable or warehouse may be actually used as a dwelling, and it may be adapted by putting in a washhand-stand and other appropriate furniture to bring it under the Bill.  That cannot be the intention, and I think the amendments are necessary to safeguard any action of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the sub-section is more satisfactory as it is.  If the amendment that Senator Sir John Keane introduces is accepted, I do not know in the first place if it meets his point, and in the second place I do not think it is advisable to do so, because the question will arise: If you have a stable with an upstairs, and that is adapted as a dwelling, whether you are going to split up the valuation of the ground floor of the house from the top floor, and what additions to the furniture besides a wash-basin and one or two minor things bring it within the scope of the word &ldquo;dwelling.&rdquo;  If the amendment is accepted the clause will still include &ldquo;or any part of which is adapted for use as a dwelling.&rdquo;  Having those words in, I do not think any possible interpretation is going to meet the Senator's difficulty.  The idea of the clause is that any place, the whole or part of which is actually used as a dwelling, or the whole or any part of which is adapted for use as a dwelling, will be regarded as a small dwelling. I do not know that we could be simpler or clearer in that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking at it from the layman's point of view.  I want to prevent a bed being put into a stable so that it might be said that it was a dwelling and came within the Act.  I am quite satisfied that a place suitable as a dwelling, or made suitable as a dwelling, would come within the Act, but the adaptation is a question of fact which can be argued out in court if necessary.  I do not think that any Judge would hold that the mere insertion of a bed would in itself be adaptation.  As I read it the insertion of a bed in a room or stable would bring such room or stable within the Bill.  I think it is in the interests of better housing that some words of the kind I suggest should be inserted.</P>

      <P>The effect of these amendments is to exclude personal liability of the agent. The point is quite simple.  At present the agent is personally liable for the liabilities of his principal.  I cannot say that that is altogether new, but it is a very important principle, and one that has been hitherto safeguarded.  It now emerges without any restrictions.  The Minister told the Seanad last week that he claims the precedent under the Act of 1878.  My information is that under that Act the agent was not under any financial liability; he was merely a person on whom notices could be served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my recollection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir J. KEANE Sir J. KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir J. KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>When a notice was served on him that was good notice, as far as that went.  But if, having received that notice, he failed to carry out what was required in such notice under the Public Health Act, personally <Col N="410" /> he was not responsible for the tort.  The principal alone was liable.  That seems to be only elementary justice.  Under this Bill the agent can be sued <i>in persona</i>, and can be distrained upon under whatever power the law gives for the failure of his principal to collect the rates.  I think that a most dangerous principle, and one which we should resist.  If extended, to my mind it would strike a very serious blow at the whole status of agents, the contractual liability of agents and landlords, and create uneasiness in all commercial institutions of a most far-reaching character. It would be dangerous for agents under this Bill to become personally liable for the liabilities of principals. I do not think we should close the door by having dangerous innovations of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously it would be necessary where you are dealing with a dwelling-house or house property of any kind that you should provide for cases, if I might so call them, of absentee landlords.  They are represented by the agent, and therefore it is quite right that, for the purpose of serving notices, the agent should be placed in the position of his principal. That is done under the Public Health Act of 1878, if I recollect aright.  This goes further, and not only makes the person responsible who received the notice, but also makes him personally responsible for the default of the owner.  That, I think, is a new principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the agent under the description given in the Public Health Act of 1878 is personally liable in cases where expense is incurred in default of certain acts being carried out.  That is, he is personally and financially liable.  The desirability of keeping the statutes uniform is one reason for including this here.  There is the point that the agent as collector of moneys has full control over them, that he handles them for the owner.  If the owner does not want to break the law, it is convenient that the agent who handles his money should pay the rates.  If he does want to break the law and withhold the rates I do not think we should facilitate him in the matter. <Col N="411" /> I would plead very much that while you have an agent acting for the owner and coming within the terms of owner from the point of view of the Public Health Acts, collecting rents as now under this Act he will collect the rates, it is not imposing any hardship or injustice on him if we should require by statute such people to hand over the rates to the rating authority.  If we do not accept that, then we get into a great difficulty in finding out who the owner is, whether he is an absentee or a local man, if the agent declines to co-operate in the matter and acts as a bad contact in respect of houses for which he is acting as agent.  I submit there is no hardship or injustice entailed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHOIRLEACH CATHOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be well to put in the words &ldquo;authorised agent,&rdquo; because anyone may be an agent or profess himself an authority for another and really have no authority. It would be very hard in that case for the principal to be made liable. If you put in those words it would be no injustice to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a matter that requires to be carefully considered by the Minister.  I am not quite sure that the law is as clear as he states.  If the agent is simply collecting rates, I think it is quite reasonable that he should hand them over to the proper authority.  If he fails or is unable to collect the rents from the tenants, as I understand the Bill, he is liable himself.  I am not quite sure that it is a wise thing to provide that. I think it is possible to get what the Minister requires without making a servant liable to pay rates that he has not been able to collect from the tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think your suggestion, sir, about &ldquo;authorised agent&rdquo; would meet the case.  It would be quite possible for any agent to make arrangements with a person on behalf of whom he was collecting rents to pay the rates, so that there would be no liability whatever.  I think if the word &ldquo;authorised&rdquo; were put in it would settle the matter satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that the money an agent collects belongs to him <Col N="412" /> and that he has a right to pay it out? Does not the money belong to the owner?  The agent has no right whatever to pay it out, except under his employer's authority.  The Bill gives the right to an outside body to make the agent personally liable for money over which he has no control.  I hold that the man for whom an agent acts will compel him to pay the money into his banking account.  No agent should be held personally liable for the discharge of his employer's debts.  We know that an employer is practically always made liable for the actions of his agent, but to make an agent liable for the default of his employer is to my mind a new procedure in law, and one which the Minister has not shown us any reason for, except as a matter of convenience.  It seems to me that we would be breaking one of the first principles of ordinary law by doing that. We should not inflict any such liability on an agent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difficulty about where the agent got the money, because this Bill would be his protection and authority for paying. The case is different where, through no fault of his own, he did not get the rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases where the agent is not getting the rent, I propose to meet the Senator's amendment with regard to 10 per cent., so I think that ought to dispose of any particular difficulty about the rates not being received. What I desire is not to complicate the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; for public authorities when dealing with their general work, and to be quite clear that if we are going to give facilities to property owners to pay their rates &mdash; the facilities of a percentage off &mdash; we are making our machinery simple and effective.  If there is good-will on the part of the owners there can be no objection to the agents paying the rates in the way this would force them to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is obvious that there must be some provision made to meet the case of an absentee owner, because otherwise you would never discover him.  Do you not <Col N="413" /> think that you want the words &ldquo;the authorised agent&rdquo;?  &ldquo;Agent&rdquo; is a very ambiguous term.  A man might be made an agent to collect rents and might disappear the next day, but if he is an authorised agent there would be some protection, as he has to give the owner some security.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to consider the effect of the word &ldquo;authorised.&rdquo;&ldquo;Agent&rdquo; as it stands here has stood the test of legal procedure for a number of years, and any necessary interpretation of it I am sure has taken place in the courts.  For that reason I would not like to tamper with the description without careful consideration of what might be implied by the introduction of the word &ldquo;authorised.&rdquo; If it is accepted at all, in the case of an absentee landlord, that the agent ought to be legally liable for the discharge of this work, I think we will have to extend it further, because, if the agent comes in between the public body and a landlord or a number of landlords, and if he is unwilling to cooperate in the disclosure of whom the landlords of these properties are, the local authority is put into a difficulty that the Legislature, at any rate, ought not to stand for, when it can get a simple and really not unjust way of solving it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have a clear definition.  On the suggestion of including &ldquo;authorised,&rdquo; I would like to have a clearer definition.  Supposing I am a landlord and appoint an agent, and authorise him to collect rents; if he acts in an irregular capacity, and an officer of the local authority came along, he might produce my letter to show he was my authorised agent.  But my authorisation was only in so far as the collection of rents was concerned. If I gave him a Power of Attorney for that purpose, and if he were to look after the sanitary arrangements and other matters, he is my duly authorised agent.  I suggest that &ldquo;authorised&rdquo;<Col N="414" /> would mean an agent authorised by Power of Attorney, which would be a very good term to use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we will have to deal with this from the point of its interpretation in the courts &mdash; its capacity to hold water.  I would like to deal with one point first, about the principle of this proposal.  The Minister claims that the Act of 1878 is on all fours with this, as far as agents are concerned.  That is not accepted by the people whose advice I have had. This, I believe, also cannot be denied: There is no single case known in Ireland or England where, under the Act of 1878, the agent has been made personally responsible for the torts of his principal under the Public Health Act. I would like to know if the Minister knows of any such case.  I know that that is not a complete answer, but surely it would be likely that within the period of forty or fifty years some Act to reinforce the Minister's argument would have taken place.  Furthermore &mdash; and this is a very different matter &mdash; assuming that his argument is correct, under the Act of 1878 there is a distinct and direct liability for doing certain things placed on a person.  This is quite different.  The rates are collected by the agent, but they are not necessarily all collected; some are admittedly irrecoverable, and it is now proposed that the agent would himself have to pay out for moneys which he has never received at all.  Admittedly the principal is responsible for these moneys, but he may have no funds from which to meet them.  All agents do not hold ample, or even slender, balances on behalf of their principals; there may be no money to discharge these liabilities, and the agent may have to pay it out of his own pocket. That surely is not just, even if it may be a rough and ready way of getting in these rates with the least inconvenience to the local authorities.  I think this discussion has shown us as rather inclined to visualise the agent as a man of substance, as a properly equipped person with an office and an address; but if we carry our recollections down the country we know that collectors of rates are changed.  One small man may be acting to-day, and <Col N="415" /> without any notice another man is there to-morrow.  They are not men of mark, and who they are the landlord sometimes does not know.  Some rents are collected on sub-tenancies and are payable to tenants of mine, and it is not even known to me who the subtenants are.  How is the local authority going to ascertain who is the agent, especially in the case of small dwellings? These rents are collected by a small man.  Who is going to ask him for an authorisation?  There should be something more than is provided in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider, between this and the Report Stage, whether this could not be met by an amendment in some other part of the Bill by which the agent would not be liable personally where he did not actually receive the rates?  That would meet the case as far as I am concerned.</P>

      <P>I will consider whether we could not work it like this &mdash; that where the rates were not paid in respect of a particular property the rents of that property could be garnisheed through the agent in respect of the rates until such time as the demand in respect of the rates was satisfied.  While helping the agent to carry out a certain transaction, that would not be invading his private purse in respect of his employer's liabilities.

      <P>Section 1, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 33-4 the words &ldquo;two-thirds of.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think the effect of this amendment would be in any way to prejudice the intentions of the Minister.  The object is really to make a person on whom the rate is made a responsible person, to avoid having to collect rates in small sums from people who cannot pay half-yearly.  The rate is to be made in future upon the person who receives the rack-rent.  The person who receives the rack-rent is a man who would possibly have a number of tenants, a man of mark, with some organisation for collecting.  This turns on what is a rack-rent, and that is defined as not being less than two-thirds of the valuation. That is undoubtedly low.  It will bring in a certain number of ground landlords, whereas the occupiers are men of ample mark, men with shops doing a substantial trade, who can well afford to pay, and about whose domicile there is no doubt.  But owing to the definition of a rack-rent the obligation will be taken off them.  Since 1878 rents are unduly increased, and this definition of 1878 is no longer applicable to the case.  I suggest that it would not in any way limit or prejudice the proper working of the Bill if the rack-rent were defined as not less than the whole valuation.  Frequently when one lets a small house the rent one gets is about the same as the valuation.  Where the landlord perhaps built the house, repairs it and keeps it in order for a number of years and hands it over, the market gives him a rent at least equal to the valuation; the tenant is a substantial leaseholder, and in that case it is unreasonable to ask the owner to collect the rates.</P>

It would simply bring a large number of these smaller dwellings from under the operation of the Bill.  One of its effects would be, I am informed, to create a serious difficulty for local authorities in establishing who the owner would be, so that I am very strongly of opinion that this amendment ought not to be accepted, and that the definition of &ldquo;rack-rent&rdquo; as we have it all along should be allowed to stand.</P>

      <P>I am not going to be controversial on this matter, because the Minister practically said that it was his intention that there should be something that amounts to an appointed date on which the owner would be deemed to have official knowledge of the rate.  As the Bill now stands some general phraseology like &ldquo;after the making of such rate&rdquo; is used.  What that means is not defined in the Bill and I do not think it is defined in any Act.  When the rate is definitely made and fixed, the landlord has power to adjust his rents. There should be no doubt as to when that period actually does arrive, and, of course, the obvious time is when the demand note has been received.  I saw only to-day in the papers that in the case of Monaghan, Senator Toal referred to the rate which was recently made, which shows that it is as late as May sometimes before the rate is struck or made.  But that in itself gives no official information to the owner. Unless he happens to send around to the local authority, he knows nothing about what the rate is.  He sees it in the paper, but, of course, owners or agents cannot act on that sort of information. In due course, an individual demand note in respect of each separate rating will issue, and that is the time when the owner will begin to function under the Bill.  This is only to make that point clear, because these things are liable to be carried into the courts, and one wants to have the law perfectly clear in the event of any dispute.</P>

      <P>That is, I think, almost consequential. The Minister demurs to that.  It is only making quite clear the date from which the rent can be increased. At present the rent can be increased twelve months after the making of such rates, but my objection lies to the incorporation of the term &ldquo;the making of such rate&rdquo; as being unnecessarily vague.  I propose to substitute for that twelve months &ldquo;particulars of the rate in respect of each separate valuation have been supplied to the owner.&rdquo; Then when he gets his demand note he is authorised to increase the rent.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. HOOPER Mr. HOOPER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This amendment is intended to meet the case put forward at the last meeting, and again to-day, by Senator Sir John Keane in reference to the difficulty of the landlord who finds it impossible to adjust his rent immediately after the rate has been struck, and who would have a further <Col N="421" /> difficulty owing to the variation of the time at which the demand notes might be received.  Obviously, as the section now stands, it would be impossible for him to adjust the rent immediately after the rate is struck.  On the other hand, the Senator told us last week that sometimes it runs up to the end of June or the beginning of July before the demand notes are received. This amendment proposes to fix an appointed date.  It fixes a date a month after the striking of the rate as the time from which the adjustment of the rent shall be made.</P>
      <P>I think that would have many advantages. It would give the owner an opportunity of learning what the rate was and of making his calculations for the adjustment of the rent.  It would also give notice to the tenant that at the end of a month from the striking of the rate he would be obliged to pay a greater or lesser rent according to whether the rates had gone up or had fallen.  Both sides would know exactly where they were.  Furthermore, it would give uniformity.  Instead of the owner having to wait until he received the demand note, which would be within a couple of weeks after the striking of the rate, or it may be, as Senator Sir John Keane said, two months after, this would give uniformity, and uniformity not only to the individual owner and the individual tenant, but uniformity with respect to all the holdings in a rating area.  The owner would benefit by that, because as things stand in the Bill at present it would be harsh if he were to receive demand notes on different dates in respect of different holdings in the same rating area.  Under the amendment I propose he would be quite independent of the demand note; he would know at once when the rate was struck that a month later he would be entitled to increase his rent on all the holdings within the rating area, and he would have plenty of time to make the adjustment.  For that reason, I think that this is a more satisfactory way of dealing with the problem than that which Senator Sir John Keane has suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are both actuated by a desire to get the right solution, that there is nothing <Col N="422" /> controversial about this at all.  But I do not think that Senator Hooper's amendment is the right one.  This again arises when there has been a division of the valuation.  You might say that the owner ought to know all that goes on.  The valuation may be revised and a new valuation may be in operation for the coming year.  The owner will not know, and will proceed to adjust his rents on the figure that he has read in the papers.  How is he to get knowledge of the striking of the rates?  You cannot believe these things through hearsay or gossip.  The striking of the rate is a formal act within the walls of the county council undoubtedly, but you cannot regard that fact as an official notice.  There are four or five hundred owners in the county, and you must give formal notice to each owner that the rate has been struck and is of such an amount.  Until that information is conveyed to him he cannot proceed to work, or if he does proceed he will do so at his own peril and he may make mistakes and may actually demand illegal increases.  The valuation might be reduced or increased.  To my mind this is not a clear and straightforward way.  The machinery is all there; the demand note is sent out, and the rates are never payable until the demand note is received, and that is full formal notice of the owner's liability. The other way is lax and not exact.</P>

      <P>Would it not be better to delete the word &ldquo;next&rdquo; and to substitute the words &ldquo;commencing on the expiration of one month from the delivery of the particulars&rdquo;?

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very desirable to have a definite date, but I would much sooner have the suggestion of one month, such as is suggested in Senator Hooper's amendment, if necessary putting in a safeguard with regard to the non-reception of the demand note.  But if we leave it entirely open to the reception of the demand <Col N="423" /> note we would have different dates all over the whole rating area and in respect of different people under a particular landlord, whereas if we introduce the idea of a definite month, or whatever the period would be, after the making of the rate, with a safeguard with regard to the demand note, we have something to speed up the local authorities and make them toe the line. Perhaps in some cases there has been a delay in making the rate, and perhaps in the issue of the demand note, but we want to get away from that, and we can get away from that by proper administrative action.  So that if the Senator would agree to my considering the acceptance of Senator Hooper's amendment, with a safeguard in respect of the non-receipt of the demand note, I think that that would be the best.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The owner of any hereditament or tenement to which this Act applies (who is not at the same time the actual occupier of such hereditament or tenement) who being so rated pays the amount due by him in respect of the rate before the expiration of half the period in respect of which the rate is made (or, if the rate is payable by instalments, within half the period in respect of which the instalment is payable) shall be granted by the rating authority an allowance equal to ten per cent. of the amount of the rate so payable by him.&rdquo;</P>

      <Col N="424" /> The Minister has stated that the Government are prepared to accept that amendment, for which one is naturally grateful.  I would ask the House not to mix up this allowance with any question of irrecoverable arrears.  The Minister let slip a remark earlier in the proceedings which suggested that this remission for the collection of rates might also be held in a way to recoup for irrecoverable arrears.  The two things are quite separate, and when arguing the section later on I will deal with that again.</P>

It is a very substantial <Col N="425" /> allowance, and we ought to be given a considerable amount of accommodation in the matter.  In so far as poor rates are concerned, they are paid in two moieties, but urban rates are paid in one payment, and urban rates will be the rates that will be particularly affected by the operation of this Bill. I think we are not seeking too much in asking that for the return of 10 per cent. off the rates the owners of this particular class of property who are getting this rebate would pay their rates, say two months after the making of the rate, and I would urge the Senator to meet me in the matter without haggle, as I mean to meet him without haggle on the 10 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be some Senators with personal experience of the onus and responsibility that will be thrown on landlords by the privilege here referred to.  The rent on most of these small houses ranges from 1s. 6d. to 2s. a week.  Taking the rents over a period of say five years, landlords are not able to collect more than 20 or 25 per cent. of them.  The very poorest people live in these small houses.  They live, not merely from day to day, but, one might say, from meal to meal.  If the landlord fails to collect one week's rent these people are not able to pay it afterwards.  It has to be written off. The landlord, therefore, will never be able to collect the rates from these people.  That being so, the burden will have to be distributed over the people who can and do pay their rates.  That will mean that, in the following year, because of the fact that these poor people are not able to pay the rates, an extra rate will have to be struck and collected from the people who can pay it.  That will be putting a certain burden on the local authority.  It is true, of course, that the landlord will have power to eject the tenant who is not able to pay, but you must remember the new tenant coming into that type of house will be of about the same earning capacity as the one who has been evicted.  With all the powers that local authorities have at present for the collection of rates, they find it impossible to get the rates from this class of poor people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill the landlord is offered a concession of 10 per cent. if <Col N="426" /> the rates on these houses are paid by him on a certain date.  I suggest that he will lose more than that.  I have in mind the case of a landlord who has about 30 houses in a certain small town in the country.  The houses are rated at about 30/- each.  The rent on these houses amounts to about 1/7 or 1/8 a week.  The local rate is about 15/- in the £.  As the landlord will be obliged under this Bill to include the rates in the rent, that will mean, roughly, an extra fivepence a week from these people &mdash; increasing the rent from 1/8 to 2/1 a week.  The landlord knows that he will never get a penny of that, and that this concession of 10 per cent. is not going to recoup him if you make him responsible for the payment of the rates on these houses.</P>
    <P>By putting an extra rate on these people what will occur is this: they will drop a week in making their payments. They will pay for three or four weeks and drop paying for one week.  When they do that it will mean that the extra rent will have been wiped out.  That is the sort of attraction that is offered to the landlord to pay the rates on a stated date.  Any advantage that there might be under this arrangement is wiped out, as far as the landlord is concerned, if they drop one week in the making of their weekly payments.  In dealing with these people the landlord is really powerless, because the only alternative he has is to eject them, and for the reasons that I have just indicated that course of action is not calculated to better the position as far as he is concerned.  I think, in view of the generous attitude of landlords in taking this burden upon themselves for the purpose of facilitating both the local authorities and the Government, that the Minister should also be more generous in his attitude towards them.</P>

      <P>The difficulty that we have in discussing this is, that we have not the Minister's amendment before us.  We are only discussing what the Government proposes to do.  It would, I think, be meeting us fairly to act as the Minister has proposed.  Under the law at present the rate is payable in two moieties.  The first instalment is payable between April and September, and the mean date would be somewhere <Col N="427" /> about May.  The second moiety is payable between October and the following March, and the mean date would be somewhere about November or December.  The landlord would be prepared to get that and suffer the loss of his commission.  The proposal here is that if he does not do so the whole thing is ante-dated and the moiety system is swept away.  Therefore, the whole rate would become payable in May.  The rates are not recovered annually, but half-yearly.  The weekly rates are recovered in small sums over the whole period, and the full payment in respect of them is not discharged until the end of the year.  Under this Bill it will mean in very many cases that the owner will have to find in advance a very big sum of money if he is to pay the full rates in one payment. If he has to pay in advance he will have to borrow the amount of money required. That is not by any means a fantastic case to put forward.  Many of these owners are very hard up.  In the case of men who own ten or fifteen houses they have put their life's savings into them.  Therefore, in these cases the owners will have to borrow the money in order to pay in advance so as to secure the benefits under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I think that the date of payment should be left as it is, and that the ten per cent. should be given to the landlord for the additional trouble as well as odium that he is bound to incur by having to press for the payment of these rates.  The fact that he will have to do so will relieve the local authority of the otherwise unpopular action that it would have to take.  In many cases the owner collects himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an agent is paid for collecting, of course, he will naturally want his commission on the extra receipts. No one, I am sure, will expect that an agent, collecting on the basis of a 5 or 7½ per cent. commission, is going to do this work of the rate collectors for nothing.  When he makes out his bill for commission at the end of the year, he will naturally include the charge for collecting the rates.  This new arrangement will mean more work for the agent.  The rates will be collected by <Col N="428" /> him weekly, just as insurance premiums are collected.  In practice, I think it will be found that the whole of the ten per cent. will have gone in paying commission to the agent.  I submit that the amendment as drafted is a fair one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand, the present position is that the rate-collector gets paid his poundage on the full amount of his warrant even though all the money is not collected.  That occurs, I think, at present even in cases where arrears have to be carried forward from year to year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. TOAL</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that has been raised by Senator Bennett is really an important one, and I do not think it is made clear under this Bill what the intention is.  The rate-collector gets a warrant to collect a certain amount of money, and I think he is entitled to his poundage fees on that.  According to the amendment, he would collect 10 per cent. less than the demand made on an individual owner.  If he was paid the full amount of poundage on his warrant and he was a poor man, there would be an encouragement to him, I think, under this amendment not to collect early.  The county council with which I am connected has made an arrangement with the rate-collectors under which it allows them a certain percentage on all money lodged within a certain period after the rate has been struck.  That is an encouragement to rate-collectors to collect the rates as promptly as possible and make their lodgments at once.  I think that under this amendment there will not be any such encouragement for them to collect early.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, as the Minister has stated, that it is not desirable to insist upon the ten per cent. on the full rate.  As has been pointed out, the first instalment of the rate is due on the 1st April.  Since the old grand jury days, however, the impression has gone abroad amongst the ratepayers in the country that they are not liable for the payment of this instalment until July. That was the month in which in the old days the grand jury used to meet.  It is the law, of course, that the rate should be paid on the 1st April and on the 1st October, but it is very hard to collect on these dates.  I do not think the amendment will improve the present position.  I believe the effect of it would be to encourage rate collectors not to press for the rates.  Even by allowing this ten per cent., it would <Col N="430" /> be very hard on the majority of ratepayers if they were to be called on to pay their rates on the 1st April and on the 1st October.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the position to be this, that the Minister is prepared to accept the principle of the 10 per cent. allowance and to bring in an amendment on the Report Stage dealing with that.  My opinion is that we cannot get very much further on this until we see the amendment the <Col N="431" /> Minister is prepared to introduce.  I would urge that the Minister, in drafting his amendment, should keep to the system of having the rates paid in two moieties, and further, that the amendment should provide that the 10 per cent. allowance would only be applicable if there was a prompt payment made, that is, a payment made within some reasonable time after the rate became actually due.  I do not think that this matter should be considered on the assumption that it is only wealthy landlords who own these small dwellings.  I do not think that is the case, because I believe that really wealthy men have got out of that class of property rather quickly.  Its management is rather troublesome at times.</P>
      <P>I suggest that, when this Bill becomes law, it may prove extremely difficult for many owners to borrow the money they will require to make payments of the rates in advance so as to secure the 10 per cent. allowance.  In some cases it is possible that the owner may be a building society.  If the owner is an individual he may not be able to borrow the money he requires so readily on a mortgage on the property.  The lenders will not be inclined to give him the money he requires even on a mortgage because if anything should happen so that the property was left on their hands they would have to pay the rates themselves.</P>
      <P>I suggest, as regards the payment of the rates in the first period, that people, animated by the best intentions to carry out the provisions of the Act and anxious to get for themselves the 10 per cent. allowance, will not be able to make these payments in advance because of the fact that they will not be able to borrow the money they require for the purpose.  I think the object that ought to be aimed at is to get prompt payment of the rates when they become due.  The local authorities reckon on getting the rates paid in two moieties.  If they get a prompt payment it will be a gain to them.  I assume the 10 per cent. is given as a recognition of the loss the owner will have to suffer.</P>

      <P>The Minister, <Col N="432" /> in considering this amendment, should weigh its effect on the local rates.  This allowance would amount to a very large percentage.  Everyone recognises that the local rates are sorely taxed and overburdened at present.  By giving this remission of ten per cent. you may very materially affect the position as regards local rates.  This amendment establishes a precedent, and one that I do not think is good for the country at large.  Take, for instance, large bodies like the City Commissioners or the Dublin Corporation.  If they are obliged to make an allowance of ten per cent., or even five per cent., on the amount of the rates leviable in the city, it will amount to a very considerable figure.  The subject is a very delicate one, and should be very carefully considered by the Minister, as well as by those who have to give consideration to the point of view not only of landlords and tenants, but of the rates as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill you are really imposing a new burden on the landlord.  He will have to pay the ten per cent. if the full rate is not collected. Under the Bill, as I mentioned a short time ago, he will have to collect an additional fivepence a week from the tenants of small houses.  As I stated before, the poor people in these small houses will not always be able to pay the rates and rents.  The landlord will have to pay from eight to ten per cent. to his agent for collecting this extra fivepence.  In many cases he will not receive the fivepence himself at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making this allowance of ten per cent. to landlords you are really saving the rate-collecting body anything up to ten per cent. &mdash; that is, if they were to collect the rates on these small houses themselves, a thing which they are not finding it possible to do at present.  If they collected the rates themselves they would have to pay about seven-and-a-half per cent. to the rate collector. Senator Mrs. Wyse Power seems to suggest that the rate-collecting body, or the local body, should ride off without <Col N="433" /> paying any commission at all, and that the landlord, who will really be acting as the rate collector, instead of getting any commission, should be penalised to the extent of ten per cent.  That would create an impossible state of things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with the views expressed by Senator Mrs. Wyse Power.  If the amendment is accepted it will, I think, be setting up a dangerous precedent.  As far as I understand what is proposed, notwithstanding what Senator Kenny has stated, it is this: that in addition to the poundage paid to the rate collectors the person paying the rate will get a rebate of ten per cent. if he pays within a certain period.  That is a dangerous precedent to adopt.  The amount that would be involved under a proposal of that kind would come to a considerable figure in the City of Dublin when it is realised that the rates in the City are paid on a valuation of over £800,000.  I would remind Senators that the ratepayers in the City of Dublin, as regards making prompt payments, are the best in Ireland or in the next country to it.  I think that the Minister, before he gives us his assent to this amendment, ought to consider the question carefully.  We are not going to swallow the statements made by Senator Kenny, who talked of the worries of landlords dropping a week's rent in a period of four weeks or so. Those of us who are acquainted with the position of weekly tenants are well aware that the landlords do not drop one week's rent in every four.  What happens is that if the rent is not paid the unfortunate people are thrown out. There is no use in a Senator putting that sort of stuff before the House. Senator Douglas stated that wealthy people had got out of this type of property. If that be so, then the people who have got possession of it are a good deal worse than the former owners. They are more greedy and grasping than the predecessors.  I think that, as this is a very important matter, it is reasonable to ask that this amendment should be left over for the Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">

      <P>As far as I can see there is every indication of holding this over for the Report Stage.  As to <Col N="434" /> what some Senators have said with regard to this establishing a precedent, might I refer them to the Rating Valuation Act of 1925, which is admittedly a British Act?  Still I think we should have some regard to a certain provision in that Act, as we ourselves are now dealing with an almost identical subject. Under a section of that Act the owners of property who collect the rates on small dwellings, under circumstances somewhat similar to those outlined here, get a reduction of ten per cent.  In fact, my amendment is practically a copy of that section in the British Act.  But lest that might not be regarded as satisfactory, might I refer Senators to the Dublin Corporation Municipal Act of 1890?  Senator Farren is intimate with the affairs of the Dublin Corporation.  Under Section 75 of that Act the Dublin Corporation obtained power to compound &ldquo;with the owners of such premises for the payment of all or any rates leviable on such reduced estimate, the net annual value not being less than two-thirds nor more than four-fifths of the net value.&rdquo; Under that section the principle of giving a concession to the owner who collects the rates is definitely admitted.</P>

      <P>So far as the Dublin Corporation position is concerned the rating question in the City <Col N="435" /> is a very involved matter, and I cannot say at the moment whether that particular Act is in operation.  The Rating Valuation Act of 1925 has been mentioned. In reply to Senators who have asked that I should give very careful consideration to this question of the 10 per cent. allowance, I may say that very careful consideration has already been given to it.  I might mention that the 10 per cent. in the Bill offers comparatively better terms than the English property owner gets under the Rating Valuation Act of 1925.  He is only getting 2½ per cent. as against the 10 per cent. that any prompt payer of rates can get here under the present system.  The decision to give 10 per cent. was taken on the grounds that we wanted to make the Bill as simple and as clear as possible.  We came to that decision, and in doing so felt that we were not going to be unfair either to the rating position or to the property owner.</P>
      <P>I am quite alive to the danger that might arise if there was a demand on behalf of every big ratepayer or on behalf of ratepayers generally &mdash; ratepayers in some counties have been asking for this &mdash; to have rebates made on the prompt payment of rates.  At present I must set my face definitely against any extension of this matter until our rating position is in a more satisfactory position than it is at present. Different circumstances during the last few years have operated to throw the collection of the rates backwards in some counties.  That accounts, I think, to a large extent for the comparatively large amount of irrecoverable rates that have to be dealt with. As far as any fears may be felt on that, I should like to say this: that until the rate-collecting position in the country has had a better opportunity of settling itself down, my attitude would be not to consider any extension of the principle at all.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> New section.  Before Section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The rating authority shall repay to an owner that portion of the rates comprised in any rent which remains irrecoverable after full recourse to legal proceedings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This infringes on the 10 per cent. allowance.  That is for a definite purpose, to repay the trouble and cost of the collection of money they have actually disbursed, their out-of-pocket expenses.  There arises a totally separate matter &mdash; what about the rates that are irrecoverable?  I know the Minister wants the House to apply the principle of rough justice and say 10 per cent. for everything.  I do not think that is fair.  Irrecoverable rates should be treated as a matter totally distinct from the cost of collection.  I ask the House to say that it is not fair or just that the owner should be asked to bear the cost of irrecoverable rates. The amendment asks that the owner should be refunded these irrecoverable rates when he has taken full legal proceedings, so that there would be no question of his not exacting his legal remedy, and going easy, and then coming for a rebate.  I would point out that this is by no means an owner's Bill.  I wish again to emphasise what is going to happen.  For the first time under this Bill an occupier can be evicted for non-payment of rates.  As the law stands at present an occupier can only be distrained, and the sheriff has to allow him his bed and tools and whatever the law allows.  In future he can be evicted, and I am afraid he will be evicted after the landlord has taken full steps without success to recover the rates.  In the circumstances, I think it is only just that the landlord should be refunded the rates by the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this not part and parcel of the other proposition? Do you not think, Senator, that it also should stand over?  I think you should consider carefully that this only entitles the landlord to be rebated after full recourse to legal proceedings, which would probably mean ten times the amount he is going to recover. Full legal proceedings means that he is to exhaust every possible step known <Col N="437" /> to the law.  I can only tell the Senator that the man who does that will have a pretty good bill to pay, and when he has done so, I think he would be left with a white elephant.</P>

The 10 per cent. we propose to allow is 2½ per cent above what the owner is allowed for a similar purpose under the Rating and Valuation Act of 1925 in Great Britain.

That point as to unoccupied premises will only become operative when the whole of the Rent Restrictions Act is repealed, and there is no possibility of that for a long time.  I do not want to be tied up with what the British do, but they give 15 per cent. in cases where the owner voluntarily does the work which he is now being made to do compulsorily under this Bill.</P>

      <P>As the Bill stands, it only applies to weekly or monthly tenants.  Occupiers who pay quarterly or half-yearly will continue to pay the rates as they now pay them.

      <P>I oppose the amendment on the grounds of the practical working of the scheme.  It would mean, apart altogether from the danger Senator Farren speaks about, that the local authorities would have to have knowledge of the conditions under which houses with a valuation under £6 were held, instead of proceeding in a simple way to deal with these dwellings from a systematic and straightforward point of view so that there would be involved no complications of any kind.  On the other hand the work that would fall on the property owners cannot be very great, and if the Senator appreciated the fact that all these people are good pays there is very little difficulty in the matter.  The amendment would open up a whole forest of difficulties for local authorities.  I do not see how they could keep in touch with the conditions under which property of this <Col N="440" /> class was held as between the tenant and the owner.</P>

      <P>Admittedly, these classes of tenants are not bad payers.  That is not the whole story. There is the trouble of readjusting the ledgers, and that would involve a very considerable amount of clerical work. When the Minister speaks of the difficulties of discovery does he realise the difficulty in that respect in the Bill at present?  How does he discover except by the closest process of investigation? He will have to send a question to every owner as to whether he is within the purview of this Bill in respect of the rent he receives.  It is a difficulty as regards the local authority and not the owner.  The Minister must appreciate that before a local authority can issue demand notes they must find out the circumstances of every owner and find out whether he comes under this Bill or not.  I suppose there is a roundabout way by which they can discover &mdash; that is by going to the occupier and saying: &ldquo;How much do you pay?&rdquo; and so forth.  Surely it is far easier to find out whether the tenant is weekly or monthly, quarterly or yearly.  It could be done at the one time.  I do not see the administrative difficulty involved.</P>

Of course it is obvious it was never intended to be included.  Deputy Professor Thrift in the Lower House pointed out that controversy might arise as to whether the text of the Bill and the title were not in conflict.  It is perfectly obvious that it would be improper that thorough drainage should be included, for this reason &mdash; that only one person can gain advantage from thorough drainage, that is, the occupier of the lands.

      <P>The amendment would really be of no help to the county boroughs, because I can conceive of no drainage scheme affecting county boroughs and the neighbouring counties that would come under the £1,000 limit.  If there is a drainage scheme affecting a county borough &mdash; a <Col N="443" /> rural area &mdash; the different interests as between property of one kind and another are so conflicting that I do not think a minor scheme, operated entirely, as this scheme is proposed to be operated, by the county council, should call for the intervention of the Board of Works.  The Senator has an amendment down to bring the Board of Works into the scheme, and I hope to show that it is inadvisable to put a drainage scheme involving a county borough into a minor drainage Bill. That, from our point of view, is entirely unsound, and it would throw responsibilities on the county councils that we do not propose they should shoulder.  If there are any county borough drainage schemes that require to be undertaken, they must be undertaken under some other Act other than under a minor drainage Bill, which is framed particularly to help small agricultural owners.  I hope the Senator will appreciate that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>In further explanation of what I have said, and in view of what the Minister has said, perhaps I might point out to him that a great many of the old county boroughs of this country have attached to them what are known as liberties, which comprise a very considerable area of land that is to all intents and purposes the same as land under the control of county councils.  In addition, these liberties are very frequently used as market gardens, where drainage is often perhaps more desirable than drainage such as is contemplated under this Bill, and it would involve comparatively small expenditure.  I know of three of these districts.  I do not think the money involved in any one of them would exceed even the limit proposed in the Bill, and it is very desirable and necessary that the schemes should be undertaken in these cases.  In fact, they are just the cases with which this Bill, in my opinion, has been introduced to deal, and I do not see any reason why they should not be included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">

      <P>If the proposal were accepted it would mean we would have to introduce corresponding <Col N="444" /> amendments dealing with county boroughs all through the Bill, and that would throw the simplicity of the Bill out of gear.  I think if existing county boroughs desire to be brought in under the Board of Works that such drainage as would be done would be in regard to main rivers.  Our system is that, with the exception of the minor drainage schemes, the Board of Works have complete control of the situation.  It does not seem helpful or reasonable to ask that the county boroughs should get the advantage of the simplicity embodied in this Bill for carrying out small schemes.  The proposal is entirely unacceptable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the bulk of the amendments in my name hinge on this point.  As I said last week, we are asked to think in terms of what £1,000 would work out at prior to the war.  I think the Seanad may take it from me that its value to-day does not represent anything like what it did pre-war.  If the Minister does not accept my amendment I would like to know how he proposes to deal with schemes the cost of which exceed slightly £1,000 &mdash; say the cost of which amounted to £1,200 or £1,300.  It is very desirable these schemes should be carried out.  When you come to consider what you can do for £1,000 to-day it seems to me that it is hardly worth while introducing this Bill.  I made a calculation as to what <Col N="445" /> £1,000 would cover, and I came to the conclusion that it would not cover more than the improvement of 300 perches by drainage.  If we are to be limited to that I think there is hardly any necessity for the Bill.  As I pointed out last week, the country will not contribute as much under this scheme as under the Act of 1925.  The Minister said I propose that there should be a certain amount of control by the Board of Works over these schemes.  I think that is desirable, but it does not affect the question.  County councils can be safely entrusted to do all the work even with the limit of £2,000 which I have put down.  I cannot see why the amendment is opposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very much in the nature of an experiment. A large number of schemes under the £1,000 limit were received by the Board of Works under the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925.  As a result of the number of these small schemes coming in, it was considered that the smaller schemes could be more satisfactorily dealt with in some other way than under the 1925 Act.  On examination of the matter it was decided to give the county councils entire power and responsibility for the carrying out of the minor schemes, and to cut out central control entirely, in that way doing away in the first place with unnecessary expenditure here at headquarters, and in the second place the delay in the carrying out of these small schemes.  Also it was decided to transfer to the county councils the responsibility which it was said might be legitimately transferred to them as an experiment to see how they would shoulder the work.  Gradually the whole work of the maintenance of drainage districts is being transferred to the county councils, and for the purposes of economy and efficiency they ought to be transferred to them as an experiment to execute the smaller works.  We are given to understand, both from the experience of the Board of Works and from representations made, that there is a large number of very small schemes requiring attention. This Bill is brought in for the purpose of getting that work attended to in the most economical way.  The Bill is proposed to last for five years, and <Col N="446" /> the experience which we will have gained during these five years will tell us whether the limit of £1,000 is reasonable, and whether it can be raised or not.  The Bill, as I have said, is entirely an experiment, and we feel we would not be justified in raising the amount above £1,000, because of the untried nature of the machinery we are putting on to this work, and also because of the great desirability of attending to the smaller schemes.  The results will be that the smaller schemes will be readily and effectively attended to, but if we raise the limit to over £1,000 they might not be attended to. Consequently, because of the experimental nature of the Bill, and the general facts we have here before us with regard to the desirability of allowing the smaller schemes to be attended to, we do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has criticised the suggestion on three grounds.  First he said that many estimates had been received from districts showing that the work could be done for £1,000.  I would like to point out to the Minister that people very often make these applications without sufficient evidence in support of them.  An application will come for a scheme, which it is stated will cost only £1,000.  When that is investigated it will be found to cost a great deal more than the amount estimated.  I think it is almost certain that when it comes to investigating these schemes to find out how far the promoters' estimates of the costs are justified, the number that can be done for £1,000 will be practically negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point he raised was that if we altered the figure to £2,000 it would hold up the Bill for a very long time.  On the contrary, I think if we do not raise it to £2,000 practically no work will be done, because it will be found when the claims are gone into that they will cost far more than the limit provided in the Bill.  The third point raised was that the county council staffs had so much other work to do that they could not find time to do this.  I have an amendment down dealing with that very point.  I do not think the county council staffs are the proper people to <Col N="447" /> do it.  Most members of the Seanad who are members of county councils, and who know what the officials have to do, will agree with me when I say that if they do their own work properly they will not have time to devote to drainage work.  Furthermore, I can say as an engineer that this is highly technical work, and the bulk of the staffs of the county councils are employed to maintain the roads, bridges and other work of that sort, and are not able to do drainage work.  People should be got from outside, and there is power in the Bill to get outside people to do drainage work.  The three points the Minister has raised against it, to my mind, work out in favour of the amendment, and I am afraid I must take the opinion of the Seanad on it. I do not like doing so, but I am quite sure that when the Minister has experience of the working of the Bill he will find that it would have been very desirable that the limit should have been raised to £2,000.</P>

      <P>By Section 14 the Government's contribution is limited to £250 for carrying out these schemes. I take it that the whole financial arrangement of the Bill is based on that, and that if we accept Senator Barrington's amendment we will be putting on county councils a number of minor schemes for which they may be liable for each scheme individually to the extent of £750.  There might be a multiplicity of schemes over £1,000 and we might be letting the county councils in for a number of schemes that will involve large outlay.  As Senator Barrington argued, county councils are practically incapable of carrying out that work.  I think it very inadvisable to alter that section.  I do not think we should raise the figures in the Bill from £750 to £1,500, as suggested by Senator Barrington.</P>

      <P>This section deals with a highly technical matter.  When a drainage district is prepared, and when it proposes to improve land in any townland, under the old Acts the whole of the townland was included in the drainage district.  Frequently in the west townlands are very large and they sometimes run into different watersheds. To say that no work should be carried out within the drainage district means that you should not carry out any works even in the watershed of another river.  That would frequently arise. Obviously the intention of the section is that the works in any drainage district already constituted should not be interfered with.  With that I am in agreement.  I think that is very desirable. But to word the section so as to prevent the execution of work in a totally different watershed &mdash; although by the exigencies of the law they happen to be in the same district &mdash; is to my mind going too far.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading the Minister told us that if any county council refused to carry out a scheme under this Bill it could be referred to the Board of Works.

I strongly suggest that where forcing county councils in matters of this kind <Col N="450" /> has been avoided in bigger schemes carried out under the authority of the Board of Works it should not now be included in this Bill.  Where you want the greatest possible expedition you would not put force on the county councils.  The object of the Bill is to give powers to people to improve their own position.

I think if an amendment &mdash; I do not know how the Minister would receive it &mdash; was framed in this way, that where one county council was strongly of opinion that certain works should be carried out, or was prepared to do the work, and if another county council which was not so interested &mdash; perhaps not interested at all &mdash; refused to join with it, the council which was interested should be allowed to carry out the work, even though portion of the scheme might be in another county.

      <P>I do not think it would work out that way.  Under the terms of the Bill a county council has to accept certain obligations, and if a county has little or no interest in carrying out work they will not accept the obligation of carrying out work in another county.  Where it would actually work in is where one county has got a major interest and the other little or none.  I do not know why a <Col N="451" /> county with little or no interest should be allowed to stand in the way of another county carrying out work which would be advantageous to them.  I do not think a county which is not interested in the carrying out of certain work would ever accept responsibility or liability for a county which had the major interest. I do not think that case will arise.  I think Senator O'Rourke and the Minister should consider the question between now and the Report Stage.  It seems to me that if they could get over the difficulty it would be a very desirable thing.  As the Bill stands it does not deal with the question where one council agrees with a scheme and another does not.  I quite agree with the Minister that it would be utterly impossible in these days to compel a county that strongly disapproves of it to do work against their will.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment, and I do so from personal experience of the working of the Act of 1925. In County Waterford there is an area extending into another county which is subject to flooding.  About 40 acres are within the County Borough of Waterford and some 300 acres in the County Council area.  The drainage scheme appealed to everybody.  The county had much to gain by the carrying out of this project, and the city, from the purely health point of view, and also in view of the improvement of 40 acres of land in its area.  The County Council would have gained by the drainage of the land and the higher assessment which would be put on it. It would have prevented a recurrence of flooding on the two main roads, from Waterford to Tramore, over which there is considerable traffic, and from Waterford to Cork.  These roads are periodically flooded and all traffic suspended, sometimes for days.  It is becoming worse from year to year, and during the last flood on the Tramore railway, which runs through this marshy district, the water was well over the wheels of the locomotive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a case in point where the Corporation of Waterford, although theirs was a minor interest, were avid for the carrying out of a scheme, but <Col N="452" /> the county council refused to fall in with the proposal.  As one who was chairman of that council for some years, I regret to say that it was a reactionary one.  I say this in extenuating their attitude that they have a high rate there, higher than the farmers are able to carry.  They only looked at it from the point of view of what it would cost.  When the county council came to consider the matter they turned it down and went on with the next business. There is a case in point.  They were interested in the way of revenue and in keeping up the road, which involves them in serious expenditure from year to year, yet they stood in the way of this very beneficial scheme on the edge of Waterford City, with 30,000 people.  Having had that experience I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision in this matter.

      <P>I am not very clear about the amendment.  The Senator wants to make it compulsory on a council to consider a petition in default. I think that the Bill compels them to consider any petition without the amendment.  I think it would be advisable that small schemes under £1,000 should be referred, as suggested in the amendment, to the Minister for consideration, where a county council under its powers refuses to put the scheme into effect.  We cannot blink the fact that in certain areas it would be possible for a valuable scheme to be lost because two or three people got members with whom they were <i>persona grata</i> to oppose it.  It would be a pity if a valuable scheme were lost. If this Bill remains as it is now the county councils have power to say that a scheme is not an advisable one, and I think there is a danger of some valuable schemes being lost because a petition was not accepted by a county council.  The acceptance of a petition <Col N="453" /> would be fortified by a report from the county surveyor that the work was feasible and could be performed within a cost of £1,000.  I think it is not advisable that county councils should have any power to condemn a scheme which might be a valuable one.  If the scheme is a valuable one, it is for the Minister and his advisers to decide, and if he decides that it is, to direct that the work should be carried out.  I think the amendment is a good one.</P>

      <P>From the remarks made by Senator Bennett and Senator Kenny, they seem to be regarding larger schemes than this Bill contemplates. We heard about arterial drainage, about roads being flooded and interfered with, and that the county councils would not consent, because the cost would be too much.  If a £1,000 scheme is going to be objected to on the grounds that it is going to affect the rates, that is rather far-fetched. The whole principle of the Bill is to give the local people a chance of doing the work themselves, getting free of the Board of Works and of the Minister, and settling their own affairs. That is why the amount is limited to £1,000.  The Bill is purely an experiment to try if the schemes will work, to see if local authorities can manage to do some useful work.  This Bill will meet schemes that are available.  We do not want to be put in the position of trying to compel anybody to do a thing they do not want to do.  We are strongly recommended by the Minister and by the Board of Works to let this experiment be made.  Senator Barrington wanted the amount to be increased to £2,000, and now the Seanad is asked to restore compulsion.  I think the Minister should get his Bill as it is, and work it as an experiment.  If it fails, we will have to get something else.</P>

      <P>In this matter the question of the cost of the scheme largely enters into the decision of the county council as to whether it should be carried out or not.  Generally a scheme is paid for in three ways:&mdash; Firstly, a drainage rate paid by persons whose lands are benefited; there is then a Government contribution not exceeding one-fourth of the amount &mdash; or £250 &mdash; and then there is the county <Col N="454" /> council contribution.  I do not agree with this element of compulsion that Senator O'Rourke's amendment introduces, unless it was made clear that no council would be compelled to make a contribution if it did not wish to do so. As regards drainage in general, I do not think it is any benefit to the country to drain land where the benefit accruing would not at least pay the interest on the outlay.  It is simply throwing money away to pay more for that work than the benefit that would accrue would be worth, and I cannot imagine any county council refusing to help a neighbouring council, when they are not asked to pay a county contribution. If this amendment is carried and if compulsory powers were given the Minister, I certainly say that he should have no power to compel a county council to give a contribution to a drainage scheme if it did not wish to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNOR</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few remarks as a result of the experience gained in the County Kildare in connection with drainage schemes.  I think this is one of the very best suggestions made, either experimental or compulsory, that county councils should adopt these schemes limiting the amount to, say, £1,000, to be applied in cases in the discretion of the council where drainage is really necessary. After the experience we had last year in County Kildare where flooding arose the drainage will be one of the greatest contributions towards the prosperity of the county.  I have experience of farms where drainage was carried out with the greatest possible advantage, and in another place a next door neighbour &mdash; one of those people who never wants to do anything either for himself or for anyone else &mdash; had to be threatened with legal proceedings before an outlet for the drainage could be secured.  I am in favour of county councils having authority to carry out these schemes where they are put forward by the local people.  The only drawback I see so far is want of energy in getting the job started.  It appears that the whole responsibility is put on the county surveyor, but if the Minister could put forward any inducement by having an independent engineer to take up these drainage schemes.  I think it would be <Col N="455" /> a great advantage.  No one likes to apply the word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; to county councils, but it is often very necessary to have some pressure brought to bear on them over and above ordinary methods so that these necessary schemes should be carried out.  From the experience that we have had I think it is proper that this suggestion should be carried into effect.</P>

      <P>My idea in tabling this amendment was to deal with cases where the principal work to be done was in, say, county A, while in county B the lands would not benefit in any way, but where excavation would have to be done.  In such cases farmers in county B would gain nothing except that the engineers would go on their land and clean drains for the benefit of county A.  These farmers would appeal to the county council not to entertain this question as it was not going to benefit anyone in their county.  As a result that county council would object to the scheme.  If the people in both counties are going to benefit both counties would carry on.  There are a number of places where all the benefit would be on one side.  In cases of that sort one county would have to pay all the charges and the other would not pay anything.  In that case Senator Linehan's argument goes by the board. I appeal to the Minister to let the amendment pass.  He said that up to the present he did not like compelling county councils to do work, still Government Departments recently compelled them to do certain work.  The Department of Local Government compelled county councils to appoint county medical officers of health after the proposal had been rejected by the councils.  It is quite common for the Government Departments to compel county councils to do certain work.  In the present instance, I think it would be very wise to have such power.  It would be seldom necessary to exercise it, but if the Minister had the power to make county councils do the work it would be favourably considered.</P>

      <P>A number of different ideas have cut across this discussion. In reply to what Senator <Col N="456" /> Linehan stated, might I say that there is no compulsion of any kind on a county council to give a contribution to a scheme.  The only liability that a county council has under this Bill is the cost of the preparation of the scheme, and for any excess over the actual cost involved in the carrying out of the scheme.  If there is any excess like that the county council has to bear it. Senator Bennett apparently would like if a county council refuses to put a scheme into operation inside its own county, apart altogether from a second county being involved in the matter, to give the Minister for Local Government power to say to the county council that it should go on with the scheme. I am very much afraid that there are many inflated ideas abroad as to the number of professional engineers available in my Department.  There are two engineers available for outside work on the housing staff.  The whole Road Department is run by the chief road engineer with three road inspectors.</P>
      <P>Some Senators suggested that if a county council did not proceed to put a scheme into operation, the Minister for Local Government should have the power to do so.  I could not do that without getting the statutory machinery that would enable me to do it.  The object of this Bill is to give powers and facilities to local people in connection with small schemes to decide these matters themselves.  We are putting compulsion on the county councils to see that when a scheme is carried out it will have to look after the drainage and that the benefitees pay the drainage rate.  Beyond that there is no compulsion on the county councils to go ahead with schemes inside their own areas.  I do not want powers to compel county councils to go ahead with schemes that they do not want to go ahead with.  It would be unjust, I think, for me to do so in view of the fact that I am not in a position to assist them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Rourke referred to the case of a drainage scheme coming under two county councils, and where it might happen that one of the county councils objected to the part of the scheme that came within its county being carried out.  I do not know whether the kind of proposition that he puts up really <Col N="457" /> exists or not &mdash; that is, that a drainage scheme benefiting land in county A may have to have some of the work done in county B, which will not affect the rate in county B.  It is quite clear to me that one could not force county B to allow county A to carry out work in an area of county B.</P>
    <P>County B has a drainage rate, but the assessment and the valuation on the amount of improvement done to the land by the drainage would be by a valuer employed by county A.  He would make his valuation on the estimated amount of work to be done inside the county.  This Bill is an experiment, and I would like to leave the element of compulsion entirely aside. If there is a good lot of work to be done, why should there be any desire to deal with a piece of work around which friction may possibly arise? There is a tendency, perhaps, to regard this as a drainage scheme proper rather than as a Bill giving facilities to county councils to deal with the smaller schemes of drainage.  As Minister for Local Government, I have no machinery for dealing technically with drainage work.  I object strongly to having put into the Bill the proposal that I will have to administer schemes not carried out by the county councils. Such a suggestion was not considered when the major Drainage Act of 1925 was under discussion.  I think that the case that Senator Kenny mentions can hardly be regarded as one that would properly come within a minor drainage scheme to be carried out by a county council.  No matter how small a scheme is, I think that if two county councils were at loggerheads in the matter that the work ought not to be carried out by either one or the other of them, particularly where we have the Department of the Board of Works for the purpose of carrying out drainage schemes other than minor drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>I would plead with the Seanad to leave out of this Bill the kind of case that Senator O'Rourke speaks of.  I think we should leave some power to the county councils.  We are putting a lot of responsibility upon them in this measure.  They are getting under this Bill a fair chance of going ahead <Col N="458" /> with a lot of work that lies before them.  I do not think that, as regards the county councils, there ought to be any suggestion or threat of compulsion coming from any side.</P>

This individual was asked to remove the weir as its existence was holding up the drainage of adjoining property.  Certain officials, I think, inspected the place.  I understand that when this man was visited by some of the officials with a view to having the weir removed, he made the statement that it would take all the members of the Dáil and Seanad to remove it.  This individual has certain fishing rights there, and insists on keeping the weir. The result of that is, that the drainage of the county is held up.  That is a very serious matter.  I think that the law should be so arranged that an individual should be compelled to remove an obstruction that is holding up the drainage of a whole district.  I do not say that this weir should be removed without compensation being paid to the individual concerned.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will agree with me that it is not the question of the present aggregate value that ought to give the people concerned the right to vote in regard to these drainage schemes, but rather the proportion of the cost that they will have to pay. If, for instance, a man owns two-thirds of the present value of the land and that on that he is only rated for a very small portion of the improvement, it would be unfair that he should be allowed to out-vote the man who is rated for the bulk of the improvement, but who does not hold as much of the present value of the land.

      <P>I do not agree that the Senator's amendment is a really sound one.  The Senator himself admits the difficulty of estimating the thing properly in working out these <Col N="461" /> particular schemes.  In basing a decision as to whether a scheme will be gone ahead with on a vote on more than 50 per cent. of the present aggregate value of the land involved, we are basing it on something which is definite. Take, for instance, that there are four persons with holdings, the aggregate value of each of which is £10, and that three of these want a scheme carried out and that the fourth person does not. The position is that that scheme is carried out because you have £30 as against £10.  If the estimated improvement in the people who went to work and carried out the schemes were simply £1 in respect of each holding, and that the other person's estimated improvement was £3, then under the Senator's amendment the £3 people would be able to stop the scheme; but suppose his estimated improvement was 2½ he would not be able to stop the scheme, and yet if when the scheme was finally examined it was found his land was improved by £3, whereas the lands of the other persons combined were only improved by two and a half pounds he would have a particular kind of grievance in law.  I do not know how it would be rectified.  He would be called upon to pay the maintenance rate, but if the full truth were known at the start he would have been able to stop it.  I think it is better to base the decisions on the aggregate value of land.  I hesitate to accept the amendment.  That would put us in the position, even in any small percentage of our schemes, of basing them on a decision that was not sound.</P>

      <P>I would like to explain that the principle the Minister has now laid down is flying directly in the face of the principle that has prevailed in the Arterial Drainage Act up to the present.  In all schemes carried out the man who has to pay the bulk of the money has the vote.  In other words, the man who pays the piper calls the tune.  I think it is a sound principle. To show how a very grave injustice might occur, we will take three men who have a large interest in the drainage of land, which will be improved only to the extent of one penny per acre.  They propose to compel works to be carried out for which another man will be rated <Col N="462" /> at one shilling an acre, and they can compel him to incur this expenditure for their own benefit.  That is unjust and wrong, and is departing from the principle that has always been enforced up to the present, and I do not see why it should be departed from.</P>

In the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925, if I remember rightly, there was considerable discussion in the Seanad as to whether people should be told before the works were carried out whether they should be carried out or not, and what they should have to pay.  I think they were not told what they had to pay.  Senators were afraid such a provision would hold up the work and the Bill was passed, I think, under a misapprehension. I tried to insist that these valuation schedules should be given to the people before they were asked to vote as to whether they would carry out the work or not.  That is, a man should know whether he was going to pay more than his neighbour, and should know to what extent he would benefit, and he should know the same about his neighbour.  That information ought to be furnished in every case.  I think, as well as my recollection serves me, that in the Act of 1925 that principle was departed from.  In these circumstances there was no estimate of improved value for them to vote on, and the only thing they could go on was the aggregate value.</P>

If the cost exceeds the estimate there would be a proportionate increase.  They are furnished with every particular, and the full scheme of assessment must be available for a certain time in the county council offices of the areas drained.

Seeing that the Board of Works have a staff of engineers, and that the machinery is available, it is only reasonable they should be asked to make a report and see that the work is carried out properly before the Minister for Finance is asked to pay his contribution.</P>

      <P>Under the Act of 1925 the Commissioners of Public Works had responsibility for seeing the whole scheme carried out.  I quite see the wisdom of having approval by the Commissioners of Public Works, who have experience of drainage schemes under former Acts.  They have engineers whose work is principally concerned with the carrying out of drainage schemes, and the method proposed for carrying them out should be a matter for approval by the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>

      <P>There are four parties involved in this matter.  First and foremost there is the county council, and if our county councils are not to be able to bear the responsibility that this Bill will put on them, I say good-bye to local government.  In the second place, there are the county council officials, whose reputation and position depend upon their carrying out their work properly.  In the third place there are the occupiers, who have to pay rates and who will have to bear the burden of work improperly or ineffectually carried out, or carried out at too big a cost, and there is the competent land valuer, or land surveyor, who has to make a report upon which the county council will give their certificate to the Minister for Finance. And really, if reliance on these four means to see that the work is properly done is going to fail, then the Board of Works would not be of any use at all. To bring the Board of Works in on all these schemes would involve multiplying the present Board of Works staff quite a number of times.  It would mean that we would refrain from placing a responsibility on the classes of people I have mentioned that I think these classes of people should be competent to bear, and if they are not competent to bear it, then no central Government will be able to help the people to do their work at all. The whole principle of the Bill is to divert responsibility from the Board of Works.</P>

      <P>This is a matter of very great importance.  When this was before the Dáil Deputy Brennan called attention to a very important aspect of it.  From my knowledge of the sort of work that can be done in the country, and of the country itself, I can say with absolute confidence that 80 per cent. of the schemes cannot be carried out without benefiting turbaries in some way or other.  In the past there has been a great objection in connection with turbaries.  The improvement schedule had to show the value of the land after the work was completed, and naturally if a turf bog which held a very considerable amount of turf was rendered more valuable or was improved in any way, it benefited more than ordinary agricultural or grass land did, and it was valued very highly.  The result was this: The turf was not valued at all, but the valuation was put on the land, because of the turf.  The turf was then cut away, the wretched cut-away bog was left, and <Col N="468" /> that cut-away bog was left liable for the whole rate that had been put on it originally in consequence of the turf. That gave rise to most of the dissatisfaction which arose in connection with arterial drainage in the past.  The turf was gone; a great many people were left saddled with most exorbitant and excessive charges because the turf had been extracted by somebody else who put the value of the turf into his pocket, went away and left that charge. I think it would be a very desirable thing if that could be amended in this case.  There is no question about it that no work of this kind can be carried out without benefiting the turf bogs.  Therefore, I beg to propose Amendment 24.</P>

      <P>Somebody might raise the question, perhaps not having considered it very carefully, as to the difficulty of collecting that rate.  I do not see any difficulty.  In the past landlords who owned turbaries did not experience any great difficulty.  They appointed an official who was known as a bog ranger.  He lived on the spot, and as a rule he collected the rates on the turf bog without any great difficulty. He was paid a poundage rate for what he collected, and the matter was met in that way.  There is no question about it that this is the only way in which the question can be solved. The turf should be made to pay for the benefit, and in many cases the turf would pay the entire cost of the drainage.</P>

      <P>I accept the principle of the Senator's amendment, and I propose to bring in an amendment on the Report Stage to meet the suggestion.  I think the suggestion could best be met, in so far as Amendments 22 and 23 are concerned, by including it in the definition under &ldquo;lands.&rdquo;  The way proposed in the amendment for collecting the rates <Col N="469" /> would, I think, be rather difficult to carry out.  But I think the thing can be met in the first place by certain changes in the Bill; for instance, replacing the word &ldquo;rated occupier&rdquo; by &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; in certain parts of the Bill, and in the final adjustment of value and fixing the drainage rate, to have the drainage rate so arranged that portion of it would be paid by persons who have turbary rights, that they will be rateable to the county council in respect to their turbary rights, and to make provision whereby, when the drainage rate is finally assessed, the turbary right owners, and whoever is involved in the scheme, will be rated definitely on turbary rights, the owners being rated over the particular number of years that will correspond to their estimated years of benefit from the scheme.  I am satisfied that it will be possible to frame an amendment that will deal with the position satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 17, sub-section (1).  To insert after the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  For the purpose of discharging the responsibility for the maintenance of a drainage works, the County Council or Joint Committee by which the Drainage Scheme has been carried out may, subject to the approval of the Minister, make agreements with the rated occupiers, or some of them, of the lands drained or improved by the Drainage Scheme, for the execution of the necessary maintenance work to the satisfaction of the said County Council or Joint Committee, and such agreements may include provision for abatement of the drainage rate assessed on such rated occupiers, and for the recovery of the cost of maintenance work executed by the said County Council or Joint Committee, in default of compliance with the terms of such agreements.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle is involved in this amendment.  Amendment 25 is only <Col N="470" /> consequential, and with your permission I propose to take Amendment 26 first. The object of the amendment is to seek to give effect to a suggestion I made during the Second Reading debate.  In the Bill as it stands, a county council or a joint committee responsible for carrying out a drainage scheme are themselves required to maintain the drainage works in good order and condition in perpetuity.  For that purpose a rate must be levied which will include an amount to cover the cost of maintenance, and this rate, as far as it relates to maintenance cost, must be levied in perpetuity if the works are to be kept in good order and condition.  A complaint I have heard on many occasions is to the effect that the amount of the rate in respect of maintenance is out of all proportion to the original cost of the scheme, that, in other words, it is abnormally high, and that because of that the drainage works are not always kept in good order and condition.  This was notoriously so in the case of the Suck Drainage Board in Roscommon, where a very high rate was levied for maintenance purposes, and where the Board discontinued its maintenance work for quite a long time.  Flooding took place and a considerable amount of damage to crops occurred as a result, but notwithstanding this fact the maintenance rate was ruthlessly collected. Farmers have declared that with half of what they paid in this way they could have kept the river in good order, free from mud banks and other obstructions.</P>
    <P>I know that the schemes contemplated in this Bill are on a different basis from the River Suck drainage, but the problem is the same in the case of all.  It is the fear of the amount of the rate that will be levied in respect of maintenance that will frighten off a number of farmers from promoting or encouraging many of these schemes that they would otherwise favour and that in many cases are very badly needed.  In estimating the cost of maintenance the surveyor will have to be on the safe side; he will have to see that the county council is properly protected; he will estimate on the high side rather than on the low, and the rate will be levied in accordance with <Col N="471" /> his valuation.  It has been suggested that in actual practice it will be the farmer and his sons, who are rated occupiers, who will get the work of maintenance to do, but, as may be quite apparent, many other influences and considerations will creep in, and it will afterwards be found that what may be the case in theory will work out quite differently in practice, and that if a would-be employee for this particular work has no other claim than that he is a rated occupier or an owner he will find that he will be left nearly every time.  I think that is rather a poor sort of consolation to hold out.  The amendment is not compulsory; it is merely permissive.  It gives the county council power to make agreements with the rated occupiers to enable the occupiers themselves to keep the works in good order and condition, in accordance with an agreement made by the county council.  It also makes provision for the county council itself to do the work, in the event of any of these occupiers failing in course of time to comply with the agreement, by collecting the cost of such work from the defaulting occupiers.</P>
    <P>During the winter months the farmers and their sons have hardly anything to do.  They can do this work just as it suits them, very much less expensively than it could be done by the county council.  The whole idea underlying these minor schemes is to make them less expensive on the farmers and to encourage the farmers to promote them where they are necessary. One of the best kinds of encouragement to give is to ensure that the schemes will be as inexpensive as possible.  When the original cost of a scheme is paid off the rate which the council must levy, under the Bill as it now stands, will continue in perpetuity, and it is this that frightens the farmer.  Under the arrangement suggested in the amendment, all that would be necessary on the part of the county council would be to have a periodical inspection, maybe only once a year, to see that the piece of drain or tributary river, as the case may be, has been maintained as originally apportioned <Col N="472" /> out between the various rated occupiers.  The amendment also provides that any such agreement shall have the approval of the Minister before it is entered into.  That is a formal arrangement; it does not mean anything much to the Ministry, but it is an additional protection.  In view of the fact that this is permissive I think it should get a chance.  I think every avenue should be explored with a view to making these schemes inexpensive and at the same time encouraging the farmers to avail of the very useful powers contained in this Bill.  The great advantage of this amendment would be if it were put into operation the council would not then be compelled to levy a rate in respect of maintenance, so that the rate levied would be smaller than would otherwise be the case, and they would have all the powers they require to see that the works are maintained in proper order and condition.</P>

      <P>While I approve of the principle which Senator O'Farrell wants to carry into effect, I am afraid that the amendment would not effect it.  I have been responsible for the maintenance of a great many districts in the past, and invariably I have found that the most anxious desire of the drainage boards was that the occupiers themselves should maintain the works.  That has been an almost insuperable difficulty.  Perhaps it is one of the reasons&mdash;they are not far to seek; they are pretty well ingrained in human nature&mdash;why drainage schemes are necessary, because in some place or other an obstruction exists, and the man on whose lands that obstruction lies feels that he will be doing the main work of the whole district itself for the benefit of his neighbours if he undertakes the work. The neighbours will be very keen on getting him to do it, but the man himself thinks differently, and the only way it can be done is by a voluntary scheme between the body that is responsible for the maintenance of the river, and the tenants themselves for them to take a contract to do it.  They can do that without this amendment; that is quite open to them, and if that <Col N="473" /> is done the whole object that Senator O'Farrell seeks to secure by this amendment will be fulfilled.  But I think, from my experience of the past, that it would be found impossible to get a number of them to agree.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment.  There is a good deal of force in Senator Barrington's objection, but in the past the schemes that Senator Barrington had charge of were large schemes where big rivers were concerned.  Looking after these would require a large body of men and very extensive works.  The schemes under this Bill will be more or less small, and a farmer's son or a labourer would be capable of dealing with them.  I think the principle involved is very sound, and it seems adequate for every detail. I certainly think that the rate to be struck for maintenance would be rendered very much less by the acceptance of an amendment of this character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Under the old drainage committees the weakness was that it was difficult to collect the rates to maintain the work.  These men were not remunerated, and when times became a little difficult for the farmers there was opposition to the payment of this drainage rate.  Other farmers on the Drainage Committee did not care to press them and had no interest in pressing them, with the result that the maintenance of the drainage works fell into disuse.  To-day the Board of Works have three thousand men and twenty-five engineers making up a leeway of the old drainage works where the banks were allowed to fall in and the courses got blocked, and the drainage rate, through not being collected and used for the purpose of maintenance by the local committees, went by the board and the committees dissolved.  They felt the onus of this work.  It was work that they were not paid for, and they did not see their way to bring other farmers into court.  Under Senator O'Farrell's amendment the county council would still have control, and if an arrangement can be made to keep these works maintained the county council will see that the work is done.  Under the <Col N="474" /> existing Drainage Acts the county surveyor makes an estimate of what it will cost to keep these works maintained during the year.  He sends his estimate to the county council, and the levy is made on the owners of the lands.  They collected that assessment with the ordinary rate under the 1925 Act and that would last for thirty-five years.  Then when the owner's liability ceases, when he has paid his contributions for thirty-five years, and when the principal has been redeemed by way of a sinking fund, and he has contributed from year to year towards drainage maintenance, it is then a very simple matter for the county council to maintain these works in perpetuity.  The county council, under their present powers with regard to roads, can carry out any work under direct labour, or they can sub-let a section to a contractor. The same applies to this work. It would be quite in keeping with the county council's practice, and it would be the line of least resistance for them, if they could arrange that the actual people concerned, who would be benefited by the work when it was done, would get paid for doing the work.  I think the principle is a very sound one, and I have pleasure in supporting it.</P>

      <P>I think the amendment is a bad one, and that it is inadvisable to put it into the Bill.  The Senator says that every avenue is to be explored, and I would like to see the county council getting the right to explore every possible system by which this could be most economically and conveniently carried out.  After the carrying out of a drainage scheme, for the first year or two there is a certain type of maintenance work to be carried out arising out of the fact that the works are new.  I think that that work <Col N="475" /> particularly might be left to the direct responsibility of the people who carried out the scheme.  In the earlier years after the carrying out of the drainage work, on the other hand, the maintenance work is lighter than it is subsequently, so that as the Bill is experimental, as there are five years during which it is proposed to run, I prefer to leave it to the county council to find out in their own way how they could best maintain these schemes.  There is nothing at all to prevent a county council entering into such an agreement, although I feel that there might be difficulties, particularly in the successful carrying out of works, by such agreements. The fact that it is permitted, and that it is only one way in which the local payer of the drainage rate can probably assist to make the cost small, makes this, to my mind, an inadvisable thing to put into the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that they can do it now, and still he says that this is a bad amendment.  In other words, if you remind them of the power that they have you are doing a wrong thing.  I cannot gather any other meaning from what he says.  I did not think they had powers to do that, but what I do think incumbent on them is that they must levy the rate to cover the cost of maintenance.  They must pay that money to somebody, and you will certainly remove one of the real practical objections to these schemes being promoted at all if you are able to persuade the promoters that the ensuing rate is going to be small, rather than levy a rate that may seem exorbitant and which the farmer knows he will have to pay in perpetuity.  Some of these schemes may be so small as to involve only ten or twelve people at the most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maintenance work in connection with most drainage schemes, as many <Col N="476" /> Senators know, consists in taking up a bit of mud that may have congregated in the middle of a stream or the removal of the branch of a tree which may have fallen into the stream, and which eventually, if left there, would block up the water-course.  A man or his son could easily attend to matters of that kind in the course of their ordinary work if they see such obstructions in a stream.  But if they know that if they do not do that the work will be done for them, and that they will have to pay for it, they will be more careful in attending to little matters of that kind.  They can do the work themselves if they want to, any day that suits them, as long as they keep the stream in good condition.  Why it should be considered bad policy to suggest to the county council that, with a view to reducing the cost of the maintenance rates under these schemes, they might remind people that they can do the work themselves, baffles me.  The complaint that I have always heard in connection with these drainage schemes is that it is not the original cost of a scheme that presses most heavily on farmers, but rather the rate levied in respect of maintenance.  That is the reason why so many of these people allow their lands to be swamped.  They allow that to go on rather than risk a burden in perpetuity which this maintenance involves.</P>

      <P>I think that the embodiment in legislation of suggestions is undesirable.  The fact that a suggestion of a particular kind is made, so far from informing people, may have the opposite effect, and may blind them to other suggestions.  I think it is much better to leave the whole sphere free from suggestion.  There is nothing in this Bill to bind the county councils as regards having this work done in the best possible way.  I think we might leave the county councils free to receive such suggestions as have been made here, and free to realise their powers, apart from making suggestions in our legislation.</P>

      <P>Might I draw Senator O'Farrell's attention to the latter part of his amendment where he refers to provision being made for abatement <Col N="477" /> of the drainage rates assessed on the rated occupiers concerned?  As I understand the position, the rate is not a flat one from year to year, nor is it a rate levied in perpetuity.  As the Minister has pointed out, the maintenance rate will be very low for some years after the scheme has been carried out.  The position is somewhat the same as that of a man who builds a house.  For the first three or four years after the house has been built, the cost of repairs is very low.  Under these schemes what occurs is this: that after a scheme has been completed the county surveyor makes an estimate from year to year as to the amount that will be required to maintain the work.  As I understand it, the rate is not a rigid thing at all.  It is only rigid under the old Acts as far as the amortisation period, which, I think, extended over 35 years, was concerned. That, of course, had to be so, because the amortisation figure is worked out on the principle of yearly payments to be made over a period of 35 years.</P>
      <P>As to the additional rate to be added to that for maintenance purposes, an assessment has to be made from year to year by the county council on an estimate submitted by their county surveyor.  Some years that additional rate may be nothing at all, while in other years it may be a penny or twopence in the £.  I think in regard to this matter that Senator O'Farrell is labouring under a misapprehension in thinking that the rate struck for maintenance purposes is rigid, and has to be made for all time, even during a year when there is no outlay for maintenance. That is not the position.</P>

      <P>I move the following five amendments:&mdash;</P>
      <P>27.&mdash;Section 22, sub-section (1). To delete the sub-section and to substitute therefor a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  When a county council or a joint committee appointed under this Act has approved of and is engaged in carrying out five schemes under this Act, they may appoint such and so many temporary extra officers as they shall from time to time think proper for the purposes of this Act, subject to the approval of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>28.&mdash;Section 22, sub-section (2). Before the word &ldquo;officers&rdquo; in line 61 to insert the word &ldquo;temporary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>29.&mdash;Section 22, sub-section (2). To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Minister, but such remuneration shall in no case exceed five per cent. on the cost of the works.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>30.&mdash;Section 22, sub-section (3). <Col N="479" /> Before the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in line 63 to insert the word &ldquo;temporary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>31.&mdash;Section 22, sub-section (3). To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;and shall not be entitled to pension or retiring allowance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is better that I should take these five amendments together, and it will be admitted by anyone who reads this section that amendment of it is necessary.  The section gives a county council power to appoint such and so many officers as it may think fit for the purposes of this Act; to give them such remuneration as may be determined by the council, while the third sub-section states that any officer appointed may at any time be removed from his office by the council or committee which has appointed him.  What I want to draw attention to is that the sub-section does not state whether such an officer is to be liable for a pension or not.  From what I know of some of the county councils in the country, I have no doubt whatever that if the Bill became law with this section in it in its present form, a good many of the clever gentlemen well known in many parts of the country in the matter of getting jobs, would immediately get hold of their relatives and friends and get them appointed officers under this Act, whether there was any drainage contemplated or not.  They would then proceed to get the county council or committee to pay them whether there was work doing or not, and if these temporary officers were removed they would see that they got pensions. The object of my five amendments is to prevent such a thing happening.  I think that the amendments are absolutely necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present time the Minister has full power not only to control the appointment and tenure of officers, but also the remuneration paid them by any local body.  Section 26 makes it quite clear that the exercise of any functions of Government or public administration vested by statute in the Minister cannot be interfered with by this Bill.  So that so far as additional officers are concerned the Minister has full control in the matter.  As regards superannuation, <Col N="480" /> no officer with less than ten years' service at present can get a gratuity of any kind.  The amendment is really an attempt to put in powers in regard to matters over which the Minister has full control already.  If it were to be set out in the Bill that you could not pay more than six or seven or eight per cent. in regard to carrying out a particular work under the Bill, that might easily prove unsatisfactory.  I would ask the Seanad to accept it that already full powers of control in regard to appointments are vested in the Minister.  If it becomes necessary to make either temporary or permanent appointments in connection with this particular work, you will not be assisting the position by passing amendments of the kind under consideration. Already the Minister possesses full powers.</P>

      <P>I think it would be important to have put in at the end of Section 22 the words &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Minister&rdquo; because, although there is a general principle for making appointments subject to the approval of the Minister, if a special provision is contained in the Act which does not refer to that power, it would be argued afterwards that exception would be taken in the case of these officers, and that the Minister's approval was not necessary.  The Minister has referred to Section 26, but it is not at all clear that that section would preserve the approval of the Minister in the way that he suggests. I think it would be well to insert the precautionary words that I have mentioned at the end of Section 22.  That would make the whole clause read &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Minister.&rdquo;  I think the matter is one worthy of consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Incorporated Law Society are, I think, interested in this.  They were first under the impression that they would have a hearing before the Committtee appointed to consider this question, which was not the case, but it could be so in the case of a Private Bill.  I immediately moved that the Committee adjourn to enable the members of the Committee to have an informal conversation with the members of the Incorporated Law Society, and a large number of points were considered; but what they have written to you, sir, was carefully considered, though not technically, by the members of the Committee during a lengthy conference.  As to the point you have mentioned, that is only one of many raised but not made in Committee.  The proposal was that the only body that should be entitled to get the benefit of the Act would be one with a capital of £50,000, at least £20,000 of which should be paid up.  They suggested that there is an Act in England which makes similar provisions.  With great respect, I would point out that there is not a similar Act in England, but there is Lord Birkenhead's Act, which deals <Col N="483" /> with the whole question of companies and a great deal of the probate law.  It provides certain limitations as to the functions of a trustee and executor.  It provides that only companies with a capital of £100,000 can be a trustee or executor.  That is a matter which, I think, is open to fair interpretation as to whether there should be such a limit or not.  Personally, without careful consideration, I would not very much object if the bodies in Ireland likely to hold themselves out would have a capital very much larger, but the insertion of such words in this Bill would not achieve that purpose.  In the Bill it is provided that corporate bodies, that is, limited companies, may act as trustees and executors, and they are in just the same position as if they were individuals. It gives them no powers individuals did not have before, and it takes no powers from them that individuals have.  If you insert the section in this Bill its effect will be that where a corporate body is appointed as executor, as they can at present, they will be able to appoint a syndic under their own name and seal and be able to act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Bill is now amended they are actually the persons who would under the ordinary law have the right to act as administrators, and they can be appointed by the court and only under such circumstances.  The only advantage is that the procedure would be simpler.  No new powers are given.  If you put in a section to limit the powers of this Act to companies with a capital of £50,000, from my point of view it would not spoil the Bill.  It would mean that if a company, acting as executor, has £50,000 capital it has not to appoint a syndic, and with a capital of £49,000 it has.  Therefore I suggest that what you raise is not a matter which should be dealt with in this Bill.  Unfortunately, the Secretary of the Incorporated Law Society sent me the amendment only yesterday, and I had no opportunity of explaining the position to him.  I suggest that to put in the amendment would be out of place, and also that, even if it could have effect in this Bill, which I am quite satisfied on legal advice it could not, it would be doubtful if it would be wise <Col N="484" /> at this stage.  If a man wants to appoint a dud executor who has no money as an individual he can do it.  I think it would be foolish to do it if he wanted the estate properly administered. If he is foolish enough to appoint a dud limited company, or one that has not enough of money to carry out its obligations, he can do it, but it would be foolish.  A company having large capital, such as Messrs. Guinness, would be fit to act as executors.  It is a matter the Government will probably have to face, to make an alteration in the whole question of probate law.  It would be a mistake to deal only with the question of capital.  I do not think small companies will be appointed. There may be a case where a man knows that a limited company he himself is connected with would be able to carry out the functions of an executor. I think they should be able to act in the same way as one of the individuals in partnership.  There is no difference.</P>

      <P>The difficulty that was presented to me by the President of the Incorporated Law Society was of a somewhat different kind.  I am not advocating this thing, but as the members of the Law Society are not here themselves I think it only fair to mention the matter.  They said that under this Bill an individual, who is a pauper, might incorporate himself with some other person as executor, administrator, and trustee of the corporation, and advertise himself all over the place under that high-sounding title, and that women and others who were not well versed in these matters, and not careful, might be attracted by the title and make such an individual their executor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position at the moment.  They can still do it whether it is the law or not, and putting in the £50,000 capital will not prevent them.  It only means they will act as a syndic.  This Bill simplifies procedure where there happens to be a limited company.  I think there is the probability of a Bill here on the same lines as in England, but until that Bill is brought in I am satisfied that what is proposed would not achieve what is wanted.  I have legal advice on that.</P>

If you are right, notwithstanding that you were advised that the position is the same precisely as for an individual, that sub-section is not necessary.

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the House to attend for a few minutes while I explain the difficult position it <Col N="491" /> was placed in in regard to these Rules. It will be within the recollection of the House that when the Courts of Justice Bill was passing through the House it was suggested, and a question was raised by Senator Brown, that the proposal, as it stood in the Bill in regard to the Rule-Making Authority, was a breach of the Constitution.  My opinion was asked in the matter, and I expressed a very strong opinion according to that expressed by Senator Brown.  But the President, who was here in charge of the Bill, took an opposite view, and said he was advised by his responsible advisers that the procedure was perfectly regular and right, and after considerable debate the Seanad adopted the view of the President.  Evidently, on further consideration, they came to the conclusion that they were not quite as right as they thought they were, and when it came back here the clause in question was modified&mdash;the clause providing for the making of Rules, and the authority who were to make these Rules.  A clause was then introduced here in Committee, and I at once raised the question.  I said: &ldquo;Are you sure under this clause that you will have power to challenge and reject a particular Rule as distinct from the entire body of Rules?&rdquo; The House then became alive to the difficulty and the doubt, and accordingly the Attorney-General and Senator Brown agreed that they would put their heads together and frame a clause for the Bill which would accomplish the purpose that the Seanad declared they wanted to have accomplished; that is to say, that would give them power to reject one or more Rules without thereby necessarily rejecting the others.  In the end, the clause that is now in the Act was introduced by the Attorney-General after consultation with Senator Brown, and that clause was introduced here with the express purpose of enabling members of the Oireachtas to reject one or more of the Rules without prejudicing or imperilling the remaining Rules which they approved of.  That was all passed. Then these Rules came to be circulated. In the first place, I think we got the <Col N="492" /> Circuit Court Rules, but I need not trouble the House with them at the moment, because owing to pressure of time they were only sent out a week before the House rose for the adjournment, and also were sent out prematurely, before they had authority to send them out.  The committee you appointed to consider them did not know that, and went on with their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of three days when we came to report we found that we had no right to be sitting at all.  However, the session was drawing to a close within two days, and by the action of the Government the Circuit Court Rules were withdrawn and they ceased to exist.  Then the District Court Rules had been put before us, and they had been referred to a Committee of the Seanad for a report.  The Committee made that report and recommended the rejection of a certain number, something like twenty.  The Rules ran into a couple of hundred, I think, and the Committee recommended that the House should fail to approve of about twenty of them.  That report of the Committee came up for consideration here.  The then Minister for Justice was present, and the report was discussed in his hearing and presence.  But the moment the motion was made that the House should agree with the Committee in rejecting, we will say, Rule No. 1, the Minister very properly interposed and said: &ldquo;If you reject No. 1 I am advised that you reject the whole thing,&rdquo; and he said that the rejection of any one rule necessarily involved the rejection of the whole.  That was rather startling to the Seanad, and to myself particularly, in view of the fact that we had gone out of our way, with the assistance of the Attorney-General, to elaborate a clause that would prevent that happening.  Accordingly I said that I must hold the opinion I held throughout, that I must so advise the Seanad, and that was that they were quite entitled to reject any one or more of these Rules without prejudicing the remainder; that is to say, they were entitled to approve of 99 of the Rules and reject No. 100.  The Seanad, acting upon that, rejected eight of them. According to the view of the Government <Col N="493" /> that, you would have thought, disposed of these Rules; they ceased to exist, according to the Government's view.  But the next thing the Government did was to publish them as Rules passed and approved of.  They inserted a note saying that those Rules marked with an asterisk had not been approved by the Seanad, but they published them as originally introduced, and they ever since have been acted upon in the District Courts, although, if the Government's view was right, they were all wiped out&mdash;the moment we rejected one we rejected the whole lot.  But they have not acted upon that.  Now, apparently, they have gone back to the original view, that the rejection of one necessarily means the rejection of all, because that has been suggested in the other House.</P>
    <P>What I am coming to is this: I have taken great trouble to look into these new Rules that have been substituted for the Rules that were withdrawn, and they seem to me to be drawn with exceeding care and with very great attention and skill.  They are entirely different in that respect from the Rules that they have displaced, because these Rules that they have displaced were carelessly drawn; they were incomplete and in very many cases were inaccurate. All these defects, as far as my humble judgment goes, have been almost completely cured and remedied, and the Rules as they stand now, taken as a whole, are, I think, very accurate. Consequently it is desirable in the interests of the country, and in the interests of the courts themselves, that we should avoid, so far as possible, again getting into any conflict over this question as to whether, by rejecting one or more, the Rules have necessarily to be withdrawn, and with a view to getting rid of that possibility, or at least mitigating the evils of it, it is now suggested that these Rules should be referred to a joint committee of both Houses, not for the purpose directly of vetoing or modifying any one of them, but for the purpose of reviewing them.  If any members of the Committee find, and so report to each House, that certain of these Rules should, in their opinion, be modified, or that they are doubtful or ambiguous, or if any other fault is found <Col N="494" /> with them, then the Rule-Making Authority should have an opportunity of recasting them, and should not be driven to the alternative that by either House rejecting one or more Rules, they would have the whole thing thrown at their heads again.  Therefore, I think it is desirable, if we could possibly arrive at it, that we should have a sort of preliminary revision of these Rules, and thereby, if possible, save any complicated or difficult question arising.</P>
    <P>My own opinion is that there is no doubt as to what the interpretation of the section of the Act is.  There is no doubt that contrary opinions have been given on it, some holding that you must either accept the Rules in globo or reject them in globo, others holding that you are at liberty to reject any one or more and to approve of the balance, with the result that the balance you approve of remain in law, the others having to go back.  In my opinion all that might possibly be obviated by the labours of this Joint Committee.  I wish, however, to guard myself and to protect the interests of the House in this respect, that is to say, that notwithstanding what the report may be when that report comes back to this House and when the Rules come up for definite consideration, I shall have to advise the House that it is still open to each and every one member to challenge any one of these Rules and for the House to take a vote upon them.  I thought it only fair, in view of what had occurred, to make this quite clear, so that there might be no mistake about it, while at the same time I am strongly of opinion that it would be very desirable that this Joint Committee should be set up.</P>

      <P>I would like to know what the ultimate development of this Committee is to be.  Are they, as suggested by the Minister for Justice in the other House, merely to indicate any objections that they may have, or suggest modifications with regard to the Rules so that he may convey them back to the Rule-Making Authority with a view to inducing them to try to make the necessary alterations, or will the Committee act as an independent Joint Committee, making certain suggestions if they find that certain Rules should be modified or eliminated, and report back to the House?  If the House accepts any recommendations of that kind, does it follow, as suggested by the Minister, that the whole of the Rules fall and have to go back again to the Rule-Making Authority?  It would be well to know before the Committee is appointed what it is supposed to do.  Is it to be a sort of negotiating body on behalf of the Oireachtas with the Rule-Making Authority?</P>

      <P>I do not think the Government have tried to hide at all what their object is.  You have had it quite frankly that it is a sort of body to have a preliminary review, with the aid of the Rule-making Authority, into these Rules.  If as a result of its operations the Committee thinks that some of them are objectionable, the hope and the intention is that when the Rule-making Authority's attention is drawn to them they would alter them in some way that would remove these objections, and that the Committee would not report on any of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not clear from the wording that this Committee must report?  If the Committee reports it must report the procedure to this House.  If it reports disapproval, then the course would be for the Government to withdraw the Rules and to produce other Rules, if they stick to their own point of view that one amendment would mean that the Rules were not passed.  This Committee is bound, like every other Joint Committee, to report to the two Houses what it has done. Nothing else could properly take place, and we will know that certain objections were taken, and I presume if the Government caused the Rules to be withdrawn new Rules would be substituted which would fit in without prejudice entirely to what this House would do.  I think that Senator O'Farrell has asked a very interesting question.  I would like to ask the same question.  I do not think at present that there is an answer to it.  One legal opinion is that if there is one single amendment to the Rules, the Rules have not been passed and, therefore, they are not law.  Another opinion, which is yours, sir, is that a Rule can be removed and that the balance will be law. At the present moment we have an actual case where the District Court Rules have been amended by this House, and I, for the life of me, do not know whether some of the Rules are law or whether only those that were amended by this House are.  I am not <Col N="497" /> a lawyer, but I really think that if this is of sufficient importance it should be taken to some court and the matter settled.  We have now one opinion expressed in the other House, with a certain amount of authority, and another opinion expressed by you, sir, with your authority.  Nothing happened. I do not know how I could find out at present whether the District Court Rules are law or whether they are not.</P>

      <P>Of course I cannot prophesy what this committee will do, and nothing I can say will bind them.  But as far as I can gather the hope of the Government, I think, is not that this committee will proceed to overrule or reject any of these Rules until they have first allowed the Rule-Making Authority to have an idea as to what their objection is, so that the authorities may, if they think fit, get rid of the objection in the meantime.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is this, that under the statute the Minister for Justice makes the Rules, but in order that the Minister for Justice should make the Rules he must have the approbation, in certain circumstances, of the Minister for Finance, and in all circumstances the approbation of the Rule-Making Committee. But even then the matter is not terminated, because before the Rules become effective they must be approved of by resolution of both Houses.  That is how the position stands.  Now the question which, as you, sir, pointed out, has arisen is as to the exact result which follows upon the rejection of two or three or more Rules, and as to whether that destroys the effect of all the Rules or simply renders inoperative these Rules to which objection has been taken.</P>
      <P>That is a difficult question.  I do not think it arises at this stage, and my hope, a somewhat confident one, is that the question will not arise later.  These Rules have been most carefully drafted by a committee of experts, and I apprehend that unless they feel something clearly wrong, something of which they clearly disapprove, it is unlikely that the Joint Committee will make many recommendations.  Such recommendations as they may make will not be on small points, but on something they consider to be important.  I imagine that the committee of experts appointed by this House and the Dáil would be composed of people appointed because of the fact that they are familiar with the practice of the courts.</P>

      <P>Fortunately for the lawyers, as the Senator points out, there are a great number of persons who have great experience of the courts and who are not lawyers, but who are litigants.  If there were no litigants there would be no lawyers.  If there is any Senator who has had a great deal of experience of the law courts, in the capacity of a litigant, he <Col N="499" /> would be an admirable person to have on the Committee.  To get away from that, I do not think an enormous number of alterations will be made.  After these matters have been carefully considered, I believe that the Rules brought forward will be in every respect satisfying to the Seanad and Dáil.  I think that the suggestion to have this Committee is a much better way of proceeding than any other that could be adopted.  These Rules of Court are highly technical.  They are not matters that could very well be debated by ordinary members, either in the Dáil or Seanad.  It is better, I think, to have some small body to go into them.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether any Senators have examined these Rules.  They are very bulky and make a rather portentous document.  I do not know that any Senator would care to go through them from cover to cover, or would desire to have a debate on them.  I really think that it is better to have them considered by a small body&mdash;in the nature of a talk over a table rather than by means of a debate in a legislative assembly.  I was very glad, if I may say so, to hear the remarks that fell from you, sir, that these Rules had shown very careful work on behalf of the Rule-Making Committee.  I have not been myself very much in touch with the Committee owing to the fact that the vast bulk of the Rules had been drafted and completed before I entered office.  But, from what I have seen myself of the Rule-Making Committee, I can say it certainly spared itself no labour.  I do not suggest that these Rules are perfect.  No Rules will be perfect.  It is very hard to say whether things like Rules of Court are going to be good or bad.  The main test is: Will they work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the supreme thing, to get your Rules into operation, and when they are in operation for a very short period it will be known whether there are defects.  That will be pointed out by experience far and away better than it could be pointed out by argument. As to what is likely to happen, I do not think that these Rules will stand for any long period of years.  Though the utmost pains have been spent on the <Col N="500" /> production of those Rules I am certain that inevitably defects must be found in them, and that some person, whether the Minister for Justice at the time or not, will come to this House again with amendments to these Rules.  You cannot expect them to be absolutely perfect. The sole test will be experience, and for that reason I venture to suggest to whoever is chosen on the Committee by this House and the other House, that these Rules are the product of expert brains, and that it should be left to experience to show if there are defects in them as they now stand.</P>

      <P>That is not quite correct.  We reported on them, and I might say in addition that I took the trouble to go through them myself. Afterwards I sent a very elaborate minute to the late Minister for Justice at his request.  I notice that most of the suggestions I made then have been adopted, so these Rules are very much like the Rules we had before us, but they are enlarged and made clearer and plainer, more intelligent to the ordinary reader.</P>
