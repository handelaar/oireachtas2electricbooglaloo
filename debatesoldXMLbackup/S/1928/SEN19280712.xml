      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;Section 5, to delete the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with and restricts the liberty given to a person accused of a criminal charge to appeal, and it <Col N="1026" /> restricts the liberty of the judges in dealing with that appeal.  The Minister, speaking on the Second Reading of the Bill, stressed that it was a novel thing in our administration of justice to have an appeal in a criminal case except in cases referred to as Crown cases reserved.  When it is remembered that on the merest grounds, in the case of civil action of one sort or another, it is open to a litigant to appeal, I think it peculiar that the Minister for Justice should stress the point that a person convicted of a criminal charge should be denied the liberty of having his case partly reheard or reviewed by another tribunal. I think that, when this measure was going through the Dáil, the Minister left a portion of this question to the free vote of the House. The two operative sections are subsections (a) and (b).  Sub-section (a) puts on judges, who have to decide that some part of the trial was informal, the onus of convicting that person, though in their view the informality was not material, in other words, the admission of some evidence which they thought should not have been admitted.  The judges are in the position of having to attach a certain amount of materiality to a piece of evidence without having seen the witnesses or without knowing the circumstances that prevailed when that piece of evidence was submitted, and vice versa.  They have to take on themselves to judge what effect that evidence would have on the minds of a jury.  I submit that is not the function of a judge.  If there is an informality I think the safer and the better course to pursue is that the conviction be quashed.  Under the section, where an informality of such a kind has occurred in the view of the court of appeal it vitiates the whole proceedings, and the judges have the power to order a re-trial.  As I said on Second Reading, in my view when a man goes into the dock for a second time and it is known that he has already been convicted by a jury, he cannot possibly get an absolutely fair trial.  It must of necessity weigh with the second jury that this man has already been convicted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> Lawyers are very conservative in those matters.  It is well within the recollection of most of us that the establishment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in England was very much opposed by prominent judges and barristers at the time.  It enabled an accused person to give evidence on his own behalf.  I remember reading in the memoirs of Sir Henry Hawkins the admission that he himself was very much opposed to permission being given to an accused person to give evidence on his own behalf, but after the Act had been passed, and the first time it arose in his own court that an accused person took advantage of the permission, he admitted that up to that point he had been very much prejudiced against the accused whereas upon hearing his evidence he readily admitted that the man completely changed his outlook on the case.</P>
    <P>Without stressing the matter unduly a number of prominent cases have occurred in our own time.  It was the Beck case that really caused the House of Commons to establish the Court of Criminal Appeal at all, because it was conclusively proved that the man had been wrongly convicted and wrongly imprisoned.  In the Maybrick case, the late Lord Russell of Killowen who defended the accused, always seemed to have some doubt as to the validity of the evidence and as to its justifying a conviction.  Then there is the case at present under consideration, the Slater case.  All this goes to show that in all good faith serious cases have occurred where accused persons have been convicted by juries, and those who are well competent to judge have really serious doubts about the validity of the convictions. I submit that a person accused of a criminal charge, whose liberty is imperilled, should not be in any worse position than a person seeking damages in the civil courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator may not be aware that the provision in sub-section (a) is precisely the same as that in the civil courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but to my mind where a man's liberty is imperilled that is a far graver and <Col N="1028" /> more serious thing than any civil matter.  The power given under sub-section (b) of this section where the courts can order a new trial by reason of some serious informality in the first trial runs counter to the principle of <i>autrefois acquit</i> which really is a great safeguard to an accused person that he should not be imperilled on the same charge a second time.  For the reasons that I have given, and having regard to the fact that in the other House a portion of this question was left to the free vote of the House and passed by a big majority I ask Senators to support me in moving the deletion of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very strongly opposed to this amendment and to all the amendments down in the name of my friend, Senator Dowdall.  The effect of all of them is really the same.  What the Senator wants to do is to give an absolute right to everybody who is convicted by a jury of his fellow-citizens of a crime, either to get off altogether or to get a new trial for any technical error, whether that technical error in the opinion of the court could possibly have effected the result of the trial or not.  That, in my opinion, does not accord either with common sense or with common justice.  It is the desire of everyone, of every good citizen and, I am sure, of every member of this House, that every person who is accused of a crime in this country should have a perfectly fair trial in accordance with the law.  That is why, very late in the history of our Judicature and of the English and Scotch systems, this court of criminal appeal was established. It was to ensure that if a person who was found guilty of a crime had not had a fair trial in accordance with the law, he should either have the right to be acquitted or the right of a new trial.  This is quite a new court, which was established in the interests of persons who have been convicted of a crime, but it is most important that it should not be turned into an institution for the purpose of enabling persons who have been convicted of crime of getting a second chance of getting off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does this section do?  Every human institution is liable to mistake in its operations and liable to error. <Col N="1029" /> There are two kinds of technical error which may occur in the course of a criminal trial.  One of them is the class of technical error which is of such a slight nature that, in the opinion of the Court, it cannot possibly affect the result of the trial; that if it had not occurred the result must be the same. In a case of that kind, what this section does is: it gives the Court of Appeal the right to refuse it, that is, the right to refuse the appeal where they think that although there has been this technical admission of evidence which ought not to have been admitted&mdash;some technical error of that kind&mdash;that yet no miscarriage of justice has taken place.  In that case it gives the court the right to refuse the appeal.  In the other case, where the error is of such a nature that the court has the slightest doubt as to whether it could have affected the issue or not, in that case they have to order a new trial&mdash;with power as regards the costs.  Nothing, I think, could be fairer than that, and am I not right in saying that that is consistent common sense and common justice?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (a) of this section, to an ordinary layman at least, is not only unique but in some respects amazing.  The paragraph reads:&mdash;&ldquo;The court may, notwithstanding that they are of opinion that a point raised in an appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; is not in the paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to know that it has been knocked out, but it was in the Bill as originally introduced, from which I have been reading. The deletion of the word certainly makes this part of the section less objectionable.  One finds it difficult to see what are the real functions of the Court of Appeal.  Being convinced that the appeal should be dismissed according to the ordinary law, they still think that the appeal should be upheld. Sub-section (b) enables a man who is actually acquitted by the Court of Appeal, where they reverse the conviction as a whole, to be re-tried on the <Col N="1030" /> same charge by a jury again.  The paragraph says:&mdash;&ldquo;Where the court reverses a conviction in whole, the court shall have jurisdiction to make an order (in this section referred to as an order for a re-trial).&rdquo;  So that the person is re-tried on a charge in connection with which the Court of Appeal has quashed the conviction.  There is a good deal of point in what Senator Dowdall has said, that a jury will find it very difficult to discharge from its mind the fact that the prisoner has already been tried and found guilty. It will be exceedingly difficult for the jury to get away from that fact, and I think it would be useless to suggest that it is not going to have some influence on the jury&mdash;an ordinary jury composed of citizens who are called in in the manner in which juries are summoned.</P>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister if this section has been introduced as a result of abuses of the law or owing to the fact that people have escaped punishment because of crimes known to be attributable to them.  Unless there is some good ground for it, it seems strange that it should be introduced just now.  The fact that a similar section operates in regard to civil cases is not, I think, a sufficient argument for introducing the section in a Bill of this kind, because the life and liberty of a human being are infinitely more important than some question or other relating to property or to some other civil matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not putting forward that at all as an argument against Senator Dowdall's amendment. I only mentioned it because the Senator said that accused persons ought to have the same advantages as people have in regard to a civil trial.  I only pointed out that in the case of a civil appeal the court has the power, if it thinks a miscarriage of justice does not really affect the result, to disregard it.</P>

      <P>At all events, this is a matter which I think should receive the very careful consideration of the House.  It is not a Party matter and does not affect one section any more than another.  But when it is a new feature that is being introduced in our <Col N="1031" /> law, one would expect that good reasons would be stated for the necessity for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney) James Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Farrell stated that sub-section (a) was unique. I do not know exactly what he means by unique in this context.  If unique means that it does not exist in any other place, and that it is a new principle that is being brought into Ireland, he is entirely wrong, because that sub-section, word for word, is in the English and Scotch Acts, and this is only bringing us into line with England and Scotland, which have courts operating just as our courts do. There is this one difference between the wording of the Scottish section and the wording of this section now.  The word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; is in the Scottish Act, and was in the original draft of this Bill, but that word has now been left out of this section.  My own opinion is that whether the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; is there or not there, it makes no difference.  Senator Dowdall, I think, in all the points which he put forward, has been completely answered by Senator Brown.  I am not going to waste the time of the Seanad by repeating the arguments which Senator Brown put forward.  There is just one thing, however, that I would like to refer to, and that was the point put forward by Senator Dowdall and Senator O'Farrell, that a person should never be tried twice for the same offence.  I am in complete accord with that.  That is a very sound principle, and no part of this section infringes upon that principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once a man has been finally tried, once the proceedings against him have terminated in favour of or against him, and he is in the one case acquitted or in the other case serving whatever sentence has been passed upon him, that is distinctly the end of it.  That does not mean, and cannot be taken as meaning, and never has meant, that a man never should be tried twice.  Men are repeatedly tried twice and tried three times.  If a jury disagree, a man is put on trial again, and always has been.  This is no more an infringement of the doctrine of <i>autrefois acquit</i> or <Col N="1032" /><i>autrefois convict</i> than putting a man on trial for the second time when a jury has disagreed, because there has been no final determination of his case. The Court of Appeal has come to the conclusion, whether it was because of the fault of the Crown Prosecutor or the judge, or the fault of the counsel for the defence, that the case was not properly presented to the jury, and that the jury were not in a position fairly to say &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; or &ldquo;not guilty,&rdquo; and they say that, in the interests of the prisoner and of the community, the man should be tried again and that justice as between the State and the accused person should be done.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that there is a certain amount of sentimentality with regard to accused persons in this country.  We know that very often the people of this country do not come to the assistance of the Guards and do not give information in the way they should.  I am glad, however, to say that the position in that respect is not as bad as it was. We know that at one time jurymen refused to convict, even upon clear evidence, and in the most ordinary cases. I know one county in which I used to practise myself&mdash;I think, sir, you will have knowledge of it&mdash;in which I do not think there had been a conviction for years.  That is the sort of sentimentality that the guilty person should be let off in all circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">

    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> Section 5, sub-section (1).  To delete in lines 16-17 the words &ldquo;may by such order give such directions as to costs as they may consider proper&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;shall order that the costs of the appeal and of the new trial of the accused person shall be paid by the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that what you are seeking to do under this amendment is to give the accused man, as of right, the costs of his first trial. As the section stands at present, that is in the discretion of the Court to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Where the Court of Appeal decides that the informality that has taken place is of such a magnitude as to quash the conviction and to order a new trial, my amendment seeks to secure that the defendant is not mulcted twice in costs: that he should be allowed the costs of the appeal, even though he has to stand his trial again on the original charge. The Minister for Justice has stated that this may have been due to misdirection on the part of the judge, or to the State Prosecutor or to the counsel for the defence.  I think it is very rarely that counsel for the defence convicts his own client.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, at all events, it is not usually considered his function. I will not put it higher than that.  I have served on juries from time to time and I have not seen it occur very often. It might happen, of course, that an indiscreet question might give rise to a particular line of cross-examination with results not anticipated when the question was put, but that does not happen very often.  At least it does not happen very often in Cork.  I submit that where a trial is vitiated by such an informality that, in the view of the Court of Appeal, a new trial should be ordered, that then the accused person is in all fairness entitled to his costs of the appeal, the costs either of his first trial or the second trial rendered necessary by such an informality being allowed to creep in.  I think that is only fair and reasonable.  After all, in <Col N="1034" /> civil actions the costs follow the decision and I think that is only fair.</P>
      <P>If I might advert for a moment to the charge of sentimentality it should not be attributed to me by the learned Minister for Justice.  If he comes to deal with me he will not find a great deal of sentiment.  I have no sympathy, good, bad or indifferent with the commission of crime in this country, either for ordinary criminal motives or for political motives.  None whatever. Let me disabuse the mind of the Minister on that.  My mind is perfectly clear on that.  But, in such cases as I am putting before the Seanad where the fault is not to be attributed to any action of the prisoner and where he is simply taking advantage of the legal avenues open to him, I think that in cases where a mistake is made against him that he should not be made pay for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal more sympathy with Senator Dowdall's amendment on the question of costs than I have with his other amendments. I think the way the matter stands is this: if a technical point was raised in the court below and decided against the prisoner or his counsel and that it had to go to the Court of Appeal he ought to get his costs.  I think that any judge or any court of appeal exercising the discretion which is given the Court under this section would give him his costs.  But, there are cases where the point is not raised in the court below. It may have been that the prisoner had not counsel or that if he had counsel that his counsel did not see the point when it was raised and when the case was going on, and only raised it afterwards in the court of appeal.  In that case he ought not to get his costs.  I think it would be better and safer to leave it in the discretion of the court which, I think, will always be exercised in the way of justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  It may be that I am a sentimentalist, but in this case at all events it is obvious that the appeal was justified.  In other words, the appellant has won, and though he is a criminal I think he should not be deprived of the victory which he has won in the court of appeal.  So far as <Col N="1035" /> the costs that he has incurred in bringing his appeal are concerned, it is optional with the court to decide whether he is to get his costs or not, but I think it ought not to be optional. I think that a man once he has won an appeal ought to get his costs of the appeal.  He has already had the costs of the original trial, and then these are the costs of the appeal.  I think it is only equitable and right that he should get the costs of the new trial. I support the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11.  To delete the section. I do not intend to press this amendment.  I wish, however, to remind the House that in all cases of appeal the appeal is mainly on the report of the official stenographer to the court.  As we know, and as I think the Minister rather led us to believe, it has been found that these reports are faulty, and I think he said the whole question was under consideration.  The reporting of the proceedings here and in the Dáil is as nearly humanly perfect as it is possible to have it, but speaking on the Dentists Bill I used the word &ldquo;pathology&rdquo; and I was reported as using the word &ldquo;mythology.&rdquo;  Of course, I admit, that the acoustic properties of this <Col N="1036" /> building are faulty.  The same thing applies to a great many of the courts. This system of appeal, based on the reports of the official stenographers, is, and necessarily must be, faulty, no matter how expert the stenographer is, by reason of the fact that a man physically cannot report hour after hour all that goes on in Court and write it out probably at night.  Secondly, I submit that the reports do not give the Court of Appeal adequate grounds upon which to frame a judgment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to see this section knocked out.  In my opinion, it is one of the most useful sections in the Act.  I agree with Senator Dowdall that the present system of appeal from the Circuit Courts is highly unsatisfactory.  But this is a most useful section as long as we have this highly unsatisfactory system of appeal. It gives the Court of Appeal in every case, whether the stenographer's report is forthcoming or not, the power of summoning evidence of their own before the court either by affidavit or the production of witnesses.  But it does more than that, because where the stenographer's report is not forthcoming it gives this court the right of trying the whole case over again, by hearing witnesses or by affidavits or whatever way it likes.  In fact, it sets up a court of appeal, of which one of the best features is a re-hearing.  It is a most useful section, and I would be very sorry indeed to see it deleted.</P>

      <P>I have to offer a final protest against the passing of this Bill, which constitutes a piece of political dexterity that is neither creditable to its authors nor beneficial to the prestige and stability of our political institutions.  No attempt whatever has been made to justify the deletion of the Referendum, one of the items dealt with in the Bill.  We have had vague meanderings about the almost certain abuse of this instrument if it were retained. An attempt has even been made to connect up the existence of the Referendum with the question of national production. There has been similar brilliant nonsense from both Ministers and Senators trying to make excuses for a Bill of which, inwardly, I think, they must feel heartily ashamed, and in connection with which they undoubtedly feel serious misgivings because of the example it sets to all Governments of the future that may be equally reckless and unscrupulous.  The broad fact remains that the Referendum is in actual operation in progressive, industrious and prosperous States, and that no evidence has been adduced to show that it has been or is being abused. There has been no attempt, or apparent intention on the part of the Governments of these States, to expunge it from their Constitutions.  The Referendum has not been tried here, and consequently has not been abused here.  It is no wonder that, in these circumstances, the supporters of this Bill have not attempted to try to defend or justify what the Bill proposes to do. <Col N="1038" /> Senator Jameson, on the Second Reading, said that we had no need for the Referendum because the people had the power of electing their legislators, while on the very next day he voted for a Bill which abolishes popular election to one House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Senator MacLoughlin, in stentorian tones, said that we defeated conscription in 1918 without the Referendum. The inference to be drawn from that statement is so clear that his laboured attempt at explanation yesterday only rendered it all the more unmistakeable. His hint to the electors, in connection with a Bill to which serious objection is taken by a very large section of the people, is this: &ldquo;You know what you did in connection with the attempt to enforce conscription. Start off with a general strike.  Form committees of defence in every parish. Arm men to the teeth and make every house an entrenchment.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>At all events, the Senator may not be fully informed of what was happening in those days. That is what happened when a Bill supported by a very influential minority in this country was objected to by a majority and was rendered absolutely inoperative.  The Senator suggests this peaceful constitutional method as a very desirable alternative to the violent and unconstitutional method of the Referendum.  Senator Sir Walter Nugent told us that he never liked the Referendum.  Well, I can appreciate, while I do not agree with, the viewpoint of the Senator because he served his political apprenticeship with a Party which did not <Col N="1039" /> approve of any effective popular voice in political affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who remembers the proceedings at National Conventions of the United Irish League will, I believe, see the Senator's difficulty. However, we had hoped that we had passed away from the stage where the views of the Party executive were enforced at national gatherings by the gentle persuasion of the baton on occasions.  Senator O'Hanlon made the most unconvincing speech that I have ever heard him make in this House. Might he permit me to say that he almost invariably makes an exceedingly able case for his point of view, but when he was speaking yesterday one felt that he was merely apologising for the vote that he was going to give, and that he could make an infinitely better case against the Bill than he made for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that I was surprised and disappointed to hear Senator O'Hanlon, whom I took to be a man of peace like myself, deploring the fact that the operation of the Referendum might prevent the country engaging in some just war, as he put it, in the future.  I suppose he meant, for instance, a war to end war like the last war, or a war to make the world safe for democracy. Certainly he did not mean invasion because under the Constitution not even the assent of the Oireachtas is necessary for the country to enter upon war.  The Senator, therefore, meant a foreign war, in other words, a war in which we should be the aggressors inasmuch as we would have at least to cross the seas. Senator O'Hanlon, in the event of something occurring in some foreign country in the future that appeals to his higher sentiments, wants to be in the position to take his gun from behind the rafters and hang his harp upon the willow tree and take himself away to some foreign battlefield.  He ridiculed the idea of delay in a matter of that kind taking place as a result of the Referendum.  I feel that if he ever does visualise a position in which a decision is entered upon to go to war, or that it is decided upon to go to war at some midnight meeting of the Cabinet, that the Senator will answer the call of the <Col N="1040" /> bugle and that he would have the approval of Senators MacLoughlin, Nugent and Jameson.</P>
    <P>I suppose Senator MacLoughlin would be ready to put him into a bullet-proof shirt, and that Senator Sir Walter Nugent would see that he was taken away by a special train to the nearest port, while perhaps Senator Jameson would recommend him to take with him a little drop of &ldquo;three star&rdquo; to give him courage to go over the top.  When the Senator had gone away his three colleagues would march home to engage in the monotonous if comparatively safe task of keeping the home fires burning.  But Senator O'Hanlon would not be the only person engaged in a war of that kind.  There would be others, the sons, brothers, and fathers and husbands who would also have to go to the front if they were to win glory on this distant battlefield.  There would be the mothers who would have to give up their sons, wives giving up their husbands, their bread winners, and these people might like to have something to say as to whether they should participate in a foreign war in which they had no particular interest, to say nothing at all of those who would have to pay in treasure if they did not pay in blood.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Hanlon ridiculed what he termed the street corner orator and the platform politician who would come into play in the event of a Referendum. I fancy that Senator O'Hanlon has won fairly brilliant spurs even in that noble art.  I have an idea myself of seeing him come back covered with the dust of the Kilkenny bye-election and feeling apparently as proud of it as if he had flown across the Atlantic. He certainly supported the Party that does not despise platform oratory or the soap-box political art.  In view of the arguments which I have mentioned as being the only excuse advanced in support of this Bill, it is I think clear to all that its authors felt that it was incapable of being defended, and I believe that if there was the respect for the Constitution which should be in any country that has a written Constitution, that this Bill would be speedily sent back to the source from which it sprang.  But no excuse has been made for it at all.  No justification <Col N="1041" /> even has been pleaded for it except the plea of Party expediency, and even that does not seem to be particularly urgent.  I do not see that there is any great necessity for it.  It strikes a blow at the stability of our institutions and damages the respect which all Parties and the people as a whole should have for the Constitution, which, as I stated before, should be looked upon us the fundamental law of the land.  For that reason, I am going to vote against the Fifth Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'HANLON Mr. O'HANLON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not speak of the question of war, and I did not advocate war.  The only comment that I made in that respect should be perfectly obvious even to Senator O'Farrell, if he chooses to see the obvious in that respect.  As regards the position of the Seanad and the Referendum, the Seanad is replacing an instrument which it did not use, and was unlikely to use, by an instrument which gives this House the powers of delay. That is an instrument which it should use.  The power of delay by the Seanad has been increased under the legislation at present before this House.  That power of delay has been increased from nine months to twenty months, thereby increasing in a practical way the powers of this House and giving it a very practical instrument to use.  Listening to Senator O'Farrell reminded me of nothing more than an appendix. No one has ever yet been able to discover what an appendix is for or what are its uses.  Perhaps even my friend Senator Gogarty would not be able to write the thesis on its use.  Like the Referendum, the appendix is an exceeding dangerous thing, but it is of no use as the Referendum is of no use.  But, when it proves a source of irritation it naturally has to come out, and so it is with the Referendum&mdash;it has to come out.  When the Referendum proves an irritation, and when there can be little use made of it, then the thing to do with it is to get rid of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not present on the second stage of this Bill.  That is partly my excuse for speaking now. My objection to the Referendum is a totally different one to the grounds upon which it is opposed by Senator O'Farrell and others who are not in <Col N="1042" /> favour of the Bill.  I believe the only function of a Referendum is to prevent legislation being passed.  If you had a Referendum only on issues of vital importance to the people, and it is still provided in the Constitution as it stands for Constitutional amendments after eight years, you would have a somewhat different proposition to deal with.  We are told that people who are fit to elect to the Dáil are fit to vote on a separate measure which is put before them.  The experience of other countries is that the Referendum is the most conservative instrument that has yet been found for the prevention of legislation. I think if Senator O'Farrell will look into the effects of the Referendum in the countries he has referred to he will find that almost invariably if a Bill is objected to it is rejected. No Bill has ever passed to which some people will not have objection.  If the Bill is vital to the life of a Government, or if the life of an Opposition depends on it, both parties will spend money and people will be instructed in the same manner as in a General Election, and you will get every information on the Bill.  If there was a practical method on vital matters of getting the opinion of the people, irrespective of the issue whether this Government was to remain in power or not, I would not be opposed to the Referendum. Personally I feel almost a grievance that the talk on the rights of the people that we would have from Senator O'Farrell was prevented owing to his not being able to move his amendment. If he had been able to move his amendment we would then have seen the form in which the Referendum would maintain the rights of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I met a lady who had been studiously reading Senator O'Farrell's speeches, and she asked me whether he was joking or in earnest.  I do not know, but to-day we know he has put in some effective joking. I am inclined to think in much of the solemn talk we had about the rights of the people and being undemocratic that there was an element of joking in it, in view of the fact that what we are doing is removing one of the most conservative pieces in our Constitution.  The Constitution was drafted by a Committee of which I <Col N="1043" /> was a member.  It was turned upside down by the Dáil.  How much I am responsible for it or not I do not know, but at any rate I would not be ashamed to say I changed my mind if I did so.  Under proportional representation I believe you will always have a party with two-fifths in the Dáil in opposition.  You will never have such a difference as you might have in England.  The result is that as the section which we have taken out of the Bill stands, whether it be the people in support of the present Government or the Opposition, there will always be delays to the so-called Referendum.  You are not taking away the rights of the people, but you may take away the rights of certain Parties to thwart useful legislation because it did not suit them at the time.  I strongly support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I opposed the passing of this Bill in all its stages.  I am totally opposed to taking away from the people the rights which they got under the Constitution.  The principal argument in favour of taking these rights away and passing this Bill is that people can always have a General Election, and that at a General Election they can express their views by electing representatives who will carry out their wishes.  There is this difference between an election and a Referendum in that in a Referendum there is only one matter put before the electors, and it is much easier for people to come to a decision on one matter than to decide on the various matters that are put before them by the different parties in a General Election. I would find it quite easy to vote in a Referendum to decide whether a Bill was a desirable one or not.  Take it, for instance, that a Bill, say a Prohibition Bill, was passed here, and in fact a Prohibition Bill may be passed at some time or other, it would be quite easy for the electors to say whether they wished that Bill passed or not.  There would be nothing to complicate them in coming to a decision.  On the other hand, at a General Election, I would be faced with several items in the programme <Col N="1044" /> of each political party.  There may be some items in a political programme of which I would approve, and others of which I would disapprove, and I would be in a quandary as to whether I should vote partly for one group and partly for another.  For instance, I would be very glad to support the party that would have a programme for encouraging industry and manufactures, and for consuming the produce of this country and make it self-supporting. I would be very anxious to support a party that would have that policy in their programme, and I would also be desirous of supporting a party that would endeavour to have the Treaty carried out to its full extent, especially as regards the taking up the question of financial relations with Great Britain, and, in particular, as to whether or not we should retain the annuities.  I would be very desirous to support that programme, but the party with that programme might also have in their programme a repudiation of the National Loan, and the commitments that the Dáil and Seanad have already agreed to.  Between the two programmes I would find myself in a very awkward position, and would find a difficulty in deciding as to how I would vote.  In the case of a Referendum, as I have said, there is only one matter to be decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not imagine that there are many voters so wanting in intelligence that they could not decide how to fill their voting papers according to their views. This is only one of a series of Bills which have been brought forward to change the Constitution.  As a matter of fact, those Bills are tearing the Constitution to pieces.  The Constitution is regarded as only a scrap of paper.  We cannot assume that the present Government will last always.  It happens that Opposition Governments come in now and again, and when this Government makes eighteen or twenty amendments in the Constitution we cannot be sure that their successors may not make eighteen or twenty more amendments, and then where will we be with our Constitution?  I think all those Bills were brought forward because the Government got into a state of panic.  Evidently the whole object of this is to prevent a Referendum on the question <Col N="1045" /> of abolishing the Oath.  I think there is no necessity for them to be so alarmed, because even if, as a result of the Referendum, people decided in favour of abolishing the Oath, that would not have effect, because even if the Oath were taken out of the Constitution it is still to be found in the Treaty, and in the Act establishing the Constitution it is laid down that any amendments to the Constitution which are repugnant to the Treaty shall be null and void and of no avail.  But, even assuming that the result of the Referendum would have that effect, I think it is not playing the game fairly, because the Constitution is really the rules of the game between the political parties.  It is hardly playing the game when matters appear to go against one side that, instead of taking their defeat, they want to alter the rules so that they might succeed.  It is very doubtful if before very long the Government might not have reason to regret that they did not retain the Referendum in the Constitution, and it may then be seen that the members of the Seanad who opposed the passing of this Bill have more sense than they are being credited with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that we have had at last an utterance from Senator Douglas, who, I understand, played a very important part in drafting the Constitution.  I am in the position of the lady referred to who questioned him about Senator O'Farrell's speeches, as to whether he was joking or in earnest, because the Senator gave us no inkling as to why he had in the course of the last five years changed his views on the question of the Referendum, because I must assume, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that he must have been in favour of the Referendum when the Constitution was drafted.  Surely the Referendum has not been tried or practised, and it would be rather interesting if the Senator gave us some logical explanation as to why he adopts rather the attitude of the dog returning to his vomit.  That is the only intelligent explanation one can get of his action in this case.  I was glad to hear Senator Linehan gave a sensible and dispassionate explanation of the attitude he and some of us have taken up in this case. It is not a popular thing to have to <Col N="1046" /> stand up in a small minority in these matters, but one has to use one's judgment to the best of one's ability and form one's reason of the facts.  Incidentally, I was rather interested to discover from the remarks of Senator Douglas that I appear to be the only consistent person in the Opposition, for I am not ashamed to say that I stand a Conservative, although I have been deserted by other Senators whom I know to be Conservative.  Senator O'Farrell has the misfortune to find himself in strange, uncongenial company, but I am the only member of this House who is consistent to his political creed.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>During the whole course of this discussion I was hoping we would learn something of the use of the Referendum and get some indication of the reasons people had for retaining it.  I find, as the speeches went on, they were getting poorer in quality. I want to tell Senator Linehan that I do not dispute the right of the people to change the Treaty, or to say that the Oath must go, but, unlike him, I would not take the line of looking to a safeguard in law to protect us in that respect. My objection, if I have any objection to that, is that the people must select their instrument to effect the change.  I am not going to do the work of Senator Linehan's or Senator Sir John Keane's friends, for I do not believe in that policy.  It is a nice thing to say people can easily decide on one thing.  That is political nonsense, democracy gone mad.  If you ask them if they would like a tax on tea they would say &ldquo;No,&rdquo; or if they would like a tax on sugar they would say &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and you could go on in that way to the last of your taxes and you will find they do not want any of them.  You are not presenting them with a fair and honest question when you say there are some important matters of legislation which you could put to the people and which they could decide.  Equally, the Senator will find on the programme of every political Party in the State something with which he agrees or disagrees. That is the usual position of a crank.  You will never find a person in that position doing any good for himself or anybody else.  Government <Col N="1047" /> carried out on democratic principles is mainly government by Parties.  In modern times, with proportional representation, a greater diversity of views can be expressed than under the old system.  The main consideration is, you must get a Government.  I would like to see a Government in which Senators Linehan, O'Farrell and Sir John Keane would be the moving spirits.  If it happened, although it would be only for a day, it would afford some amusement, but it would not contribute to stability.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Farrell said this was a blow to the stability of the country.  If there is any people in the world who have a clear idea of political freedom and of democracy, and the rest, it is the people of this country.  I doubt if there is any country which is stronger in the intensity of its political Parties than this country, and yet how many public meetings have been held to denounce the removal of Articles 47 and 48 out of the Constitution?  Senator O'Farrell has not had one.  A member of the other House, who was at the bottom of the poll in an election a short time ago, presided at one meeting.  The position is that people take no interest in this, for the people have the political insight to know that you cannot get your laws dealt with simply by a Referendum and decided as Senator Linehan wants.  That is ridiculous.  If every issue had to be put singly to the people you would get no result.  As everyone knows, a Government makes a lot of political opponents one way or another in the course of transactions, and the weaker members of the Party fall away.  Senator Sir John Keane says Senator O'Farrell has gone to his way of thinking, and if Senator Linehan belongs to any Party he has probably gone from it now.</P>

      <P>In view of the references of Senator Sir John Keane, perhaps I would be allowed to state the position on the original Constitution Committee and other committees set up.  I do not want to go into my reasons any more on it for, as I said, I would be abusing the privilege of the House.  The members of the original Constitution Committee, at a meeting, jointly prepared drafts for the Provisional Government.  They arranged not to publish their opinions as to the attitude they took in the proposals. The draft, altered in many respects, was submitted to the Dáil sitting as a constituent Assembly, and it proceeded to alter the drafts submitted to it by the Provisional Government.  The original members of the Committee were granted freedom to speak and vote as they wished on the proposals. It is only right to say there is nothing in the Constitution of which every member of the original Committee approved. It is known that a Committee was appointed by the Government a couple of years ago to make certain recommendations. That sat and it made recommendations for certain constitutional changes, including the abolition of this section.  Members of that Committee sat on the same terms&mdash;that their votes would not be published, and that they could speak and take any action they wished.  I think the same applied to the Committee of the two Houses set up with regard to the changes, and that the members of the Committee were free to speak and act as they thought fit.  I only mention this in view of Senator Sir John Keane's challenge, and because I think it should be on the records of the House.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That it is hereby declared that the Bill entitled the &lsquo;Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Bill, 1928,&rsquo; which has this day been passed by Seanad Eireann, is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace and safety.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The passage of a resolution in these or similar terms by the Seanad is the only means of securing that the Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Bill, which has for its object the removal of Article 47 of the Constitution on the ground that this Article is undesirable and dangerous, will not be held up by virtue of the very Article which it is intended to remove.  Indeed, we have had sufficient warning of the danger that exists that this course would be resorted to. The opponents of this Bill have stated their intention to use every possible method open to them to oppose the present measure.  One of the courses still open to them is to endeavour to secure 62 signatories from amongst members of the Dáil to a demand which will operate to suspend the Bill for 90 days, giving them 90 days to go round the country to collect the signatures of one-twentieth of the voters on the register, and thereby to force a Referendum on the people.</P>
      <P>We know that the principal Party in opposition to this Bill would only require to obtain five additional signatories in the Dáil to start the Article operating.  We know that they have an organisation sufficiently strong to secure that five per cent. of the electorate would joyously commit the remainder to the expense and disturbance which a Referendum would entail. There is, therefore, grave reason to apprehend that unless this door is closed by the passage of the resolution on the Order Paper, the country will be faced with a Referendum on this Bill abolishing the Referendum.  There will be no finality to this question.  It would go on like a recurring decimal.  It is because of this danger and in view of it that I ask the House to say that the immediate passage of this Bill is necessary if the public peace and safety are not to be endangered.  We have all seen how public business has been consistently and openly obstructed since the introduction of these measures.  We have already had an example of the devices which can be and have been resorted to to hinder and delay the work of Parliament.  In the passage of this Bill through the other House there were scenes of gross disorder and a determined effort made to turn the Dáil into a bear-garden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it seriously contended that the extension of these tactics to the wider sphere of the Referendum, with the greater opportunities for misrepresentation which would present themselves, with the certainty of excited appeals to the electorate upon false and dishonest issues, would not endanger the public peace?  Is it seriously contended that the public safety is not endangered by attempts to delude the people into taking a course which would inevitably result in the breaking of the Treaty?  The present measure was introduced, and its passing has become urgent, by reason of an attempt to do this.  An attempt was made and is being persisted in to force the majority in the Oireachtas by the machinery of Article 48 of the Constitution, which this Bill deletes, to facilitate the delusion of the people into the belief that the oath of membership of the Oireachtas <Col N="1051" /> could be abolished without taking the consequences; that an international agreement was susceptible of alteration at the hands of either Party thereto&mdash;that the people had only got to vote for the abolition of the oath and the oath was abolished and nothing would happen, that everything in the garden would be lovely, and the last barrier to the prosperity of the country would be removed.  These beliefs have been sedulously cultivated, and the fact that a campaign of this nature is on foot, and that it has been sought to utilise Article 48 in this dishonest manner should open our eyes to the danger to the Treaty that lurks in this movement, and, of course, any danger to the Treaty is a danger to the public peace.  The mere fact that this present measure has been attacked along lines calculated to incite ill-will between sections of the people, and that the opportunities which a Referendum would afford would be utilised still further for this purpose, are, I think, ample grounds for declaring that the measure is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace and safety.</P>

      <P>If I may be permitted to intervene at this moment on the resolution before the Seanad, I should like to say that the view of the Government is that the resolution is necessary.  I make that assertion not in any alarmist spirit, not to make anyone uneasy, not to indicate that there is a departure from peace and order, but simply to say that in the opinion of the Government the measure which has just passed is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace.  It will be within the recollection of the Seanad that a General Election took place in June, 1927.  It was a model of public decorum.  Within a month we were confronted with a national tragedy. The ordinary citizen was shocked, the public was horrified.  National confidence received a rude shock.  Looking back over the events of the past five years we find various incidents, however in themselves detached, which evidence the presence of organised <Col N="1052" /> attempt to provoke disorder&mdash;having a certain political tinge, and all conceived and planned in defiance of representative government and organised authority.  The sad and deplorable event of July, 1927, was not the last example of a deplorable excess.</P>
      <P>It may be, and I feel confident the Seanad agree with me in the hope, that these incidents are the last flickering sparks of the disturbed conditions which arose early in 1922 and continued for some time in 1923.  But I have no information, nor have I seen any indication, that those responsible for these periodic outrages have even now accepted the decision of the people in General Elections.  The Constitution as it was before the Amending Bill was introduced contained clauses, some repugnant, some favoured, by political Parties in the State A good deal of heat is imparted by these political Parties on the various occasions they address themselves to these provisions.  Exaggerated statements are made concerning them and allegations made likely to foment civil strife and commotion.  In the event of this resolution not being passed these exaggerations would arouse angry passions and provoke breaches of the peace.  The right of the people to decide national issues is preserved in the Constitution.  I would fail in my duty as head of the Government if I did not say solemnly and sincerely that the passage of this resolution is in the interests of the immediate preservation of the public peace.</P>

      <P>I for one am not going to vote for a resolution which I believe to be a lie.  I would not be paying any compliment to the intelligence of those who moved and seconded it if I said they did not know it was not. Would it not be far better if we were bluntly told the truth in regard to this? The President said that the election in June was a model of decorum, and I think the same term might be applied largely to the election in September, in which great and passionate issues were discussed and decided.  Now, in the event, the very unlikely event, of a Referendum taking place on this Bill, we are told that the whole peace of the <Col N="1053" /> country is going to be disturbed.  It would be very much better to say we are not going to give the country the opportunity of deciding on this, and that even if we were anxious to do it we are not, after a long Parliamentary Session, going to have a Referendum on this Bill.  There are many arguments one could advance in a human point of view which are not in the documents read by Senator MacLoughlin and the President.  It is putting a very severe tax on the followers of the Government in this House to ask them to vote for this resolution, and make the pretence to the public and all decent persons that they are voting for something they know to be true.  The resolution is not true, and if we pass it we will be passing a lie.  I am not going to vote for this resolution for that reason.</P>

      <P>I wish to protest against the resolution.  To my mind it is an abuse of language and an abuse of the Standing Orders of this House as regards the phrase that it &ldquo;is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace and safety.&rdquo;  It is nothing whatever of the kind.  Senator MacLoughlin, in moving the resolution, said that we were to be in fear and trembling lest perchance a Party in the other House, which is opposed to this measure, might by any possible chance get five hundred signatures.  What if they did?  Are not the elected representatives of the people to exercise their right of judgment in signing against this Bill, if they think it proper to do so?  Personally I do not think they are likely to do it.  But when we are told seriously here, and in a manner which is an insult to the intelligence of every one of us, that this is to preserve a democratic feature of the Constitution and to enable people to have sound, stable and fixed government, that is not true.  As a result of the last election, it is well to bear it in mind as between the two larger Parties in the State, the figures were 61 elected for the Government Party and 55 elected in opposition to it.  That is not counting the Independents or the Labour representatives, and when the Government speak as if they were the sole monopolists of the goodwill and good wish of this country they know it is not true <Col N="1054" /> to say that this Bill must be rushed through.  To say that such constitutional safeguards as are in the Constition should not be availed of is an insult to the intelligence of the House.</P>

      <P>One may be allowed to inquire into the mentality which seeks to retain the Referendum and to prevent this motion from passing.  If anyone could persuade me that the preservation of the Referendum was to serve democratic principles and to maintain stability in the country I should have been very loath to oppose it.  But when one thinks that every pettifogging subterfuge, every instrument that can be made to contradict itself in the Constitution, which had to be drawn up in order to put in writing the broadest issues of the Treaty; when one sees that is done to defeat stability and to obliterate not alone the Constitution but the Treaty itself, then the sooner the Constitution is rid of these stultifying elements the better, and it is high time to examine not alone the mentality but the personality of the people who have been so extraordinary solicitous for the retention of the Referendum: It is the usual attitude of the people who have been suppressed for a very long time, the attitude of the meaner part of the people, an attitude towards law and security in a form that is concentrated in the bootlegger towards the laws of the United States.  That is what one might have where there has been slavery for a very long time.  Slaves associate every Government, even there own, with an enemy act.  They consider that stability can only be British, and that if we have a Government in Ireland we should resist it in every way, and oppose it and upset it merely because for centuries and generations the British stood for law in this country.  There is never to be the outlook where the law can come from ourselves or themselves.  The resistance they show to their own laws is a kind of re-action to any form of liberty. When you consider the men whose devastating political career from petrol to perjury who are behind the resistance to this motion there is not a single word to be said for their attitude except the forgetfulness and ignorance of <Col N="1055" /> the country.  I think that dealing with them is more a matter for the Education Minister than for Senator Dowdall blaming the outrage on his intelligence. What is wanted is political and economic education for the people to neutralise the stupefying effect of the cosmopolitan intermediate system. If we had economic education in all the local National Schools we would never have the spectacle that has presented itself.  The United States has a written Constitution.  The British Constitution, which is not written, may be arbitrary where there are interests at stake.  It is lamentable that our Constitution had to be written, but it had to be written so that the terms of the Treaty could be included.  People have been deliberately humbugging by pretending that in the Referendum are terms of reference by which you can get rid of the oath.  It would be far honester for them to say that to get rid of the oath is to get rid of the Treaty. If there was less fomenting of contention by those who stand for what is called Republicanism there would be less emigration and more security in the Irish Free State.  It would be better to get the people to understand that they can evolve their own laws and change them than to be indulging in slogans and catch-cries on the rights of the people.  The whole issue is an economic and financial one.  This country is on the western seaboard of Europe, and apart from the springs of European civilisation, and so you have people here still capable of being humbugged.</P>

      <P>With reference to the statement of the President, I, for one, have been a consistent, if reluctant supporter, of measures to maintain public safety.  I have considered all along it is essential to act swiftly and surely in matters of public safety. Behind the President's speech I see the shadow of the Public Safety Act and the spectre of the gunman and if I believed those were realities at present, if I really believed that those dangers are likely to arise owing to failure to pass this resolution, I certainly would not vote against it, but I do not believe anything of the kind.  I do not like to suggest that the President is trying to <Col N="1056" /> make our flesh creep.  I think if he really believes that he justifies what Senator Linehan said some time ago, that the Government were acting in a panicky manner on this question.  I wish those were the real reasons for promoting this resolution.  Yesterday the President attempted a pleasantry at my expense when he said that I thanked God I was not as other men are.  I took the trouble this morning to verify the text, for I generally find a lurking fallacy in most parables.  I find that I was the pharisee and he was the publican.  The pharisee in those days was a hypocritical person who made a pretence and show.  The publican was not the publican of to-day but the tax-gatherer of a foreign power, an agent of the Romans dominating over the Jews, but in practice none of these analogies will bear close examination. In fact I should rather suggest that the tables should be turned and that the hypocrites are those who are going to vote for this resolution, and that in their hearts they believe it is not necessary in the interests of the preservation of public peace and safety.  They know it is not, and I pity them.  I pity the position of degradation to which they have been brought by the operation of the Party machine.  That is all it is; the party machine drawing them along and they have been unable to escape, like Sisyphus.  This reminds me of Potsdam, in 1914 and the specious policy that &ldquo;Necessity knows no law.&rdquo; That is what is written over this resolution&mdash;reluctance to trust the country&mdash; fear of public opinion.  According to the President we should trust the people.  This resolution is invoked in a totally different and, I venture to say, dishonest spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It comes badly from the Senator who moved this resolution and who talked about false and dishonest methods that are going to be employed if this Resolution does not pass.  Heavens alive!  I hold no brief for these people.  I feel as anxious as anybody for the preservation of the Treaty, not merely in the letter but in the spirit, in its inward and outward forms.  But I do not believe for one moment the Treaty is in jeopardy or the Oath if this resolution is not passed.  I think the only thing in jeopardy is the security of parties. <Col N="1057" /> The only peace concerned is the peace of darkness, the peace of the ostrich who hides its head in the sand and thinks it is not seen.  The President in talking of stability said &ldquo;Can we not trust the people.  Cannot we be satisfied with the Government in power and accept their good sense.&rdquo;  The precedent this resolution affords makes me seriously alarmed for our future stability.  This resolution is nothing but sharp practice, which sets an example to the other people, who will always go one better.  That is the danger. There is ample precedent for things we loath and detest in the action we see taken to-day.  It is for that reason I stand up with all sincerity to protest against the solemn farce we are about to enact.  I feel it is nothing more than part and parcel of a political vendetta.  It is not good. You are not giving your Constitution a fair chance.  It is taking a short view, trying to suppress, trying to sit on the safety valve of a boiler.  The only thing it does is to drive them underground and make them worse, and in those circumstances for every blow given two are returned.  Senator Gogarty referred to the British Constitution. <Col N="1058" /> A British Poet Laureate spoke of freedom broadening down from precedent to precedent, but what I say is this example is, it is freedom narrowing down from precedent to precedent.</P>

      <P>In dealing with this matter I have to ask myself the question whether there would be more excitement by a Referendum than there would be by a General Election, or whether it is more likely that the peace would be disturbed by taking the Referendum than by a General Election. I cannot understand the arguments that have been put forward&mdash;they were unconvincing to me&mdash;by Senator MacLoughlin, the President and Senator Gogarty.  I cannot see any grounds for believing that the Referendum cannot be as peacefully taken as a General Election.  For that reason, and because I wish to have that truth that we asked for at the commencement of our proceedings prevailing, I certainly could not bring myself to vote for a resolution in which I do not believe there is any truth.</P>
