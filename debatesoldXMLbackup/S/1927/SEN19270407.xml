      <P>Having explained the principles of the Bill, and the reasons why the promoters brought it before the House, I think it is well that I should now explain why they wish to withdraw it.  Of course, the real reason for the necessity of requesting permission to withdraw the Bill arose from a speech which was delivered by the Vice-President in the Dáil, when he was dealing with this matter.  In opposing the Bill on behalf of the Executive Council he referred to proofs of differences amongst the supporters of the scheme, the subscribers and others connected with it.  In the forefront of his proof that there was grave dissension amongst the subscribers and others, he referred to a letter written by you, sir, on 11th May, 1926, in which you stated that you could not recall the sequence of events in connection with the fund for the last four years.  Before the rest <Col N="718" /> of that letter was written I am sorry the writer's memory was not refreshed. As a result, there were statements made in that letter which, I believe, had the writer gone to the Committee and asked for information, would never have been made.  However, they were made, and they suited the convenience of the Vice-President to bring forward as evidence that the subscribers to the War Memorial were at variance.  The Vice-President did not make use of the answer that was given to that letter two or three days afterwards by Captain Henry Harrison.  The Committee of the War Memorial had the matter before them.  It was not considered that it was consistent with the dignity of the writer of the letter or the Committee that they should enter into a newspaper controversy as to whether the rights lay on this side or that.  It was decided that the matter should end there and then.  I believe the decision that the Committee took then was perfectly right.  The greatest mistake was made when the matter was raised again.</P>
      <P>The other matter to which the Vice-President referred was the attitude of the ex-service men.  He relied on statements made in this House by Senators Sir Bryan Mahon, and Sir William Hickie.  The question is a troublesome one and I do not think it is one which the ex-servicemen or any of the subscribers would thank the Vice-President for drawing attention to.  No good can be done by doing so. The real fact that the Minister had to disclose to the House was that the Executive Council had made a ruling. The facts connected with the matter were given in the resolution that I read to the House when I spoke here on a previous occasion.  I will read that resolution again:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That the National Executive Council of the Legion of Irish Ex-servicemen, having heard from their President details of the situation with regard to the National War Memorial Fund, wish to place on record the universal wish of the Council that the memorial should take the form of a statue, obelisk, or cenotaph of exceptional beauty and grandeur, sited in some central <Col N="719" /> part of the city of Dublin; that such monument should include adequate recognition of the deeds of the 10th, 16th, and 36th Divisions, and of all Irishmen who served in the Royal Navy, the Royal Artillery, Engineers, Air Force, Tanks, Machine Gun Corps, and all Corps and Departments of Armies in the field. They are unanimously in favour of the payment of a portion of the cost of the erection of the battlefield memorials in France, Flanders, and Serbia.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was communicated to the High Court when application was made to the Court for permission to proceed. The Committee then got advice which compelled them to go to the Seanad and Dáil for leave to go on with the Bill.  Why, after that, the ex-servicemen changed their opinion and how much real change there was no man knows.  I know that my friend Senator Sir Bryan Mahon always held the opinion that there should be some payment either to the soldiers or some special charities connected with their organisation.  I think I am interpreting him correctly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonMahon" hpid="Sir BRYAN MAHON Sir BRYAN MAHON">
      <NameTxt>Sir BRYAN MAHON</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I never stated or thought of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that was always the Senator's opinion, and that he was consistent in the attitude he adopted when he told the House that he objected to the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonMahon" hpid="Sir BRYAN MAHON Sir BRYAN MAHON">
      <NameTxt>Sir BRYAN MAHON</NameTxt>
      <P>My opinion has never changed.  My opinion was always that the Merrion Square scheme was a mistake.  I was opposed to it.  I never stated that the money should be given to ex-servicemen or spent in any other way except as a memorial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a small matter.  What I am trying to express is that as far as the Senator was concerned he was perfectly consistent in his opposition to the scheme.  His opposition did not appear when the application was made to the High Court.  We had no evidence at that time that he was opposed to the scheme. <Col N="720" /> As regards Senator Sir William Hickie, we had every evidence that he was entirely in favour of the scheme.  He was one of the promoters and one of the signatories to the scheme.  He backed it up in every possible way.  In the scheme as it was before the High Court there was a clause which sanctioned a payment of £1,500 to a project for the erection of crosses on the battlefields of France and Gallipoli. That amount was afterwards paid by the War Memorial Committee to a committee of which the Senator was a member. Anyone would have thought that he was in honour bound when he accepted part of the verdict of the court, to accept the whole verdict. Apparently Senator Sir William Hickie changed his mind.  Once that part of the matter was settled the Senator chose to come here and to oppose a scheme of which he was so long one of the principal promoters.  If a leader of the ex-servicemen changes his mind like that, I think there is not much to be surprised at if other people connected with the ex-servicemen do so. I hold that the mass of the ex-servicemen still believe in and agree with the resolution which I have read to the House.  I hardly think it was fair of the Vice-President to quote a bit of the letter of the Cathaoirleach as proof that there was a serious difference of opinion amongst the promoters of the Merrion Square scheme.  Even if there had been, the promoters of the scheme were perfectly willing to go before a Committee of this House, or of the two Houses, and to let those who opposed the scheme come forward on the other side.  We have no hesitation whatever in saying that, if that was all that was against this scheme, the Committee would have dealt with the matter as promptly as the High Court had done and give the same decision.  We were not in the least afraid of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was another question when we came to the real opposition: the announcement of the Vice-President that he opposed the scheme on behalf of the Executive Council.  He spoke of discontent and disagreement and the absence of something in the nature of substantial unanimity.  I tried to show the House how wrong the statement <Col N="721" /> was that there was a sharp diversity of opinion amongst the subscribers.  There is not a particle of evidence that such a state of affairs really existed.  We know that it is impossible that any scheme could be put forward in Ireland without having people differing with it.  A great deal of unanimity was obtained. Apparently it was the purpose of the Vice-President to decry that unanimity and to prove to the best of his ability that it did not exist.  I do not think that that was fair.  I think he had quite enough shots in his locker to end the scheme without bringing these matters forward.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to follow the Vice-President in his various arguments as to what strangers would think if the monument were erected in Merrion Square, but the opposition of the Executive Council was not a thing which the Standing Committee of Trustees of the War Memorial had the least reason to expect.  Both from letters and from conversation with some of the members of the Executive they were at least entitled to think that though there might be no very great approval there was certainly no very great disapproval of the scheme.  I suppose there were few greater thunderbolts launched on any Committee than there were when that speech was made by the Vice-President to the Dáil.  We may leave out the question of strangers, of history and all the rest of it, but I hold that the whole view-point of the Executive Council was voiced in the Vice-President's speech when he said: &ldquo;I do not want to see a little park in the front of this State's seat of Government dedicated to the memory of those who fell in the war.&rdquo;  That is the decision of the Executive Council and it is the decision which is now inflicted upon the Free State.</P>
    <P>We have been offered sites in Fitzwilliam Square or Parnell Square.  I think if the Vice-President had given any consideration to the matter at all he could have seen and known that these sites are utterly unfitted for such a memorial, and he might have spared us an offer which he knew we could not accept under any circumstances.  The fact is that our Government has decreed <Col N="722" /> that such a memorial is not to be erected in their neighbourhood, and that our scheme as regards the erection of a war memorial in Dublin is wrecked. The Committee accepts the inevitable and counsel is now being asked as to the steps which must be taken to satisfy the legal liabilities of our contributors, and to return the subscriptions, now that the effort to spend the money for the purposes for which it was subscribed has failed.  I ask the leave of the Seanad to withdraw the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. YEATS</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask a question of the promoters of the Bill.  The wisdom of the decision of the Dáil has been very much discussed, and I think it would help the community to give an enlightened decision if my question were answered.  If this Bill passed, the people of Dublin would have come into possession of Merrion Square as a park for ever.  I understand that the trustees of the Pembroke Estate will in twelve years be at liberty to sell Merrion Square as a building site.  It is inconceivable that the Dublin Commissioners should desire or, if they could prevent it, should permit that great open space to be built over.  I have heard, however, a very high sum mentioned as the price the Commissioners will have to pay for Merrion Square if they have to buy it.  There is no doubt that they would have to pay for its building value.  I would be obliged if you, sir, would permit Senator Jameson, who is perhaps best informed as to the facts, to reply to my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only information of a very casual kind, and I do not know that the valuation could be relied on very accurately.  I think I am certainly understanding the figures when I say that twelve years hence, with a building scheme attached to it, the site should be worth anything from £50,000 to £100,000.</P>
      <P>Leave given to withdraw Bill.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a second time.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be convenient for the purposes of the discussion on the Bill if I give a very brief outline of its contents.  The Bill is divided into six parts&mdash;five parts really, because Part 1 merely deals with definition.  Part 2 bears on the question of the hours of sale in licensed houses.  Part 3 refers to the question of endorsement, and Part 4 embodies a scheme for the reduction in the number of licences in the country.  Parts 5 and 6 are of lesser importance.  Inasmuch as the main purpose of the Bill is contained in Part 4, dealing with the reduction of licences, I might perhaps be permitted to take that out of its order and to give the scheme in outline to Senators. There are about 12,300 licensed houses in the State.  The report of the Intoxicating Liquor Commission sets out in its schedule the detailed figures.  The Commission which inquired into this matter was of opinion that that number of 12,000 odd premises permits of a very considerable reduction.  I would not care to attempt anything in the nature of a precise forecast as to the reduction that could take place.</P>
      <P>I am roughly of opinion that the public interest or the reasonable requirements of the public would not suffer on a reduction of that number by at least one-third.  That would mean the extinction of four thousand licences.  The general principle of the scheme is that the surviving licensees for a period of twenty years are expected to recoup the State for the money paid out in compensation for extinction.  The area that is taken as the unit is the area that is, in fact, the area for licensing purposes at the moment, the area served for summary jurisdiction purposes by a particular District Court, not by a particular District Justice but by a particular court of a District Justice.  There are 340 such areas in the State, and there will, therefore, be for the purposes of this scheme 340 units.  There will be credited to each such unit in my department a compensation fund, and when licences are extinguished, compensation will be paid out of that fund and the levy process will commence on the surviving licensed holders of that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> The process of extinction is that in the first instance a particular licence is challenged as redundant by the district officer before the District Justice.  If the District Justice is satisfied that there is a prima facie case he refers the matter to the Circuit Judge.  The Circuit Judge tries two issues really: (a) is there in fact redundancy in that particular licensing area, and (b) assuming that there is, is this the most appropriate licence to extinguish?  If he finds affirmatively on these two issues he proceeds, with the assistance of a competent valuer appointed under the Act to assess compensation, and when he has arrived at his decision in the matter of compensation, that decision is communicated to my department and the payment is made forthwith.  Over a period of twenty years altogether. with the licence duty, the State recoups itself from the surviving licence holders of that area.  There was much discussion in the Dáil as to what would be the proper area to take as the unit&mdash; whether it should not be the entire State or a county or some area different from that which is embodied in the provisions of the Bill.  If I had received from the organisation primarily concerned, the organisation of the licensed trade, a representation in favour of some other area, I would have given very serious consideration to such a representation, but in the absence of enlightment from that quarter I prefer the provisions in the Bill to anything else that has been suggested to me in the Dáil, because it keeps as closely as it is humanly possible to keep to the principle that the area which is to benefit should be the area of charge.</P>
    <P>If I were to take even the county as the area there might be many extinctions at one end of the county and none at the other end, forty, fifty, or perhaps sixty miles away, and the people in that part of the county in which no extinctions were taking place might well ask for what they were paying or what benefit accrued to them by the extinction of licences forty or fifty miles away.  The suggestion that the State might be taken as the unit and the compensation money collected from all the licensed holders of the <Col N="725" /> State equally, really seems to embody the fallacy of regarding the licensed trade as an entity, as something like a religious Order, as a Deputy in the Dáil remarked.  Of course they are not. They are simply a combination of persons engaged in the same calling who, for the purposes of self protection, propaganda and so on, found it convenient to come together in an organisation, and there is not that essential unity which would justify me in taking the entire area of the State as the appropriate area for this part of the Act.  I adhere therefore to the principle of simply taking each of these little pockets, these 340 court areas as the unit.  They are at present the unit for the purposes of licences and if licences are extinguished within any of those units, the compensation money should be paid by the surviving licensed holders in that area.</P>
    <P>Embodied in the following provisions of this Act there is a small state contribution. It is not a very substantial or material one, and in fact it will do no more than cover to some extent the administrative cost of this procedure suggested for the purpose of extinction. We can go more fully into that at perhaps a later stage.</P>
    <P>In the matter of extinction we will have to move with some care, and Senators may take it that it will not be left in the unfettered discretion or indiscretion of particular district officers but that there will be control from the Department, and there will be consultation and instruction as to how to proceed, because at one end there is the danger that if one goes too far or too fast in the matter of extinction it may give rise to the greater evil of she beening and great care will have to be taken in deciding what are the reasonable wishes of the public in this matter and how far one can go in the process of wiping out licences.</P>
    <P>Coming to Part 3 of the Bill, dealing with endorsement, Senators will remember that in the Act of 1924 certain offences were set out in the schedule, and convictions on any of these offences involved the automatic endorsement of the licence.  I have no apology to make <Col N="726" /> for that particular provision in the Act of 1924.  During the years 1922 and 1923 there was considerable laxity in the matter of licensing laws, as in the matter of other laws, and exceptional laxity can only be corrected by exceptional stringency.  That exceptional stringency was provided in the Act of 1924, and I am satisfied that it has had excellent results.  One can afford now to mitigate some of the severity of the Act of 1924 and, consequently, the provisions with regard to endorsement in this Bill are substantially less severe than the provisions that the Act of 1924 contained.  There is, for instance, new ground broken in the matter at present of attaching a lifetime to endorsement, the idea of reform comes in.  The first point I should, perhaps, make clear, is that no endorsement prior to the passing of this Act will be operative towards the extinction of a licence.  The first endorsement after the passing of the Act will have a lifetime of five years; the second will have a lifetime of seven years, and the third and any subsequent endorsement will have a lifetime of ten years.  If a holder of a licence has three live endorsements at any one time, then he goes out of business. But let me take a specific case. Let me suppose a man, within a few months of the passing of this Bill, is convicted of some offence which warrants the endorsement of his licence. That endorsement has a lifetime of five years.  Let us suppose three years after he is again convicted of one of those major offences, then that man will have two dangerous years&mdash;quite dangerous &mdash;in which another endorsement would put him out of trade.  But if he gets over the five-year period safely his first endorsement dies, and so on, and the second endorsement after the passing of the Act lives for seven years, and the third, and any subsequent one, for ten years, three live endorsements together putting a man out of business. This is a wholly new concession, because in the past if a man was convicted of one of the offences that required endorsement that endorsement stood for ever against his licence, and if joined by two others the licence was forfeited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> Further, the Bill provides a limited discretion to the District Justice to withhold endorsement if he is satisfied that there are circumstances that render the offence trivial or purely technical in character.  One can imagine some circumstance which would render an offence wholly trivial.  A man's clock might work five or seven minutes wrong in the course of the day.  He might have taken the correct time from the Post Office in the morning and if the clock was faulty it could work a bit wrong and he might find at ten o'clock that night that it might register five or seven minutes false.  There might be an offence of selling during prohibited hours, but the circumstances would have rendered it trivial in character and it should be within the discretion of the District Justice not to endorse the licence.  Together with that limited discretion I ask for an appeal for the officer of the Gárda Síochána.  If he is satisfied that an over-indulgent view is taken as to the particular occasion, he may go to the Circuit Court Judge and ask whether he considers that the attendant circumstances of that offence were sufficient to reduce it to trivial proportions not warranting an endorsement of the licence.</P>
    <P>If there were an accident outside a licensed house after hours and stimulants were required, if there was a sale there you would have a technical offence, but few people would I think suggest that it was an offence warranting endorsement of the licence, warranting even that the licence holder should be put to the expense of appealing to the Circuit Court to get the endorsement withdrawn.</P>
    <P>It is to meet cases of that kind that this limited jurisdiction is vested in the District Justice and as a check and safeguard, I ask that the right of appeal should lie with the district officer.  If he considers too lenient a view is taken in a particular case, he may go to the higher court with the case and get the opinion of the Circuit Judge.</P>
    <P>There is a new provision also which enables the holder of a licence which is endorsed to sell a clear licence provided <Col N="728" /> that the sale is bona fide.  That is intended to meet a point of view put to me on the question of endorsement. The complaint was made that the credit and the borrowing capacity even of traders who are running their shops quite correctly, who are not breaking the law in any respect, who had no convictions against them, and were not likely to have any convictions against them yet their credit was affected.  I agreed that if that were the actual position, it was a serious position, for which a remedy ought to be sought. No one wanted, by a provision in our legislation, to penalise people keeping the law strictly and running their establishments quite correctly, yet it was suggested that was happening. Perhaps it was.  With the provision of the Act of 1924 in existence a bank might well say to the holder of a licence seeking to borrow on the security of his premises: &ldquo;We have no guarantee that this year you may not break the law and be detected and convicted and get a sufficient number of endorsements to wipe out your licence.&rdquo;  This new provision in this Act purports to meet, so far as it is possible to meet, that plea.  It enables the holder of a licence who may have received an endorsement, perhaps two endorsements, to sell to the purchaser an absolutely clear licence provided the court is satisfied that the sale is open and above board and not a mere bogus transfer to a relative for the purpose of clearing the slate.  If it is a bona fide sale the purchaser can get a clear licence.  That does meet the complaint to some extent, because a man borrows on the ultimate security of what his place would fetch in the open market if sold, and this provision enables a man who is unfortunate and gets two endorsements to get out of business, giving to the new purchaser a clear licence if there is no suspicion in the court that the sale is simply a bogus one.  So much for endorsement.</P>
    <P>On the question of hours.  We come for the first time, and in a limited application, to the principle of the break in the day.  This, I think, is a very desirable reform.  It exists in Great Britain, and I think it is generally agreed that it is a desirable reform, <Col N="729" /> and a good thing to clear out the house even for a short space in the middle of the day.  The hours in the Dublin metropolitan area, and in the cities of Cork, Limerick, and Waterford are as follows:&mdash;From 10 a.m. to 2.30 p.m.; from 3.30 p.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays other than Saturday; on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2.30 p.m., and from 3.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m.  There is half an hour earlier closing on Saturday nights than on other nights.  On Sunday and St. Patrick's day 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.  In the urban county districts, with a population exceeding 5,000, the hours on ordinary weekdays are:&mdash;10 a.m. to 10 p.m., and on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 9.30 p.m.  Elsewhere the position is 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. summer time, and from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. during the remaining portions of the year.  On Saturday 10 a.m. to 9.30 p.m. summer time, and from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. for the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>The Sunday hours now require some comment and explanation.  It is proposed to restrict the hours for the sale of intoxicating liquor to bona fide travellers to the hours of from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. in the non-summer time period, and alternatively, from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m., or from 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. in the summer time period.  There will be a discretion to the District Justice in a particular area to grant the 2 to 9 rather than the 1 to 8 if satisfied that there is any particular cause for the change.</P>
    <P>Now, the bona fide traffic is something of a growing problem.  I think it has changed enormously in its character for the last ten or twelve years. The mobility of the individual in the first instance owing to the introduction of the ordinary push bicycle and later to the motor bike and motor car, and now the charabanc, and so on, has increased considerably within our own recent memory&mdash;within the last ten, twelve or fifteen years.  I certainly would welcome complete abolition.  I invited the Dáil to discuss the question as to whether it would not be an improvement to grant a limited opening throughout the State on Sunday afternoons and abolish entirely the bona fide traffic.</P>
    <P>The predominant view in the Dáil <Col N="730" /> was wholly against uniform opening throughout the State.  I suppose the explantion of that is that the abuses which arise from the bona fide traffic are not felt uniformly throughout the State but seen and noted only in particular areas.  This provision in the Bill is not exactly my own idea, but I consider it a distinct improvement on the existing prohibition whereby if a man once covers the statutory distance he can drink from 1 p.m. until the small hours of the next morning.  I am not sure whether his statutory concession ends at midnight or not, but from the Act of 1924 it seems to me he can drink the round of the clock.  In the Act of 1924 we took out from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., and it is now proposed to restrict it to six hours in the non-summer time, that is, from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m., and in the summer time from one to eight or two to nine.  I do not think many people will cavil at that.</P>
    <P>It seems a proper and reasonable thing to take a substantial slice off the end of the day as in 1924 we took six hours off the early part of the day.  I think seven or eight hours are quite sufficient to meet all the requirements of the so-called bona fide traveller. There was a proposal to double the distances. I put that to the Dáil without any great enthusiasm or conviction.  It seems to me that to the user of the motor car or motor bicycle it is a small matter to tell him that he must travel six miles instead of three in the country or ten miles instead of five near the four cities.  The effect of it would be to wipe out one set of vested interests with a stroke of the pen and create new ones.  In so far as the change leaned against anyone it leaned against a man who is perhaps the most genuine traveller of the whole, the pedestrian who goes out for a walk from the town on Sundays, while it made no difference to the man who goes by motor cycle, car or bus.  So I did not feel particularly aggrieved when the Dáil voted out the proposed changes in the distances.  I do not think there is anything in it myself, and I think it would be simply wiping out, in a rather arbitrary fashion, one set of vested interests and creating new ones without achieving anything substantial from <Col N="731" /> the point of view of temperance reform. That is how the matter of Sunday stands at the moment.  I think perhaps the time will come when, with the extension of motor traffic through the country, many more people than at present seem inclined to support the proposal will support the abolition of the bona fide traffic in exchange for some uniform limited opening throughout the State.  But for the moment these proposals in the Bill hold the field.</P>
    <P>There will be points of detail that can be gone into on another occasion. A certain amount has been said and written on the modification this Bill underwent as between its introduction in and its final passage through the Dáil.  As a matter of fact, these alterations were quite slight matters, the most substantial ones being reduction and the break in the day from two hours to one hour.  It is unnecessary to stress that the important thing was to get a break to get the publichouses cleared, and it was the fact of their clearance rather than the length of the break that really mattered.  I am quite satisfied to have established, for the first time in legislation here, the principle of some break in the day, and I hope, after some reduction has taken place in the total number of licences in the country, and after some greater measure of prosperity is felt among the survivors, that someone will propose to the Oireachtas an extension of that principle over a wider area than is covered by the proposal in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Is there an appeal against the Government assessors? When a man makes a valuation of a publichouse on behalf of the Government are the Government now put in a position to conduct an appeal against their own decision?  That happens in every compensation claim, and the onus of the defence is put on the person to be compensated.  That is strictly unfair, as the publican has to defend himself twice.</P>

      <P>I have a good deal of genuine sympathy with the Minister's view on this question.  I propose, after this stage is passed, that we postpone further consideration of this Bill until after the general election, because I am perfectly satisfied from my observations, and from what I have read of the discussions in the other House, that, owing to the undue influence used on members of all parties in the other House, they were hardly free agents in discussing this most important question with regard to the public and social life of the country.  I think the influence wielded by members of the licensed trade is out of all proportion to the influence they should possess in this country.  On the Second Reading of this Bill we found present in the Dáil the largest number of Deputies who had voted in a division for years. They were whipped up to vote in favour of particular interests.  That is not very creditable.  For that reason I think it would be in the best interests of the community as a whole that the further stages of this Bill should be postponed until after the general election. I believe, if reasonable amendments are passed in this House to the Bill, and I sincerely hope there will be, if it goes back to the Dáil in its present state they are not likely to get the consideration they would be entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the licensed trade as a whole will be in a better position if this Act, goes through in its present form than they were before the passing of this Act.  We find in regard to the days on which there should be no trading that Saint Patrick's Day has again been made a day on which publichouses have permission to open.  In 1924 we had a battle royal on the question in this House and I am glad to say that those in favour of closing on St. Patrick's Day won.  As far as lies in me I shall endeavour to convince the House that on St. Patrick's Day there should be total closing.  It is practically an open day all over the country under the provisions of the Bill because the bona fide regulations will allow every publichouse in the country to open; for that reason I hope we will add St. Patrick's Day to Christmas Day and Good Friday in order to make it a total <Col N="733" /> closing day as far as the licensed trade is concerned.  I know members of the licensed trade will say: &ldquo;Why restrict the hours of licensed houses above any other houses?  You do not restrict the hours of people in other occupations.&rdquo; That is true.  There is no necessity for it.  Every other decent trader closes his premises on Christmas Day, Good Friday and other days without any law compelling him.  He does it on his own volition because he believes it is the right and proper thing to do.  The licensed grocer would say: &ldquo;Of course you can curtail our hours of opening. You fix under this Bill that we dare not open our business before a certain hour in the morning and we must close our premises before a certain hour at night.  You regulate our hours of trade.&rdquo;  We do, and quite right.  He says: &ldquo;You do not do it in other occupations.&rdquo; Our answer is: &ldquo;We do not prevent competition in other trades.&rdquo; The publicans are sheltered; they are protected.  No man can open a publichouse and be in competition with the present traders.  He will not get a licence.  He will have to go before the District Justice.  For that reason the competition is limited and the licensed trader is in a better position than any other trader in the country.  Therefore it is necessary that the hours of trading should be regulated.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister in the principle that he has established.  He is to be congratulated on that, notwithstanding all the influences that were brought to bear on him, congratulated for standing for the break in the day in the licensed trade.  He has established for the first time a break in the working day in licensed houses.  It is true that he did not get all he wanted to get.  He did not get as much as prevails in Great Britain, where they close for a few hours in the morning and for a few hours in the afternoon. He is confined to a break of one hour in the day.  For five days in the week it will not make any great difference, but I think on Saturday it will.  I am speaking from experience, and my experience is not quite so bad, I am glad to say, as the impression that generally prevails.  From my experience, the <Col N="734" /> closing of the licensed premises for one hour each Saturday will be a great boon to the wives and families of some of the unfortunate men who are so infatuated with alcoholic liquor that when they get a taste of it they will not go home to their families and have almost the only dinner they can have in the week with their families, and bring home with them what would keep the family for the rest of the week.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of the bona fide problem.  I must say that I am in absolute agreement with the suggestion that was put forward by the Minister in the Dáil dealing with this question of the bona fide traffic.  I, personally, would prefer to see every licensed house in the country allowed to open from 2 to 5 on Sundays than to continue or allow the system of the bona fide traveller as it is carried on.  I think we would benefit somewhat if instead of the bona fide system we allowed the houses to open from 2 to 5 on Sunday.  I travelled this country a good deal during the past ten years, and I stayed in publichouse-hotels and other hotels, and I observed things as I went around, and I say that, for the sake of decency, it would be much better if every publichouse were allowed to open for a few hours than to continue the system that obtains at present.</P>
    <P>Anybody who observes what is happening knows that this thing of closing on Sunday in the country is all nonsense. Any man who wants a drink in the country on Sunday can get it if he knows his way.  For that reason I certainly would prefer that licensed houses in the country should be permitted to open for three hours on Sunday than allow the bona fide system to go on as at present.  In the country a man is permitted to get a drink on Sunday and St. Patrick's Day if he walks three miles.  The distance from where I live, at Dolphin's Barn, to Nelson's Pillar is about three miles.  Fancy a man being a bona fide traveller by walking from Nelson's Pillar to Dolphin's Barn.  The thing is a farce.  You might as well open them all.  In Dublin, of course, a man must go five miles to be a bona fide traveller, but you can get the twopenny tram to the Yellow <Col N="735" /> House, where a man is qualified to get a drink.  The thing is absurd.  A man in the country goes three miles and then he can get a drink.  Would it not be much decenter to open the houses for a number of hours on Sunday and allow men to get a drink than have this farce of making them travel three miles?  A fellow gets on his push bicycle, he travels on, and in five or six minutes he is a bona fide traveller.</P>
    <P>A bona fide traveller is allowed to get more drinks than one in a publichouse. There is nothing in the Bill, as far as I can find out, that will prevent him.  I had an extraordinary experience one time.  One Sunday morning, a good many years ago, I was in the Phoenix Park and I found my way to Chapelizod.  The man with me was a teetotaller, and it was a very warm Sunday.  He suggested that we should go in and have a bottle of ginger ale. We went into a publichouse in Chapelizod. There was nowhere else to go to.  Unfortunately they do not cater in this country for the teetotaller. When we went into the publichouse the house was so crowded that we could not get served.  We left the house and crossed to the other side of the street and were going into another house but we were stopped and told it was against the bona fide laws to go into two publichouses in the one village.  I understand, but I do not know whether I am correct or not, that formerly under the bona fide laws a person was only entitled to one drink in the house. I do not know whether that is correct. But a man is allowed to drink for hours in a publichouse.  He is doing more than the bona fide when he stays there drinking to his heart's content. I do not want to say any more at this stage on the bona fide question.</P>
    <P>There is another important matter in connection with this Bill, which is, I think, an innovation&mdash;that is, total exemption on Saint Patrick's Day or other days.  The District Justice will be entitled to make an order of exemption, that publichouses in a certain locality may open so that all and sundry may be permitted to go in and drink to their heart's content for three hours on Saint Patrick's Day or on the other days that may be exempted.  That <Col N="736" /> is an innovation, I think.  Some alteration should be made in that respect. The argument will be made that people going through the country should be entitled to get a drink.  I do not stand for it that the people who go to a football or hurling match should not get a drink.  I do not stand for that, but I do not stand for open exemption.  I have only to say that I hope the Seanad will take my view on this and in the circumstances existing, postpone this Bill until after the General Election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on having preserved so many useful provisions in this Bill, and for that reason I hope that the House will not assent to Senator Farren's suggestion that the further progress of the Bill should be held up.  Because, as he himself has admitted, the reduction in the number of licences and a break in the day are in themselves so valuable; and particularly as this is so substantial a Bill, considering the questions you are dealing with, it is almost an agreed Bill.  It has had a most exhaustive discussion and contains many useful provisions.  The progress of this Bill should be facilitated, and it would be to the advantage of the country to have it become law in the present session. The Minister said there were 12,000 odd licences in the State, and he suggested that one-third of the publichouses may be regarded as redundant. I was disappointed at hearing the number put at that figure, for I know that men connected with the liquor trade consider that in some districts fifty per cent. would not be more than sufficient to bring the number to the figure where ample facilities for reasonable refreshments in accordance with the legitimate requirements of the districts could be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> I agree thoroughly with everything practically in this Bill, but I have some misgiving as to one point.  I notice that the Circuit Judge with his assessor is to fix the compensation.  That is the Tribunal before which the redundant licensee is to go both as regards the question of redundancy and the question of value, and the appeal with regard to endorsement and the appeal at the discretion of the Civic Guards also goes before the Circuit Judge.  I am very much afraid that the Circuit Courts, which are already congested, will be overwhelmed if this Bill comes to function.  The amount of work thrown on the court purely in connection with the administration of the Act will be very great. It may be possible and desirable, in order to secure a sufficient and speedy working of the Act&mdash;not rushing it to the extent that the Minister has pointed out&mdash;to appoint extra judges or even commissioners to help the Circuit Judges in the administration of the Act.  In regard to that very vexed question of the bona fide traveller, I would suggest to Senator Farren that the bona fide gentleman after an arduous and weary journey of three miles on his push bicycle raises possibly a question he has forgotten, and that is, that that gentleman has to go back again on his three miles journey home with perhaps more difficulty than on the three miles journey out.</P>
    <P>I think that under the circumstances in regard to that question, the Minister has come to a very reasonable arrangement, an arrangement with which no reasonable man would disagree.  Anyone who suggests that the bona fide traveller cannot get sufficient refreshment from 2 o'clock to 9 o'clock is not suggesting what is reasonable.  If there is one point in the Bill with which I disagree it is with regard to selling a tainted and endorsed licence.  The bona fide sale will give to a bona fide buyer a licence that had been endorsed but that is now a clean licence.  My objection to that is this, that it is not fair to the publican who has complied with the provisions of the law.  It is giving a dishonest trader an incentive to continue his course of fraudulent trading in competition with the honest trader. <Col N="738" /> He is able to sell for its full value something that might in a very short time become redundant and probably be forfeited.  I may tell the Minister that I will probably move some amendments with regard to drinking in clubs.  I would ask the Seanad, as this is generally an agreed Bill, to pass it and not to stay its course here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in bringing in this Bill has done something to minimise the worst evil of the liquor traffic.  I find on looking up the figures for the last year that 17½ million pounds was spent in drink.  Whether that is an undue proportion for three millions of people I do not know.  What a reasonable proportion would be I do not know.  But anyway you analyse the figures it would appear that there is an excess of drinking going on somewhere, and to the extent of that excess our people are worsened both mentally and physically.  A man may drink a certain amount of alcohol and possibly it may not do him any harm.  It may benefit him, for men's constitutions differ.  That is a matter for each individual and for his constitutional ability to stand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly a man who drinks more than his constitution can stand is encroaching upon his capacity, both mental and physical, and in the present state of depression in the country there is need for every ounce of capacity we have.  I think that the Bill goes in the right direction towards minimising the worst evils of the drink traffic.  Prohibition has been tried in other countries and it has given rise to worse evils even than the sale of alcoholic drink.  As long as human nature is human nature people will go in the direction of certain mental excitement and enjoyment.  It is a matter for legislation, such as this, to control the evils that may arise from traffic such as the drink traffic.  I may say on behalf of the county councils that a Bill of this sort, which has provisions for the reduction of licensed premises, or a Bill that has any effect on the licence duties, affects the county councils in their administration.  The resulting fees from these licences are paid into the <Col N="739" /> local taxation account, and under that account certain grants are made to mental hospitals and other institutions towards the reduction of the rates. This Bill will, in time, to some extent have the effect of depleting the funds going into the local taxation account. I introduce this question because it has been the attitude of the General Council of County Councils and of individual county councils, and boards of mental hospitals, that the basis of the grant accruing to them is entirely wrong, and that these grants should be borne out of the central fund and not be liable to be affected unduly by depletion or otherwise by the incidence arising from the present method of dealing with local taxation accounts.</P>
    <P>Regarding the afternoon break, the aim of the Bill is to clear the bars and prevent continuous drinking, which is no doubt one of the worst evils of the drink traffic to-day.  I do not know that a very large percentage even of the most habitual drinkers drink the round of the clock, as the Minister says.  Anyone who has information in the matter, or who has made personal observation of what is happening throughout the country, knows that there is a great amount of excessive drinking going on in the bars and publichouses at certain times.  That, possibly, may be defended by the argument that many people have not comfortable homes, and they naturally seek the lure of the publichouses, where they have a certain amount of social enjoyment and leave their cares behind them.  When one friend meets another in a social atmosphere of that sort excessive drinking may take place.  The Bill, so far as it goes, will in one way or another tend to remedy that by clearing out the houses at least once a day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as introduced, is, I think, one of the very first which follows very closely on the lines of the recommendations of the Commission set up to consider the question. From that point of view the Minister certainly ensured that the time of the Commission was not wasted.  It is rather unfortunate, I think, that the measure should have been introduced <Col N="740" /> at this particular stage.  I am not blaming, in the least, the licensed trade for having used all the influence they can command, but they are to be congratulated on the fact that they have established all their pristine glory in the way of public influence in matters affecting their trade.  The Minister is to be sympathised with in the fact that, notwithstanding the strong line he generally takes in regard to many matters he brings forward, in regard to this particular question he beat such a rapid, strategical retreat that his pursuers were thrown into disorder when trying to keep up with him.  However, he has brought away in the remnants of what he introduced originally some very good principles which will go towards regulating in some proper way the licensed trade.  It is peculiar that the more civilised we are supposed to become the more we have to place restrictions upon our appetites.  Three hundred years ago or less, I think it was in 1634, the first licensed measure was introduced in Ireland, and the licence fee was fixed at 5/- per annum. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, about 1790, it was found necessary to enact that no licence should be issued for the sale of alcoholic liquor in prisons and workhouses, showing that there must have been a considerable amount of looseness in the sale of drink.  It was only in 1886 that the first measure was introduced prohibiting the sale of drink for consumption on the premises to children, and then it only applied to children under 13 years of age.  Since then we have advanced very considerably, but that has been not only because of legislative measures, but, I think, because there has been an increase in the general prosperity of the community, and in the upliftment of their general view of what is enjoyment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity when this measure was being introduced that some attempt was not made to codify the law in regard to licences.  At present there are no less than 14 different types of licences, and one of these is divided into four or five sub-heads.  The result is that there is an immense amount of dubiety regarding the various licences. This creates difficulties for the police <Col N="741" /> authorities, and it gives an immense amount of work to solicitors that would otherwise be unnecessary if there were a simplification of the licensing laws. Senator Farren dealt with the question of the bona fide traffic, and suggested that instead of having any bona fide traffic there should be universal Sunday opening.  From the point of view of preventing intemperance that probably would be the right course to take, but I think the almost inevitable result would be that more money would be spent on drink on Sundays than at present.  The person who wants drink on Sundays manages to get it now, but the person who would take drink if it were easy to get, and if it could be got legally, does not bother getting it now, but he would get it if there was universal opening.  A good deal of evidence was given before the Liquor Commission on that question, and one of the best witnesses in regard to the matter was Mr. Williams, who owns 22 publichouses in the vicinity of Tullamore.</P>
    <P>This is an extract from a report of his evidence at the Liquor Commission:&mdash;</P>
    <P>He explained that his publichouses are controlled by managers, and in view of the risk which would be involved he has forbidden these managers to serve bona fide travellers. He made it clear that he had no objection on principle to drinking on Sundays, but as a business proposition he felt that the risk would be too great.  He felt it would be to his financial interest if a limited opening on Sundays were allowed, as such alteration in the law would place him in as favourable a position as the owners of competing publichouses living in their premises who can afford to take the risk of serving the bona fide travellers.  Notwithstanding that, he advised against the opening of publichouses on Sunday.  He said that in most villages where he owned publichouses groups of young men loitered around the streets on Sundays.  Were the publichouses open he felt that on a Sunday they would go into them and no good result would accrue.</P>
    <P>The Commission felt that no real case <Col N="742" /> was made for universal Sunday opening for the reasons I have stated, that such alteration in the law would tempt thousands of people after last Mass on Sundays to wait around the towns and villages until the publichouses opened, and then they would go into them and come home late for their dinner, after having spent more money than they could afford, leaving their families, perhaps, to go short of the necessaries of life as a result.  I do not know whether universal opening would do away with drunkenness, but it would certainly do away with some of the abuses of the so-called bona fide traffic. As against that, one has to consider whether it is advisable to place temptation before tens of thousands of people who do not now think of touching publichouses on Sundays.</P>
    <P>Regarding St. Patrick's Day closing, personally I do not feel very strongly on that.  I am not particular about a short opening on St. Patrick's Day any more than on Sunday.  It seems peculiar that opening is only allowed in the four exempted cities.  Of course I can see the reason, as in the four cities there is Sunday opening.  Although St. Patrick's Day has been added in the exempted cities there will be a demand, I think, from people in the larger towns for limited opening on St. Patrick's Day.  I notice that publichouses in the small villages will be, in the summer time, open for 11½ hours on Saturdays, and in the winter time for a stretch of 12 hours.  From the point of view of the publican whose licence will be extinguished, I think it is hardly fair that a year should elapse after his house is closed and his licence taken away before any compensation is paid to him.  The Commission recommended that the house should not be closed until the compensation was paid. An owner's income should not be taken away until something was given in its place.  As I read the Bill, the house may be closed on the 30th September, and the question of compensation may not be considered until the following April.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the <Col N="743" /> house could be closed before compensation could be paid.  That would be going against the recommendations of the Commission, but the Minister informs me that that view is not correct. Generally speaking, I support the Bill. I think it should be welcomed by the licensed trade, as it extinguishes by a gradual process those redundant publichouses that have militated against the efficiency and respectability of the trade.  There are some hundreds of these houses in various places that sell little or no drink.  They are competing with the other publichouses and encourage breaches of the law.  To extinguish them does not mean taking away much income from the people concerned while, of course, compensation is provided.</P>
      <P>I imagine the better-class publican will welcome this proposal.  Nevertheless the Bill created an immense amount of anxiety as to how compensation might be arrived at.  Needless to say there will be an objection on the part of the remaining publicans to pay compensation. Such a scheme has worked well in Great Britain and has been satisfactory in Northern Ireland.  I fail to see what other steps could be taken by the Minister.  With Senator Farren I would like if a more suitable opportunity had been selected for the discussion of the Bill.  I think, however, it is inevitable that we should go on with it, and, if suitable amendments are inserted, I am sure they will receive reasonable consideration in the other House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the Second Reading of the Bill.  I do not propose to deal with the various points that were referred to by the Minister and by Senators.  In the main I agree with Senator Farren, with this exception, that I do not think there will be anything gained by leaving the Bill over until after the General Election. If Senator Farren would be prepared to ask people to vote for the Government, so that they should come back strong enough to bring in the Bill in its original form, I think there would be some title to ask the House not to bring it on before the General <Col N="744" /> Election.  As that is too much to hope for.  I am afraid we can only come to the conclusion that this would not be, in any real sense, an issue before the election.  Therefore I do not see that anything could be gained by postponing it.  I agree with Senator Farren to this extent, that if it were possible to put the issue before the country as between the Bill as introduced and as amended, we would get a verdict in favour of the Bill as introduced.</P>
      <P>There are one or two matters I am sorry the Bill does not deal with. Children are not allowed to be taken into licensed premises in Great Britain where drink is consumed over the counter.  I mentioned that matter when the 1924 Bill was before the House, and it was postponed because the question of mixed trading would arise.  In the interests of the decent carrying on of the trade it would be far better if children could not be taken into these premises.  I know that there are certain difficulties and that in England some of the best licensed houses provide nurse-maids to look after children.  I think it is a bad thing to allow children to be brought into ordinary licensed premises.  If possible I would like to see an amendment dealing with that matter provided in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In view of the Commission's report it was quite obvious that the original proposals with regard to mixed trading, which this House passed, and which were withdrawn as a result of opposition in the Dáil, could not be insisted upon.  At the same time, I feel that after a period of five or six years structural alterations should be enforced where there is mixed trading. By that time, or some reasonable period, it is anticipated the weaker houses will have ben found redundant and abolished. As a result the other traders will be presumably wealthier owing to better business, and should be in a position to carry out structural alterations. I recognise that it could not be done fairly or with justice at the present , but I think there should be some indication that after a period such a regulation will be enforced.  It would be highly desirable to have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> It is not clear to me from the Bill that where there is an application for the abolition of a licence on the ground of redundancy, that any person other than the police could make it, or that anyone else can give evidence when the application is being heard.  It seems desirable that in some way the public might be able to state their point of view, particularly local clergymen or other persons in an authoritative position, so that the Court could have their views as to the desirability of reducing the number of licences or taking a licence from a particular house.  It might be possible to provide that the police might put before the magistrate any written evidence sent in by a responsible person.  To some extent that might meet the case.  I think there is a want there.  It is difficult to understand how it will work after reading the Bill.  There is no doubt the House should pass the Second Reading, and with some amendment the Bill should be proceeded with and not postponed. Two important alterations were made in the Dáil, one of which was with regard to the endorsement of licences.  There is, as far as I am concerned, no need for the Minister to explain that.  I think the alteration made was a just one.</P>
    <P>I think it was a wise thing to bring in the original Bill as it was, because I believe if it came in the form in which it is now the trade would have raised the same objections, and we would have a much less satisfactory section.  As the section concerned stands I think it should be supported. As to the break during the day the Minister was not so convincing, and as far as I can gather, experience in Great Britain has shown that a break of two hours in the afternoon is desirable.  I am told by friends on the other side of the Channel that the two hours break has considerably reduced the amount of drunkenness amongst women.  One of the problems which a good many reformers feel is a serious one&mdash;I do not think it is as bad recently as it was some time ago&mdash;is the increase of drunkenness amongst women.  I think a reduction of the hours of trading in the afternoon is certainly a gain in that respect.</P>

      <P>I do not require to say much in reply to the points that were made in the course of the discussion. I would like to refer briefly to the line that Senator O'Farrell took when commenting on the Bill.  He suggested, rather than stated, that he and the other members of the Commission had signed an excellent report.  To that extent I agree, but the Senator went on to suggest that I had turned my back on that excellent report in the Dáil, and that, in fact, this Bill as it stands represents simply the mutilated remnant of the Commission's report. That is not so.  If it were so I might plead in extenuation to the Senator that only two just men were found in his Party in the Dáil, prepared to give a Bill based on the report of the Commission that he signed a Second Reading. Only Deputy Johnson and another Deputy in his Party voted for the Second Reading.  In fact, the Dáil did not mutilate the Bill to anything like the extent that the Senator suggested. The main changes made in the Bill are three in number.  The break in the day is reduced from two hours to one hour, with this important difference that, whereas under the two hours break mixed houses were to remain open for the non-licensed side of the business, under the one hour break they are compelled to close their doors.</P>
      <P>I have no illusion about this question of mixed houses being left open for the non-licensed side of the business for two hours.  I knew it would give rise to a great deal of evasion, that it would be a rather difficult matter to administer, and impose a rather heavy burden on the police, but personally I would have preferred a two hours break even with this inconvenience. When I agreed to accept a break of one hour I did make the condition that if that were to be a provision in the Bill we would have to make that one hour a complete closing hour both for the mixed houses and those that were publichouses only.</P>
      <P>Another alteration is that to which Senator Douglas has referred in Section 26, sub-section (1).  The sub-section states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever the holder of a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor is <Col N="747" /> convicted by a justice of the District Court of an offence to which this part of this Act applies, such justice may, if satisfied that by reason of the trivial nature of the offence such conviction ought not to be recorded on such licence, make an order stating the circumstances which reduce the offence to one of a trivial nature and declaring that such conviction shall not be recorded, and whenever such order is so made such conviction shall not be so recorded.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) provides an appeal for the superintendent.  People may hold their own opinions as to just how far that section constitutes a mutilation of the Bill.  Personally I did not regret accepting that particular amendment. I think provided it is properly administered, that it does meet the case that is purely trivial, the purely technical case, which I myself would agree should not be subject to endorsement &mdash;the matter of the clock being five or seven minutes wrong, the matter of the sale under special circumstances, such as an accident outside the door and so on.  Then there is the bona fide sale of the clear licence.  An amendment dealing with that was not brought in by me as a result of any pressure in the Dáil.  It was brought in to meet the case put to me by a deputation that this whole system of endorsement is affecting the credit of men who are conducting their houses quite properly, that it is affecting the credit of the trader who is observing the law punctiliously and it was a case that I felt should be met some way.  Because I could find no better way of meeting it I brought in the amendment now in the Bill.  I referred to it, I think, in my Second Reading speech in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>On Sunday the proposal was two spells of two hours for the bona fide traffic, from 1 to 3 and from 5 to 7.  I believe it would not be possible to administer a break in the bona fide traffic. I felt, whatever the hours, there should be a straight run, because the bona fide traffic is not like the ordinary retail trade.  It is a closed-door business, and if the police were to administer that break between 3 and 5 it would be necessary for each sergeant to visit <Col N="748" /> as many of the licensed houses in his area within these hours as he could reach, and for that reason I departed from the recommendation of the Commission in favour of six hours in the non-summertime period and seven hours in the summertime period.</P>
    <P>On the question of distances, there again I did not find myself very heartily in agreement with the recommendation that the distance should be doubled up.  It is a matter of sending the fool further and creating new vested interests instead of those that would be wiped out.  These are, to the best of my recollection, the principal modifications in the Bill that were inserted in the Dáil.  On the question of the postponement, I do not take that suggestion over-seriously.  I do not regret that this Bill was brought forward within three or four months of a general election.  I think it has been educative to bring forward a Bill of this kind so close to a general election. I think it has been educative to show that a Bill of this kind can be introduced and discussed on its merits and passed on the verge of a general election, and to show that there is always likely to be here in the Free State not merely a Government, but a Dáil and a Seanad, that will refuse to be deterred by any organised ramp on the part of any vested interest from discussing and considering legislation on its merits and from the point of view of the public interest.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Constitution shall be and is hereby amended by the deletion from Article 52 thereof of the word &lsquo;Dáil&rsquo; and the insertion in that Article of the word &lsquo;Oireachtas&rsquo; in lieu of the word so deleted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> New section.  After the preceding section to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Constitution shall be and is hereby amended by the deletion from Article 58 thereof of the word &lsquo;Dáil&rsquo; and the insertion in that Article of the word &lsquo;Oireachtas&rsquo; in lieu of the word so deleted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Members of the Seanad are familiar with these amendments.  They simply propose to make Senators eligible for Executive office.  Senators are also familiar with the course of the Bill up to the present stage.  It was referred to a Special Committee of this House, and the result of that reference was that the Committee advised that further consideration be postponed, and that the Dáil be invited to join in setting up a Joint Committee to deal with the measure. The Dáil, in its wisdom, or unwisdom, saw fit not to accept that invitation, and the Bill is now left to us to take up its consideration at the point where we left off when the Special Committee of this House was appointed.  The Minister for Justice, in submitting the Message to the Dáil, reviewed the whole position.  At the outset he referred to the framers of the Constitution, and to the particular clause in the Constitution setting up a Legislature in this country.  He said that it was recognised that there should be some effective liaison between the two Houses.  He stated that in other countries, in the Dominions and elsewhere, where members of the Second Chamber were eligible for executive office, that was the way they proceeded to establish an effective liaison between the two Houses, but that as the conditions of this country were different and changing the framers of the Constitution thought it better to bring about the same result here by empowering Ministers who were chosen for executive office from members of the Dáil to follow legislative measures sent to the Second Chamber and to help it to arrive at a decision by giving them every possible information that was given to the other House on these measures.</P>
    <P>In answer to that I must say that there is also a provision in the Constitution <Col N="750" /> which enables the Oireachtas within eight years to amend the Constitution; after that time it can only be amended by referendum.  That, no doubt, is a very wise provision, but it indicated certain doubts in the minds of the framers of the Constitution, no matter what their prescience might be, or how machinery of that sort would work out.  Therefore they introduced this clause in the Constitution.  It is the result of the application of this machinery to our legislative measures and our procedure that we ourselves would be in a position, within eight years, to remedy any defects that were discovered in the Constitution for any reason.  Not very long ago members of the Dáil and the Executive Council saw fit to introduce amendments to the Constitution. Their conception of the extent to which the Constitution could be strained in any direction which they desired to go was indicated by a Bill brought in here which, if it were passed in the form in which it was presented to this House, would result in the anomaly of a member having the full right and power to sit in the Dáil, to vote, act and affect legislation in so far as his vote could affect it, without having a constituency&mdash;being responsible to no constituency, a free-lance, in other words.</P>
    <P>If the Minister sets up the argument that it was never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution that Senators should never reach Executive office, I am sure that argument could be met by the counter-argument that the framers of the Constitution never visualised or anticipated that such an anomalous position would arise as that, by any subterfuge or otherwise, a member could act in the Dáil without being responsible to any constituency and remain in that anomalous position for a certain number of years.  Yet this Executive Council, which is so punctilious in other matters, gave their sanction to that proposal, and were it not for the superior acumen and higher standards of competence that exist here at times, that anomaly would have passed into law and would exist to-day.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when dealing with the claim made by the Seanad as to infringement of its rights, asked what <Col N="751" /> rights?  My conception of the infringement is simply this: That under the Bill as it stands there is power to narrow down the margin of appointment of extern Ministers, thereby encroaching on the position of Senators and others outside the Dáil.  There is power given to increase the number of Executive Ministers, but the privilege of selection is confined to members of the Dáil only, and no compensating privilege is given to Senators.  The Minister also said that we had no further right to a grievance than Paddy Murphy of Skibbereen.  That is so, but if Paddy Murphy of Skibbereen were consulted about the Bill, and if we were attacked as we were afterwards attacked, it might be found he would be a very indignant and vocal citizen.  We were not consulted, and when we sensed the insidiousness of the Bill we rose up here unanimously and objected to the measure. Notwithstanding our unanimity here we were treated in a very discourteous way by the Dáil, and in his presentation of the case the Minister's attitude was most disappointing to this House, because when the amendments were first considered the Minister was very favourable and agreeable to our proposals.  I think it was his own suggestion that it should be referred to a Special Committee of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Special Committee I think he suggested that the matter should go before the Joint Committee.  Finally we agreed to send this Message to the other House:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in the opinion of the Seanad it is expedient that a Joint Committee of both Houses, consisting of seven members of the Seanad and seven members of the Dáil, be appointed to consider and report upon the advisability of amending the Articles of the Constitution which prevent members of the Seanad being appointed members of the Executive Council.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>With reference to that, the Minister's words were these:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We object to the setting of this resolution; we object to its bargaining <Col N="752" /> complexion.  We object to the underlying threat, that, unless this resolution is passed, and, presumably, unless those who represent the Dáil on the proposed committee agree that Senators should be eligible for membership of the Executive Council, then the Bill that is before the Seanad will not be passed by the Seanad.&rdquo; ... &ldquo;The second objection is on the merits.  To accept this proposal to take part in the proceedings of a Joint Committee, to consider the alteration of Article 55 of the Constitution, so that Senators may be eligible for membership of the Executive Council is, in effect, equivalent to giving a Second Reading to the proposal that Senators should be eligible for membership of the Executive Council.  Are we sure they should?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To anyone understanding ordinarily the value and force of words in the English language, I do not know how the Minister could have read in all those underlying threats.  I can find no threat at all in the position arrived at by the Special Committee and presented to this House.  There may have been individual views expressed by members of the Committee as to what course might be taken in special circumstances, but the Speaker in the Dáil has ruled they are not to be affected by speeches, but only by the words and the text of the Message sent to that House.  The Minister seems to have based his references on the individual opinion of members either in the Seanad here or in the Special Committee, not on the text of the Message.  His references and remarks were not justified in any way by the text of the Message sent by this House to the Dáil.  That is the only matter with which the Dáil is concerned and to which they are confined. He also referred to collective responsibility as a reason why Senators should not be eligible for Executive office.  Inasmuch as they might not have to meet their constituents, seek re-election within a certain period, or would not have to resign in the event of a Government defeat, his insinuation is that they would not give a sincere, genuine, honest consideration to <Col N="753" /> Executive matters, to Government policy or otherwise.  I do not know whether we have a higher sense of our duty to the State and to our country or whether we have a lower position than members of the Dáil or Ministry. If matters of high State importance and of national importance are to be considered in an atmosphere outside that of all extraneous influences or considerations, or without any influence being brought to bear upon them by any section of the community, then I think the argument is entirely in favour of including members of the Seanad, because we can bring a more impartial and a more independent frame of mind to bear on those matters inasmuch as we are taking lesser risks.  We can address ourselves more impartially to the subject in hand even than members of the Dáil or of the present Ministry, who themselves are liable to be thrown out of office or not returned at the next election.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Bill was referred to a Special Committee of the Seanad, which I attended.  The proposal that emerged from that Special Committee was that no further progress should be made with the Bill that was passed here and sent to the Seanad; that they should mark time on the Bill; that they should pass a resolution inviting the Dáil to take part in the proceedings of a Joint Committee....  The Executive Council objects to the bargaining complexion of this resolution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now I have read already the resolution sent by this House to the Dáil. There his reiterative references to bargaining and threats cannot be read, no matter how you strain the English language, into that resolution or any part of it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Seanad at present consists of sixty members.  Thirty-one of those members were elected; twenty-seven were nominated; two were co-opted.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But none of these persons, whether nominated, co-opted, or elected, were nominated, co-opted or elected with a view to their being anything else than members of a <Col N="754" /> Second Chamber&mdash;a Second Chamber with powers of revision, powers of criticism, powers of suggestion, and even powers&mdash;maximum powers&mdash;of delay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have, I think, further powers than that; we have powers of initiating Bills here.  Bills go through all their stages here, and if the Dáil see fit to amend them they have the privilege to make those Bills their own as if they were initiated in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Coming to the main point of these amendments I assert that in practice the proceedings of this Chamber are hampered by want of sufficient knowledge of legislation that is in prospect. If the House is not kept in sufficient touch with all the information naturally due to it as to approaching legislative measures, and I think that has been the experience of the Seanad, then I say the effective liaison between the two Houses has not been found to work out in practice.  At any rate, any argument put forward by the Minister as to why Senators are not eligible breaks down when we apply world-wide experience to the matter.  I will read to you Deputy Major Cooper's remarks with regard to that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now there is no doubt whatever that the present position of the Seanad is unique and, I think, anomalous. It is not in the same position as any other Second Chamber in the world that I know of.  Ministers without portfolio sit in the Canadian Senate.  Ministers sit in the Senate of New Zealand; the Vice-President of the Executive Council and the Minister for Home Intelligence sit in the Senate of Australia. In France the Prime Minister (Monsieur Poincare), is a member of the Senate.  In every Second Chamber in the world, except that of the United States, where the Executive is entirely divorced from the Legislature, and where members of the Executive are not members of either House, members are eligible for office, and by the fact that there are Ministers in those particular Chambers they derive a great advantage, because they get guidance from the other House&mdash;of which the Seanad has very often stood in need.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="755" /> In addition to that I may say that in South Africa in the Constitution there is an element of perpetual nomination. The nominated element of this House will fade out by fluxion of time; after another few years we will all be popularly elected in this House.  I should say we hope to be.  In South Africa, at any rate, this nominated element, which the Minister, in the other House, pressed as being essentially a point which renders us ineligible in having the same responsibility as members of the Dáil, is looked upon as a virtue and is installed there as a permanent element of their Constitution. The Minister also said we were not a democratic institution, and that we were not founded on a democratic basis, and he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some time ago one of our daily papers committed itself to the statement that people were apt to forget that the Seanad was even in a wider sense than the Dáil a democratically elected Chamber.  I have the exact quotation here,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>said the Minister, and he read it as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is too great a tendency to forget that the Seanad is even in a wider sense than the Dáil a popularly elected body,&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and he continued:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that statement is, of course, blatantly and demonstratively untrue.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Irish Independent&rsquo;&mdash;I have not got the date of the issue, but I can give it to the Deputy subsequently&mdash;says <Col N="756" /> there are 27 members of the Seanad nominated, 2 co-opted and 31 elected.  Even with regard to the 31 elected it is decidedly an overstatement to say that they possess in a wider sense than the Dáil a popular mandate.  For whereas the Senator who, in those elections, secured the highest number of votes, secured the total vote of 14,000 in the entire State, there are many members of the Dáil who secured in a single constituency very many more votes. There are members in the Dáil who secured upwards of 20,000 votes in a single constituency.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister forgot to mention that these votes were given on an entirely restricted franchise, where no one under 30 years of age had a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that will be another point against the newspaper statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care about the newspaper statement, but I am entitled to argue that if it was on a franchise where those of 21 years of age had a vote, we would secure more votes.  But that is only a small point.  It must be remembered how we were nominated or elected.  It was by a democratic, revolutionary Dáil and a democratic revolutionary President who had the power of nomination that we were elected in the case of 50 per cent. of the Seanad.  Is not this impeachment therefore by the Minister an impeachment of the Dáil and of the President and of an ultra democratic and revolutionary Dáil and President?  It was this revolutionary President who nominated men here, but, according to the Minister's statement, we are not even democratic, although the Dáil in its judgment elected over 50 per cent. of the members of this House, and the whole wide range of the Free State elected another section of the House on an absolutely democratic standard and from a democratic point of view. We are in reality democrats of the democrats, the elect of the elected, the nominated of the nominators.  A <Col N="757" /> Senator reminds me here that we had 26 counties as the constituency in the Senatorial elections, whereas you have only one or less forming a single constituency for the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Now I pass from the attitude of the Minister to that of other members of the Dáil.  Deputy Cooper asked why did not the Minister, instead of asking the Dáil to give a flat negative to the Seanad message, not suggest an amendment to the terms of reference.  &ldquo;It would be possible,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to do so. Deputy Johnson, more far-seeing than myself, suggested the lines on which it could be done, but the Government preferred to offer a flat negative to the unanimous resolution of the Seanad. Let there be no mistake about it that every party in the Seanad concurred in the resolution, including the Labour Party.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now let us see what Deputy Johnson had to say.  Everybody knows that what Deputy Johnson says has weight both inside and outside the Oireachtas. Deputy Johnson referred to the same matter and said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Perhaps this is merely an excuse&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but I make the suggestion that instead of repelling this proposal from the Seanad, we should offer as an alternative suggestion that a joint committee be appointed to consider whether any improvement can be made in the procedure and practice governing the relations between the two Houses and between the Ministry and the Seanad which would facilitate the Seanad in carrying out its work of legislation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And Deputy Johnson further stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think, nevertheless, that there is something required to be done to improve the business methods of the Seanad as of the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with Deputy Johnson and other members of the Dáil, and I think the experience of this House has been and is that there is not the clear liaison between the two Houses which was contemplated by the framers of the Constitution, and I think it is as important to remedy that defect in the Constitution as it is to remedy defects for which Bills are <Col N="758" /> brought in here.  I think it is a regrettable thing that time and again we have been asked here under stress of pressure to rush through Bills without being able to get a proper conception of the different sections of these Bills.  Under appeals from the Government we have set aside our procedure and again and again suspended our Standing Orders for their convenience.  We have allowed Bills to be rushed through without proper time for their discussion and calm deliberation.  I think, considering the attitude of this House and what we have always done to facilitate the Government in every way, now, when we bring forward a very reasonable proposal of this sort, calling upon the Government in ordinary courtesy and in the interests of legislation generally, and certainly with the object of having better communication and intercommunication between both Houses upon important matters, and making a suggestion as to how to overcome these difficulties, namely, that the President of the Executive Council should have the option of selecting as one of his Ministers a member of this House, and when we are only putting that forward for consideration, a joint committee ought to be asked to go into the whole matter.  I speak for the majority of this House when I say that I think the message which we sent to the Dáil did not get the consideration it deserved, and that the attitude taken up upon it was not such as should be accepted by the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself compelled to support the amendment proposed by Senator Kenny.  By doing so I cannot claim any extraordinary enthusiasm for the proposal that Senators should be members of the Executive Council.  Still the proposed Bill cuts so much across the principle and provisions of the Constitution that I think a drastic amendment of this nature is necessary to obtain the attention which the Bill merits.  When this Bill was introduced into the Dáil, whether the Minister forgot altogether that the Constitution as it stood made provision for members of the Seanad being Ministers, and made provision for vocational councils of which the nominated head should be a Minister, I cannot <Col N="759" /> say.  At all events, when the Bill was discussed in the Dáil, it was considered altogether from the point of view of the Dáil, irrespective of the Seanad and irrespective largely of the provisions of the Constitution.  The Constitution provides for 12 members to be Ministers, of whom not less than five, or more than seven, shall be members of the Executive Council.  The Constitution further provides that the total number of Ministers shall be 12.  It will be observed that the Constitution, as formulated, made arrangements whereby five Ministers should be what are called extern Ministers.  The Constitution made provision that any member, practically, of An Saorstát could be one of these extern Ministers, but the Bill we are now discussing changes all that and wishes to provide that a future President shall have it in his power to nominate 12 Executive Ministers, thereby vitiating and rendering nugatory Article 56 of the Constitution, which provides for vocational councils, and Article 55, which provides for extern Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not entering into a discussion. I support Senator Kenny in what he said as to the abrupt manner in which our request for a Joint Committee of both Houses to be set up to discuss this very important constitutional question, was treated&mdash;that is, the treatment it received from the Minister.  I am not making the least attempt to traverse what his views may be, but this I think, that it is a proposal so far away from the provisions of the Constitution that it seems to suggest some innate semi-concealed viciousness which one feels ought to be prevented.  Has the extern Minister so failed that he should be put a stop to?  As far as I can read, when the extern Minister proposal was first suggested in the Dáil, the President of the Executive Council laid great stress upon the importance of such a Minister.  I submit to the House that such a Bill as this, doing away in such a short period with the extern Minister, is a proposal to which we should not agree.  That is one of the reasons why, I think, that the amendment should be considered.  The Minister spoke about Paddy Murphy of Skibbereen. <Col N="760" /> I am largely concerned with Paddy Murphy of Skibbereen.  Paddy Murphy of Skibbereen may have great administrative powers, and surely if Paddy Murphy of Skibbereen or Ban try had such powers it is a pity that he should be denied to the State as this Bill suggests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he should stand at a General Election. The framers of the Constitution thought otherwise, and I stand in this case for the framers of the Constitution. I do not think that the Constitution has failed, and I do not think that the time has yet come to put into the hands of the President the creation of a Cabinet which, after all, must eventually form itself into a Cabinet within a Cabinet, because you can hardly picture twelve Ministers in this country of ours being an Executive Council.  It will be only three or four Ministers, and the rest of the Cabinet will be the lesser lights of the greater constellation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the amendment proposed by Senator Kenny does not meet the points on which I really laid stress.  I for one am not at all anxious, though it may be wise, that a member of the Seanad should be a member of the Executive Council, but I am more than anxious that a member of this Seanad should at all events be a member of the Ministry, for the purpose of liaison, for the purpose of keeping us in close touch with all that is happening in the other House, and for the purpose of more clearly indicating to us the line of legislation and helping in our debates with all the details necessary for adequate consideration of the Seanad.  We cannot say now, unless we follow line by line and figure by figure the long debate in the Dáil, what the line of legislation is, nor do I think it would be wise for us as a second Chamber to read everything which they say in the Dáil.  After all, we bring to bear on the Bills that come to us a new line of thought, and a new train of reasoning.  For that purpose it would be well for us, sometimes, if we could shut out from our minds the arguments used in support of a Bill or against a Bill in the other House.  I <Col N="761" /> think that the close and serious reading of those debates in the Dáil would not be to our advantage, and when we consider those various points, the Minister who had charge of the Bill, who is in the confidence of the Dáil, the Minister who is concerned with the framing of the Bill, who knows all the details, would be the person to advise us, the person to tell us all the reasons for legislation and the person on whose advice we could act with greater dependence in legislation.  I do not think that I need say any more.  I have been quite long enough, and I apologise for the length at which I have detained the House, but if this amendment is carried, as I hope it will be, it will, at all events, I think, prevent the doing away with the right of a Senator or of any other person in the State to become a member of the Executive Council.  Judging from the attitude of Ministers towards our modest proposal for a Joint Council or Session, that they would accept such an amendment as this to their Bill, no one could for a moment imagine.  Therefore, merely for the purpose of preventing a Bill which, I think, is a gross infringement of the Constitution and a grave infringement of the rights of this House, I second the amendment.</P>

      <P>We have had this subject before us on several occasions and I do not propose to do more than, as briefly as I can, to state my view of this amendment.  I have already expressed my strong feeling that there should be in this House a representative of the Government.  But I think that is irrelevant on this subject, as I do not think that matter could be arranged at the present time.  Personally, I think that if the number of Ministers in the Executive Council exceeds the five to seven members now provided, the Dáil should have power, if it so desires, to choose a Senator. The only question is not as to whether there should or should not be a Senator in the Executive Council.  It should vary according to the circumstances, but it is a simple question of whether the Dáil should have that power. I think it should.  I do not think that I should support this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> I am strongly of opinion that only one subject should be dealt with in the Constitution (Amendment No. 5) Bill, 1926.  The fact that the Senator who moved this amendment has to move another amendment to alter the Preamble shows clearly that, by doing so, he was introducing two subjects.  He also proposes to amend the Short Title.</P>
    <P>I think certainly it would be a mistake to pass this amendment, and for that reason I shall vote against it.  But if Senator Kenny will introduce a Bill, or if other Senators will join together and introduce a Bill to provide that where the members of the Executive Council exceed seven, then there should be an option to choose a member of the Senate, I should be glad to support such a Bill and to help in the drafting of it.  The proper thing for us to do would be to join in promoting such a Bill and to discuss it in this House without regard to the subjects that are being discussed here now.  Senator Bennett's arguments were rather against the Bill than for this amendment.  There is a great deal to be said for that.  He feels that this Bill abolishes the extern Ministers. I think the position is that this Bill leaves it optional to the Dáil as to the number of members not exceeding twelve forming the Executive Council. I hope the House will not accept the amendment not because of any objections that I have to it, but because it is a mistake to introduce two subjects into a constitutional amendment like this.</P>

      <P>In the matter of this Bill I want to say if I have done the Seanad less than justice I regret that very much.  On the other hand, if the Seanad has done me less than justice I am prepared to suffer under that rather than to be putting myself and the Seanad to the trouble of ploughing through the proceedings of the Special Committee of this House, which was set up in the same way as, let us say, Senator Kenny parsed my speech in the Dáil.  I believe that, perhaps, I might establish that my attitude with regard to the suggestion of the eligibility of Senators for membership of the Executive Council throughout has been this&mdash;that I dislike it being raised as a side wind <Col N="763" /> to this particular Bill; that if this Bill were to pass unamended I was quite prepared to give my advice, for what it is worth, to the Executive Council, that it was a matter that might be discussed by a Joint Committee of both Houses.  I did indicate that I myself saw a certain objection to Senators being members of the Executive Council.  I see them still very clearly. But I was quite prepared to have the matter considered by a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad provided that the issue was not raised in connection with this particular Bill.</P>
      <P>I suggested in the Dáil that there was a suggestion of bargaining about the hanging up of this Bill, and the sending on to the Dáil of a resolution inviting them to set up such a joint Committee.  Senator Kenny says that in taking that view I was straining the King's English.  Again, if I have strained the King's English I am sorry, but I was adverting not so much to the King's English as to the resolution that came on to the Dáil, as to the action that was taken and to the attitude that I believe was implicit in that action The Bill came on here.  It was introduced and got a Second Reading.  It was referred to a Special Committee. That Special Committee advised the Seanad to hang up the Bill, to take no further action on it, and it invited the Dáil to join with them in a Committee to consider the desirability of Senators being eligible for membership of the Executive Council.</P>
      <P>I do think that underlying that there was a suggestion that the attitude of the Seanad to this Bill would be determined by the result of that Joint Committee when, and if, set up.</P>

      <P>If I am wrong I am glad to hear it, for it means the Seanad is prepared to consider this Bill on its merits and not on the merits or demerits of the proposal that Senators should become eligible for membership of the Executive Council.  I was a little bewildered when Senator Westropp Bennett was speaking, because he described this Bill as a flagrant violation of the Constitution.  It is a Bill to <Col N="764" /> amend the Constitution.  It is a question of language as to whether you regard a Bill to amend the Constitution as a flagrant violation of the Constitution. It is a Bill which, if it becomes an Act, will be part of the Constitution, and really that is the only comment I can make upon the whole argument of Senator Bennett that the Bill is unconstitutional. It is a proposal to amend the Constitution, and I gave reasons as best I could for that proposal on the Second Reading.  I said we had now less enthusiasm for the conception of the extern Minister than we had when the Constitution was being enacted.  It was frankly an experiment. We hoped it was an experiment which would mitigate the rigidity of the Party system, and that it would enable certain matters arising in certain spheres of administration to be discussed and considered in a non-Party way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there is an aspect of the matter which, perhaps, is overlooked or not sufficiently stressed, and that is that most of the major departmental proposals involve a question of finance. Fisheries, Education, Local Government, Posts and Telegraphs, radiate into the sphere of collective responsibility on that question of £ s.d.  Let us take, as a concrete example, the recent action of the Minister for Agriculture with regard to creameries.  He could not on that matter stand singly responsible. The whole essence of the project was the question of finance.  On that question the Executive Council had to sit in judgment on the proposal and form the best opinion they could about it. It is so on almost every matter, and consequently we have come to the conclusion that this idea of the single responsibility of the extern Minister is a matter of theory rather than fact and practice.  It cannot become a reality because of the financial factor.  While it is not proposed absolutely to abolish it, the Oireachtas is asked to say that each succeeding President on his election should have discretionary elasticity as to the number of members he will call into his Executive Council, and as to the extent of the field of entire administration that he will make a matter of collective responsibility. <Col N="765" /> I consider that an eminently reasonable proposal.  It does not close the door to the idea of an extern Minister, but leaves to each President, facing his own situation as he finds it after the General Election, and his own election, to say how many members he will have in the Executive Council, and how much of the field of administration he will make subject to collective responsibility. I think that is an eminently reasonable proposal.  I do not think it is a proposal that ought to be complicated with this other question as to whether or not it is desirable that members of this House should be eligible for membership of the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>That may be, and indeed is, an important question.  It is a question on which I have my own definite view, which I think I need not elaborate here and now.  I do not deny the importance of the question, but I contend that it is a separate question and that the subject matter of this Bill ought not to be complicated by the raising of that issue.  It is true that Senator Kenny and Senator Bennett justified their amendment by pointing to the fact that if you abolish extern Ministers, that inasmuch as Senators were, let us say, theoretically eligible to be extern Ministers, then to that extent the rights of Senators are involved. My reply is that they are involved equally with the rights of every adult citizen of the State, for there is no pointer in the wording of the Constitution to Senators any more than to any private citizen up and down the country in this matter of eligibility for the position of extern Ministers.</P>
    <P>Like Nelson Pillar and Mr. de Valera, I stand where I always stood in this matter.  I am still prepared as a distinct question, to see this matter of the desirability of Senators being eligible for the Executive Council discussed by a Joint Committee, but I want this Bill through as it stands, and I think it should go through as it stands because a General Election is imminent.  My contention is that the President elected by the Dáil after that General Election ought not to be limited to a membership of seven for his Executive Council, and ought not <Col N="766" /> to be placed in the position that whether he likes it or not he must leave a substantial portion of the field of administration outside the sphere of collective responsibility.  I believe that to tie his hands in that way would not be wise and would not be in the public interest.  I believe he should have this discretionary elasticity which the Bill seeks to give, and thereafter, either by a Private Bill introduced here or by a resolution of this House, the other matter can be discussed, and I would not object to it being discussed except in connection with this Bill.</P>

      <P>No doubt if it is desirable to amend it, it could be amended, but I would need a lot of convincing that it is desirable to make Senators eligible for membership of the Executive Council.  Any Senator could stand at the General Election who feels that he has ministerial aspirations. Article 16 of the Constitution says members of one House may stand for election in another, and need not resign their seat if they fail to pull off the chance.  Article 16 of the Constitution says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No person may be at the same time a member both of Dáil Eireann and of Seanad Eireann, and if any person who is already a member of either House is elected to be a member of the other House, he shall forthwith be deemed to have vacated his first seat.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now there is a great chance for someone.  The only other thing I wish to say is that Senators were elected, co-opted or nominated to this House to be Senators, to be members of a revising Chamber, and they were not elected, co-opted or nominated, as the case may be, to do anything other than that.  The question of an effective liaison between the Executive Council <Col N="767" /> and the Seanad is another matter.  I myself cannot see that there could be any more effective liaison than the daily attendance here, in connection with legislation, of members of the Executive Council to answer any question that may arise.  Senators complain regarding the lack of information about forthcoming legislation. They get as much information as members of the Dáil.  They are certainly entitled to it, and if they ask for it I cannot conceive its being denied to them, but I do not think myself that persons ought to aspire to ministerial office who have not direct responsibility to the people, who have not been elected by the people, at any rate not elected for that purpose or with any view of the possibility of that, and who have not the feeling that at any time they may have to answer politically to the people.  Senator Kenny enlarged on the advantage that they could bring to bear by way of a calmer judgment on matters of legislation.  It seems to me his argument in that respect was one for the abolition of representative Government.  If the calmer judgment depends on a feeling of entire independence of the people then there is a great deal to be said for the revolt against democracy that has taken place in some countries during the last seven or ten years.</P>

      <P>If this amendment were pressed to a division I should be obliged to vote against it, and I should be very sorry to be put in that position, because with the principle that underlies the amendment I am entirely in agreement.  I think the President should have the right to nominate, and the Dáil should have the right to approve of the nomination of a member of this House to the Executive Council. I feel this is not, at the moment, a matter of principle, but a matter of procedure.  I do not think that this is the best way of doing what we would like to do.  It is not the best way of getting the legislation that we desire to get.  We were not very well treated in the matter of the message that we sent to the Dáil.  I am happy to think that the situation that arose was the result of a misunderstanding.  I am <Col N="768" /> sure that that is so, but what I feel now is that an amendment to the present Bill is not the best way of getting what we want.  It is not even the way of getting the best discussion on the question as to what we want, and I think, for the sake of our own dignity, that this amendment should be withdrawn, and that this whole question involves a number of issues and a number of considerations which have not been brought before this House on this amendment, and could not very well be brought before it.  There are other weighty considerations that ought to, be considered by us before we adopt a drastic amendment of this kind.  I, therefore, suggest that the best course for the House to adopt would be to allow this amendment to be withdrawn and allow this Bill to go through and then let the matter come before us in a Bill which could be introduced in our own House after due consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in general agreement with Senator Brown in regard to the procedure.  I do not think that this amendment would be considered on its merits elsewhere if it is introduced in the present Bill.  I think the Minister might not have rather flippantly suggested that the amendments were brought forward because of the ministerial aspirations of any member of this House.  I do not think if Senators have ministerial aspirations that they are going to be realised in the near future, but it certainly is not the driving motive behind these amendments. We are concerned with an alteration of the Constitution, and we did take an interest, and we effectively enforced that interest with regard to another alteration of the Constitution which did not affect this House at all. So that the Minister's suggestion that this amendment is because of the ministerial ambitions of Senators here, is quite uncalled for.  These amendments really mean nothing to the individual Senators of this House.  The President, in the selection of the Executive Council, is absolute master of the situation.  He can form it as he thinks fit without let or hindrance from this House; if the amendment were carried he would be in exactly the same position. <Col N="769" /> He cannot be concerned into taking into his Cabinet any member of the Second Chamber, so that, from that point of view, one is amazed that there should be any serious opposition to this amendment, seeing that if it is adopted it really leaves matters much as they are, and brings no compulsion whatever to bear on the President.  The desirability of making members of this House eligible for membership of the Executive Council is of course quite another matter.</P>
      <P>Article 53 of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>...The other Ministers who are to hold office as members of the Executive Council shall be appointed on the nomination of the President, with the assent of Dáil Eireann, and he and the Ministers nominated by him shall retire from office should he cease to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Eireann, but the President and such Ministers shall continue to carry on their duties until their successors shall have been appointed: provided, however, that the Oireachtas shall not be dissolved on the advice of an Executive Council which has ceased to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not follow because a Ministry falls that there is a dissolution, and that another Ministry cannot be formed to carry on.  The Minister also referred to the small vote obtained by Senators at the Seanad election.  He overlooked the effect that the action of the Dublin Press had in regard to that election.  The two Dublin daily papers entered into an arrangement whereby no report of any proceedings or meetings held in connection with the election would be published unless they were paid as election advertisements. These two papers, evidently, see the need for a second Chamber.  They see, also, the need for selecting the most suitable people for that Chamber, but, nevertheless, their commercial instincts prevail over their patriotic aspirations. They would allow no one to secure publicity unless he was able to pay for it in hard cash.  Just fancy what the position would be if a similar attitude was adopted with regard to the Dáil elections.  Does anyone imagine the <Col N="770" /> same interest would be taken in the elections or that the same number would go to the polls if the same measure of publicity was not given that all decent journals are supposed to give in matters connected with the legislature of the country?  That, together with the fact that the electorate was much more restricted, though if anything more intelligent, accounts for the small vote.</P>
    <P>This amendment has very little significance, as there is very little likelihood of the President, for some time to come, selecting any member of this House as a member of the Executive Council.  So far, there have been in the other House very many more aspirants than offices and, on more than one occasion, I understand, Party discipline has been seriously impaired by disappointed aspirants.  Fancy the position of a President, with any amount of aspirants around him, who would come to this House and appoint a Minister from it, whilst the others had their aspirations unfulfilled! It would mean mutiny, in all probability. One can feel that while that spirit of protection or actual prohibition prevails there is no likelihood of a Senator being selected for office.  I understand also that the present Government feel that they have no thick-and-thin followers in this House, competent to take the position of a Minister, and that whoever was appointed would merely form a hopeless target for the criticism of his opponents and would, therefore, constitute a weakness rather than a strength.  I would point out that what this amendment really seeks to do is to leave the President full discretion for selecting his Ministers from both Houses if he so desires, without in the least saying &ldquo;You must do so.&rdquo; That is the constitutional liberty the President should have, and that prevails in most other Parliaments with the exception of the United States. That is a principle which can be discussed when a Bill dealing with this matter comes to be discussed.</P>
    <P>The Minister seeks to legislate as if his own Party was to be the Party in power for all time, and as if the views that Ministers have in matters of that kind should prevail.  It would be a <Col N="771" /> better outlook if they took the view that some day their Party may cease to have a majority in the House.  While they are in power they need never select any member of this House, but they should leave it to a subsequent President to have the liberty, if he so desires, of selecting Ministers from this House. The Minister suggests Labour, but I suggest that is a flippancy that he has introduced into the matter, and it certainly does not arise.</P>
    <P>Eight years after the Constitution was passed an amendment could only be effective as a result of a referendum. That is one of the reasons why we should be very slow to introduce an amendment to the Constitution here, which experience may show will have to be re-amended, as it would be exceedingly more difficult to amend it then.  I suggest to the mover that he should withdraw the amendment, as I do not think it is the best way to have this matter considered.  At a later stage a Bill may be introduced to deal with the matter, or, as the Minister has agreed, a Joint Committee of both Houses might discuss it free from all prejudice.</P>

      <P>My whole personal trend was against the proposal, but I did say that I was quite prepared to see it considered by a Joint Committee provided this Bill was allowed to go through.

      <P>We will leave it at that and accept the Minister's assurance. I would just like to refer to some remarks of the Minister and other speakers.  We, as the Seanad, are equally responsible for legislation with the Dáil under the Constitution.  We are not to be in any manner divested of that responsibility or to be considered a negligible part of the Oireachtas. Our position is not a minor or secondary one.  The principle object of the Oireachtas is the making of laws. Under Article 12 of the Constitution it is stated that &ldquo;the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the peace, order and good government of the Irish Free State is vested in the Oireachtas.&rdquo; The Oireachtas is not the Dáil.  We are equally responsible with the Dáil. Very often when Bills came to this House we transformed them so radically that one could not recognise them as the same measures that came from the Dáil.  We accept full responsibility for every law.  That is where we take exception to this Bill.  We are not given opportunities of amending certain Bills as otherwise we would amend them because they are rushed through, but the onus is on us equally with the Dáil.  However, when an immature and imperfect Bill is brought here and thrown out we are branded as not being worthy of our position here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite willing to withdraw the amendment if I get some sort of an assurance that the Minister will take his courage in his hands and go a little further than he has done&mdash;if he would assure us that the Government would introduce such a measure&mdash;it would be a very short Bill, I am sure&mdash;or that he would himself of his own volition make the proposal that a joint committee be set up for the purpose of going into this question.  It is only a formal matter. The Minister said the proper thing is to initiate a Bill here.  I can <Col N="774" /> see such a Bill meeting with the same fate as the Wild Birds Protection Bill. It would go to the Dáil loaded down with prejudice and would never have an opportunity of getting back here. Even though nothing eventuates, the whole position will be threshed out, and perhaps I would see at the Joint Committee there would be no object in pressing these amendments at all.  I am quite broad minded enough to say that.</P>
    <P>There is no member of the Seanad aspiring to Executive office.  I have not the least ambition in that way.  I do not think, seeing all the aspirants for office that there are in the Dáil, that any man here, even if he were a superman, would have the slightest chance of getting into the Executive.  All these arguments, I might point out, apply with equal force to the Legislatures in the Dominions.  Members of the popular House are pressing for Ministerial office, so that Ministers and Prime Ministers have to meet the same pressure as would be brought to bear even though Senators were made eligible for office.  If the Minister would see his way to give the assurance that I ask, he would make some sort of amende for the curt reply he made to the very courteous message which this House sent to the Dáil.  If he will undertake, as a <i>quid pro quo,</i> to propose in the Dáil that a Joint Committee be set up I will withdraw my amendments.</P>

What I did say was not that I would ask the Dáil to co-operate in extending, but that I would ask the Dáil to co-operate in considering the advisability of extending.  All the time my position was that apart from this Bill I had no objection to a Joint Committee to consider that matter.  I was quite definite in that before the Special Committee, and so far as I am concerned I am quite definite on it still.</P>

      <P>I will not undertake to propose it to the Dáil.  I do not know what the fate of it would be.  I know that Deputy Johnson objected most emphatically even to participate in such a Joint Committee.  It was he who suggested to me that to go into such a Committee was, in effect, to give a Second Reading to the proposal, that the Dáil considered there was need for something of the kind.  My position is: I would suggest to the Executive Council that the Dáil should be left free, on non-Party lines, to decide whether or not it wanted to co-operate in a Joint Committee in considering that specific proposal.</P>

      <P>What troubles me about Senator Kenny's attitude is that I understood we were all agreed that our action in regard to this Bill would not be of a bargaining nature.  Every one has repudiated the idea that in suggesting this Joint Committee and in postponing the Bill, we did so with the object of bargaining with the Government, or that we desired to make use of our attitude on this Bill so that Senators should be made eligible for posts in the Executive.  The Senator, however, still seems to be bargaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not to get an admission from them but to get consideration of a Joint Committee for the whole position.  There was no element of bargaining in so far as my attitude was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting anything about making a bargain.  I am suggesting that what you are trying to do is to get a compromise from the Minister that we now should go on, not to accept your amendments, but to pass the Bill.  That is, as far as I understand, the opinion of the Seanad.  We suggested a Joint Committee and to postpone the Bill to see if we could get a Joint Committee.  It was not the suggestion of the Seanad to hold a pistol at the Government's head and to say, &ldquo;if we do not get that Joint Committee and the concession we will not pass this Bill.&rdquo;  I do not think the Seanad are in any way helping the object they have in view by trying to force the Minister to accept amendments in order to get his Bill by making us some compromise of an indefinite nature in regard to whether we can get a Joint Committee to consider the matter of whether Senators should be eligible for elections Ministers or not.  As far as I am concerned, there was nothing further from my mind than that we should attempt, in any way, by our <Col N="777" /> action in this Joint Committee to force the hands of the Government.</P>
      <P>The whole matter as far as the Bill is concerned is one for the President and the Executive Council and is not one in which the Seanad should interfere. I think we should have the dignity to admit that.  If we want to settle the question of whether Senators should be eligible to be members of the Executive we should keep it to itself and not mix it up with another question.  We have sufficient assurance given that we will get that consideration when we ask for a Joint Committee to consider the matter later on.  I can hardly suggest again to Senator Kenny that he should drop his amendments, but I think he is wrong in asking us to vote against this Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Kenny asked will I give an assurance that the Government will move a resolution that a Joint Committee be set up.  I could not do that.  I do not think the resolution would pass.  It is unwise for the Government, to use a slang phrase, to bite off more than it can chew.  I believe the Dáil might not pass such a resolution, and I do not agree that they should be compelled to pass it as a matter of Government confidence.  On the other hand I would ask, and try to secure that the Government as such would not oppose a resolution of that kind, and in that state of affairs I am prepared to say personally and individually I would be glad to see the resolution passed.  I would be glad to hear a close discussion across a table on the merits of the situation. But my present view is against the proposal.  I dislike it.  I do not think the Seanad ought to contain potential or prospective Ministers.  The very fact that it did contain such would begin to alter, impalpably but certainly, the whole character of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would create parties here, and party points of view, and would take somewhat from the calmness of the deliberations of the Seanad.  But I have no objection at all to having the matter discussed as between members of the Seanad and the Dáil, and I am prepared to say if such a resolution comes from the Seanad, not in connection <Col N="778" /> with this Bill, but quite apart from this Bill, I would be glad to see such a committee set up, while I myself have my own views about the merits of the proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad to see this amendment withdrawn, but at every possible stage that I can oppose this Bill I shall oppose it.  I still feel as I felt when the original Committee was set up, that this Bill cuts across the Constitution.  I said it was vicious, and I add it is an amendment of the Constitution which is in an unwise direction.  For that reason I think it is my duty to prevent an amendment of the Constitution which I think is for the worse.  Further, if the House, as many speakers suggest, think it would be well to have Senators Executive Ministers in the Dáil, for my part I do not think it would be well.  In this I take the point of view of the Minister, but I think it would be well to have some Minister of the Government in the Seanad.  For that reason I will oppose this Bill as drastically as I can all through, because if it is passed, and we wanted to bring in a Bill securing that members of this House should be Ministers, we would have first and foremost to amend this Bill, and to amend other articles of the Constitution.  By not passing this Bill, the <i>status quo</i> remains, and we have still power to have Extern Ministers in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The precedent of two matters cropping up in one Constitution Bill has been established, provided they are relevant.  I submit my amendments are entirely in line with the text of the Constitution Bill No. 5, and they are not separate matters.  The Minister, to be consistent, if a message is sent down from the Seanad, or if a Bill is introduced here, or an invitation is sent forth for the purpose of setting up a Joint Committee, one must take up the same attitude he took up when a message was sent down the other day.  It was at his instigation and by his argument that the invitation was prejudiced, and had no chance of getting through.  Now he tells us if a similar message comes to the Dáil he will alter his attitude.</P>

      <P>The Senator need not worry about my consistency.  I will look after that.  I opposed the resolution that went down from here, because it was in connection with this Bill.  If a resolution comes down now before this Bill is through the Seanad I shall take up the same attitude, but if a resolution comes later I shall say that I, personally, would be glad to see this question opened up, though I have my own very definite view, for discussion between the members of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>

      <P>The Minister unfortunately did not confine his argument to that.  He did not say it was because it was associated in any way with the passage of this Bill here.  If that was his answer I could understand it.  He went outside that and went over the <Col N="780" /> whole range of argument, to show that such a thing would not be beneficial to the Constitution.  I anticipate from the whole tenor of this discussion and the Minister's attitude, and the attitude of the Seanad itself, that there is no use in my pressing these amendments.  We still have the Bill to deal with, and I ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</P>
