      <P>Dáil Eireann has passed the following resolution:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil concur with the Seanad in their Resolution communicated to the Dáil the 24th day of February, 1927, that it is expedient that a Joint Committee of both Houses be appointed to consider the Dublin Port and Docks (Bridge) Bill, 1927.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is the desire of the promoters not to have their Bill considered by a Committee at this period, as the Bill may have to undergo some alterations.  I would therefore ask the Seanad to postpone the motion standing in my name&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dublin Port and Docks (Bridge) Bill, 1927, be referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses&rdquo;&mdash;for a month, and in the meantime a motion of a general character will be put down to enable the promoters of Private Bills, initiated in the present session, to suspend further proceedings on their Bills in this session and to proceed with them in the next session.  It is essential, because a new Bill will probably have to be prepared in this instance.</P>
      <P>Ordered&mdash;That the motion of the Leas-Chathaoirleach be adjourned for a month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw attention to one matter in connection with this Bill.  I refer to the appointments of presiding officers and poll <Col N="1226" /> clerks for the election day.  Complaints have been repeatedly made after every election to the effect that these appointments are, in the main, given to civil servants, officials of public authorities, teachers and other people of that kind, whilst there are available almost sufficient people of a suitable type who are not employed.  I know, of course, it is the returning officer for the county who makes the appointments. I suggest the Minister might encourage, as far as possible, that where suitable unemployed people can be found they should get these appointments. The salary for the day is rather small, but it is big in proportion to what the unemployed get.  Where suitable unemployed persons can be found I think it is desirable they should be appointed.</P>

      <P>Of course the appointments are solely in the hands of the sheriff, and naturally he will take into consideration any circumstances of that kind.  I think it is quite obvious why in the past this particular type of official, coming from the ranks of civil servants, officials of local authorities, etc., was favoured.  The reason is the kind of work they do ordinarily is very similar to what they have to do in the booths.  I am sure the sheriffs will bear in mind the recommendation that has now been made in this House.</P>

      <P>There is an amendment in my name on the Orders of the Day to insert a new section before Section 12.  Since I put the amendment down I had some communication with the Minister.  We failed to impress each other with our respective points of view.

      <P>I would like to correct a false impression that is conveyed by the amendment paper.  If Senators will look at amendment 3, where a new section is proposed to be inserted by the Government, they will observe that it is the same section as is contained in the Bill.  It was apparently put down through some mistake. The new section the Government propose is not there.  We are dealing with amendment 3, but what is on the amendment paper is Section 58 as it stands in the Bill.  The section the Government is proposing is quite different.</P>

      <P>When this amendment was under discussion on the last occasion some Senators thought it was unduly severe, and that it imposed too great a personal responsibility on the members of the Committee of the club. I have considered that in the meantime and the amendment which I am asking the Seanad to accept now reads:</P>
      <P>Before Section 58 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> 58&mdash;(1)  If any excisable liquor is supplied for consumption on the premises of a club registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904 or is consumed on the premises of any such club by any person in contravention of the rules of such club relating to the supplying and consumption of excisable liquor on the premises of such club, such club shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof, in the case of a second or any subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding forty pounds.</P>
    <P>(2)  Proceedings under this section may be brought against a club in the name under which it is registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904 and any summons or other document required to be served on a club for the purpose or in the course of such proceedings may be served on the secretary of the club and any warrant for the recovery of the amount of a fine imposed on a club under this section may be executed against the goods and chattels of the club.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that meets the point that was raised by the Senators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 61 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> 61.&mdash;(1)  The holder of an on-licence (in this section referred to as the on-licence) in respect of premises situate in a county borough or in the county of Dublin or in an urban district may apply at the annual licensing District Court next after the passing of this Act or at any succeeding annual licensing District Court that in lieu of a certificate for the renewal of the on-licence there be granted to him in respect of the said premises a certificate for a new spirit retailer's off-licence or a certificate for a new beer retailer's off-licence or certificates for both such new licences.</P>
    <P>(2)  When an application under the foregoing sub-section is made the Justice of the District Court, if he is satisfied that a certificate for the renewal of the on-licence might have been granted and that the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption on the premises is no the principal business carried on in the premises to which the on-licence is attached, may, if he so thinks fit, grant to such applicant the certificate or certificates so applied for by him.</P>
    <P>(3)  When an application under sub-section (1) of this section is granted, a new licence or new licences shall notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other Act be granted to the applicant in accordance with the certificate or certificates granted to him in pursuance of such application.</P>
    <P>(4)  When a new licence or licences is or are granted under the foregoing sub-section no new on-licence shall at any time thereafter be granted in respect of the premises to which such new licence or licences are attached.</P>
    <P>(5)  When an application under sub-section (1) of this section is refused such application shall be treated as an application for a certificate for the renewal of the on-licence and dealt with accordingly.</P>
    <P>(6)  In this section the expressions &ldquo;spirit retailer's off-licence&rdquo; and &ldquo;beer  off-licence&rdquo; have <Col N="1231" /> the same meanings as such expressions respectively have in the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this new section that Senator Jameson has moved, with two deletions, I could accept it.  That would be the deletion of the words in line 3 of sub-section (1): &ldquo;or in the County of Dublin or in an urban district&rdquo; and the words in line 5 &ldquo;or at any succeeding annual licensing District Court.&rdquo;  The effect of that would be to confine the operations of the section to county boroughs and there would not be a recurring opportunity for people to avail of the provisions of the amendment, but that they would within a short time of the passing of the Act, have to make up their minds definitely whether or not they proposed to avail of it.</P>

      <P>We are not sure that we want to make it easy for people to get off-licences generally and that off-licences in fact, are for the most part grouped here around the county borough of Dublin.  Off-licences present rather a special difficulty in the matter of police supervision or rather a bigger degree of supervision is required.  We are out definitely to limit the operations of this amendment closely to the county boroughs.</P>

      <P>I wish to make it clear that the confusion that arose over Section 58, of the so-called Section 58, is not due to the officials of this House.  There was never a Section 58 in those terms.  An amendment was proposed by Senator Dowdall to introduce a Section 58 in these terms.  After that amendment was moved by Senator Dowdall it was withdrawn in order to give the Minister an opportunity of <Col N="1233" /> looking into it and introducing an improved draft of the section.  As a result, there was confusion, which has now been cleared up.</P>

      <P>The following amendment stands in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 8.  Before sub-section (5) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  (a).  The foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply to the compensation (if any) to be paid to the Grand Canal Company in respect of permanent injury to the navigation of the River Barrow and the Canals connected therewith by the execution of the said works.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b).  On the expiration of five years after the works to be executed under the scheme shall have been completed, the Grand Canal Company may require that the questions whether any permanent injury has been occasioned to the said navigation by the execution of the said works and whether any permanent benefit has been occasioned to the said navigation by the execution of the said works shall be referred to the arbitration of a competent engineer appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and such engineer shall also determine whether any and, if any, how much compensation is payable to the Grand Canal Company in respect of such permanent injury (if any) after taking into consideration such permanent benefit (if any).  The costs of both parties of such arbitration shall be in the discretion of the said arbitrator.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will recollect that the object I had in putting down this amendment in Committee was to give the Canal Company five years after the completion of the work, for the purpose of ascertaining exactly what damage had been done to their navigation. If the term ran for five years from the draft award they might not discover in the meantime what damage <Col N="1234" /> had been done, because the real damage they feared was the damage from an extremely wet year.  I proposed that the arbitration should not take place for five years after the completion of the work.  On the Committee Stage the Minister raised the objection that there were financial difficulties in the way which would practically make that impossible.  I have discussed the matter with the Minister since, and I am satisfied that the objection is a sound one.  I am also relieved to know that the work will not be finished for something like 2 or 3 years.  In the meantime a good deal of the damage&mdash;perhaps all if there happens to be a wet year&mdash;that the Canal Company will suffer in that time will have been done.  It is not practicable to carry this amendment, and I do not move it.</P>
    <P>Amendment not moved.</P>
    <P>The following Government amendment was agreed to:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The object of these amendments was to give the same kind of protection to the canal company as the railway got under the section as it stood in the Bill. I have since ascertained that the only real work on the canal which is likely to be interfered with is an aqueduct <Col N="1236" /> which is going to be underpinned. None of the bridges which are road bridges over the canal are likely to be affected.  I do not move the amendments as the Minister has put a provision in the next amendment to meet me.</P>

    <P>28&mdash;If and in so far as the scheme provides for the diversion, removal, or other interference with any aqueduct carrying a canal or other navigable waterway the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the Commissioners shall at or before the completion of the work specified in the scheme either restore the aqueduct to its former condition or construct a new permanent aqueduct sufficient to carry the like amount (in quantity and character) of navigating traffic as the original aqueduct was able to carry and not substantially less convenient in gradient, curve, and depth than such original aqueduct;</P>
    <P>(b)  if any doubt, dispute, or question shall arise as to whether the Commissioners in the restoration or construction of an aqueduct pursuant to this section have complied with the provisions of this section, such doubt, dispute, or question shall be decided by the Minister for Industry and Commerce whose decision shall be final and conclusive.</P>

      <P>I move the deletion of Section 11.  I put down this amendment in order that I might be able to obtain from the Minister a statement as to the position in regard to these fee-farm grants.  It is proposed to apply the same method of acquisition in the case of fee-farm grants outside the congested districts as already exists inside them, and if that intention is carried out it appears that a very great injustice is liable to be done to the holders of fee-farm grants.  According to the statement the Minister made in the Dáil, the price which the Land Commission will pay to the grantee will be <Col N="1238" /> fixed on the supposition that the land is to be acquired for the purpose of the relief of congestion, and, of course, we all know that in order to finance the division of land for the relief of congestion the price must be very low to secure the interests of the State.  In many cases these fee-farm rents are very well secured, and in certain cases there could be no intention of dividing up the land.  The grantee in some cases may be an institution.  I know one case where the grantee is a religious institution&mdash;a monastery&mdash;where there is a very extensive building on the land and the land has been very much improved, and where the question of sub-division could never arise, and yet in spite of that the price will be fixed on the supposition that the land will be divided up.  A very low price will, in consequence, be given and the grantor will receive far less than the full value of his security.  I do not know if I am right, but that is may reading of the Minister's remarks in the Dáil when he said that he (the Judicial Commissioner) must redeem the rent in such a way as to leave a sufficient allowance for the grantee.  In other words, he is going to resell the land to the grantee, on the assumption that the land will be divided among congest.  I ask the House to take the view that that is a wrong and unreal assumption, acting to the prejudice of the well-secured interest. I ask the House if they think that is fair, and if they think it is not fair I think the section might be dropped altogether, and that we might leave the position as it is at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

      <P>There are three possible courses.  One would be to leave the position as it is at present, another would be to treat fee-farm grantees as tenants and the third would be to adopt the compromise contained in this section.  On many estates there are a large number of small holdings with valuations of £6, £8, and £10, as fee-farm grantees.  These are not at all so uncommon here and there throughout the country.  We have cases in the Land Commission of twenty to twenty-five small-holders, actually congest, with valuations of £7 or £8, who are fee-farm grantees, all having to be treated as separate <Col N="1239" /> estates and bought as fee-farm grantees.  In other cases there are farms of anything from 50 to 100 acres and in other cases farms of 100 to 200 acres, and very big estates held under fee-farm grantees.  It is difficult to apply the same legislation to all of them.  As I say, we might have left these as they were.  If we did we would please some fee-farm grantors and grantees and we would displease others.  There are many fee-farm grantors and grantees very anxious for this section.  There are fee-farm grantors whose relations with their grantees are of the very best and who have some sympathy with the plight in which they find they are now.  In some cases these grants were made in 1919 and 1920 at exorbitantly high rents; they are not able to meet the yearly rents and have got into some arrears.  There are other cases still where the events of 1919 to 1923 made it extremely difficult for people to work their lands and consequently to pay their fee-farm rents yearly, and they are now in arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now that there is a large section of fee-farm grantors who would be anxious for a way out on the lines of adding some of the arrears to the purchase money, andthat is one of the things that this section does.  No matter how you try to solve this problem you will not have a simple alignment with the grantors on the one side and the grantees on the other; you will have both in favour of this and both against it.  On the other hand, you will have the very same position no matter what you do.  I was pressed very strongly indeed to treat the fee-farm grantees in exactly the same way as if they were tenants, but I declined to do that.  Undoubtedly a very good case could be made out for treating fee-farm grantees as tenants. There would be the examples I have mentioned of small farms here and there on estates with valuation of £6 or £7 held by fee-farm grantees in circumstances exactly the same as tenants.  There are other considerations that could be urged in favour of treating fee-farm grantees as tenants, but I declined to adopt that expedient, <Col N="1240" /> and as a way out I suggest this section. The position under the 1920 Land Bill, and also under the 1923 Land Act, was that fee-farm grantees inside the congested districts purchased in this way, that is to say, the land was vested in the Land Commission was untenanted land and re-sold to the fee-farm grantees.  That position was first enshrined in the Act of 1920 and continued in the Act of 1923, in view of the fact that there are strong arguments in favour of treating fee-farm grantees as tenants.  But actually I think the compromise that I have suggested in this section, putting the fee-farm grantees living outside the congested districts in the same position as those living inside it, is the fairest one. I do not pretend that there is a principle behind it; it is a matter of expediecy and I think it meets the equities of the case.  I do not think that it would be fair to treat the fee-farm grantees as though they were tenants, start by giving them 25 per cent.  of a reduction in their arrears and 25 per cent.  reduction in their rents and then fix a fair rent on that basis.  I have always declined to do that.  On the other hand, it is difficult to resist the argument directed towards showing that fee-farm grantees outside the congested districts should be placed in exactly the same position as those inside.  In any event, I have adopted that particular method and I think it fairly meets the equities of the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>While differing from the Minister as regards the differentiation between fee-farm grantees of a certain valuation, I think he has certainly made a reasonable compromise in favour of the grantors. I cannot really see why fee-farm grantors should be any more sacrosanct than ordinary landlords.  A great deal of property changed hands in Ireland in the last couple of hundred years, and if a man bought a fee-farm grant it was a matter of choice.  Having accepted the principle that land had to be treated from a certain standpoint, I think it would have been better to let all fee-farm grants be treated exactly as other land has been treated.  I think that was <Col N="1241" /> largely the recommendation of a special commission which was set up. Certainly if such a proposition had been before the Seanad I would have supported it.  The section before us is a very reasonable compromise in favour of fee-farm grantors, and to oppose it would be very unwise.  I accept it as a compromise.  I regret that the section has not been made wider and that all fee-farm grantees have not been included.  I know several cases myself which will just be outside the section, where the persons concerned are really bona fide tenants, as the Minister suggests, and where great hardship will be done.  As I said, I cannot see why fee-farm grantors should be any more sacrosanct than ordinary owners.</P>

      <P>This section applies only to three conditions:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that the applicant is in bona fide occupation of the parcel of untenanted land uses and cultivates the same as an ordinary farmer in accordance with proper methods of husbandry; and</P>
      <P>(b)  that the rent payable by the applicant in respect of the parcel of untenanted land in equal to or exceeds what in the opinion of the Land Commission would have been the fair rent of the lands comprised in the parcel if the same had at the passing of the Land Act, 1923 constituted a holding held by the applicant as a statutory tenant thereof subject to a third term judicial rent; and</P>
      <P>(c)  that the applicant is willing to repurchase and that the parcel should be resold to the applicant.</P>
      <P>As I understood Senator Sir J. Keane, he was proceeding to frame a case where there was a smaller rent than an agricultural rent reserved under the lease.

      <P>There is a further point, that the arrears of rent which are really interest, are treated as capital, and go to form a capital fund which is very different to the old arrangement, because the capital revenue and rents were kept distinct.  In this case the three years arrears are treated in effect as a capital sum, while in actuality they are interest payments. That is a further hardship on the grantor.  I really think that there is <Col N="1243" /> an element of rough justice in this case which acts very harshly on the amply secured grantors.  I may be wrong, but that is the way I read it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;23&mdash;When the Land Commission have caused lands to the inspected in order to ascertain such particulars thereof as may be required for the purposes of the Land Purchase Acts, they shall, after considering the reports of their inspectors, notify the decision come to by them within such time as may be prescribed, to the person who appears to be the owner of the lands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to meet the case made by Senators Sir J. Keane and Brown on the last occasion.  It was pointed out that after an Inspector had been sent down to inspect the lands long delay occurred before the transaction was completed.  I pointed out that there was another side to the case, and the promise I gave to meet it is this amendment, which takes the form of a new sub-section to be inserted before Section 23.  If that section is passed, regulations will have to be made by the Land Commission setting out the time within which notice would be given.  It would be a short time.  It is the only thing I can suggest to meet the case put forward.  A particular case was mentioned on the last occasion, where the Land Commission had served notice say after a year.  That particular holding was a &ldquo;retained&rdquo; holding, and it was <Col N="1244" /> pointed out that notice was served two years ago and that nothing has been done since.  That case is nothing like as bad as it looks.  To begin with, as the Land Act is at present every holding worth more than £3,000 must be &ldquo;retained&rdquo; to start with.  There are two proceedings, one is retaining a holding and the other resuming a hold ing, and every holding on which a greater advance than £3,000 is to be made to the landowner in order to purchase must be retained.  On vesting of the landlord's interest in the holding it is for the Land Commission to consider whether they will resume the holding, but the steps are set out quite clearly.  So far as tenanted land is concerned every tenant knows, or should know, that the law at present in force provides that if an advance is to be greater than £3,000 the holding has to be retained&mdash;it does not add or subtract from the security of the holding&mdash; that in fact the Land Commission must serve notice on him because he must get that notice.  So long as the holding is so big that it will take more than £3,000 to purchase it then at some stage we must serve notice to say that it is a retained holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That should not be news to the tenant because the Act states that no greater advance shall be made than £3,000 except in certain circumstances. All that the serving on a tenant of notice that a holding is to be retained means is that this section is in the Land Act.  Afterwards comes the question of resumption and that can only be considered when the landlord's interest in the holding cannot be vested in the Land Commission if there are arrears of rent.  In the case quoted the last day although the name was not mentioned I looked up the circumstances of it in the Land Commission and I think I am right in saying that there were arrears in that case and consequently, the land could not be vested in the Land Commission.  That is the reason why such a long time lapsed between the actual serving of the notice that the holding was retained and the vesting of the holding in the Land Commission.  If the holding is <Col N="1245" /> once vested, then, the negotiations about resumption could take place and there are the serious negotiations.  The mere fact that there is notice served that it is to be retained does not inevitably mean that the holding is going to be resumed.  What would happen on resumption would be the Land Commission would consider it from two or three points of view.  (1) They might make an advance of five or six or ten thousand pounds as they have discretion to do.  (2)  They might make an advance which, while not covering the whole holding would be nevertheless more than £3,000.  (3) They might say we will make advances of £3,000 provided you put up two or three thousand pounds in cash but they cannot begin to consider that question which is the really serious question for the tenant until the holding is vested in the Land Commission.  On the other hand the holding cannot be vested under the Act of 1923 as long as arrears of rent are due and that is the reason why you have certain delays, because on a big proportion of the tenanted land there were arrears.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 3, sub-section (2), to delete the words &ldquo;either generally or temporarily for a period not exceeding twelve months&rdquo; inserted in Committee after the word &ldquo;service&rdquo; in line 50 and to substitute therefor the words either regularly or tentatively for a period not exceeding twelve months.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is really a verbal amendment.  On the last occasion the word &ldquo;generally&rdquo; was objected to as an inappropriate word to use.  The object of the amendment was that the company might have a chance of trying a route, working it tentatively, and in that case they <Col N="1248" /> should be allowed to withdraw it without the approval of the Minister.  The word &ldquo;generally&rdquo; does not seem to be proper and I move to substitute the words &ldquo;either generally or temporarily for a period not exceeding twelve months&rdquo; by the words &ldquo;either regularly or tentatively for a period not exceeding twelve months.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think that I have got the information I wanted from the remarks of the Senator.  I wanted to know if it was his intention to have a tentative service removed from the approval of the Minister either in regard to its establishment or withdrawal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>Only as to withdrawal. If the Minister reads the section with my words introduced he will find that a tentative service has to be approved. It is only when you come to the subsequent sub-section which deals with giving up a service that you do not require approval.</P>

      <P>I am advised that it runs the risk of being interpreted with both words and that, perhaps, the word &ldquo;permanently&rdquo; might be substituted for the word &ldquo;regularly.&rdquo;  You could not have a permanent service &ldquo;for a period not exceeding twelve months.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would like to <Col N="1249" /> put this point on its merits.  If the railway company is going to be given leave to run experimental services and to be allowed to withdraw them without the approval of the Minister, the company will, in fact, run nothing except experimental services and will not run regular services.  Every service will be described as experimental.</P>

      <P>It could be introduced again tentatively the next year. I do not know what the Seanad thinks of the principle of the Bill.  The idea was that the prohibition which at present lies on the railway company in regard to the running of road motor services should be withdrawn, and that the company should be put in the same position as any other company or person in regard to the running of road services.  First one has to safeguard the railway revenue by seeing that no injudicious road service would be run against competition which it could not defeat except by running it at a loss. Secondly, one has to protect the public against the railway company, which being a large corporation and having, at any rate, facilities for finance&mdash;if not having loose finances at present&mdash;might hereafter defeat the road services which are at present run beneficially to the public, and, having done so, might then clear off the road themselves. Having defeated their competitors, they might come off the road themselves in the hope that the traffic would then flow back to the railway.  If that principle be accepted, I think there is a weakening of the liabilities under which the railway company is being put in regard to facilities they are now getting for running road services.  In other words, we are going to allow them to run experimental services and allow them to take them off without the permission of the Minister.  As set out in the Bill, once the service is established and the rate fixed, the rate is not to be lowered nor the service withdrawn or discontinued without the approval of the Minister.  The amendment introduces a new point, namely, that what is described as an experimental road service may be run and <Col N="1250" /> afterwards withdrawn without the approval of the Minister.  That is an open door to the company which they may push wider and eventually defeat the restrictions put upon them.  That may be good or bad, as the restrictions may be too onerous.</P>

      <P>The Seanad carried my amendment on the last day, but it was worded differently and less artistically. I suggest that it is better to get the amendment worded properly than to leave it as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that.  I am rather enlarging the remarks I made on the last day.  I have doubts as to how the change will be received by the Dáil.  It is a breach in the Bill as sent by the Dáil, and it is a breach in the provision about which they were most insistent.  If it is to be put through I ask that it be put through at once so that I may argue the matter at greater length with the Dáil.  If it is to be put through, I agree that it is better to have it worded properly.  I am pointing out that there is a danger of the amendment not being accepted by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Is there not a danger that if you do not have an amendment of this kind the public will lose a certain amount of service as the railway company will not be ready to make an experiment?  I think there is great danger that if they cannot withdraw they will not put on a service which is doubtful from the point of view of profit.</P>

      <P>I want to remind the House how the matter stands.  The Committee have already accepted an amendment to insert in this section the words &ldquo;either generally or temporarily for a period not exceeding twelve months.&rdquo;  It was objected to by the Minister that these words &ldquo;generally or temporarily&rdquo; were little awkward, and <Col N="1251" /> not very accurate expressions.  The Senator said he would consider and see if he could not devise more suitable terms than the words &ldquo;generally and temporarily.&rdquo;  The result of his meditation was to produce &ldquo;regularly or tentatively.&rdquo;  On further consideration, and on the suggestion of the Minister, he now prefers &ldquo;permanently&rdquo; to &ldquo;regularly.&rdquo;  The amendment would run, then, &ldquo;either permanently or tentatively for a period not exceeding twelve months.&rdquo;  What is before the Senators now is whether they will give leave to change the amendment passed in Committee from &ldquo;generally or temporarily&rdquo; to &ldquo;permanently or tentatively.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I was under the impression that this matter was deferred for the purpose of making a verbal alteration in the amendment. The principle of the amendment on the last occasion was accepted subject to modification.  If connection with another Bill the Minister deprecated the introduction of a spirit of pessimism. I venture to suggest that he himself is sounding a note of pessimism to-day when he tells us that the railway company might be very apprehensive about the success of motor services, and that as a consequence they would regard all these services as experimental. I do not want to indulge in the role of prophet, but I do not think that the railway company have any such view.  In my opinion the amendment that Senator Brown has now moved provides, what we are hoping will occur on very rare occasions, that when a service which is experimental has been found unprofitable or undesirable then the company should have the power of withdrawal of that service.  When it is said that all services would be experimental and withdrawn without the Minister's approval, that is going further than anyone could anticipate.</P>

      <P>I think it is clear from the Minister's statement that he is not quite as enthusiastic about this amendment as he was on the last occasion.  I think his chief objection is that if this amendment is carried the railway company can with the approval of the Minister institute a motor service, and withdraw it without his permission.  I would like to know how he arrives at that conclusion.  Is he quite clear that even a tentative service can be withdrawn without his approval?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The third amendment by Senator Brown achieves that, and the amendments are put down together.  I put it to the House that there is leave in the Bill as it stands for an experimental service to be run with the approval of the Minister, and it can only be discontinued if the Minister again approves of its discontinuance. I would ask whether that is a good power to put into the hands of the Minister, rather than have it in the way of an amendment that a tentative service once established with the approval of the Minister can be withdrawn at the railway company's discretion.  At the worst, every service would be inaugurated as an experimental service.  That would be the tendency resulting from the amendment in order to get away from having to go to the Minister for approval for the discontinuance of the service.</P>

      <P>Up to the present about sixty amendments have <Col N="1254" /> been handed in to the Electricity Bill, and I have no reason to anticipate that that is the conclusion of them.  If we take the Committee Stage of the Bill on to-morrow and Thursday I am hoping that we will be able to complete it by Friday.  That would dispose of the Committee Stage of the Electricity Bill and we would take the Report on Wednesday or Thursday of the following week.  In view of the amount of business that we have at present pending in this House and the number of Bills that are yet to make their way to this House as far as I can see we shall be able to dispose of them by the end of next week.  That is provided always that we will not be called upon to deal with the Currency Bill.  If we are asked to deal with the Currency Bill which we probably shall not have until next week I do not see how we can possibly get through that within the time.  It is a very important Bill which would, I think, call for a good deal of discussion.  I do not know what the intentions of the Government may be but I think it is quite possible that they cannot be deliberately anxious to have that Bill disposed of before the Recess. I am not suggestion that we should get any view from the Minister upon it, but I have written to-day to the President asking for information of the subject and I will be able to inform the House to-morrow how the position stands.</P>
