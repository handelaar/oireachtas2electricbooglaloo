      <P>I desire also to mention that the Central Fund Bill will, I think, be available for Second Reading on Wednesday next &mdash; this day week.  The House will understand that on that Bill Senators will have an opportunity, if they wish to exercise it, of discussing the various Estimates, and may raise any question they choose on the Estimates.</P>

      <P>The House will recollect that in the case of the Constitution (Amendment No. 5) Bill it agreed, on the report of the Select Committee to whom that Bill was sent, to postpone the consideration of the measure until they received a reply from the Dáil to their message suggesting the appointment of a Joint Committee. The Dáil, as you know, declined to appoint members on a Joint Committee, and consequently, if the Bill is to proceed in this House, it will be necessary for some Senator to put down a notice of motion recommitting the measure.  If it is desired to go on with the Bill, I suggest the proper thing to do is to put down a notice of motion recommitting the Bill to the Select Committee.  The Select Committee did not deal with the matter as a <Col N="624" /> Committee; they simply agreed that for the present they would postpone consideration of it.</P>

      <P>So far as I can see, the business this day week will consist of the Central Fund Bill, Second Stage.  As I have indicated, it will be open to Senators to discuss any particular Estimate they desire to call attention to.  We will also have under consideration the Report Stage of the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Bill, 1927, and the Constitution (Amendment No. 5) Bill, 1926, provided the notice of motion I have mentioned is put down.  There will be also the election of a Senator to fill the casual vacancy.  Apart from that, I do not contemplate we will have any other business ready.  The House will meet this day week, because the election has been fixed for that day.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.10 p.m. till Wednesday, 23rd March.</P>
