      <P>I am afraid that under our Standing Orders it is not open for discussion now.  The Standing Order says that when any stage of a private Bill is first taken no discussion shall be allowed, and, if a Bill is opposed, it shall not be proceeded with on that occasion.  Apparently, I am precluded from having any discussion at this stage.  The procedure differs from an ordinary public Bill in this way: that the passing of this stage only means that it is referred to a committee.  On Committee all interests can be represented.  It is not like a public Bill because the parties can appear with counsel and argue the pros and cons of the Bill.  I think that is the reason why the Standing Order was passed in conformity with the practice prevailing in the British legislature.</P>

If the Bill be then opposed consideration shall again be postponed, and the Speaker of the Dáil and the Chairman of the Seanad shall fix a time for its further consideration.

    <Title>PRIVATE BUSINESS. - CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT No. 2) BILL, 1926&mdash;THIRD STAGE.</Title>
    <P>&ldquo;The Constitution shall be and is hereby amended by the insertion therein of the following paragraph at the end of and as an addition to Article 21, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;The member of Dáil Eireann who is the Chairman of Dáil Eireann immediately before the dissolution of the Oireachtas shall, unless before such dissolution he announces to Dáil Eireann that he does not desire to continue to be a member thereof, be deemed without any actual election to be elected at the ensuing general election as an additional member of Dáil Eireann not representing <Col N="218" /> any constituency and shall as such additional member have all the rights and obligations of an ordinary member of Dáil Eireann (including eligibility for the office of Chairman) save that his death, resignation or disqualification shall not create a vacancy in the membership of Dáil Eireann.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The first four amendments on the Orders of the Day are consequential on what happens to the one I ask permission to move.  It reads:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2. The member so elected shall be deemed to represent the constituency which last elected him to Dáil Eireann, and the number of Deputies to be ordinarily elected by the said constituency at the ensuing general election shall accordingly be reduced by one, save that the death, resignation or disqualification of the said member shall create a vacancy in the said constituency, which vacancy shall be filled by the ordinary methods of election of a member of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is to alter the Bill so that the outgoing Chairman of the Dáil shall be automatically elected an ordinary member of Dáil Eireann as representing the constituency that elected him to Dáil Eireann.  The constituency which he represents will return one Deputy less than it would return ordinarily, but, in the event of the death of the Ceann Comhairle, a vacancy would be created in the constituency and would be filled by the ordinary method of an election.  This amendment merely seeks to do by legislation what is done in England and in other places by arrangement between the different political parties.  Of course there is every reason to believe that if there were single-member constituencies here, as in Great Britain, there would be an arrangement between the parties not to oppose the Speaker of the Dáil.  That <Col N="219" /> is rendered difficult, if not well-nigh impossible, by the fact that here all the constituencies return a comparatively large number of members, so that it is impracticable to return a Speaker unopposed. The amendment suggests that if we cannot do it by arrangement we should try to do it by legislation.  Personally, I am not in love with the amendment any more than I am with the Bill.  I think it is an undesirable form of legislation.</P>
      <P>I am moving the amendment as, in my opinion, it is at all events somewhat more desirable than what is in the Bill.  Under the Bill a sort of floating additional member is added to the Dáil by the Dáil itself.  The total membership of the Dáil is increased for the time being by one member who represents no constituency.  If he is not selected for the Chair after the new Parliament opens, he is then in the rather anomalous and unenviable position of not being in the Chair.  At the same time he represents no constituency, and has no intimate connection with any constituency.  There are times also when with an even division of parties one additional member might have a vital effect on the life of a Government. If he is in the Chair he has a casting vote and gives that vote although he is a person representing no constituency and is an additional member. That may have very far-reaching and vital results.  If he should die or resign before the next election there is no provision for electing anybody in his place, so that the membership of the House fluctuates, at all events, to the extent of one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another consideration that I do not want to advance very much is that by the amendment the allowance of one Deputy would be saved.  It may be a small matter, but it is a consideration that may be worth mentioning.  I do not claim that the amendment is by any means perfectly drafted.  I only ask the House to consider the principle of it, and the drafting may be seen to afterwards.  As I said, I am not in love with the amendment, but I think it is more acceptable than the arrangement of adding an additional member to the Dáil, and making him a floating member without attachment to any constituency. <Col N="220" /> I suggest the amendment as a compromise for the consideration of the House.</P>

      <P>What is the position at present, supposing the Speaker resigns during his term of office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>At present he represents the University, and if he resigns, as in the case of any other Deputy, a vacancy is created and is filled by a by-election.  If he represented any constituency outside the University the same thing would occur. As the Bill stands, if the Speaker resigns there would be no election.  No vacancy would be created.  My position is, if my amendment is passed, that at the next election the University would elect only two instead of three Deputies.  In the event of death or disqualification there would be a vacancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the position is that if the Speaker resigns his seat during the first term but not the Chairmanship, there would be a vacancy.  If he resigned under the Bill after he was deemed elected, the position would be as Senator O'Farrell has stated.  I think the amendment proposed by Senator O'Farrell is a very interesting one.  It is quite clear that it does not in any sense cut across the principle of the Bill.  Those who strongly support the Bill can support the amendment without in any way injuring what it is desired to achieve.  At first I was inclined to think the amendment is an improvement, but on the whole, I am inclined to think it is not.  It is not because of any vital difference.  It is largely a matter as to which will be the more convenient machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the amendment were inserted and the Speaker died or resigned, as suggested, if he had been deemed to be elected under the Bill there would be a by-election.  That is one clear difference and a point in favour of the amendment that will appeal to those who consider representing a constituency to be of considerable value. Personally I do not think under Proportional Representation that is a matter of very great importance, but the drawback to the amendment is a Speaker has first of all to be elected <Col N="221" /> for a constituency returning say four, five, six or seven members.  He then finds himself chosen as Speaker, and then, in my opinion, he practically ceases to represent that constituency. He cannot act in any party sense, he cannot argue in public, and he cannot represent the constituency except in some way which I think is undesirable. For all practical purposes there is disfranchisement under the amendment, and that disfranchisement would continue if there were six members representing the constituency for which the gentleman was returned, who was chosen Speaker.  At the next election only five would be elected because the Speaker would be deemed to be elected.  I think, but it is not vital, that it is preferable to let that constituency elect six members.  The fact is you cannot get a perfectly logical position if you want to provide for this.  I do not think there would be a saving of £360 a year.  If the gentleman is not re-elected as Speaker somebody else would of course be chosen for the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Under my amendment there would not be an additional member.  There would not be more than 153 members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case there would be an additional member, but it would not always so work.  To be logical and make the thing perfect you would want to provide that he should be a member of the constituency of the person who was chosen in his place.  On the whole I think it is better as it stands, but it is a matter of choice.</P>

      <NameTxt>EARL of KERRY</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot make this sort of thing completely logical, but I am bound to confess that Senator O'Farrell's amendment makes it more logical than it is in the Bill.  It approximates as nearly as possible to the custom on the other side, which works very well in practice.  It seems to me perfectly fair that the Speaker would be virtually deemed to be elected, and to continue to be a member of the constituency for which he was originally elected.  Would not there be a certain injustice supposing he were not chosen as Speaker in the <Col N="222" /> second Parliament?  He would have, so to speak, divorced himself from his constituency during a period of four years during which, through force of circumstances, he had been unable to do anything for that constituency. You would assume he was a member of merit or he would not have been elected Speaker.  He would get his reward by letting him continue to represent that constituency in the next Parliament, and you would give him a chance under these circumstances of actually representing the constituency. It seems to me that it is far more logical in that way than to put in an extra member with all the possibilities that may arise under the Bill.  Therefore I support Senator O'Farrell's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment which is consequential has the appearance at any rate of elected representation. The person who has acted throughout the period of the life-time of one Parliament is deemed to be elected for the constituency which elected him in the last General Election.  In that way, unlike the provisions of the Bill, the total membership of the Dáil remains what it was, and the constituency which in the previous General Election returned the Speaker will be only free to elect one short of its full representation.  Whether that represents an improvement on the Bill or not is questionable.  The Speaker on his election was, I submit, called from the service of his constituency to the service of the Dáil, but he is to be dumped on that constituency by Statute in the next General Election, and the constituency is to be docked to the extent of one seat of its full representation.  Whether simply for a desire to adhere to the appearance of democratic and elected representation we are not in fact infringing on it to an almost equal extent is a question, but there is one reaction in this amendment to which I would like to draw attention.  Article 26 of the Constitution provides that the constituencies shall be revised at least once in every ten years.  Now, let us suppose that during the lifetime of a particular Parliament the constituencies are so <Col N="223" /> revised, and let us suppose that the constituency which elected the person chosen as Speaker in the previous General Election was substantially altered, or perhaps legislated out of existence, to what constituency then is the Speaker to be deemed to be elected in the next General Election? Senator O'Farrell says his former constituency, but his former constituency may have disappeared as a result of the operation of Article 26 of the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and as a result of such revision one constituency might disappear and be merged in an adjoining constituency. If the Speaker's constituency were to disappear, or to be substantially altered, then to what constituency under this amendment is the Speaker deemed to be elected in the next General Election?  His former constituency will have ceased to exist. Parts of it may exist, but the former constituency as such has gone if it is interfered with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would find another.  That is not at stake.  But the Speaker is not free to find another. Under the amendment he is to be deemed to be elected to his former constituency, and that might put him in the dilemma; that in the absence of his former constituency he is not deemed to be elected for any constituency. If the constituency is altered then it disappears in fact. There is that difficulty about the squaring of the provisions of Article 26 of the Constitution with what the Senator seeks to effect by his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now this other proposal is simply that the Speaker be returned to the Dáil as an additional member, free to choose a constituency on whose needs he may care to concentrate with a view to the next ensuing General Election.  I do not think there is anything particularly anomalous in that.  There is the same anomaly as there is in Great Britain. We have been told by Senator the Earl of Kerry that the system in Great Britain works very well.  It does of course work very well, but whether the electorate there would be enthusiastic about it is another matter.  It results in the disfranchisement for a long period of years of an important urban constituency.  It works very well because the heads of parties refrain from putting up candidates in opposition to the Speaker, but the net result for the electorate of that constituency is that for all practical purposes it is disfranchised during the lifetime of the Speaker.  Now this proposal is that your Speaker who has served in one Parliament be returned automatically to the next without defining him as representing any particular constituency. If he is not elected to the Chair, well he is there as an extra member with a roving commission, free to choose the constituency that he may care to concentrate on, and we are told that is a fault and a stigma.  It is something less than one per cent. of an encroachment on the representative character of the assembly.  Whether you will improve that very much by saying by Statute that he is deemed to be a representative of some constituency which, in fact, has not elected him, is a question, <Col N="225" /> and when you add to that question the difficulty that I pointed out and that certainly may arise under Article 26 of deciding what constituency he represents, if the constituency that elected him in the former General Election is substantially altered, then I think there is a case for leaving the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Farrell in the attitude he has adopted towards this amendment.  He said he was not very much enamoured of it, and I am much in the same position. There is one comfort about this amendment, that whether it is passed or not it is not going to spoil the Bill. No matter whether you pass the amendment or leave the Bill as it is, the Speaker will remain in the House.  My reason for not being enamoured of this amendment and for much preferring what is in the Bill is this: the objection to the Bill on the part of Senator O'Farrell and of others who share his view is that it infringes the theory of parliamentary representation.  You have someone in the House who represents no constituency.  Well, to a certain kind of decimal extent that is perfectly true.  But, on the other hand, this amendment makes the matter very much worse, for under it the Speaker will be automatically dumped on a constituency which he may not represent at all&mdash;he may not represent the views of the people in that constituency at all.  In fact, their views in the meantime may have undergone an entire change.  I am, therefore, in favour of the Bill on the ground of parliamentary representation, believing as I do that you do less harm to it by the Bill than by passing this amendment.</P>

      <P>The speech of the Vice-President confirms me in my opinion that this is not a desirable Bill.  The amendment which Senator O'Farrell has moved meets the situation to some extent, though I would have preferred to have the matter debated on the amendment which I intend to propose to line 31.  The speech of the Vice-President raises a new spectre.  He told us that in addition to having a Speaker in a new Dáil in future years who would represent nobody, that we would have what he <Col N="226" /> called disappearing constituencies, so that apparently we are to have members of the new Dáil representing nobody, and we are to have constituencies that will disappear if you press a button.</P>

      <P>Yes.  All this is evidence to my mind that it would be very much better to leave things as they are.  The Vice-President told us about a Speaker or ex-Speaker who was not re-elected to be Speaker. I gather that is the case that he had in mind.  He told us that that gentleman, who represented nobody, should concentrate on another constituency while he sat in the Dáil.  I can imagine the reception that the member for that other constituency would give this gentleman representing nobody concentrating upon the people whom he was elected to represent.  I disapprove of this Bill altogether.  It is very hard to amend it, and logically it is not possible to amend it.  You cannot amend a thing logically which is utterly illogical in itself.  It only shows us how unwise it is to make constitutional amendments without some really grave and all-important reason.  We have a written Constitution, and this is one of the illustrations of the advantages of a written Constitution.  We find it very difficult, if we amend it, to know what the results of that amendment are likely to be.  Senator O'Farrell's amendment is an attempt to improve what I think is a very illogical situation. I object, and will continue to object, to a member of a representative assembly representing nobody. That, to my mind, finishes with this Bill altogether.  The idea of the presiding officer of a legislative assembly representing nobody is, to my mind, a parody on constitutional principles.  I have an amendment down which we are to discuss, and which removes at all events the personal element, because I should be very sorry to be suspected of taking any personal view in this matter.  I would be very sorry indeed to say anything unkind or impolite about the distinguished gentleman who presides over the destinies of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> What I propose is that he should be re-elected for his former constituency. That would make his position in the next Parliament perfectly safe.  Senator O'Farrell has a similar purpose in view in the amendment which follows, and to that extent I accept it and welcome it.</P>
    <P>The main underlying principle of Senator O'Farrell's amendment and of mine is the same.  It removes the utterly impossible situation of an unelected member being a member of an elective and representative assembly I think that when one considers the matter deeply one becomes more impressed of the desirability of the legislature being elected.  We have been talking all our lives about democratic institutions, constitutions and legislalive assemblies.  This Bill is the first real attempt to go behind the principles that we have always professed.  We are going to have in the new Dáil a Speaker who represents nobody.  I hold that you cannot confine this election to the Speaker.  You must treat your Deputy-Speaker in the Dáil in exactly the same way.  Then, if you do so much in the Dáil, you must come to the Seanad and you must re-elect your Chairman and your Vice-Chairman of the Seanad automatically.  Once you start infringing on the principle of representation you do not know where you may be landed.  It might very well happen that when the system had been in operation for a few years, with the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the Dáil and the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of the Seanad elected automatically, that the President might consider that he was entitled to be re-elected automatically, and I do not see how, on logical grounds, you could prevent it.  I think it would be very much better to leave this matter alone and not interfere, as this Bill does, with established principles in this country.  I certainly support the Senator in all his amendments.  They do not quite treat the matter as I would like it to be treated, but they carry out to a certain extent the views that I maintain.</P>

      <P>I agree with a great deal of what the last speaker has <Col N="228" /> said.  The Minister's speech was very ingenious, but I think he seems to have omitted to remember that the very thing that he suggests might apply to the present case in this Bill.  The Speaker's constituency might have been abolished.  Then what constituency does he represent?  He certainly cannot be deemed to represent a constituency which has been abolished.</P>

      <P>The report of the Committee that dealt with this matter states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A majority of the Committee considers that it is desirable that the Chairman of Dáil Eireann should keep himself clear of party affiliations during his term of office; that the difficulty in these circumstances of his securing election in any constituency to the subsequent Dáil will tend to be great; and it is, therefore, of opinion that amendment of the Constitution in this respect is desirable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there was a proposed alternative. As I understand it, the Chairman is chosen by a majority of the Dáil and acts in that capacity throughout the year or throughout the term of his Chairmanship in a way that commends itself to the Dáil or does not.  At the next general election the fact that he was Chairman would rather, I think, enhance his chance of being returned. He certainly has had an honour conferred upon him, and the electors of the constituency he represents would appreciate it in that way.  There is no use in saying that the man who occupies the Chair is perfectly colourless in the matter of politics from any political opinion.  He is not.  He is a human <Col N="229" /> being, and he has his own views.  He tries as far as he can to divest himself of any partiality just as a judge would on the Bench, but at the same time he holds his views and acts accordingly. I am entirely in agreement with Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde and other speakers in the views they expressed that every member either in this House or the other should represent some constituency, and I am, also, of the view that the matter should be left there and that the Speaker as well as every other member of the Dáil should come forward for election and not disturb the principle that underlies our present electoral system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>The last three Senators who have spoken have dealt with a matter which I hardly think is before the House&mdash;that is, the rejection of the Bill.  I have been sitting here trying to make up my mind after listening to Senator O'Farrell as to which was the wiser course, the Bill as it stands or the Bill with Senator O'Farrell's amendment.  The last three Senators who have spoken have practically said &ldquo;A plague on both your Houses; we do not want the Bill and we do not want the amendment.&rdquo; They are advising the House to throw out the Bill.  I could make nothing else out of what Senator Esmonde said and Senator Colonel Moore and Senator Kenny said the same.  I think as far as I listened to the debate that the general opinion of Senators is that the object of the Bill and of the amendment is entirely a good one.  Both Senator O'Farrell and the Minister admitted that they were doing a certain amount of what you might call evil, but for a good purpose, and as an ordinary individual looking at it I really think that the good to be obtained in making the Speaker of the Dáil absolutely independent is so great and that the evil under the Bill or under Senator O'Farrell's amendment is so small that I do not think the House should hesitate to adopt one or other of those evils.  To reject the Bill seems to me to be a course that none of us could possibly think wise, because I think we all agree that to secure the absolute independence of the Speaker is an object worthy of <Col N="230" /> every consideration and that we should not interfere with it in any way. Senator O'Farrell does not at all attempt by his amendment to wreck the object of the Bill.  There is no such intention on his part.  We see in the Parliament on the other side of the water the same difficulty and the way they dealt with it was by agreement amongst the leaders of the different parties disfranchising one constituency more or less.  I believe the Bill as we have it here does a great deal less than if we followed the British practice. There is one thing in which I differ with Senator O'Farrell.  I think if there is any evil in either course his amendment is going to do more harm in the way of democratic representation if adopted than the Bill will do as it stands.  I think I interpret the feelings of the House when I say that we are not in any way disposed to vote against the Bill.  I think the issue is whether the amendment or the Bill is the best way to secure the absolute independence of the Speaker.  That it ought to be done one way or the other is a matter upon which I believe we will all agree.  Personally, and for the reasons I have stated, I think I would prefer the Bill as it stands to the Bill with the Senator's amendments.</P>

I am not enamoured of the Bill nor of the amendment, and I merely recommend the amendment as preferable to the Bill as it stands.  I was surprised to hear Senator Kenny denouncing the whole of the Bill, seeing that he voted in favour of the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>The Senator's name is in the official record as voting in favour of the Second Reading of the Bill.  The arguments advanced against the amendment are not, I think, particularly impressive or crushing.  What the amendment merely suggests is that what has been the arrangement and what has been acted upon as a desirable arrangement for some years past <Col N="231" /> in Great Britain by agreement between the parties shall here be made a statutory arrangement in view of the impossibility of making it voluntary.  Senator Jameson talked of disfranchising a constituency.  That is the case in Great Britain where you have single member constituencies.  You do not in this amendment disfranchise a constituency, because at best or at worst there will be other people in the Dáil representing the constituency.  If a constituency has one of its members selected to be Ceann Comhairle, I think that will be an honour conferred upon the constituency as well as upon the individual, and it is not too much to ask them to have him as one of their accredited representatives while he is in that position, and to elect accordingly one less than the total number that they would elect in the ordinary way.  Even if there does occur the position that the member in question is not re-elected as Chairman of the House, he has a roving commission, as the Minister says.  He is knocking round to see into what constituency he can stick his nose.  There is no place for him.  He is in a most unenviable position, because he can only get re-elected in the future by ousting one of his colleagues.  If he tries to take an interest, in a particular constituency everyone will see the reason is obvious, and that he is trying to provide for his future, and he is trying to get a seat that he has not got now.  His position will be infinitely more independent under the amendment than under the Bill.  If he is not re-elected, which is a contingency which we have to provide for, then under the amendment his place will be one of the duly elected representatives of the people, he can then without any accusation of ulterior motive function for his constituency in the actual ordinary way.  Senator Douglas seems to argue that there would not be a saving of £360 a year at all times under this.  But there is not under the Bill.  Under the Bill there must be one additional member&mdash;154 instead of 153&mdash;and inasmuch as that is the case whether the Ceann Comhairle is re-elected to the Chair or not there must be an additional member in the House under the Bill, unless the <Col N="232" /> Speaker resigns, of course, altogether or is disqualified.</P>
      <P>The Minister really made only one point, and that certainly a very feeble one.  His argument was the amendment assumes that the Speaker shall be deemed to represent the constituency that last elected him to the Dáil, but that under a revision of constituencies or re-organisation his constituency might disappear altogether.  But surely in order that that should occur legislation would have to be introduced.  Would it not be very stupid legislation that would not be able to deal with a position of that kind?  The Bill need only say that the present Speaker shall be deemed to represent whatever constituency the greater part of his previous constituency went into.  That arrangement could be made by legislation when the matter arose, just as we deal with many other unforeseen matters as they arise.  This would be a matter of a Bill, and it is not beyond the bounds of genius to deal with it.  I think on the whole that my amendment is a far more preferable arrangement than that suggested in the Bill.  One other point, the Bill only received a final reading in the other House by a comparatively small majority.  I believe my amendment, if adopted, would secure for the measure a far greater amount of general support than has been given to it so far, and I am sure the Speaker himself would like, if possible, that the Bill should be almost unanimously approved in the House of which he is a member in order that he might avail of it.  If this amendment is inserted the Bill will get greater support in the Dáil than it got originally, because the amendment will be a great argument in favour of it.</P>

      <P>On this motion I would like to deal with the point raised by Senator O'Farrell with regard to complications arising out of Article 26. The Senator made light of my argument based on the difficulties that will arise or that may arise under Article 26 in the event of the constituency for which the Speaker was elected being altered by the revision.  That is made mandatory under the Article.  He says that you can deal with that in the revision Bill.  But you are embodying now in the Constitution a provision for the re-election of the Speaker.  You are saying that he is to be deemed to be elected to his former constituency.  That is embodied in the Constitution.  The Constitution for eight years from the date of its passing may be amended by ordinary legislation.  Thereafter it will be much more difficult, and if after eight years a constituency represented by a particular Speaker is, during the lifetime of that Parliament altered, then to what constituency is the Speaker deemed to be elected under Senator O'Farrell's amendment?  That is my point, and the Senator has not met it. I suggest that the Senate would do well to give it a little more consideration than they have given to it.</P>

The Bill would say that according to Article so and so of the Constitution, the constituency for which the Speaker is deemed to have been elected on the last occasion shall be so and so.  If his present constituency is amalgamated with Trinity College it will be called another name, and it will be quite easy to say so in the Bill, that it shall be for the constituency with which his present constituency is combined that he would be deemed to have been elected.

      <P>The opinion of a very eminent constitutional lawyer and my own opinion is that when this Bill passes the Constitution is there and then amended, but the amendment does not come into operation until the event fixed later on occurs.  I cannot for the life of me see why six years are put in at all unless it is intended to suspend the Constitution from the date on which the Bill passes, because if that is not intended those words are absolutely unnecessary, and a simple statement that the Constitution shall be amended as from the date of the coming into operation of this Bill would settle the whole thing.  Why this amendment is rejected I do not know.  It rather suggests to me that there may be some desire to secure the suspension of the Constitution at the date of the passing of the Bill.  I do not know.  However, we had better let it stand until the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To reinsert in the section, sub-section <Col N="239" /> (5), which sub-section was deleted in Committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This proposal follows from an amendment which Senator Linehan induced the Seanad, and quite justifiably, to pass the other day.  Since then we have all considered this matter.  We have had the advantage of a very full exposition of the situation from the Minister for Local Government, and the conclusion I, and probably many other members of the Seanad, have come to is that in agreeing to Senator Linehan's proposal we made a mistake. Probably Senator Linehan himself will agree now that his proposal would not carry out what he wanted.  The sub-sections that I move to reinstate propose to alter the mechanical process by which the agricultural grant is now directed to its proper purposes.  The original proposal in the Bill was for the purpose of improving and amending the technical process by which this was done.  There was no intention, I am quite certain, to make a change in the destination of the grant.  All these matters of local rating are complicated, and if I went into them in detail a too voluminous explanation would be required. But I would like to give the Seanad a very short sketch as to how the thing is arrived at.  The process that has been in operation in county councils heretofore, and which is not really interfered with in principle by this Bill, is as follows: The secretary and the chairman of the county council come together, make up their budget and decide upon the probable expenditure of the county.  The next step is to apportion that expenditure on the valuation of the county between the land that is available for the agricultural grant and the other hereditaments. Then the full amount of the grant or grants for the county is deducted from the expenditure.</P>
    <P>What is left us then is the net charge on agricultural land.  When the rate in the pound is worked out each farmer knows the amount he pays on his land. There are rates on agricultural land and on other hereditaments.  As the section originally stood only one rate would be made on all hereditaments and every occupier of agricultural land would receive his full abatement in <Col N="240" /> respect of the agricultural grant.  The change proposed in the section is really one of procedure.  It does not affect the incidence or the amount of the agricultural grant, or the revision of the various agricultural holdings in the smallest degree whatever.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) of the section now stands because Senator Linehan's second amendment was defeated with the sub-section provided for the raising of one rate on all hereditaments, lands or otherwise.  Then we deleted the following sub-sections which secured the relief to holders of agricultural land, and we have succeeded in defeating our own purpose.  What is wanted is to secure to the agricultural holders their right to the full amount of their agricultural grants.  The effect of sub-section (4) with sub-sections (5) and (6) would be that in future the grant would be treated as any other receipt of the county and its benefits would be spread over all the hereditaments included&mdash;that is, which are not agricultural land; so that in our endeavour to secure the agricultural grant to agricultural land, we have succeeded in doing exactly the opposite.  Sub-sections (4), (5) and (6) are the only parts of the section that make any change in existing law and the amount of that change is merely this: Senator Linehan told us his object was quite different from what we have succeeded in accomplishing.  In his view the amount of the agricultural grant allotted to each union in 1898 in relieving expenditure should be for ever stereotyped.  Since the original Local Government Act several others have been passed.  We passed two in this House and we rearranged our whole structure of local administration. We cannot go back to the arrangements made to carry out the original Act.</P>
    <P>Members of the Seanad who are interested in local administration read that interesting proposal submitted to us some months ago, by the Minister for Local Government in relation to the apportionment of the rates and I think, possibly, that if that arrangement had been borne in mind we would never have agreed to make the change Senator Linehan proposed the other day.  This new arrangement, <Col N="241" /> approved of in this Bill, was the result of collaboration between officials of the Local Government Ministry and the secretaries of the various county councils.  They hit upon this scheme of making a new system which would ensure that the agricultural grant, to its last penny, was devoted to the purpose for which it was intended, and which would make for a considerable diminution in book-keeping and the cost of administration of local affairs. Senators are probably aware how the thing is worked out.  Every holding in a county, with its description, valuation and the name of the occupier, is entered in a book called the rate book. The amount payable out of each holding is calculated by the officers of the county council and entered in their book in another column and the result of these deliberations in book-keeping are copied out in the demand notes. You can quite imagine that this process takes a good deal of time and costs a considerable amount of money because every single entry that is made, the result of which appears in the demand note, has to be checked and certified so that there shall be no mistake about it. The object of the change, which is approved of in this case, is to reduce the number of calculations.  There are separate applotments on each holding and each of these applotments is made on a different valuation.  First there is a general rate on the valuation of the other hereditaments.  Then you have the general rate on agricultural land and further rates for separate charges; all these things are very intricate.  Under the proposed method the rates are made on the total valuation of the holding and can be added together.  Then you calculate the abatement for the agricultural grant and the result of that is that you have exactly the amount a man has to pay.</P>
    <P>The maximum number of separate calculations under the new programme will only be two.  That makes a tremendous difference, and in the new rate books prepared for that purpose according to Section 6 there will be only 19 columns, whereas in the old days there used to be 29.  That reduction of ten columns means a considerable improvement and also a saving in expenses. Under the new system you can <Col N="242" /> show a single rate for each holding, and, as you get experience as to how this system works, you may be able to reduce very much the cost of collection of rates and the cost of book-keeping to the county councils.  I would remind the Seanad that these new proposals which Senator Linehan succeeded in knocking on the head are the result of consultations between the Local Government Ministry and the representative officials of the county councils throughout the country. There is no doubt that they would help in the administration of local affairs and would reduce expenditure, and to that extent they would be a considerable boon to ratepayers. We are all anxious to reduce the cost of local administration, and this is a very good opportunity of doing so in a very appreciable degree.  It is not as if we were slurring things over and making things easy for bad accountancy. We are, as a matter of fact, assisting efficiency.  There is no reason why you should have all those small items printed over and over again in the rate books, thus making it difficult for the ratepayers to understand. After all, the Local Government Auditor is your sheet anchor in this respect and he will see that these accounts are properly kept.  I therefore move the reinstatement of sub-section (5) in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the majority of the Seanad when they voted for Senator Linehan's amendment the other day did not quite understand the effect of what they were doing.  The matter is complicated, but it is not nearly so complicated as it sounds.  Before the Local Government Act of 1923 there were three different kinds of rating authorities in each county.  There was the county council, the rural district council and the union, each of which had to deal with charges which were charges on its own area. The county council dealt with charges on the county at large.  The rural district council dealt with purely rural district charges, and the union with purely union charges.  The agricultural grant, which was made for the relief of agricultural land, gave relief in each of these areas under a system which <Col N="243" /> worked all right so long as these areas were separate.  Sometimes it worked curiously, but it is not necessary to go into that now.  By the Act of 1923 the union was abolished, and the charges which had formerly been union charges became county charges.</P>
      <P>Under the Act of 1925 the rural district councils were abolished and the charges which were formerly raised and expended by rural councils were made county charges.  Therefore, since the Act of 1923 all these charges have become county charges.  All the expenditure is done by the county council, and it is only right and equitable that the relief given by the agricultural grant should be spread over the whole area now charged with these services. That is what is being done under this Bill.  It is perfectly equitable.  The charges are all county charges, and relief is given to everybody according to rating, and it is only right that persons should get relief from the agricultural grant in the same way as they have to pay for expenditure.  This is more than equitable; it is economic. Often things which are equitable are not economic.  This is economic.  All that it does is to provide that the present method of applotting rates and working out of relief on agricultural land shall cease to operate, and that this new system, which will mean a saving of something like £30,000 a year to the country, shall operate.  I would seriously ask the Seanad not to adhere to the opinion expressed the other day that Senator Linehan's amendment was a proper one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to emphasise the fact that the decision of the Seanad to delete this sub-section on the last day was come to on arguments put forward by me, and I contend that they have been fully borne out.  My contention was, and it is not denied, that a serious change was made in the agricultural grant allotted to each rural district by making the grant a county-at-large grant.  The Minister admits that when he says, in effect, that the changes that have taken place recently in local government legislation have given to districts which have been deprived of portion of their agricultural <Col N="244" /> grant other benefits which equalised the position.  I think that fairly meets the point at issue here.  Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde stated that there was no change in the distribution or in the amount of the grant.  I do not think that the ratepayers who find their agricultural grant reduced will agree with that statement.</P>
      <P>It is also contended that the saving that will be effected in the making out of the rates will be sufficient compensation for the ratepayers whose grant has been reduced.  The Minister has estimated the amount of the saving at £30,000.  I should like to know how that was made up.  In my opinion, the agricultural grant should not be touched.  When those other changes were being made in the Local Government Act of 1925 was the time to come forward with any proposal to alter the incidence of the agricultural grant. That was not done.  Instead of that the Minister has made an Order, which I am informed has the force of law, distributing the agricultural grant in the same manner as he proposes to do by these two sections that it is now proposed to reinsert in the Bill.  If the Minister has already power to do what he wants in that regard, what is the necessity of bringing forward these two sections?  In my opinion, he wants to get the approval of the Seanad to his action in dealing as he has with the agricultural grant during the past two years.</P>
      <P>As I said on the last occasion, the agricultural grant and the rates in force in the standard year have formed the basis of the judicial rents that were subsequently fixed.  I will read the section which bears out my contention&mdash; Section 55 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A fair rent in a rural district shall be fixed under the Land Law (Ireland) Acts on the assumption that there has been no decrease or increase of the rate in the pound of poor rate as compared with the total rate in the pound to which the standard rates for poor rate and county cess as certified under this Act, when added together, amount, and that the tenant is to have any benefit from the agricultural grant given in repect <Col N="245" /> of the county cess, and that the landlord is to have any benefit from the agricultural grant given in respect of the poor rate; and where after the appointed day any such fair rent is fixed there shall be recorded in the Schedule specified in Section 1 of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1896, the standard amount as defined in the preceding section both for poor rate and county cess, and the benefit in respect of the holding received by the landlord and tenant respectively out of the agricultural grant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a note by Vanston, the author of this book, to that section which says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This section is intended to permanently secure the benefit of the agricultural grant to the landlord as regards poor rate, and to the tenant as regards county cess.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Brown alluded to the fact that union charges are now county-at-large charges.  That is so, but he referred to the rural district charges being also county-at-large charges.  That is only so to a very small extent.  The water schemes, sewage schemes, labourers' cottage charges, and the lighting of villages and towns are still borne by the different rural districts. The main roads were always county-at-large charges, as were the cost of the asylums and contributions to hospitals. The only change recently made was with regard to county roads and to the general public health charges which would, generally speaking, be the salaries of the sanitary officers in the different districts.  In the statement sent to Senators by the Minister he has made a comparison in connection with one of the districts I referred to that has had a considerable reduction made in its agricultural grant.  He has compared the rate levied by the guardians in 1914 and the rate levied last year for the expenditure of the board of health.  I do not know whether last year was the year in which the different county councils borrowed a very large sum of money and thereby were enabled to strike a very low rate.  Assuming it was not so, there is shown here a reduction in the rate for the <Col N="246" /> Castletown district from 3/9¾ to 2/7. When they were paying 3/9¾ in that district they had a workhouse and a hospital in the district.  Now they have neither of these, and the nearest county home is sixty miles away.  If the rates are reduced, so also are the services furnished there.  In the later portion of the statement the Minister says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would be better to postpone the benefits of the Bill for a year than to introduce a change in the method of apportionment of such rate as has been proposed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is a very good suggestion &mdash;that the Bill should be postponed for a year, because we really have not had time to go into the different figures in this very elaborate document.  The document was only supplied to us a few days ago and we want to check the figures given.</P>
    <P>No additional arguments have been put forward to induce the Seanad to stultify themselves and change the opinion expressed on the previous occasion.  The Minister has done by an Order what he is asking the Seanad now to sanction, and I think the Seanad will be wise in keeping themselves free from any approval of this section which seeks to reduce the agricultural grant, which was so solemnly fixed as portion of the relief to agricultural land in the year 1898. I hold that the agricultural grant is attached to the land and the amount was fixed in that year.  There was no need for fresh calculations.  It was the same amount year after year until the Minister made the alteration.  For that reason I hope the Seanad will maintain the position they have already taken up.  The Minister's Order is still in force and in the meantime we will have time to consider and examine the figures and the statements he has now put before us and those of the proposer of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question arising out of what Senator Linehan has stated. I understand that there is no alteration in the amount of the agricultural grant in a particular county and that what is proposed is merely that there is to be a possible, but not inevitable, <Col N="247" /> redistribution of this grant.  From what Senator Linehan has just stated one would rather gather that there was a possible reduction in the grant to the county at large.  I should like the Minister to answer that.</P>

      <P>On the original amendment on which I voted I think I was rather mistaken in my reading of the particular section.  I had a grave fear from the wording of the section as originally drafted, that there was a danger that the complete allocation was to be spread over the county at large irrespective of whether the rateable premises was agricultural land or other hereditaments.  That, to my mind, has been made perfectly clear by the paper which has been circulated, from every point of view.  I think, on the whole, the proposed method of dealing with the allocation whereby a great deal of applotment work is avoided is the better.  I think after mature deliberation that is an advantage and I do not think, on the whole, that the loss to any particular district from a variation of the system, whereby it was allocated two years ago, is serious enough to continue one in opposition to the clause as it originally stood in the Bill.  On these grounds I think it will be my duty to vote in favour of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is anything further that I can add on this matter.  I dealt with it fairly fully on the last day, and in a brief way before <Col N="248" /> that.  I might say that before this amendment was moved in the Seanad I, and some of my officials also, did our best to convert Senator Linehan to my way of thinking without success. From the course the debate has taken I realise that he is obdurate on the point, but I do not think that any other Senator is under the same misapprehension at present.  I think it is quite obvious once you make district charges county-at-large charges you must also equalise the agricultural grant for the whole county.  That is the sole point at issue.  Senator Linehan persists in looking at this from one angle&mdash;from the point of view of the agricultural grant&mdash;without looking at it from the point of view of the rate which is equalised all over the whole county. During the debate he reiterated the argument which he used here on the last occasion, and which I rebutted, namely, that all rural district charges have not been made county-at-large charges.  That is not the case.  With the exception of charges for labourers' cottages, all the rural district charges are county-at-large charges.  There is absolutely no justification for continuing to allocate the agricultural grant on a district basis.</P>

If that is the case, what is the necessity for further statutory enactments through these two sections?  What is the necessity for these two sub-sections? There is another point on which I would like to hear the Minister.  In his memorandum the Minister says the passing of these sections will involve a saving of £30,000 to the ratepayers.

Whether the amount is sufficient to meet that purpose is a question.  You find at the end of the year a deficiency has arisen. Might it be that in the apportionment of the agricultural grant of the next year a deduction is first made for this deficiency and then the balance is allocated to the agricultural rate? That is quite feasible.  You cannot make good a deficiency until it arises, and you will not know whether it will arise until the year has run its course.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Section 11.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;(9) Sub-section (3) of Section 69 of the Principal Act shall be amended by the deletion of the words &ldquo;the Housing of the Working-Classes (Ireland) Acts, 1883-1919&rdquo; and the sub-section as so amended shall apply as from the passing of this Act to any house erected under the aforesaid Acts.</P>
      <P>There is no necessity for me to weary the House with a repetition of the statement I made with regard to this amendment on last Wednesday.  On that occasion I think the House were practically unanimously of the opinion that the amendment I moved was eminently reasonable and ought to be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the proposed amendment is that for every house provided by a local authority under the Housing Acts since the 1st April, 1920, and before the 31st March next, there will be a remission of two-thirds of the rates for the next six years.  This question of rates relief on houses provided by local authorities is somewhat involved. An elucidation of the matter involves the citation of several figures as to costs and rents.  If any Senator considers he could not conveniently follow the details without noting such particulars I would be prepared, with the Chairman's permission, to place in <Col N="252" /> his hands a copy of the statement which I have prepared.</P>
      <P>In moving his amendment, Senator Farren was under the impression that Section 69 of the Local Government Act, 1925, imposed a hardship on the class occuping the local authorities' houses.  He stated that what he sought to achieve was &ldquo;that there shall be the same equity and justice to a similar class of people under similar circumstances.&rdquo; On a full consideration of the facts it will be abundantly clear that there has been no violation of this excellent principle.</P>
      <P>Since 1920 strenuous efforts have been made both by the local authorities and by the Government to deal with the grave situation which had arisen from the shortage of dwellings and the rise in building costs.  In present circumstances it is impossible to provide houses without serious loss to the public.  Working men cannot pay the high rents or the sale prices, as the case may be, which would be necessitated were such to cover the total cost of the houses.  Notwithstanding this position everyone realises that houses must be built, and much progress has been made during the past few years. The loss resulting from this activity has been very extensive, and has been met by the community generally by means of State subsidy or contributions by local authorities or by both together.</P>
      <P>The resources of local authorities have been so heavily burthened that care must be given to the possibility that if the strain be made too great further housing activities may be retarded or terminated.  An essential factor in the preliminary calculations of a local authority of the cost of a housing scheme is the amount of rates to be expected from the houses.  It cannot be disregarded, as it has a direct bearing on the rent or the purchase price, as the case may be.  The amendment proposes to make nugatory the prudent calculations made before these recent housing schemes were put into operation, and it imposes on the local authorities a new burden, in addition to the heavy charge which they have already assumed for the sake of housing their poorer constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 69 of the Act of 1925 has <Col N="253" /> for its object the encouragement of builders and the provision of the employment which is so greatly needed. This amendment is no encouragement to local authorities to build since it penalises those authorities who have built and makes it more difficult for them to continue their work.  Need I add that since the Act of 1925 became law no local authority has represented to me that the change Senator Farren advocates should be effected?  In specifically excluding houses provided by local authorities under the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Acts from the operation of Section 69 of the Local Government Act, 1925, I have felt bound to take into consideration the fact that such houses were being disposed of by letting or by sale at prices considerably below the economic rents or the market value, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>For five-roomed houses provided in Dublin City by private persons or public utility societies under the Housing Acts grants amounting to £200 per house were obtained by the builder. (£100 from State and a like amount from Borough Commissioners).  In addition the houses benefit by the remission of rates provided for under the Acts.  For the past twelve months the Borough Commissioners' scheme has been altered.  The Commissioners have been constrained to offer to prospective builders either the remission of rates or the grant, but not both.</P>
    <P>Senator Farren endeavoured to point to a distinction in favour of the person who built or purchased a new house through the medium of a public utility society and a relative disadvantage to a person who purchased one of the houses provided by, say, the Dublin Corporation at Marino.  He made the proposition that while the first category got grants of £200 and rates remission, persons under the Corporation schemes did not get rates remission. It is evident that the Senator is under misapprehension of the facts as to the finances of the Corporation's Marino scheme.  The houses built and at present being built at Marino and at Croydon Park are costing approximately £700 per house on an average, and are being sold at an average price <Col N="254" /> of £420 per house, so that the purchaser gets in effect a bounty of £280.</P>
    <P>As the Senator has explained, the motive of his amendment is to give to the occupiers of local authorities' houses a rates remission similar to that provided for private persons and public utility societies under the Housing (Building Facilities) Act, 1924, and the Housing Acts, 1925-1926.  This would give to the occupiers of the Marino houses who, as already explained, have had the advantage of what is the equivalent of £280, the added advantage of the remission of rates.  The capitalised advantage of such further benefit would, when calculated on present Dublin rates, amount to £63 10s.  From this it follows that the tenant purchaser of a Marino house would get £80 more than the total assistance provided for under the Housing Acts for private persons and public utility societies.  At present the Marino tenant gets £17 10s. more, namely £280, as against £200 plus £63 10s.  Furthermore, the majority of houses being built in Dublin under the Housing Acts by parties other than the Corporation are being built by speculative builders, and in the sale of the house the State subsidy is divided between the builder and the purchasing occupier.</P>
    <P>In the case of Marino the tenant-purchaser gets the full advantage of the £280 bounty.  In the few cases where occupiers of grant houses have got the full advantage of the £200 subsidy and remission of rates by building the houses themselves, either as private persons or through the medium of small public utility societies, they have had to invest some capital in the undertaking and very often to borrow money at high rates of interest, and for short periods of repayment, so that in such cases the houses are a heavy annual charge on their incomes.  The cost of the houses being built on a site at Marino by a public utility society referred to by the Senator is not less than £900.  On the other hand, the Marino tenant purchasers had no personal capital outlay in respect of the provision or subsequent purchase of the houses, and have been given a period of 40 years in which to pay the agreed purchase money.  In the case of the St. <Col N="255" /> Barnabas Public Utility Society the Senator suggested that the tenants were better treated than were the Marino tenant-purchasers.  In this he is mistaken, though I do not suggest that they are not well treated.  The tenants of the St. Barnabas Public Utility Society pay an inclusive weekly rent of 15/- for a four-roomed house. While they continue to pay this rent they do not acquire other than an occupation interest.  The tenant-purchasers at Marino pay between 15/- and 17/- weekly (inclusive) for their houses (which are five-roomed), and every week they acquire an additional saleable interest to be perfected in ownership after 40 years.</P>
    <P>The houses built on other housing areas by the Dublin Corporation or Dublin Borough Commissioners have been sold to the occupiers at smaller prices than those referred to above, although in some instances they have cost more.  In other urban areas in the Saorstát houses provided under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts have been sold at prices as low as 52½ per cent. of the cost, giving a financial advantage to the purchaser considerably greater than the benefits of the Housing Acts to ordinary private persons or public utility societies.  The proceeds are, of course, in all cases applied to the building of further houses.</P>
    <P>The amendment would also apply to houses built and let (not sold) under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts during the period.  Where such houses have been let the rents average 8/6 per week for five-roomed houses which cost approximately £700.  This weekly rent yields annually £22 2s. 0d. From this sum is expended annually on Insurance (1/6 per cent. on £500), 7/6; Maintenance (say), £3; Collection costs (5 per cent.), £1 2s. 0d.; total, £4 9s. 6d. leaving an annual sum of £17 12s. 6d. towards funding the capital expenditure of £700.  If the house had been built out of money borrowed for the purpose by the local authority for, say, 50 years at 5 per cent. interest, the following would be the annual outgoings of the local authority in respect of the house:&mdash;Annuity to redeem loan <Col N="256" /> of £700 in 50 years at 5 per cent., £38 6s. 6d.; Insurance, 7s. 6d.; Maintenance, £3; Collection costs (5 per cent.), £2 2s.; total annual outgoings, £43 16s. 0d., which, to be met in full by the tenant, would require a weekly rent (exclusive of rates) of about 17/-, or twice the rent at present charged.  The loss on these houses has to fall on the ratepayer or, to the extent of the State grant, on the general body of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>This shows what I stated earlier that the housing of the working classes is an uneconomic proposition, and, whether the deficit on a scheme is met by the local authority or by the State, the money is coming out of the pocket of the man in the street.  The Senator's amendment, if accepted, would only result in placing an additional and unsupportable burden on the community. In Dublin alone the intended amendment would mean a loss to the Borough Commissioners of an additional sum of some £127,000 (present value) while by the inclusion of the other local authorities this figure would be very greatly enlarged.</P>
    <P>Contracts to which members of the local authorities have given anxious deliberation should not be varied without substantial and meritorious reasons. Under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts the sale of any house provided requires the Minister's consent. In the existing cases which are affected by this amendment I have already expressed my approval, after full consideration of the bargains proposed, to the terms of purchase submitted to me by the contracting parties, and now the effect of the Senator's amendment will be to vary these terms in the absence of any signification of assent by one of the parties, namely, the vendors.  I do not think, when this is realised by Senators, that they will be disposed to pass legislation which will disappoint those who have given much thought to the housing question, and which will, in effect, defeat the hopes as to the provision of houses which Senator Farren and all of us share.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement made by the Minister would be much more important if he had told us how he arrived at his figures.  We would like <Col N="257" /> to get some authority for the figures he quoted.  He told us in regard to these houses at Marino which I seek to bring in under my amendment that they cost £700 each to erect.  I have figures here in connection with their erection which I propose to quote for the information of Senators, and I suggest they will show that the position taken up by the Minister on this matter is really a hopeless one.  Of course, I have often heard it said that a clever person dealing with figures could make them explain anything.  Certainly we have had a demonstration of that today from the Minister in the way he dealt with figures relating to the erection of these houses, telling us that they cost £700 each to build.  I am now going to put before the Seanad the contractors' estimates for these houses.  These estimates prove quite clearly that the average cost of the erection of the houses ran from £509 to £620 at the very outside.  The Minister tells us that they cost £700.  If that is so, there are a few hundred pounds missing somewhere.  Therefore let us try and discover the missing sums.  I have before me the contract figures of Messrs. Crampton for the erection of 220 houses in the Croydon Park area.  The contract figure is £119,996 15s. 6d., and this gives you an average of £545 per house. Another contract for 96 houses worked out at £570 per house.  The first contract given to the German firm, Messrs. Kossel, for the erection of houses worked out at £524 per house, and the second contract at £533 per house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the average price per house and includes the erection of the entire structure, drains, boundary walls, preparation of site, etc., but not the purchase of the site, because the tenant has to pay £3 per year ground rent.  Because of that he has not to pay for the purchase of the site, and, of course, rightly so.  If he had to pay for the purchase of the site then naturally he should have the place as a freehold.  You could not expect a man to pay ground rent and purchase the site as well.  I do not think many farmers would do that.  I have before me an actual agreement <Col N="258" /> with regard to the purchase of one of these houses.  The agreement provides that the cash price of the house is £460.  That is the selling price by the Corporation to the tenant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they do.  A house is built at £530 and is sold to the tenant at £460.  I want to know where that tenant is getting the benefit of the £280 subsidy that the Minister has been talking about.  The man who signed the agreement to purchase this house for £450 to which I am referring, is buying it out by paying an annuity of £24 12s. 4d., this being the amount of the principal and compound interest at the rate of 5¼ per cent.  In addition, he has to pay rates on the full valuation as well as £1 a year for the collection of the rent, £3 ground rent, and £4 9s. 0d. for the preparation of the lease.  If the Minister's figures are right then there is something wrong somewhere, or otherwise I am wrong. I, however, have given to the House the actual cost of erection of these houses. I have quoted the contractors' price, and I want to say that on the strength of the figures I have given, these tenants, leaving out the question of the remission of rates, are not getting the advantages that other people are getting from the Government subsidy of £200.  That is the case that I want to make, and I submit to the House that we ought to deal out equity and justice all round.  I am pleading the case of the poorest class in the community.  I am dealing with their case not with a view to saving them a shilling or two shillings in the week.  I said last week that I was bringing this matter forward in the interests of all concerned, and I say that it is a physical impossibility for the ordinary working man on the present rates of wages to pay 17s. 8d. a week.  He may have a family of six or seven, some of his children being eight or nine years of age.  He has to feed and clothe them, and in addition to pay a rent of 17s. 8d. a week.  Unless the Seanad does something to help <Col N="259" /> these people, then the result will be that this beautiful area will be turned into a slum again.  As it is, they are being compelled to let rooms and to turn these little houses into tenements in order that they may be able to pay this rent of 17s. 8d. a week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>The valuations vary. Some are £11 and more £12.  I have particulars here of a second type of house that is being sold to the tenants at £440.  The payment of principal and compound interest at 5¼ per cent. on that sum means that the purchasing tenant has to pay 10/11 per week.  In addition, the tenant has to pay 6/2 for rates, ground rent and collection charges.  The whole thing works out like this, that the tenant who has purchased the house for £440 has to pay a rent of 17/1 per week.  As I said before, I want fair play all round.  There is no use in the Minister getting up and saying that you are going to retard house building if you give so much to the tenants of these particular houses. If the House decides to give what I am asking in my amendment it will not cost a fraction of what the remission of rates on newly-erected houses is costing the State at present.  I think that we should give help to the people I am pleading for&mdash;the people who need help most.  It is only when we get down to helping the poorest class of the community that we hear a lot of talk about finance and the last straw.  This cry did not go up when the Government introduced a section into the Act of 1925 giving a substantial remission of rates to anyone who erected a new building. It is only when we try to give a little help to those who really need it that this cry about finance and the last straw goes up.  I hope I have convinced the House of the justice of the claim that I am making on behalf of these people.  I can stand over the figures that I have quoted and, with regard to those figures, I may say that I went to the fountain-head myself to get them and I defy contradiction of them.  The Minister told us that they get the benefit of £280.  I ask him to show where this comes in.  The house is sold at <Col N="260" /> £460 to the tenant, and we are told that it cost £700 to build.  Where did he get the £280?  I have given the figures, which are from £509 to £620.  As a matter of fact, I know about the biggest figures, because I was a member of the Housing Committee at the time that the large contract for building was given out at the dearest period. The cost has been coming down since then and numbers of houses have been built at a much lesser figure.  For these reasons I say that the Minister has made no case.  His statement about £200 subsidy is a fallacy.  They did not get it, and on the figures that I quoted they could not possibly have got it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may be able to clear up the difference.  We have been treated here to one of the cleverest debating exhibitions that I witnessed for a considerable time.  Senator Farren is an old member of the Corporation, and he went to the Corporation, the fountain head, for the figures.  He got certain figures, and he now uses these to prove that the figures I gave are not correct.  Knowing something of the working of the Dublin Corporation, I have been to the fountain head also, and I have got an exact copy of the statement sent to Senator Farren.  The Senator's figures are correct as far as they go, but the Senator did not give the full statement.  There is the little addendum at the bottom of the note which he got with these figures, which makes all the difference in the world. The addendum says: &ldquo;To the above figures must be added the cost of the acquisition of site, development, electric wiring, etc., so that the all-in cost for each house would average about £700.&rdquo; That is the figure I gave.  That is the figure Senator Farren has refused to give, and that is the figure which he got when going to the fountain head.</P>

      <P>The tenant is paying for it at the rate of £3 a year in ground rent.  I believe there were 1,500 houses budgeted for at Marino&mdash;whoever was paid for the sites at the outset must have got a tidy sum.  If the tenants are charged a ground rent how that sum should be put against the cost of the house seems to me to be the last word in juggling.  I do not profess to be a man of figures, I am merely an artisan, but I claim to be a man of commonsense and to have sufficient sense and education to see through the Minister when he merely produces a figure of £700 and gives no details.  He says that the footnote was at the end of the information that I asked for. I did not ask for the footnote, I had all the figures before.  I went there simply to verify my figures and to see that they were correct.  I was so anxious not to deceive the House that, at the last moment, I went to the Corporation to see whether my figures were correct, not to ask for these figures.  The Minister was not long in getting aware of that.  This question of the cost of the acquisition of the ground is all moonshine. If you put the cost of the acquisition <Col N="262" /> of the site against the cost of the house, and you give it as a freehold I am satisfied, but you cannot have it both ways.  Give them a freehold and I will accept that.  You are not giving them a freehold.  You are charging ground rent, and yet the Minister puts in the acquisition of the site.  Did any responsible Minister ever before try to hoodwink a body of intelligent people by methods like this?  It will not work.  I have given the figures for the cost of erection and I stand over them. The Minister does not deny that they are correct.  He has a copy of a statement supplied to him, but he does not give any details.  I say no more about that, and I leave it to the commonsense of the House to decide between the Minister and me, as to the equity and justice of the case I am making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think very much more could be said with regard to these figures from the point of view of helping us to decide the exact position. It seems to me that the position we have to consider is something like this: It is clearly undesirable to exclude from special provisions working-class houses unless a very clear case is made why these working-class houses should be excluded.  If I understand the Minister's case it is that these working-class houses have obtained in the form of reduction of cost from the ratepayers or the community something which is better in proportion than another person would obtain under this Act.  I think that is the case made.</P>
      <P>If his case is complete I do not think we should vote for the amendment, and where the question of these figures comes into consideration is not as to the exact amount of the figures, but as to whether the figures show that the owners of these houses have obtained substantial equipment from the ratepayers and at the expense of the ratepayers. I think these figures have been most unsatisfactory, and I think that the Minister's statement with regard to this round figure of £700, when he had a detailed statement in his hand, was not really the way to convince the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is simply this: certain figures were given by Senator Farren.  There was a footnote to the effect that electric wiring and certain other things were not included, including the cost of acquisition.  Personally, I do not think that the cost of acquisition has anything to do with the question when a ground rent is paid. I am just trying to ascertain the position, and am making a statement in order to see whether my understanding of the matter is correct.  That would mean that you deduct, roughly, about £60 from the £700.  I would be surprised if the cost of electric wiring and the other things mentioned made up the balance and brought the average up to £700.  I do not think that that statement has really been sufficiently detailed. My feeling about the whole matter is this, that we ought to agree with the substance of Senator Farren's amendment unless we are perfectly satisfied that there has been a very large advantage given at the expense of the ratepayers, and as the matter stands at present I am not convinced, and I am inclined to vote for Senator Farren's amendment, because I do feel that the difference, as disclosed, and taking away the cost of the acquisition of the site, which I do not think should be taken into consideration, is not sufficient and unless it is made clear I think I shall vote for the amendment.</P>

      <P>One could scarcely <Col N="264" /> hope to digest the very long statement of the Minister, who was very prolix, but gathering from it two or three salient facts, we are to compare these particular houses and the utility houses.  He says in one case a bounty of £280 was given, and that in the other case only £110.  But from the peculiar manner in which the figures were given to us I am perfectly satisfied from them that if the selling price to the tenant is £460 the £240 difference between the £460 and the £700 does not arise.  It has not been contradicted that the tenants are paying ground rent.  If they are, the capitalised value of the ground rent should be charged.  Then we are told about the electric wiring.  Such a sum could not possibly be spent for wiring&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think it is reasonable to assume that the selling price of £460 cannot be a diminution of more than £100 or £140&mdash;say £600, and comparing that with the amount given to the utility builders I think that the working-class dwellings are left at a decided disadvantage, and, I think, it should be rectified.

      <P>We have been told that this is a great advantage being given to the labourer's cottage of £280 as compared with the remission of rates, but that does not appear in the difference between the £700 and the £460.  As regards any acquisition of sites, some of these companies lately formed to build garden cities charge <Col N="265" /> £8 a year for one-fifth of an acre.  That is equivalent to a price of £100 an acre, and you are not even given the choice of the building contractor.  That is in the garden cities.  They have the advantage of whatever the building contractor gets, and I think it is more or less 100 per cent. on the cost.  I built a house in the country and the walls are two and a half feet thick.  Of course, it is not the class of house let to people in Fairview, which people I do not think will be there in forty years' time&mdash;neither the tenants nor the houses&mdash;because it is a most lamentable thing that the town planning of this city has not been dealt with, and that they have selected very unhealthy slum areas to increase the slum population in cement slums.  I should have thought that they would have taken advantage of the fact that motors were going as far as Killester, and nobody should have been allowed to build in Fairview.  Rubbish is dumped there every night, no tar is put on it; and when the weather is not wet and the wind blows anything dumped there blows across into the receptacles for the children's milk, and houses are still being erected on land which no civilised community would allow to be built on at all.  Senator Farren's contention largely amounts to whether value was given for the difference between £700 and £460.  I do not think these houses should have cost even £300, because they have iron windows, which only cost £2 10s. each, and they have very bad walls.  The latest method of construction is the Swedish method, and by that method the walls are more substantial, though only half as thick as the walls in Fairview.  The only way to correct that would be to put in a dictator, who would see that the houses built about the city are built on convenient and healthy sites, and who would be cognisant of the fact that if this were done the tenants would no longer have to walk home.  In different parts of Dublin there are many healthy sites, practically under heather and gorse, up about Ticknock, and along the road that runs from Rathfarnham to Dundrum.  But they select a place where there is an ancient slobland, covered with tin cans and every kind of <Col N="266" /> rotten rubbish, and in front of that they build houses in which people are supposed to live healthily.  Then the expenditure falls back on the hospitals, and there again you have lowered the rateable value of semi-private hospitals because they are for the poor.</P>

I am talking of the bad quality of the houses that are causing the rates to go up in one place as they are taken off in another, and I am questioning Senator Farren's figures very much because of the addendum that he did not produce to show that he could easily account for a couple of hundred pounds.</P>

      <P>I tried to show that even where one had an option, without even being driven by any regulations, people who are free agents were paying £1,100 as the price of an acre.  Therefore it is easily conceivable that whatever small area is under each house would have made away with a large proportion of that £200, as the deficit that Senator Farren tried to explain, though, as I say, he suppressed the addendum.  I would like to know the source of his figures and the reason for the suppression of the figures that might have explained the difference between the rates.  It is a lamentable thing that when the £280 was there these houses were not built.  If they had been there would be no question about a difference now.</P>

      <P>You will have that opportunity on the Final Stage of the Bill.  But it would not be in order now to go into the general condition of the Dublin houses.  I feel in an awkward position about this matter.  I do not mean in an awkward position as to the voting, because I have no responsibility in voting upon it.  But I think the House should see that this thing is cleared up in some way.  We have here figures that were given, quite accurately I thought, by Senator Farren, and the only thing he did not state in those figures is this addendum which I will now read for you: &ldquo;To the above figures must be added the cost of acquisition, development, electric wiring, etc., so that the all-in cost per house will average about £700.&rdquo;  Well now the Senator very properly says that the cost of acquisition is represented by the ground rent.  That may not necessarily represent the total cost of acquisition, but it certainly seems to be a substantial contribution towards it.  There is the question of the development. That was one of the reasons that I asked if the roads had been made after the houses were erected on this land, because there would be a substantial addition for pathways and railings. But they are included in the contract.  Therefore the extra cost cannot result from development in that sense, and we are only left then with the &ldquo;wiring, etc.,&rdquo; and that is not satisfactory, because it would take a lot of &ldquo;wiring, etc.,&rdquo; to make up the difference between £460 and £700.  I only mention that to show why we should perhaps have a further opportunity of getting further particulars&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Were these the figures that were before the Corporation when they decided as to the amount that they were going to lose, and that the rates that these houses should pay should be a certain thing; because it looks as if when the Corporation settled the price, that they wanted some excuse for forcing up the price.  The whole thing is very hazy, and it does bear that interpretation.  It looks as if a man built a £500 house and he wanted to sell it by way of appearing to give a big remission and by saying that it cost him £700 to build.  It looks as if that note was made by someone who was advising the Corporation and who said, &ldquo;What is the most you can say you spent on this site?&rdquo;  That is the way the whole discussion appears to me on which this codicil, or whatever you wish to call it, was made.  That looks very much like the position, and it is an excuse which the Corporation has for saying they did a thing much better than they actually did it.</P>

      <P>That is an amendment that Senator Brown and I considered was consequential on Senator Farren's amendment if it passed, and as it has passed I think it is necessary in Section 12 to delete sub-section (2) (b), which deals with exactly the same question.</P>

      <P>This is also a logical sequence of Senator Farren's amendment.  The object of both these amendments&mdash;and they must be read together&mdash;is to give the benefit of the relief given by this section to persons who have erected or improved buildings which owing to their not being finished before the 1st April, 1927, are outside Section 69 of the Act of 1925.  The benefit of Section 69 of the Act of 1925 is only given to people building and improving before the 1st April, 1927.  There are a certain number of houses which are being erected at present and which may be finished before the 1st April, 1927, and, on the other hand, there are houses which have been commenced now and which will be finished in the interval between the passing of this Bill and the 1st October, 1930.

With regard to Section 12, I consulted with the Commissioners of the City of Dublin and other people interested and I found how much of a burden was placed on them.  With regard to that particular section I thought the matter was disposed of.  This Bill was re-committed in respect of two proposals&mdash;in respect of Senator Linehan's amendment with regard to the agricultural grant, and Senator Farren's amendment applying this Act to houses built under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.

      <P>I would like to draw attention to the fact that the provisions of this Bill do not touch the urgent necessity for better houses for the very poor.  We have been familiar for the last quarter of a century with the housing conditions under which the very poor in Dublin live, and we know that one-third of the population live in single-room dwellings.  It is not easy to realise the conditions under which these poor people live in single rooms, without water supply or any sanitary arrangements.  Within the last week I visited some of these dwellings.  In one room there were a father, a mother and seven children.  The room was about fourteen feet by nine.  The mother had been in a sanatorium and is now attending a tuberculosis dispensary.  One of the children is in a sanatorium.  What hope is there for people living in such conditions, and what hope is there for the children living in adjoining rooms? The room was filthy dirty.  I visited another dwelling, a cellar kitchen, in which the top of the window was slightly above the level of the back yard.  There was practically no ventilation and it was damp and filthy. There were living there a father, a mother and nine children.</P>

      <P>I think that the same facilities which are given in this Bill to build certain classes of houses should be given for the erection of houses for the working classes.  The dwellings to which I refer are really hotbeds of disease.  We are spending £35,000 in Dublin annually to deal with tuberculosis, yet these conditions are allowed to breed more tuberculosis.  I will give just one or two further instances. In another one-room dwelling there were a father, a mother and nine children.  One child which was formerly in Crooksling sanatorium is now attending school.  Another child is now in a sanatorium.  The eldest girl living in that room is twenty years of age and there is another girl of nineteen, as well as a boy of seventeen and several young children.  What kind of morality and what kind of sanitation can you expect to find there?</P>

I think it will probably be found more convenient if I make a very brief statement now and give a detailed account of the Bill on the Second Stage when copies of it will be in the hands of Senators.  The object of the Bill is to put practising accountants in a similar position to solicitors, to provide for a council which would set a standard, and to provide for the registration of all practising accountants.  The Bill is of considerable importance.  It raises a principle of considerable importance which will want careful consideration, and it will, no doubt, take considerable time.  I do not intend to rush it in any way.  I am prepared to go at considerable length into the Bill now, but, having stated its principal objects, I will defer an explanation of its details until Senators have copies of it on Second Reading.</P>

It is to prevent certain kinds of cruelty in the capture of birds and certain kinds of cruelty in keeping birds in too small a cage.  I also stated that the Bill was the result of a deputation which went to the Minister for Justice; that he is in sympathy with it and would have introduced it as a Government Bill in the Dáil but he was afraid that it could not possibly reach the Seanad in time if that course were adopted.  It was therefore suggested that the Bill should be introduced here.</P>

Some persons make a livelihood by the capture and sale of these birds, and I see no provision in the Bill for compensation for such persons, who will lose their livelihood.  It occurs to me that this Bill is more or less of a one-sided character, bordering on class legislation.  There are certain persons who take out guns to shoot down birds.  It is not alone the birds they kill that matter, but the birds that they wound, which have to linger along until death releases them from their sufferings.  The Bill makes no mention of that&mdash;that is sport.</P>

      <P>On most occasions I am in agreement with Senator Brown and I have no objection to supporting this Bill, but I want to take the opportunity of protesting against the unnecessary annoyance which farmers and cattle traders are subjected to by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, who, I am sure, are behind the Bill.  I want to give some instances of the annoyance which they suffer.  A farmer may send out a horse with a load of farm produce and when the horse gets to the market, owing to the heat and perspiration due to pulling the load his back or breast may be scalded by the harness.  The inspector of the Society comes along and finds a sore and prosecutes the farmer for an act for which he is in no <Col N="277" /> way responsible and could not foresee, because the horse would be in a perfectly sound condition when leaving home.  The next instance I wish to give is that a farmer may send a number of animals to the market. Going along the road one of them may strike a stone with his foot or in some way get his foot injured, and it may be walking lame.  If an inspector of the Society sees the animal the farmer is prosecuted for an act for which he is not responsible.  Another instance is that of the Society's inspectors, or some of the members of the Society, poking around farmers' places.  I admit this is to prevent the dishorning of cattle.  In this case it is a deliberate act on the part of the farmer, but I cannot understand why any people should try to prevent the dishorning of cattle.  It means the loss of markets in Great Britain, because a good many farmers over there will not have cattle unless they are polled, and if we do not supply polled cattle the Canadians will. Dishorning cattle, to my mind, when performed by a competent person, is no greater cruelty than the castrating of male animals.  What I suggest is that Senator Brown should give me some assurance that he will make representations to the Society to cease these petty prosecutions.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Bill for one reason, if for no other, that it will restrict the activities of plover-catchers. They go about with these tremendous engines of war.  In the case of golden plover, they come with great spring nets and they have these decoy birds held on by a thread.  When they spring, the poor little bird hops, and he is kept hopping and hopping. He is kept for days, perhaps, in a bag, hungry, and is still kept hopping until he gets expert.  These poor little birds are caught in that cruel way.  To my mind, apart altogether from the question of cruelty to the birds, the destruction of green plover is a source of great loss to the country.  The green plover is the most prolific devourer of noxious insects that we have.  I am informed that they devour those grubs which cause the terrible rot we have amongst stock and which has been responsible for such heavy losses amongst farmers. I have heard that the green plover is one of the most tremendous devourers of these insects.  If that is the case, this Bill is desirable apart altogether from the aspect of cruelty to the birds. I strongly support the Bill.  I know that the poor little goldfinches, which should be a delight in the country, have practically altogether disappeared. They are caught in traps and by birdlime and sent wholesale to England.</P>

      <P>I am in a somewhat difficult position owing to the discussion that took place about a week ago, as to the advisability of sitting every Wednesday.  If we adjourn the House until next Wednesday, as far as I can see there will not be business to occupy the House for more than a few minutes.  At the same time it is immaterial <Col N="279" /> to me how often we sit.  The more often we meet the better I like it, but I am not sure that that feeling is shared by the whole House, particularly those Senators who have to come a considerable distance.  I am placed in a considerable difficulty owing to this divergence of views.

      <P>I do not think it arises on that.  My view is quite simple &mdash;that it is on Monday you, sir, should come to a decision as to whether there is likely to be business.  Last week we were given the impression that there would be no business for this week and, as a matter of fact, it is now 6.30, and we could go on much longer.  Some Senators could at any rate.  It seems to me the mistake is in trying to decide the previous Wednesday whether there will be business for the following week. It makes it very difficult.  For instance there is the Bill I introduced, and there is the Birds Bill.  If there was no other business, we could take these Bills.  I think we should meet regularly in order that the Government and the Dáil may know that we meet regularly on Wednesday, and if they have any business, that they can count on that. I think that has been a source of a considerable amount of criticism.</P>
