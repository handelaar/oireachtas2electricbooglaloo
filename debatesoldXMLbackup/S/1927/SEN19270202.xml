    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle sought to be established by this Bill is quite foreign to representative institutions, and, as far as I know, without any constitutional precedent in any other Parliament.  The Bill proposes that the Deputy who is Chairman of the Dáil immediately prior to a dissolution shall, unless he expresses a desire to the contrary, have no necessity to offer himself for re-election, but shall be returned automatically as a member of the new Dáil and represent no constituency.  When the new Assembly meets it may or it may not select this Deputy who represents nobody to be Chairman over its proceedings. If it does elect him he presides over its deliberations, but if it does not elect him he still remains a member of the House with all the rights and privileges of a Deputy duly elected.  It is even possible that he can become a member of the Executive Council, Minister for Finance, or even President. That seems to me to be an extraordinary constitutional departure in order to meet what is obviously a difficulty, but not a difficulty which is peculiar to this State more than to any other.  The arguments in support of the Bill have been to the effect that the Speaker of the House has not the opportunity that other Deputies have had of catering for his constituents, of voicing their opinions in the House and so forth, and that consequently he is at a disadvantage <Col N="123" /> in securing re-election.  That is one of the arguments.  The other is that it is undesirable that the Speaker of the House should have to enter into the cock-pit of politics in the ensuing election.  Although a Deputy may be Speaker it does not of necessity follow that he has not been able to do something for his constituents, because he is always in a position, if he so desires, to ask the assistance of Ministers and other Deputies in getting individual cases attended to, and in general doing the work of a Deputy which is apart from the ordinary public parliamentary work.  In regard to the undesirability of his mixing in politics openly at an election there is nothing unnatural in that, because there is no guarantee that the same man will be elected Speaker again at the next Parliament, and it would be a poor Parliament that would be unable to secure a suitable alternative for a Deputy who was Speaker in the event of his not securing re-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A compromise on this unusual departure was suggested and turned down. It was to the effect that he would not be required to seek re-election, but that if the new Dáil did not select him as their Chairman he would cease to be a member of the Assembly.  Otherwise he would not have to seek election at the polls.  Even his own colleagues do not see fit to elect him to the Chair, so he does not command the confidence of the majority of the House, and yet he has all the powers and privileges of a duly elected Deputy.  The compromise is reasonable, because it would be up to the Chairman of the day to say whether he would risk election or alternatively chance being re-elected by the Assembly and thereby retain his membership of the House.  I think it is an undesirable departure to have anyone in the elected Assembly who is not elected, but who can go on from one Parliament to another without ever appealing to his constituents.  If that is a good policy for the other House I contend it to be equally good for the Seanad, and that a case made in respect of the other House can be made for the Chairman of this House although I should oppose it.  It shows <Col N="124" /> how the principle can be extended, and eventually it might extend to the Vice-Chairman of both Houses.  In that way the principles of a representative institution would be gradually encroached upon and eaten into.  For that reason I shall vote against the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The object of this Bill, as explained by Senator O'Farrell, is to meet the special case of the Speaker or Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil.  I may perhaps mention that this difficulty is not peculiar to this State.  It exists elsewhere and has been met elsewhere in a rather special manner.  In Great Britain the Speaker's seat, by agreement between the heads of Parties, is not contested.  It is ear-marked for him and he is returned automatically at each succeeding General Election. The result of that is practically to disfranchise an important constituency. It is, I think at present, a constituency in the City of London but that provision for the Speaker can be made where you have straight voting system of election.  It cannot be made where you have proportional representation. It would not be possible here to earmark a seat and say &ldquo;that is the Speaker's seat&rdquo; and by agreement between Party leaders it should be left uncontested so that it did seem necessary to make some other provision to meet the special case of the Speaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me remind Senators of what happens when Parliament meets. Some one member of the Parliament is called from the services of his constituency to the services of the Assembly.  That is what happens. As from that date the assembly in fact becomes his constituency.  He is divorced from the cut and thrust of active party politics.  It is undesirable that he should adopt a partisan attitude on any issue, that he should appear on public platforms, that he should, in other words, exercise the liberty which attaches to all other members of the House.  When a man over a period of four or five years had been completely aloof in that way from party politics, from the active service of his constituency, from the voicing of the views of his constituents, his prospects <Col N="125" /> in a competitive election under proportional representation against five or six others who throughout that long period had been free to nurse that constituency might be very slender indeed.</P>
    <P>This is a special provision.  I have shown that a special provision is made elsewhere in a manner in which it cannot be made here owing to the existence of proportional representation. The suggestion is, therefore, that the person who has presided over a Dáil during the lifetime of a particular Parliament shall be deemed to be elected, shall be returned automatically to the next Parliament, leaving the next Parliament quite free on the issue of whether or not it will select that particular individual to be its Speaker. The Senator says, and of course he is accurate, that it is an encroachment on the representative character of the Assembly.  It is to the extent of less than one per cent.  In an Assembly of 130 or 140 members you will have one person who was not elected by a constituency unless you take it in the sense that his real constituency during the lifetime of the last Parliament was the Dáil itself.</P>
    <P>We have not been able to devise any other provision.  The alternative is to leave the Speaker free to take his chance, in an intensely competitive election, against persons who have been under none of the disabilities which he has been under by nature of his office. That does not seem sound.  But the Senator spoke of a suggested compromise, that this person should be returned automatically to the next Parliament, retiring therefrom and stepping clean out of public life, so to speak, if not selected as the Speaker. Is that desirable?  Does it not put a degree more of pressure, of coercion on the next Parliament, to select him if the result of his non-selection is that he disappears entirely from the arena of public life?  The case would then be the stronger for the election of that particular individual.  It would be pointed out that if he is not selected he disappears for five years as a factor in the public life of the country.  It is better to leave the ensuing Parliament quite free in the matter as to whether the person who had acted as Speaker <Col N="126" /> for the previous Parliament would be Speaker in that Parliament or not, and it is a degree or two less free if you say: &ldquo;Here is a man in your midst; if you choose him as Speaker he remains, but if you do not choose him as Speaker he goes out from your midst and disappears from the scene for five years.&rdquo; We think that this is a reasonable proposal. It is certainly not devised in any spirit of party, but simply to meet a special situation which undoubtedly exists as part and parcel of our scheme of representative institutions.  We cannot meet it as it is met in Great Britain because we have a different system of election, because we have proportional representation, and it would be impossible to earmark the Speaker's seat. This is the best method that we have been able to devise, and we recommend it accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Seanad will support this Bill.  Possibly we are better able to consider it even than the Dáil, because it does not affect us and we can look at the thing without any regard to personalities.  It is not our concern who may or may not be Speaker of the other House.  But it does seem to me that the arguments for this Bill are not quite as stated by Senator O'Farrell, though I recognise that he was endeavouring to state them quite fairly.  It is not so much that there may be certain hardships on an individual, who cannot do what he would like in order to get re-elected, as it is that you require to have the Chairman of the popular House as independent as it is possible to make him, as free from partisanship, to make it beyond question that he cannot and ought not, while in office, or while a prospective candidate for office as Chairman, express his opinions, whatever they may be, on the legislation that is before the House.  Quite, true, the Chairman of the Dáil, when he went for election, would have difficulty in making as good a case as another member.  It is equally possible that he might be better off, because sometimes the speeches that people have made cause their failure to be re-elected. But I do not think that that is the point.  My point is that, for good or <Col N="127" /> evil, he ught not to go to the hustings and state that he is for or against the particular Bills which, as frequently is the case, have been introduced into the House but not passed, with regard to which he has been acting impartially and on which he will be expected to act impartially as soon as he is re-elected, if he is re-elected.</P>
      <P>The main point, to my mind, is to provide the best way to secure the independence of the Speaker, to secure that he shall not be expected in public as long as he holds that office, or as long as he is likely to be elected to that office, to express any opinion, good, bad or indifferent, about the Bills with which he will have to deal.  For example, a certain number of Bills, I understand, are to be introduced by the Government between now and the time when we are likely to have a General Election.  The Chairman of the Dáil acts impartially; he expresses no opinion about any of this legislation. I think it is indisputable that much of this legislation will not or cannot be passed into law before the General Election.  Is the Speaker to go out, as soon as the House dissolves, and express his views upon all these measures? I suggest that that would weaken his position, and that, no matter how independently he was prepared to act if he was re-elected as Chairman, certain people would feel, knowing as they would then what his own views were, that he would be acting other than impartially.  Then, again, what I consider is the most serious problem of all is the fact that we have the party or group system here at present. It is extremely difficult to get a man elected as an independent candidate. If he is wealthy he may manage to run an election campaign all by himself, and one or two of that type may get elected.  In practice that is rare. That means, in fact, that the Chairman of the Dáil has to be adopted for election purposes by some one or other of the parties, and must be run by that party.  I suggest that that is not desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question then arises: If we agree as to the end, what is the best means? I have not heard any method suggested <Col N="128" /> other than the proposed compromise by Senator O'Farrell, that the Speaker should not be a member of the House at all.  There is a good deal to be said for that, but the Committee which considered this in the first instance and made recommendations to the Executive Council of proposals somewhat like this, considered the matter carefully and came to the conclusion that he should be a member.  As to the compromise, my own impression is this: it is not a matter of a man taking a risk as to whether he will be re-elected Chairman or not; it is simply this, that you want the Dáil to be as independent as possible of other considerations in choosing its Chairman.  Senator O'Farrell says&mdash;and he may be right&mdash;that the failure to elect him as Chairman would show a want of confidence in him on the part of the House.  Perhaps I had better not argue that; it might be correct, but I do not think it would always be the case.  There may be cases where considerations other than purely a matter of confidence would lead to the selection of somebody else. A new Government, a different complexion in the parties, led to a change in South Africa some time ago, and it is quite possible that there are other questions which would be considerations in deciding whether the Chairman ought to be re-elected or not.</P>
    <P>One other point.  Senator O'Farrell said that this man would represent nobody. Let me say, in passing, that the case of one man representing a constituency does not apply under proportional representation; there are five or six, representing groups in the constituency. Under the old system the man elected looked after the general interests of the constituency, but that has practically gone.  He now represents one-fifth, one-sixth, or one-seventh of the interests in his constituency, and he speaks for that portion, not for the whole constituency. For example, Mr. A.B. is elected, and when he takes his seat in the House, finds himself called to the position of Chairman.  He does not function at at all as an ordinary Deputy.  I do not agree that he can take very much interest in his group in the constituency by going to Ministers or by <Col N="129" /> asking other Deputies to act on his behalf. In fact, he has failed to carry out what he was elected for.  All that this does is to provide that if, during the lifetime of the following Parliament, he does not continue in the Chair, he carries out these duties, and when it it said that he is not representative, in the strictest sense, as he was not elected at that particular moment, it must be remembered that he was elected previously and was, therefore, considered a fit person to act as a Deputy. I hope, having regard to all the circumstances, that the Seanad will support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still among those unconverted to the Government's view.  I do not know that any particular emergency has arisen to urge us specially to interfere with what has been the immemorial parliamentary practice as far as the Speaker is concerned.  It is said when the Parliament elevates one of its members into the important position of Speaker, that, <i>ipso facto</i>, he is unable to give proper attention to the interests of his constituents, or, as it may be, that he is not able to keep sufficiently in touch with the affairs of his constituents, their wishes and their interests.  But I should have thought that that argument could not possibly apply in a country as small as this country.  Surely the Speaker of the Dáil must know what his constituents think about various questions, and he will surely be able to assist them in many respects.  As a matter of fact, the Speaker has exceptional facilities, exceptional opportunities, for serving his constituents' interests, as we all know.  In fact, most constituencies might look upon it rather as an honour if their representative were appointed to the most important position in the gift of his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that a Speaker should not mix in politics.  Well, how did he get elected?  Was he not a member of some political party?  It does not follow because a man is a Speaker of an Assembly that he must therefore have no views of his own.  I think it is a most unwise thing for a politician, a representative of the people, to have no views of his own.  I am afraid that <Col N="130" /> a person occupying the position under these conditions would hardly conduce to the dignity or efficiency of a Parliament. There is no reason whatever why a Speaker should not have his individual views in regard to politics, and there is no reason why he should not express his views even at election times.  Of course, when he takes the Chair it is his bounden duty and first principle to act with absolute impartiality. While he is in the Chair he pays no attention, of course, to political considerations.  Political considerations, after all, do not arise very much in the interpretation of the Orders of the House.  All he has to do is to carry out the ordinary duties of Chairman and see the business of the Assembly is conducted in an orderly fashion.</P>
    <P>There is another point which has escaped general notice.  Under the arrangement now proposed you will have one member of the Dáil elected to represent no constituency; but that member must belong to one of the political parties or groups into which the Dáil is divided.  You can imagine something approaching equilibrium being arrived at amongst the various groups and parties and the party to which the Speaker, or the ex-Speaker, belongs will have one vote more than it is entitled to.  To that extent I think it will be a negation of constitutional and representative principles.</P>
    <P>The Speakers in other Assemblies, in the United States, Canada and Australia are in this position: their seats are contested in the ordinary way, and if they are defeated they are not in the running for the Speakerships of their Assemblies. They seem to carry on quite satisfactorily in those countries under those conditions, and I do not see why we should make an exception in the case of the Saorstát simply because we happen to have proportional representation. It may be that some day or other we may change the system of proportional representation.  If that is done I presume we will have to amend our Constitution again.</P>
    <P>I do not think a case has been made out for such a departure from established constitutional and representative rules and regulations, and I will certainly <Col N="131" /> vote against the Second Reading of the Bill if the matter is pressed to a division.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think anybody who knows anything about the Dáil and its proceedings will agree that the present Speaker is unexceptionable and that it would be hard to get another as good.  But, after all, he belongs, like anybody else, to a party.  I do not know whether, when he was first elected, he was put in for that purpose; but no one had any experience of him as a Chairman before, and, therefore, I presume that, to a certain extent at least, if not entirely, he was put in because he was a member of a party.</P>
      <P>That also would apply equally, as has been pointed out, to the Deputy Speaker.  As far as I know, the Deputy Speaker is not permitted to go about the country making speeches wherever he likes.  I do not think that there is any order against that, but I think, unless I am misinformed, it has been suggested to him that he had better not do it and that it would not conduce to his retention of the Deputy Speakership if he did.  If that is so, the same thing should apply to him.  Why is it not applied to him?  I do not know of any reason why it should not be.  Perhaps the Minister will explain why the exception should be in the case of the Speaker only.</P>
      <P>As has already been pointed out, it might also be made apply to the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad.  As a matter of fact, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad has on more than one occasion made political statements.</P>

      <P>Well, that is only in passing; I am only saying it for the sake of my argument.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach here might do the same. What I am going to say was already hinted at.  We know of the English agreement and it has been pointed out that under proportional representation such a thing could not happen.  That is an extraordinary thing to say.  It means that even if all the parties in a particular constituency&mdash;say the University&mdash;agree that the present Speaker should be elected, he may be put out and given no chance.  That is a very extraordinary statement.  Even if all the parties agree in the University that the present Speaker should be elected&mdash;and I think that all parties will agree&mdash;we are told he may have no chance of being put in.</P>

      <P>The English situation is made up, I said, by agreement between the heads of parties.

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has stated was not always, to my knowledge, the case in the House of Commons.  I remember when an important party question arose in the House over the election of a Speaker and the choice of a Speaker at the time tended to show which party was in the <Col N="133" /> ascendancy.  I believe that since then the selection of a Speaker has been made by agreement, but it is only a private agreement and if there was strong party feeling in the House I am not at all sure that it would continue. It might or it might not.  My contention still holds good.  There is no reason why the different parties, in the case of the University or some other constituency, as it might happen, should not agree to support the Speaker in the election and that would probably ensure his return.  In England the Speaker goes up for election but he is not opposed.</P>
      <P>This is a matter touching the Constitution. It is not so long since the Constitution was drawn up for the Seanad and Dáil and we were told then that it was almost inviolable.  But now so many changes are made in this Constitution that I think, after a little while there will be only one Article of the original Constitution left and that will be the Oath.  It seems to be the tendency at present to wipe out all the other Articles.  Another argument put forward in favour of this Bill was that it was only a question of one member in a Dáil of 120 or 130.  That comes back to the old argument of the girl who had a baby and in mitigation said it was only a little one.  However, that is not so in this case because there are three or four more &ldquo;babies&rdquo; coming on to-day.  I do not think there is any necessity for this Bill under all the circumstances.  I believe the difficulty has not arisen and will not arise. I believe if the Ceann Comhairle goes up at the General Election he will be elected.  I see no reason why he should not.  I think we should follow the practice in England where they do not make theoretical changes, but wait until the difficulty arises or until the question arises.  I believe we would be wise in not making a change of this kind and for that reason I oppose this Bill.  I do so with regret because the Bill does not concern the Seanad.  For that reason I am sorry in a special way for having to oppose it.  I rather regret giving a vote in this House on a matter concerned with the other House, but under the circumstances I feel I must do so.</P>

We have no guarantee that in future the Dáil will be able to get such as efficient a Ceann Comhairle as they have to-day.  I think every Senator here as well as the Deputies in the other House would regard with much regret anything that would deprive the Oireachtas of the services of the Deputy who occupies the position of Ceann Comhairle in the Dáil. At the same time we must not forget, if we pass this Bill now, that we are passing legislation not for the present but for the future.  It is rather a dangerous thing that we should pass legislation amending the Constitution for the purpose of providing a seat in the Oireachtas for a member who represents nobody.  Senator O'Farrell has suggested a reasonable compromise, that in the event of the individual who was the outgoing Ceann Comhairle at the dissolution, not being re-elected the Ceann Comhairle of the new Assembly, he would cease to hold his position.</P>

      <P>I think that the whole principle underlying this Bill is a want of confidence in the good sense of the electors.  At the last General Election the present Ceann Comhairle was elected for two constituencies. The intelligentsia of the National University and the democrats of Dublin City (South) elected him as Deputy, so that I think we rather forget that fact when we suggest that the ordinary electors, men and women, citizens of the country cannot appreciate the good services that he is competent to carry on on behalf of the State.  For that reason I say that I do not think there is any danger that the man who has given service in the position of Ceann Comhairle would not be re-elected or that the people outside <Col N="135" /> would be unmindful of the services rendered and would be unmindful of the fact that he conducted the business of the Assembly in the manner in which it has been conducted since the Oireachtas was established.  I do not believe that the people outside would forget that and I have no hesitation in saying that neither the Government nor the Dáil need have any fears in that respect.  We are told that because the Ceann Comhairle was divorced more or less from his constituents and because he was not in the position to deal with the ordinary work the ordinary Deputy does, that there was danger that the people outside would be unmindful of the fact that he was unable to do ordinary work outside.  When this matter was under consideration in the Dáil itself a considerable difference of opinion arose amongst the Deputies. If my memory serves me right the majority in favour of it was only a mere handful.</P>

      <P>I think it was seven. I think if there was such a difference of opinion in the Dáil itself with regard to this matter then, that is all the more reason why the Seanad should seriously consider it.  It is unnecessary for me to say that the opposition from this side of the Seanad is not to be taken as any disparagement to the present occupant.  Because I think no Party has more admiration and no Party has reason to have more admiration for the present occupant of the Chair than has the Labour Party.  I will say no more than that.  I do not want to offer my own personal views on this question because I do not want to say the nice things that I would wish to say about the Ceann Comhairle.  The reasons I have given are the reasons why we are opposed to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I hope the Seanad will vote for this Bill, and carry it by <Col N="136" /> a large majority.  There are certain objections to it about which we have heard.  There is a small infringement of the representative character of Dáil Eireann, but that is so small as to be almost an academic point, whereas I think on the other side it must be universally recognised that the position of Chairman of any legislative Assembly is an exceedingly onerous one.  The position of the occupant as regards the work to be done in the House and the sittings in the House is one that involves a great deal of hard work.  The Chairman of that Assembly should as far as possible be an entirely impartial person because the efficiency and smooth working of the House depends so very much on the amount of general confidence felt by all parts and sections of the House in the Chairman and in his efficiency.  If he is to reach that efficiency and if he is to do the work that he has to do in the best possible way, it is necessary that he would be free to look upon himself as being not a member of any party.  For that reason I think the principle involved is very sound and I hope the Bill will pass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to abolish the provision for a public holiday on the day of the General Election.  I think there is pretty general agreement with that.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that one result will be that more votes will be recorded than if it were a general holiday.  However, I presume that the Minister will later on introduce legislation amending the Electoral Act, which provides for a general holiday and also that on the day of a general election the polling hours shall be from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.  The reason the polling hours are short is because of the fact that the day of a general election was presumed to be a public holiday.  At the last Seanad election the public.  I think, were taken completely by surprise when the polling booths were closed at 7 o'clock in the evening.  The hours were left unchanged, although the day of the Seanad election was not a public holiday, with the result that thousands of people who went to vote after tea time found they were late.  If I might make a suggestion in advance to the Minister, it would be that he should alter the hours for polling: that the polling booth should open later in the morning &mdash;say about noon&mdash;and remain open until 10 p.m.  The election, I presume, would take place in the summer-time, so that keeping the booth open to a late hour would not make much difference. Certainly, the later hours for polling would be far more convenient for the general public than the earlier hours from 8 a.m. onwards.  Very few people, as a rule, go to the booths to vote during the early hours of the day.  This early opening of the booths imposes a tremendous strain on the presiding officers and others concerned, who have to sit there for twelve and sometimes thirteen hours.  That is a suggestion that I throw out for the Minister's consideration, and one that I hope he will bear in mind when the amending legislation is being drafted.  It is the Minister for Local Government, I believe, that has to do with this matter of arranging the polling hours on general election days, and I trust he will give this suggestion his consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be necessary, in connection with this Bill, to say a word as to the intentions of the Government.  The Bill is introduced <Col N="139" /> to enable the lifetime of Parliament to be prolonged for a period of five years.  I should say that that is our conception as to what the length of a particular Parliament ought to be. The Bill went to the Dáil with the figure of five years, and there it was suggested that in the Constitution there might perhaps be a greater latitude on the basis that the electoral law would provide a five years' Parliament. It was stated that conceivably, running towards the end of the fifth year, a situation might arise which would render it desirable to extend by some period at any rate the lifetime of Parliament, and that it might be wise to put six years in the Constitution on the undertaking that the electoral law would provide only for a five years' Parliament.  We, consequently, made an amendment in the Bill fixing the maximum at six years and giving an undertaking in the Dáil, which we give here, that the period named in the electoral law will in fact be five years.  If a situation arose rendering it necessary or highly desirable that Parliament should sit longer than five years it would be easier to alter the electoral law&mdash;to put through the Dáil and the Seanad a Bill amending the electoral law&mdash;than perhaps to alter the Constitution, because only after a period of eight years can the Constitution be altered, and we are now altering it by means of ordinary legislation.</P>

      <P>No, but Ministers are predicting that they will be returned again this time.  We all know that after a little bit that whatever Ministry is in&mdash;whether this Ministry or any other, and whether in England or in any other country&mdash;the country gets tired of its Ministers and wants a change.  I think that the people should have the opportunity of doing that.  I think, too, that that tired feeling comes about the fourth year.  I might say that I am speaking now in a purely non-partisan way.  I do not know that the Ministers will be returned again this time.  It is quite possible that they will not.  It may perhaps be the party to which I belong that may have to go out in five years' time.  I do not take a partisan view of this matter at all.  I think, however, that four years is quite long enough for the lifetime of Parliament. About the end of that time Ministers and the country get tired.  I am in favour of the present period of four years, and I say that quite apart from any party feeling in the matter.</P>

      <P>Between now and the Committee Stage of this Bill, I <Col N="141" /> would suggest to the Minister to consider a very serious matter that has occurred to me with regard to its phraseology. Remember that we ought to be very careful in our wording where we are dealing with an alteration in the Constitution.  Section 1 reads:&mdash;&ldquo;The Constitution shall be and is hereby amended.&rdquo;  Now, if that stood alone the effect of it would be that on the date of the passing of this Act the Constitution would be <i>ipso facto</i> amended, but that construction is contradicted by the second clause, which says the Act is not to come into operation until some indefinite date.  While the Act is hung up until some indefinite date, nevertheless the first clause has amended the Constitution.  It seems to me that that is an oversight.  I would suggest to the Minister that on the Committee Stage he ought to bring in an amendment to Section 1, somewhat on these lines: &ldquo;The Constitution shall be as from the date of this Act coming into operation amended,&rdquo; and leave out the words &ldquo;is hereby amended,&rdquo; because if you leave the words as they are you have a direct contradiction between the first clause and the last clause.  The Bill, according to the first clause, amends the Constitution automatically when it passes, but it is not to come into operation till an indefinite date.  But meanwhile the Constitution has been amended.  I think that has been overlooked, and perhaps the Minister may think the matter of sufficient importance, and do something with it on the Committee Stage of the Bill in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution (Amendment) Bills, 2, 3 and 4 affect membership of the Dáil.  The first section of this Bill reads: &ldquo;The Constitution shall be and is hereby amended by the deletion from Article 51 thereof of the words &lsquo;not more than seven&rsquo; and the insertion in that article of the words &lsquo;not more than twelve,&rsquo; in lieu of the said words so deleted.&rdquo;  The effect of <Col N="142" /> that will be that whereas now we have seven Executive Ministers and a certain number of extern Ministers, you absorb the whole margin for extern Ministers by increasing the number of Executive Ministers from seven to twelve.  That is a proposal that infringes on the prerogatives and privileges of members of this House because if you refer to the Constitution and to certain articles of it affecting the privileges of members of this House, you will find that by Article 52 these Ministers who form the Executive Council must all be members of the Dáil.  By Article 55 of the Constitution other Ministers, not members of the Executive Council, may be appointed on the nomination of the Dáil.  Nothing in the Constitution makes it incumbent on those Ministers&mdash;extern Ministers so-called&mdash;to be or to become members of either House of the Oireachtas.  Since the Saorstát was established, however, no extern Minister has been nominated who was not a member of the Dáil.  The Bill that is now before the Seanad leaves Article 55 of the Constitution untouched, but purports to amend Article 51 by increasing the maximum number of Ministers of the Executive Council to twelve.  As, under Article 55, the total number of Ministers, including members of the Executive Council, must not exceed twelve, this Bill, if passed, will make it possible for all the Ministers to be members of the Executive Council.  In such a case no Minister would fall to be appointed under Article 55, and every Minister would necessarily be a member of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be well to draw attention, by way of conclusion, to the provisions of Section 7 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  Under this section the Executive Council may, on the nomination of the President appoint persons, being members of the Oireachtas, to be Parliamentary Secretaries to the Executive Council or to be Executive Ministers.  The total number of persons in receipt of salaries as Ministers or as Parliamentary Secretaries at any one time is not to exceed 15.  At present there are three Parliamentary Secretaries in addition to the Executive Ministers and to the extern <Col N="143" /> Ministers.  There is a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, a Parliamentary Secretary to the President, and a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence. Now, under this Bill which proposes to increase the number of Executive Ministers to twelve and with the three Parliamentary Secretaries, the limit of 15 which is laid down in the Constitution would be exhausted and it would follow that the provision for the appointment of extern Ministers under Article 55 of the Constitution would become a dead letter as the margin for the appointment of extern Ministers would have been absorbed.  When we come to amend the Constitution in this proposed way we have to consider that we are here as a Seanad.  I take exception first to the way that the Dáil and the Government have approached this matter.  They have done so without any reference to this House, and I might say that we are an integral portion of the legislature and of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Any amendment of the Constitution would affect us equally with the Dáil. The Oireachtas is based on the Constitution, and the Oireachtas is composed of both the Dáil and the Seanad. Any amendment or alteration of the basis upon which the legislature is founded is a matter in which this House is equally interested with the Dáil.  The approach to these very serious amendments has been in this way, that a Committee of the Dáil was set up, and there was no previous inquiry made, I take it, as to whether this House would like&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The terms of reference of that Committee were restricted. The Committee were not empowered to roam over the whole Constitution and suggest amendments to the various clauses.  They were restricted in a certain way, and they have brought in their recommendations accordingly. We are concerned here with the taking away by a Bill of certain privileges and prerogatives of this House, which powers and prerogatives, even under the Constitution, are rather meagre, and I would have thought, seeing the character of this House and the qualifications that are supposed to be possessed by its members, and that are set out in the Constitution as being essential for election to this House, that instead of restricting the privileges we already enjoy there would rather be a disposition on the part of the Dáil to extend our privileges when it came to a question of amending the Constitution, that is if the Dáil takes this House seriously at all.  Possibly the Dáil does not, and possibly there are members of this House who do not take the Dáil very seriously, but when you look into the Constitution and read the respective qualifications necessary for election to this House and to <Col N="145" /> the Dáil you will see that the framers of the Constitution had their own particular views with regard to the importance of this House and with regard to the Dáil.  Here is Article 30 of the Constitution:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Eireann shall be composed of citizens who shall be proposed on the grounds that they have done honour to the nation by reason of useful public service or that, because of special qualifications or attainments, they represent important aspects of the nation's life.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that that particular clause and what it implies was borne fully in mind by the President and by the Dáil in forming the first Seanad here.  The conditions laid down in Article 30 were fairly well adhered to, with the result that you have a personnel in this House responding fairly to the conditions laid down.  Turning back to Article 26, I find that the only qualification required for membership of Dáil Eireann is &ldquo;Dáil Eireann shall be composed of members who represent constituencies determined by law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is all.  It does not prescribe any special qualifications.  Now one would think from that that the aggregate of wisdom and legislative ability in this House should at the least be on the average on the same plane as that of the people of the Dáil, and that the President might have widened his range of vision in forming his Cabinet, certainly in regard to extern Ministers, and considered whether there are not some members of this House qualified for these positions.  That is what I say. The Seanad is an integral part of the Oireachtas, but its members are not considered worthy of being appointed as extern Ministers, or even as Parliamentary Secretaries.  I have read for you the conditions for membership of Seanad Eireann, and I shall now refer to the practice both in Great Britain and in the Dominions.</P>

      <P>There is a fallacy in that.  The Government do not claim that their Executive Council should always consist of twelve.  They only claim the right to have it consisting of twelve, but they may have it any smaller number.  If, for example, it only consisted of ten, then they would require two extern Ministers, and I take it, as regard the Seanad, members would be eligible for either of these two appointments.  Your point is that their power to raise their own numbers to twelve means that if the Executive Council increase their numbers to twelve they shut out this House from any chance of participation in the Ministry.

      <P>That is so.  Passing away from that, I wish to say that it is scarcely wise to restrict a Committee when coming to a consideration of an amendment of the Constitution to certain articles of the Constitution, because I am sure in this House there are many members who are in agreement with the idea that the Ministers should be chosen as in the Dominions and in Great Britain from both Houses, that the Article in the Constitution which limits the selection of Ministers to members of the Dáil should be expanded, and that instead of Dáil Eireann being the limitation the Oireachtas should be.  Any member of the Oireachtas should be eligible for Ministerial office.  These are some of the points on which amendment will, I think, be very desirable in the Constitution. Speaking on the principles of the Bill, there is a further amendment which might be considered very desirable, and that is, whereas at present <Col N="147" /> we can hold up a Bill for 270 days, and this House, I am sure, has not exercised that privilege without&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>While criticising this Bill, I think we ought not to take the drastic course of not giving it a Second Reading.  It might be desirable to have a certain extension of the Executive Council but I think it is eminently undesirable that a provision of the Constitution whereby people other than members of the Dáil may be appointed Ministers should be taken away from the citizens of the Saorstát. If the Bill as it stands goes through, it will be impossible for any man not a member of the Dáil to be a Minister. I do not think the Seanad would desire that.  They have now the power, and <Col N="148" /> such power is used by all the Dominions, with the possible exception of Africa, to appoint members of both Houses members of the Government. The Dáil in its wisdom completely ignored this House in that matter. They had a Committee set up to examine their rights and privileges. They never told us about it, or asked us whether we wished to put a member on that Committee.  One would have thought they would have invited us to investigate whether these privileges should in the interests of the Saorstát be curtailed.  They did not take that course.  They set up a committee of which we knew nothing&mdash;we might have seen something about it in the newspapers&mdash;and that committee reported that these drastic steps should be taken&mdash;that we citizens of the Saorstát, as well as Senators, should for ever be deprived&mdash;because practically that is what it amounts to&mdash;of the right to become Ministers.  Senators were selected because of certain expressed qualifications defined in the Constitution.  You would have thought that the Government would have availed themselves of them, but instead of making any attempt to avail of them, they make an attempt in this Bill to prevent any future Government from taking advantage of the ability and experience of Senators.  I do not wish to oppose the Second Reading of the Bill, because I think it is possible that more than seven members of the Executive Council are desirable, but I certainly hope to introduce amendments on the Committee Stage to prevent the intention expressed in the Bill from being carried out by this or any other Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Senator Kenny, if I understand it correctly, is one which certainly ought to be considered by the Seanad.  But I think on consideration it will be found that while it is one of considerable importance, it is not one of very great simplicity.  In the first place, the practice up to the present&mdash;which I think for many reasons is a wise practice&mdash; is to make amendments to the Constitution one by one, and to have a Bill dealing specifically with each subject, rather than having omnibus amendments <Col N="149" /> in one Bill to the Constitution. This Bill proposes to alter the Constitution to allow for elasticity in the matter of the number of members of the Executive Council.  Under the Bill it will be possible for the President, when choosing, to nominate the full number of twelve, and if he obtains the assent of the Dáil to the twelve, there would then be no Ministers appointed by the Committee, commonly called extern Ministers.  In that case there would be no Committee of the Dáil to choose Ministers, as the present Constitution provides that all the members of the Executive Council must be members of the Dáil.  It will not be possible for a Senator to be chosen as it will then stand.  This Bill does not make it compulsory that the President shall choose twelve.  It is left to the particular circumstances which I think will vary from time to time.</P>
      <P>Senator Kenny feels that privileges are being taken from the Seanad.  I am not very much impressed from the point of view of privileges.  Without arguing whether it is a privilege or not to be a Minister, the only privilege we had was that the committee of the Dáil could choose a Senator.  If there is a committee of the Dáil to choose Ministers in future, they will still be able to choose Senators.  The only point is that there may not be such a committee if the President chooses to have all the Ministers inside the Executive Council.  That privilege, to my mind, is not very great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also not impressed by the charge of Senator Bennett that a committee of the Dáil was set up without consulting us.  This Bill was introduced by the Government, and the Dáil set up a committee to look into it.  The Bill has now come to us, and there is nothing to prevent us setting up a committee to look into it from our point of view, if we think fit.  There was a further committee consisting of a number of persons, of which I was a member, long before this Bill was introduced, who were invited by the Executive Council to make certain proposals to them for amendments to the Constitution. Members of that committee were left perfectly free to take any action they thought fit, and their proposals were purely for the purpose of <Col N="150" /> aiding the Executive Council in considering how far they should introduce amendments to the Constitution.  There was an understanding that the members of that committee, while retaining their own freedom, should not disclose the nature of the recommendations which they had made.  I am not, therefore, free to say exactly what the committee recommended, but I am perfectly free to say that as a member of that committee I advocated that whether this amendment took place or not&mdash;that is whether the President chose five or seven or twelve Executive Ministers&mdash; the provision in the Constitution which prevented his choosing a Senator should be withdrawn.  I am still of the opinion that, quite apart from whether there are to be extern Ministers or not, there should be nothing in the Constitution to prevent a Senator becoming a Minister if otherwise chosen.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I think on consideration, we will see that there could never be many members of the Seanad members of the Executive Council.  The position is not quite the same as in England. The Government under our Constitution is clearly responsible directly to the Dáil.  They are the servants of the Dáil, which is the directly representative House.  While I see no reason why a suitable person in the Seanad, who is in general agreement with any particular Government, should not be chosen as a Minister, I do recognise that you could not have a President in the Seanad suitably under our Constitution, or a Minister for Finance.  There are natural limitations which, whether in the Constitution or not, will be applicable. It is a matter entirely for the Cathaoirleach to say whether one could, by amendment of this Bill, alter Article 52, which says that the members of the Executive Council must be members of the Dáil.  What is required is, to remove that particular portion of Section 52&mdash;not to alter this.  That would leave us, at any rate, in a better or clearer position than we were before.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that we could not alter that on this Bill, but I do think that it would be open to us in Committee, if we were so advised, to insert that in the event of the Executive Council being increased <Col N="151" /> from seven to any number in excess of seven, the members selected over and above seven might be selected from either House.  I am not committing myself to that, but if any Senator puts down an amendment I will deal with it.</P>

      <P>My point is that in order to carry out what I think is the desire of Senator Kenny, Article 52 would have to be amended, and it is a matter for you, sir, to decide whether that could be done in this Bill, or whether a separate Bill would have to be introduced.  I am inclined myself to the latter opinion, that a separate Bill would be required, and I am sorry, personally, that the Government did not see their way to introduce that Bill.</P>
      <P>While I am speaking on the matter, I should like to say that I think the Seanad suffers considerably by not having either a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary in this House.  I think that the Government ought to look in the future to having one person who would be in a real sense a representative of the Government and, consequently, the leader of the House.  It is not satisfactory as it is at present, and I think a good deal of misunderstanding and difficulty with regard to the stages of Bills are due to the fact that there is no authoritative person, as there is in most Second Chambers, representing the Government of the day.  Whether that Government has a majority in the Seanad or not, has nothing to do with it&mdash;they should have a representative.  That is an additional reason why I think some amendment of this Bill, such as was suggested by Senator Kenny, should take place, or another Bill be introduced to give effect to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that we cannot amend this Bill to effect the principle demanded by Senator Kenny and that the Bill should be rejected, <Col N="152" /> because it is very important that Senators should be eligible for a post in the Executive Council.  The fact that the Seanad cannot have several members on the Executive Council, or that the President or Minister for Finance cannot be a member of the Seanad, does not affect the principle.  That should be kept clearly in view.  We should not be led astray by the argument which may be put forward that the power to have extern Ministers still remains. It will remain.  Senator Douglas says it will have a certain elasticity.  The President can have extern Ministers or not as he likes.  I believe the whole object of this Bill is to chain up those extern Ministers, They have been very embarrassing to the Government on some occasions.  If that has been the experience, it is unlikely, unless they are very docile, that they will be re-appointed in that capacity. All this is rather interesting, because at the time it was generally felt that it was a doctrinaire constitutional device to try and bring Ministers outside the party system, so that the party system should be shorn of its vices.  All that has happened has proved it to be necessary.  You must have discipline in the ranks of the Government.  This so-called theoretical device led to indiscipline and very considerable confusion on the part of the public, who did not quite appreciate these niceties, when they saw people they knew as Ministers speaking with totally different voices, and advocating widely different policies.  I do not think that much would be left to this House by the nominal retention of extern Ministers.  I do strongly feel that we should come into line with our sister Dominions, all of whom, I think, have the power to choose Ministers from their Senate or Upper House.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Douglas that the Government should be represented in this House, and I think they make a great mistake in not being represented here. Any Government which has a majority in the Lower House of the Legislature should be represented in this House, whether it is by extern Ministers or not is a matter for its own determination. From the point of view of efficacy <Col N="153" /> and harmony between the two Houses I think it would be extremely well if a member of the Government was a member of this House representing them in this House.  It is proposed to increase the members of the Executive Council under this new Bill.  If there is to be any increase in the number of members of the Executive Council I think the claims of the Department of Local Government should be recognised. It is one of the most important Departments that we have in our administration, and I trust that whenever the Government adds to the members of the Executive Council the Minister for Local Government will be included.</P>

      <P>I have felt from the very beginning the great embarrassment of not having some party leader in this House.  As matters stand, no one knows exactly what a particular Minister wants.  There is no one to decide.  Ministers themselves are obliged to leave their other duties to come to this House and sit here in a very awkward position in order to give their views occasionally as to what they mean.  I do not think such a course is dignified or is very suitable for Ministers themselves.</P>
      <P>I think it would be very much better if we had a leader in this House.  The result of not having such a leader is just as I prophesied, that the Chairman of this Assembly is in two positions whether he likes it or not.  He is in the position of an ordinary Chairman and he is also a sort of leader of the House, giving advice and doing things which an ordinary Chairman would not do because there is nobody else to do them.  I do not think it is convenient; I think it would be better if the Minister could take his place in this House, as is done in the other Dominions and in every country that I know of.  I suggest that this ought to be arranged by some means.  I am not going to vote against this Bill.</P>

      <P>I was rather taken aback by the onslaught of Senator Bennett.  If this Bill is a Coercion Bill it is probably the shortest Coercion Bill that was ever drafted.  It consists simply of one section: &ldquo;The Constitution <Col N="154" /> shall be and is hereby amended by the deletion from Article 51 thereof of the words &lsquo;not more than seven&rsquo; and the insertion in that Article of the words &lsquo;not more than twelve&rsquo; in lieu of the said words so deleted.&rdquo;  I do not think the Executive Council or the Dáil thought that that constituted a sinister attack on the rights of Senators.  I doubt if Senator Bennett thought it either, but, by pretending to think it, he was able to ventilate his views on the desirability in the abstract of Senator-Ministers, and I congratulate him upon his success in doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sole principle of this Bill is whether it is desirable to have a maximum for the membership of the Executive Council of seven; whether it is not desirable to give a discretionary elasticity to the President up to a maximum of 12.  Now we think that each succeeding President should be free, in the circumstances which he finds confronting him&mdash;political exigency and so on&mdash;to decide just how much of the sphere of administration he would take into the Executive Council as a matter of collective responsibility.  The other was rigid. You had a maximum of seven and any posts beyond that were to be filled by a Committee of the Dáil with extern Ministers.  This extern Minister idea, let me say frankly, has not just proved all that we believed it might.  Much was said at the time when that idea was mooted, in the Constitution, as to the desirability of mitigating some of the rigidity of the party system, of allowing certain matters to be the subject of free non-party discussion in the assembly, in the country and so on. The difficulty, in practice, has been that all these departments radiate into the sphere of collective responsibility in the matter of finance, and, finance being a very important consideration in the administration of any department, the single responsibility idea of the extern Minister, is very much more a matter of theory than of fact.  No extern Minister could get along without the hard cash.  For the hard cash he had to turn to the Minister for Finance and when he does that the whole question becomes essentially and fundamentally a matter of collective <Col N="155" /> rather than single responsibility, so that, we are not now as enthusiastic about this experiment of the extern Minister, with his single responsibility, as some of us were before the matter had been worked out in practice.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not purport to abolish it.  It simply asks for discretionary elasticity for the President, on his election, as to the number of persons he would like to have in the Executive Council and the number of departments he would like to make matters of collective responsibility.  The maximum of course is twelve.  It might be eight or nine or ten according to his judgment of the requirements of his political situation.  Nothing would be gained by making a forecast.  It would be, of course, idle, but if this Bill passes, each President, after his election, would be quite free to decide whether he would have as many as twelve Ministers or how many he would have.  That was not intended at all to touch the question of qualification or eligibility for membership of the Executive Council.  The Article bearing on that, as Senator Douglas pointed out, is Article 52.  I do not think that the general question as to who should or should not be a Minister and what the qualifications of a Minister ought to be, and so on arises on this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is of course just this relevancy that an extern Minister, according to the Constitution, need not necessarily be a member of the Dáil, for that matter he need not necessarily be a member of the Oireachtas; so far as I am aware, he might be any citizen. This Bill is not in any direct or specific way an encroachment on the rights of Senators as Senator Bennett seemed to think.  He referred with indignation to the fact that the Dáil had set up a Committee.</P>

      <P>It is a Bill to increase the maximum from 7 to 12, but the complaint about the Dáil setting up a Committee is scarcely well founded. The Dáil set up a Committee of the Dáil.  It could not very well set up a Committee of the Seanad.  That Committee was set up, after the Bill was introduced, for the better and more detailed consideration of this series of Bills.  It was a Committee of the House in which the Bills had been introduced. If the Seanad would like to give more careful consideration to these Bills, it is open to it to set up a Committee.  I would be very glad to come before that Committee and give that kind of exposition and explanation of the Bills that was given to the Committee of the Dáil.  So really coming back to what the Bill does effect as distinct from what it does not effect, it is simply a proposal to leave to any President after his election a discretion and elasticity as to the number of Departments he would care to make matters of collective responsibility; the number of Ministers he would like to have in that political group round the President which stands or falls as a group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators know the extern Minister position.  If an extern Minister is defeated in the Dáil on some important Departmental measures, he goes down alone.  If the Executive Council is defeated and goes down, the extern Minister stands.  The President should be free to judge his position and to decide how many departments he will take collective responsibility for; how many individuals he will snowball round him as a political group, as an executive council, which stands or falls as a group.  That is the proposal in this Bill, to leave him a freer hand, not to <Col N="157" /> maintain this rigid maximum of seven, but to leave it to each succeeding President to say how far he will go in the matter of collective responsibility, and how many Ministers he will call into the political group immediately around him.</P>

      <P>I wish to bring under the Minister's notice a difficulty that has arisen in practice in connection with the working of the Public Bodies Order with regard to the striking of a rate for a financial year. Under the Order the estimate for expenditure on roads has to be considered and decided at least one month before the end of the year.  At the time a council has no knowledge of other charges for poor law, mental homes and general county services.  It is asked to strike a rate for roads, representing a very considerable sum, while it has no knowledge of its total liabilities.  From the financial point of view that is grotesque.  I know there is a feeling that whatever the wealth may be the cost of the services must predominate and a certain standard must be provided. That reminds me of the saying of a well-known literary gentleman, whom I met only once, that we should all live at the rate of £10,000 a year.</P>
      <P>The position of these councils is that they have restricted and diminishing resources and must cut their coats according to their cloth.  The only thing they can cut is expenditure on roads.  The other expenditure is statutory or mandatory so that any retrenchment the county council may desire to make must fall on the roads. If the Public Bodies Order is to be carried out what the county councils are driven to do is to make a nominal estimate, by striking a conservative rate, which is possibly totally inadequate but may be increased later when the total liabilities are known. That is a very unbusinesslike arrangement, and I would like some assurance from the Minister that the matter will receive his attention.  All it leads to is friction between the superior Olympic authorities in Dublin and those on the ground floor.  As the Minister knows there is quite enough friction already. Where the causes can be removed, I hope that will be done.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment to Section 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete the sub-sections (5) and (6).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The effect of this section, if retained in the Bill, is that the agricultural grant will be distributed equally on agricultural land over the entire county, and not, as heretofore, by different rates in each rural district.  The Local Government Act of 1898 made this grant in consideration of the occupying tenants assuming liability for the landlord's portion of the poor rate and county cess.  It was calculated for each union or rural district on the basis of the rate actually levied in the year 1897, which was known as the standard year.  For more than a quarter of a century the ratepayers of each rural district have been allowed, off their gross payments in respect of rates, the amount of the agricultural grant allotted to the particular rural district in which their holding was situate.  In the different rural districts of each county the grant varied considerably. The sub-sections provide for a flat rate for the whole county and will do a serious injustice to many ratepayers by reducing the amount of their agricultural grant.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that under Section 55 of the Local Government Act, 1898, it is provided that rents fixed by the Land Commission should be on the assumption that there was no increase or diminution of the standard year rates; that the landlord was to get the benefit of the agricultural grant in respect of the poor rate, and the tenant of the county cess.  Tenants have since purchased their holdings on the basis of rents so fixed, and the annuities payable by them under the Land Purchase Acts have been calculated on the assumption that the agricultural grants would not be varied. I do not think it is good policy to tamper with the agricultural grant as solemnly fixed by the Act of 1898.  If it is done it will be a substantial grievance. It is difficult to understand why it is now proposed to alter an arrangement so long in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plea may be one of simplifying the applotment of the rates and saving <Col N="160" /> clerical work.  If that is so, it is not a sufficient reason for reducing the grant to the ratepayers.  As the agricultural grant is now double, the grievance will be still greater.  I instance a few cases where rural districts will lose in respect of agricultural grants.  In County Cork, Castletownbere rural district will lose 1/10 in the £.  That will have to be made up by an increase of a similar amount on other rates.  The rural district of Schull will lose 1/8½ in the £, Bantry 9½d., Cork 9d., Skibbereen 6½d.  Senators will notice that these are the poorest districts in the county. In County Donegal, Glenties rural district will be heavily hit if the section is retained in the Bill.  In County Galway the grant will be reduced in Clifden and Oughterard; and in County Mayo, Belmullet district will be hardly hit.  In County Tipperary the districts of Nenagh and Thurles will lose, and in Roscommon, Carrick-on-Shannon No. 2 rural district.  I hope Senators will satisfy themselves before passing this section that it is not going to do a great injustice to ratepayers in particular districts.</P>

      <P>An important point in this Bill came before the Poor Law Commission, which has not yet reported. The question was whether we should have regard to the circumstances of poorer districts.  The Government grants are at present distributed on a proportionate rate without having any regard to the wealth of a district.  It is obviously only just, that some regard should be had to the wealth of a district in distributing a grant from the Central Fund.  I think we should pause before passing the section, as poorer districts find it very hard to meet the burden imposed upon them for the public services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Linehan has made a very full exposition of the case.  He suggested that the section was intended to simplify applotment of the rate.  That could not have been the intention, as Section 5 retains an arrangement for separate applotment of the rate in each rural district.  In my opinion, all the charges in each <Col N="161" /> county should be county charges.  This Bill does not recognise that essential proposition.  The Bill recognises certain charges as district charges, and others as county charges.  As Senator Linehan has pointed out, all these charges were based on the actual expenditure in the standard year.  If you segregate from the particular locality the amount of relief they are entitled to under the Act, and if you give them lesser relief while continuing the burden, you are doing them a grave injustice.  While it is hard to arouse enthusiasm in the Seanad for local charges I feel, from the case Senator Linehan has so strongly put, that the House cannot fail to agree to the amendment.  Take the case of a locality that was getting relief to the extent of 2s. 4d. in the £.  Under the Bill that locality would only get 1s.  It will suffer a loss of 1s. 4d., although under the Bill all the other charges are to be continued.  I strongly support the amendment, and I urge the Government to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is in force at present.  Heretofore, before the abolition of rural district councils, the agricultural grant was apportioned to each district separately and in proportion to the expenditure in each district. As the expenditure varied in each district it was only right that its portion of the agricultural grant should vary also.  Now, since the abolition of the rural district councils, all these charges are made county charges, with the exception of those on labourers' cottages, which are discretionary.  All other charges, such as poor law charges, road maintenance, and public health charges, are county-at-large charges now.  There would be no justification, <Col N="162" /> where the expenditure in each particular district is the same, for not having the agricultural grant apportioned to each district equally.  The natural effect of the amendment would be that the agricultural grant, instead of being confined, as it is, to agricultural land, would be applied equally to agricultural land and other hereditaments, and it would have an effect altogether different to that at which it is aimed. There is justification for the revision of the whole policy with regard to the agricultural grant which is founded on a somewhat archaic basis.</P>

      <P>The amendment seeks to repeal sub-section 1 of Section 96 of the Local Government Act, 1898.  In that section the county councils are bound, after making the rate, to send a copy to each board of guardians in the district. Now that there are no boards of guardians it will be impossible and unnecessary for them to do so, but, under the Adaption of Enactments Act, the Minister has adapted that section and he is proposing that, in lieu of sending it to the board of guardians, it is to be sent to one of the Civic Guard stations in each public health district.  I have been informed by people who ought to know that it is an unnecessary expense, namely, to make a second complete copy of the rate book in each county for the purpose of sending it to one of the Civic Guard stations in each public health district.  In the case of County Cork I am told that it would mean more than £500 expense.  I think it is unnecessary but if the Minister thinks that it is necessary I will not press the amendment.</P>

Before the passing of the last Act, provision was made in every rural district council to enable the rate book applying to that particular district <Col N="163" /> to be shown to the ratepayers on application.  In adapting the Act we inserted the Civic Guard barracks instead. It is not a matter on which we stand very firmly as to whether the provision should be continued.

Anybody who really wants to have particulars of the rates can go to the county council, but it is very seldom that they are wanted.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Immediately before Section 12 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  In this section the expressions <Col N="164" />&ldquo;The Commissioner&rdquo; and &ldquo;new building&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;valuation&rdquo; have the same meaning as in the preceding section; the word &ldquo;tenement&rdquo; means any rateable tenement or hereditament; and the expression &ldquo;the exemption period&rdquo; when used in relation to a tenement the valuation of which has been increased means either a period of five years from the date of such increase or the period from such date to the next date on which a general revision of valuation in an area in which such tenement is situate becomes effective, whichever of such periods is the shorter.</P>
    <P>(2)  This section shall apply to every building except the following, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) Houses erected under the Labourers (Ireland) Acts, 1883 to 1919.</P>
    <P>(b) Houses erected under the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Acts, 1890 to 1921.</P>
    <P>(c) Houses in respect of which grants are made under the Housing Acts, 1925 and 1926.</P>
    <P>(d) Buildings which are new buildings.</P>
    <P>(3) This section shall apply to any increase in the valuation of a tenement, not forming part of a general revision of valuation in an area including such tenement, on an application for the revision of such valuation by reason of the erection, enlargement or improvement of a building to which this section applies which is included in such tenement, which erection, enlargement or improvement has been begun and completed during the period from the passing of this Act to the 1st day of October, 1930.</P>
    <P>(4) Where an increase to which this section applies is made in the valuation of any tenement, the valuation of such tenement shall, for the purposes of the assessment and levying of any rate raised by a local authority for the service of any local financial year commencing during the exemption period, be deemed to be reduced to either</P>
    <P>(a) the valuation of such tenement immediately before the making of such increase, or</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> (b) one-third of such valuation as so increased,</P>
    <P>whichever of such amounts is the greater; and any reduction in the valuation of such tenement which under Section 69 of the Principal Act or this section has, previous to the making of such increase, been deemed to be made for the purposes of the assessment and levying of rates for the service of any local financial year, shall be made for the same purposes in the valuation determined under this sub-section after the making of such increase.</P>
    <P>(5) The Commissioner shall determine whether any increase in the valuation of a tenement made after the passing of this Act and not forming part of a general revision of valuation in an area including such tenement was so made on an application for the revision of such valuation by reason of the erection, enlargement or improvement of a building to which this section applies which is included in such tenement, and such decision shall be indicated by the Commissioner on the appropriate revised valuation list, and as so indicated shall be final and conclusive and not subject to any appeal.</P>
    <P>(6) Where an increase to which this section applies is made in the valuation of any tenement and at the time of or after the making of such increase a separate valuation is assigned by the Commissioner to a portion of such tenement not previously valued separately, the valuation of such portion immediately before the making of such increase shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to have been an amount bearing to the total valuation of such tenement then in force the same proportion as the valuation of such portion after such separate valuation bears to the total valuation of all the component parts of such tenement after such separate valuation.</P>
    <P>(7) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (5) of this section any doubt, dispute or question which shall arise as to whether an increase in the valuation of any tenement is an increase to which this section applies, or as to the duration of the <Col N="166" /> exemption period for any tenement shall be decided by the Circuit Court on an application by any person interested, and such decision shall be final and conclusive and not subject to any appeal and any amendments which may be necessary to give effect to such a decision shall be made in the rate books and demand notes for rates.</P>
    <P>(8) Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1925 shall have effect in relation to any tenement the valuation of which is deemed to be reduced under this section for the purposes of the assessment and levying of rates as it has effect in respect of a new building under Section 69 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>This amendment is really a reconstruction of Section 11 as it stands in the Bill.  As it stands, the object of that section is to extend the relief given by Section 69 of the Local Government Act, 1925, to persons who have either erected a new building or substantially improved or enlarged an existing building.  The object of Section 69 of the Act of 1925 was to encourage building in the shape of new buildings and the improvement of existing buildings, with consequential benefit to the country and the giving of employment.  The effect of that section was that where a person erected, or substantially improved, a building he only paid one-third of the increased valuation over a period of seven years. The section, however, only applied to buildings which were either erected or improved, that is, begun to be erected or improved after the 1st April, 1920, and which were completed before the 1st April, 1927.  The Act of 1925, therefore, only gave two years for the operation of Section 69.  That was found to be quite inadequate.  I am afraid that the public really never understood the benefit they would get in the shape of reduced rates under that section, but, be that as it may, the object of Section 11 in the existing Bill, which is now before us, is to extend the period during which this beneficial reduction in rates will take place and also to do away with the defects which have been found to arise.  There were two defects in Section 69 of the Act of 1925.  The first defect was that <Col N="167" /> the period was too short, and the second was that it might mean, in the case of substantial improvement, that the local authority would get a smaller amount of rates during the seven years, that is, that one-third of the new valuation, provided by Section 69 of the Act of 1925, might be less than the old valuation, and the local authority might suffer in the diminution of the amount that the rates produced.  That last effect under Section 69 of the Act of 1925 had a curious result.  The Act only relieved in a case where the enlargement or improvement was substantial, and the question of whether an improvement or an enlargement of an existing building was substantial arose in practically every case, and where there was a dispute about whether an improvement or enlargement was substantial it led to an appeal to the Minister under Section 69, and, very probably, with the laudable object of not allowing the local authority to get less from the new building, or the improved building, during the seven years, the Minister always decided that an improvement or enlargement was not substantial unless practically it increased the valuation by something like 100 and sometimes 200 per cent. That, of course, was very unsatisfactory because it hit the small man.  It did not matter so much to a person who was making a very large improvement running into thousands of pounds, in an existing building, but the small man who wanted to enlarge his shop, or enlarge the factory in which he was working, found himself very badly hit because the Minister decided that the improvement which he had made was not substantial and that, therefore, he was not entitled to get a reduction under Section 69. Clause 11, as it stands in this Bill, remedies, to some extent, one of these defects; that is to say, it extends the date for erecting and improving a building until the 1st April, 1930.  That is, the house would have to be erected and finished, or the improvement or enlargement made, between the present date and the 1st April, 1930.  That only gives three summers, and practically the summer is the time that building goes on fastest and best.  Therefore, one of the <Col N="168" /> amendments that appears in the new section which I am now moving to insert in this Bill is that that period until 1st April, 1930, should be extended until 30th October, 1930, and so giving them a fourth summer for building.  To that, I understand, there will be no objection.  But Clause 11, as it stands in the Bill, did not remedy the defect. It leaves the case of the substantial improvement just where it was, and it would lead to the same result.  Nobody who had not made an improvement which increased the valuation to this very great extent would get the benefit of the section.</P>
    <P>The amendment that I am moving is, perhaps, not a perfect solution of the difficulty.  I do not think it is, but at any rate it is the best solution that I have been able to arrive at.  Of course the simplest way would have been to say that in the case of anybody who built a new house, or substantially improved an old one, the owner would pay on the old valuation for a period of, say, five years.  That would be perfectly simple and would require very little working out.  However, there were certain objections to that, and what this amendment does is to make the valuation on the enlarged or improved building during five years one-third of the increase.  That does not injure the local authorities.  There is no loss of rate.  In fact, there must be a gain, and it is a very substantial relief.  I have stated that this is the effect of the amendment I am going to make because I am going to ask the House to allow me to alter sub-clause 4. Sub-clause 3 reads:</P>
    <P>This section shall apply to any increase in the valuation of a tenement, not forming part of a general revision of valuation in an area including such tenement, on an application for the revision of such valuation by reason of the erection, enlargement or improvement of a building to which this section applies which is included in such tenement, which erection, enlargement or improvement has been begun and completed during the period from the passing of this Act to the 1st day of October, 1930.</P>
    <P>That gives four summers.</P>

      <P>Then I ask to delete the words</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to either</P>
      <P>(a) the valuation of such tenement immediately before the making of such increase, or</P>
      <P>(b) one-third of such valuation as so increased,</P>
      <P>whichever of such amounts is the greater,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and insert in lieu thereof &ldquo;by two-thirds of such increase.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the same sub-clause as a matter of drafting the word &ldquo;determined&rdquo; in the last line but one would be better &ldquo;reduced.&rdquo;  That is to say, substitute &ldquo;reduced&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;determined.&rdquo; The object of clause 6 as it stands, and as I hope it will stand, is to apply for the apportionment of the valuation of a tenement only a part of which has been built on and is separately valued.  You have to work the valuation of the rest of it in connection with the new and separate value which has been put on a small part.  That requires apportionment of the valuation. It was considered that it was worked out by sub-clause 6 as it originally stood, but it has not stood the test of working out and, accordingly, I would ask to delete the last three lines beginning with the words &ldquo;the same proportion.&rdquo; Then it will read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an increase to which this section applies is made in the valuation of any tenement and at the time of or after the making of such increase a separate valuation is assigned by the Commissioner to a portion of such tenement not previously valued separately, the valuation of such portion immediately before <Col N="170" /> the making of such increase shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to have been an amount bearing to the total valuation of such tenement then in force such proportion as shall be determined by the Commissioner who shall indicate such determination on the appropriate revised valuation, and such determination as so indicated shall be final and conclusive and not subject to appeal.</P>
    <P>That is, the Commissioner is taking the burden of doing this technical apportionment of the rates between the different parts of this tenement.  It is a technical thing and it is a question of fact which might be very safely left to the Commissioner.  If the House would give me leave to alter the wording of my amendment in the way I have indicated I beg to move it.</P>

      <P>I want to know does the Senator persist in carrying out, under this amendment, what was carried out under the amendment to the Local Government Bill of 1925.  You remember when this amendment, which embodies the principle which we are discussing under the present Bill with regard to the remission of rates on buildings, was sprung on us I called, the Senator's attention to the fact that he was doing an injustice to people who were inhabitants of working-class dwellings.  He stated at the time that as the local authorities were the ratepaying people that they would be paying rates to themselves and that the matter did not affect them.  I went, at great length, at the time, to point out to the Senator that that was not the position, so far at least as Dublin is concerned.  The local authorities are not paying rates to themselves.  The tenants in possession are becoming the owners and they are paying rates and are responsible for the maintenance of the houses.  No doubt the argument will be put forward that these houses were built under subsidies and that the tenants are getting the benefit of the subsidies, but houses that were built by speculative builders and private individuals are in the same position.  They also got subsidies under the Housing Acts of 1924 and 1925 and they got a remission of rates for twenty years.  So we are doing a grave injustice to the poorest class of the community; the people who can afford least to pay are being made to pay the full rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is exactly this: The Minister for Local Government and Public Health is aware, no doubt, of the fact that in the case of houses built in the city under the Housing Acts for the last few years, rents are not fixed but the tenant has to pay a certain amount representing the purchase price and the rates of the house.  When the tenant enters a house built by the municipality he has to sign a lease and pay a fee for the signing of the lease.  These tenants are becoming <Col N="172" /> owners of the houses.  They are responsible for the full maintenance of the house.  They are the purchasers of the house by weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly instalments.  In addition, if they are paying weekly they pay more for the expenses of collection.  I want the Seanad clearly to understand that the tenants of these houses are the owners and that they are responsible for the rates just as they are responsible for the maintenance.  I say that it is unfair if we are going to have legislation whereby people get the benefit of reduced rates from new houses, to take a class of the community that can least afford to pay increased rates and deprive them of the benefits you are giving to every other section of the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also aware that the rents fixed, or at least the weekly instalments of the purchase price of houses, such as those built in Marino, are as high as 17/3 in some cases.  They range from 14/- to 17/3, and the result is that the tenants are not able to pay. If he consults the responsible authorities in the municipality of Dublin he will find that in a large number of cases tenants of the working class type are not able to pay these rents.  They cannot afford to pay such a high rent. Heretofore, professors of economics and people who studied the position were of opinion that one-eighth of the income or wages of the working class, was the quota that should be allowable for rent. That was about the sum that should be taken from the weekly earnings for rent, and if you reduce the wages of these people to £2 11s., as they have done, how can you expect these men to be honest and compel them to pay 17/3 a week rent?  I am not introducing this to have a discussion on the whole question of working class houses, but I pointed out to Senator Brown on the day he introduced that amendment that it was doing a grave injustice to these people.  The House would not accept my view and there was another provision inserted.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to Senator Brown that he should now delete sub-clause (b) in sub-section 2 of the new section. I think the Seanad will admit that in equity the same treatment should be given all round.  As I have pointed <Col N="173" /> out, building speculators have got subsidies, and in addition they got a remission of rates for twenty years. People who were in a position to take advantage of these Housing Acts got a subsidy of £100 from the local authority and £100 from the State. These people got a subsidy of £200 and they also got a remission of the rates. I think it is unfair to other people who can least afford to pay, if this benefit is given to new houses, that they will not get the same advantages.</P>

      <P>I think the point raised by Senator Farren should be very carefully looked into.  I understand the reason why, under Section 11, these houses were excluded was, that they already had got an exemption from rates.  The only reason was that they had already got the privilege.  I am not an authority on the subject and I would be glad if the Minister could let us know if that is the case.  As far as new buildings are concerned, if they were built under these Acts they can be exempted.  Even though a house built under one of these Acts has already got exemption as a new house, if that house is enlarged I for the life of me cannot see why it should not get the benefit conferred by this section. There is a case under Section 11, assuming that they had already got reduction in rates, for another reduction in respect of any enlargement.</P>

      <P>That is true to a great extent, but all these houses had a very generous grant given to them when they were being built, and if you put in a provision of this kind it will only be an illusory advantage, because it is the rating authority built the houses in these cases.  They gave the maximum reduction to the tenants that they could, and if you insist on a reduction of the rates now it will only mean that it will increase the rent.</P>

      <P>They pay weekly, quarterly, monthly or annually, and if they are in a position to do it they deposit a sum of £60 or £100 down.  My point is that the sum that has to be paid weekly, monthly, quarterly or annually by these tenants is made up of so much ground rent, so much rates, so much off the purchase price of the house.  All these factors enter into it and they pay in proportion to them. The rate is paid on the valuation which <Col N="175" /> is specifically set out in the amount. The rates are paid on the valuation of the house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move for leave to introduce this Bill.  It is a very short Bill and it deals with two forms of cruelty to which wild birds are at present subjected.  One of these is the using of live decoy birds for the catching of other birds, the using of maimed birds for the same purpose, and the using of birdlime and other substances of that kind for the taking of birds. The second form of cruelty, which is still unpunishable in this country, is the keeping of birds in cages so small that they have not room for flapping their wings.  In 1925 an Act was passed by the British Parliament making these two forms of cruelty illegal. A similar Bill is at present before the Northern Parliament.  This Bill only asks us to bring our law into conformity with the law in Great Britain. I may state that the Bill is the result of a deputation which went to the Minister three or four weeks ago.

      <P>With regard to the motions by Senator Douglas and Senator O'Farrell respecting amendments to the Standing Orders, I suggest that instead of discussing them now they should be referred to the Committee on Procedure for report.  They both deal with matters in the Standing Orders that I think it is very desirable should be dealt with, but in the form in which they stand we could not possibly accept or pass them, and I will tell you why.  There is a provision in the Constitution that every matter in either House must be determined by a majority, and that in the event of an equality of votes the presiding officer is to have a casting vote.  That manifestly assumes that every matter is to be decided by a bare majority.  Consequently <Col N="180" /> any proposition to alter the majority to two-fifths, three-fifths or two-thirds would seem to be a breach of the Constitution.  The first portion of Senator Douglas's proposal would not be out of order, but where it goes on to say that if the Chairman is satisfied that it is a case of urgent necessity he may, with the assent of 30 members, do so and so, it is different.  Very often there would not be thirty members in the House, and in such a case it would not be a question of the vote of any majority at all, and it would be almost impossible to pass it, because we have only sixty members, and if it were to be a bare majority you never could pass anything in a full House except with the casting vote of the Chairman.  So that the matter is clearly one that requires consideration.  Then, coming to Senator O'Farrell's motion, the difficulty is this, that while the general principle is, I think, quite sound, it omits to consider special urgent cases.  First of all it omits altogether the case of Senators.  Senators should not be deprived of the right of communicating certain facts to the House through the Chairman.  For example, take Senator Dowdall's absence to-day.  If this Standing Order were in operation I could not have communicated his message.  I do not think it is intended by the Senator to apply this to members of the House, but in its present form it would so apply.</P>

      <P>No, but I suggest that the Committee should also consider that two of our Standing Orders are repugnant to the Constitution.  Article 25 reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Sittings of each House of the Oireachtas shall be public.  In cases of special emergency either House may hold a private sitting with the assent of two-thirds of the members present.&rdquo;  Our Standing Order 44 provides that we can exclude the Press with the assent of a bare majority. Article 22 of the Constitution says:&mdash;&ldquo;All matters in each House shall, save as otherwise provided by this Constitution, be determined by a majority of the votes of the members present other than the Chairman or presiding member,&rdquo; whilst our Standing Order 76 says:&mdash;&ldquo;Should a Senator wish to suspend a Bill initiated in the Dáil he may, upon the motion for the Second Stage of the Bill, or upon the motion for the Fifth Stage, move &ldquo;That the Bill do come up for consideration in ... time,&rdquo; setting out any space of time not exceeding two hundred and fifty days from the date on which the Bill was first sent to the Seanad.  The second part of the Standing Order reads:&mdash;&ldquo;Should a Bill be suspended in this way it may be revived for consideration before the expiration of the time of suspension on a motion of which seven clear days' notice has been given, with the consent of two-thirds of the Senators present and voting.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Both those matters have been present to my mind. In fact, my attention was called to them some two weeks ago by our Clerk.  However, we have had no meeting of the Committee in the interval. When the Committee meets it will have to consider not only the matters on the Agenda but a number of other matters. However, the immediate question is whether you think it more desirable to refer these two proposed new Standing Orders for Report to the Committee on Procedure.</P>

      <P>My reason for putting <Col N="182" /> down the amendment was that there might be some discussion.  I intended to suggest that it should be referred to the Committee on Procedure but it seems to me that where Senators feel that there should be a change in the Standing Orders, particularly those Senators who are not members of the Committee on Procedure, it is proper and desirable to put down a proposal. I agree that they should go before the Committee, but I think in a matter which involves considerable amendment, such as the one I have moved, and, to a considerable extent, that proposed by Senator O'Farrell, it is well that the Committee should have some idea as to the wishes of the House before they consider it.  The details and the working out of it should be considered by the House.  The reason I put it down is because I think some little time might be spent upon the matter by the House so that the Committee could frame a Standing Order to meet the wishes of the House.</P>
      <P>With reference to your point as to its being constitutional or not, I based my motion on Standing Order 29, which provides that motions can only be rescinded with the written assent of so many members, but I was under the impression&mdash;I bow to your ruling on the matter&mdash;that there was nothing to prevent the assent being required of so many members before it was actually accepted by the Chairman. I agree that when the House-meets a bare majority must decide the issue, but I put this forward to be considered by the Committee.  I did not think there was anything in the Constitution to require the written assent of so many members of the House before a motion is considered.</P>

      <P>I thought it meant this&mdash;I may have taken it up wrong&mdash;that before I could allow a motion to suspend Standing Orders to be moved without notice I should ask whether the motion had the support of twenty Senators.  I think that would be evading the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to that I accept that view and the word &ldquo;written&rdquo; can be introduced to meet the point, I mention it, not for the <Col N="183" /> sake of arguing it, but that the Committee might consider that as a way of meeting it.  I feel there should be a proper and regular method of suspending the Standing Orders with notice so that every Senator will know that it is proposed to put a Bill through so many stages on a day and that it should be as difficult as is reasonably possible to suspend Standing Orders without notice.  That is really my argument in a nutshell.  On one occasion recently we had a Bill which no Senators other than those actually present, and there were only twenty or less present, knew was going to be put through all its stages.  Not a single Senator received <Col N="184" /> formal notice that it was coming.  My point is that it is not desirable to suspend Standing Orders, but if it is necessary there should be notice given, and if there is not notice the suspension of Standing Orders should be made exceedingly difficult.</P>
