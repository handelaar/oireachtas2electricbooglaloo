      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;(1)  Every woman to whom this section applies who is qualified and liable to serve as a juror in any administrative county or county borough shall be entitled, if she so desires, to be entered in the register of electors for the registration area comprising such administrative county or county borough as exempt from serving as a juror and while so entered shall be exempted from so serving.</P>
      <P>(2)  This section applies to unmarried women and to widows, and also to married women whose husbands are qualified and liable to serve as jurors in the same administrative county or county borough as that in which such women are themselves so qualified and liable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is only following up the amendment which we passed on the last day.  I now leave it as a matter for the House itself to decide.</P>

      <P>The Senator's amendment is following up the amendment that he moved and that was accepted by the Seanad in Committee when the word &ldquo;male&rdquo; was deleted in Section 3. As the Bill now stands women are prima facie qualified and liable for jury service.  The present amendment, copied from the 1924 Act, enables women to seek exemption if they so desire.  If this amendment is carried the Senator will propose to delete Section 16 by amendment 5 standing in his name. The effect and the net result of that <Col N="970" /> would be to preserve the position created by the 1924 Act.  My proposals, the official proposals, to deal with the question are contained in amendments 3, 4 and 6.  Amendment No. 2, by the way, is a mistake and will not be moved.  But my proposals bearing on this question are contained in 3, 4 and 6.  Taken together these amendments in conjunction with the proposed new form for the first schedule give the women and other classes conditional exemption.  That is, they will be regarded as exempt in the first instance, and they will be at liberty under the new form to apply to be placed on the jurors' list for jury service. There is no radical difference between the two except under the official proposals the cost and trouble of putting the women's names on the draft list in the first instance is avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Senator's proposal many women's names would have to be inserted in the draft list only to be deleted at a later stage.  My other objection is that it throws the onus on women to seek exemption, and our experience of the 1924 Act is that women who desire exemption very frequently omit to take the positive steps to secure exemption and wreak their wrath upon the court officials and the judges when they get their summons for jury service, subsequently.  They neglect to take the necessary steps to secure exemption and the result is that various panels are to a considerable extent deprived of their effectiveness because the names of women appear on those panels.  Those women are exempted in court by the judge when they appear and make sufficient trouble there to secure exemption.  Under my proposal, peace commissioners, doctors and other classes, including women, will not have their names put on the jurors list but it will be possible for any individual member of this class to have his or her name entered on the list on application.  Now reading back over the proceedings when the 1924 Act was under consideration I made the interesting discovery that what I am now proposing was in fact the proposal of the women themselves in 1924, and that that proposal was rejected by the then Attorney-General, the <Col N="971" /> present Chief Justice.  Speaking in the Dáil on March 13th, 1924, he referred to the Women's Organisation, and so on and then he said:&mdash;&ldquo;I discussed this matter with two or three of these deputations, and I understood from them that they would be willing, for the present at any rate, to have a provision by which only women who applied to be put on jury lists should be put on.  That does not appeal to me because I do not think it would get the average woman;&rdquo; and he goes on to develop his ground of objection.</P>
    <P>What I am stressing now is that this proposal of mine was in fact the proposal put forward by the Women's Organisation in 1924, a proposal which was rejected at the time by the Attorney-General for reasons which he deemed sufficient when the matter was discussed. Well, the Attorney-General's preference, speaking of the Attorney-General of 1924, is a preference which was given statutory form; it has been tried and, I suggest, stands condemned on the administrative experience which it has got since 1924.  The idea was that the women possessing rateable qualifications should be entered on the jury list and that there would be automatic exemption for any who applied. The theory underlying that was that by that machinery you would eliminate the reluctant woman juror.  It has not happened in the past, and I submit it will not happen in the future.  What has happened is this: You put on all the women&mdash;100 per cent.&mdash;who possessed the necessary rateable qualifications, and about 60 per cent., perhaps a little more, apply for exemption.  And then of the balance, three-fourths turn up in court in response to their jury summons in a state of frenzied indignation and wreak that indignation on the court officials, the judges and everyone else, in a protest against the idea of their being expected to perform that function and duty.  So that the 1924 Act is not working out as it was hoped it would work out.  It has not resulted in the elimination of the unwilling woman juror, leaving only the balance who are perfectly prepared to perform that duty.  It has been unnecessarily <Col N="972" /> expensive and unnecessarily troublesome, and I submit it is a sounder and a saner thing to adopt the proposal which the women themselves made in 1924, namely, to exempt them as a class.</P>
    <P>Give a prima facie exemption to a class, leaving individuals within the class who feel that, without any particular inconvenience to themselves or anyone else, they could undertake the duty, to notify that willingness on their part to the appropriate officer and thus procure the inclusion of their names in the list.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that, while a good deal has been talked and written about this subject, no one in this House has proposed to return to the Act of 1919.  People talked as if they were going to do it, and then they did not do it.  I think there is a general recognition in both Houses that the Act of 1919 is not a practicable proposition; that it was right to depart from it, and departing from it the question arises as to the degree of that departure. There is really no question or principle as between Senator Sir Edward Bigger's amendment and the position I am taking up.  There is the question only of administrative convenience and experience, and I suggest that on that ground I have it all the way.  I submit it is a more sensible thing to ask that the small minority amongst the class that is willing to take service should take the positive step of notification, than to ask the 90 per cent. who are unwilling, to take the positive step of seeking exemption.  That is the issue really which Senators have to decide.  My proposals are embodied in amendments 3, 4, and 6, and I submit they are proposals that ought to commend themselves to the Senate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>16. &mdash;(1)  Any person qualified and liable to serve as a juror but exempt from so serving by reason only of being included amongst the persons mentioned in Part II. of the First Schedule to this Act may apply in any year at the time mentioned in this section to the county registrar for the area co-terminous with or including (as the case may be) the jury district in respect of which he is so qualified and liable that his name be inserted in the general lists of jurors or the draft jurors lists (as the case may require) then being revised under this Act by such county registrar, and such county registrar, if satisfied that such person is qualified and liable to serve as a juror in respect of a jury district co-terminous with or included in his area and is exempted from so serving only by reason of being included amongst the persons mentioned in Part II. of the First Schedule to this Act, shall insert in such general lists of jurors or draft jurors lists (as the case may be) the name of such person, his place of abode, his trade, profession, calling, or description and the situation, description, and rateable value of the land in respect of which he is so <Col N="974" /> qualified and liable as if he was not so exempted, and thereupon such person shall become and be qualified and liable to serve as a juror in respect of such jury district when and so long as the jurors list derived from such general lists of jurors or draft jurors list is in force.</P>
    <P>(2) Applications under this section in respect of the general lists of jurors revised in the year 1927 shall be made before the 28th day of May, 1927, and applications made under this section in respect of draft jurors lists revised in any subsequent year shall be made before the 15th day of May in such year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, if I might, I would have amendments 3, 4 and 6 taken together, because, cumulatively, they represent the scheme, and the scheme is that the Schedule is divided into two parts, I. and II.  In Part I. we place classes that we would not, for various reasons, have on jurors lists at all.  We do not propose to allow any members of the classes contained in Part I. of the Schedule to serve on juries.  In Part II. we are putting classes that we are prepared to exempt, leaving it open to individuals within these classes to notify if they are willing to undertake the burden of jury service.  We put doctors, dentists, veterinary surgeons, and people of that kind, together with women in Part II. of the Schedule, leaving each one to appreciate his own circumstances and to decide for himself or herself whether they could undertake the burden of jury service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the scheme, and Section 16 is altered to meet that.  There is an alteration in Section 16 which, instead of referring to women only, refers to the classes contained in Part II. of the Schedule.  I think it is an improvement on the Bill as originally introduced in the Dáil and into this House, and that perhaps Deputy Johnson in the other House was right when he said that the reasonableness of the thing I wanted to do was arguable, and perhaps could be established to be sound, but that the method by which we went about it was wrong.  I should think from the point of view of women and women's organisations that it is <Col N="975" /> preferable to have women set out in a portion of the Schedule together with these other classes of citizens, and to say we will exempt these classes, but if there are individuals within these classes who feel they could undertake jury service then their names will be entered on the jury lists on application. That is what is now proposed and I think it is an improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the attention of Senator Sir John Keane, Senator Barrington and Senator Sir John Griffith to this for it affects their amendments.  They proceed on the assumption that there was only one part to the Schedule.  There now will be two parts.  The House will understand that the first Schedule will contain the classes who will not have the privilege of asking to be put on.  The second part of the Schedule will include classes who are excluded and who may apply to be put on.  I want Senators who have these amendments down to state into which part of the Schedule they propose to have their amendments inserted.</P>

      <P>I notice that medical practitioners actually &ldquo;practising as such&rdquo; are exempted, but when we come to registered dentists and pharmaceutical chemists it does not state that they must be &ldquo;practising as such.&rdquo;  I think to get exemption it should be set out that they should be actually practising their profession, and they should not be automatically exempted because at some time or other they were registered.</P>

      <P>27.&mdash;Notwithstanding anything contained in this part of this Act or any repeal effected by this Act, every panel of jurors prepared after the passing of this Act, and before the 1st day of September, 1927, shall be prepared and the jurors named on such panels shall be summoned in the manner in all respects required by the law in force immediately before the passing of this Act and such law shall be deemed to continue in force so far but so far only as may be necessary for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the section inserted in Committee and to substitute therefor a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>58.&mdash;The following provisions shall have effect in every trial of a criminal issue which is tried with a jury and is prosecuted at the suit of the Attorney-General of Saorstát Eireann, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the said Attorney-General or the counsel or solicitor representing him may at the time prescribed by this Act direct without cause shown any juror who has not been challenged to stand-by and thereupon such juror shall not then be sworn of the jury;</P>
      <P>(b)  if, before or when all the jurors whose names are entered in the panel and who are liable to be called for service in the jury have been called, a jury is obtained without including the jurors who have been directed to stand-by, such last-mentioned jurors shall leave the jury-box as soon as such jury has been so obtained and no such last mentioned juror shall be included in such jury;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  if, after all the jurors whose names are entered in the panel and who are liable to be called for service <Col N="978" /> in the jury have been called, a jury is not obtained, a sufficient number of the jurors who were so directed to stand-by and are not successfully challenged under the subsequent provisions of this section, shall be sworn and included in the jury in the order in which the cards containing their names were drawn from the box;</P>
    <P>(d)  The said Attorney-General or the counsel or solicitor representing him may challenge for cause shown any juror who, having been directed to stand-by, is called to be sworn under the foregoing paragraph;</P>
    <P>(e)  Whenever a juror is challenged under the foregoing paragraph the cause shall be shown immediately upon the challenge being made and the Judge shall then allow or disallow the challenge as he shall think proper and such allowance or disallowance shall be final and conclusive;</P>
    <P>(f)  if any such challenge is so allowed, the juror so challenged shall forthwith leave the jury-box and shall not be included in the jury.</P>
    <P>This proposed new section is in fact a verbatim copy of Section 58 as it appeared in the original Bill.  The object of the amendment is to restore to the Attorney-General the unlimited right of stand-by which he possessed and which he does possess under the existing law.  This is a matter of supreme importance.  In my opinion this unlimited right of stand-by by the Attorney-General is absolutely necessary for the due and fair administration of criminal justice in this or any other country where the jury system prevails.  What happened in Committee was this: Section 58 of the Bill preserved and defined the right to stand-by as it existed before and as it exists now.  Senator Bennett proposed an amendment in Committee the effect of which was to put the Attorney-General in the same position as the accused in the matter of challenge, and to restore what the Senator described as a fair balance between the State on one side and the accused on the other.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> I will come back to the question of fair balance later on.  That amendment which abolished the unlimited right of stand-by of the Attorney-General and put him in the same position as the accused was carried by two votes in a House consisting of only seventeen of our members.  I need scarcely say that was a most unsatisfactory mode of dealing with this vital question of criminal procedure.  It only shows how important it is for members of this House to study, understand the Orders of the Day, and recognise the importance of amendments which do not seem to be important unless you study them.  It also shows the importance of members remaining here until the end of the sitting, because it happened just before the close of the sitting that this drastic amendment was carried.  Having been carried, it is necessary for me to state openly the reasons why the unlimited right of stand-by should be preserved to the Attorney-General. It must be the desire of every right-minded citizen that an accused person should get an absolutely fair trial; that is, he should be tried by jurors who are prepared to act without fear, favour or affection.  That is secured, so far as the accused is concerned, by the right of challenge.  The right of challenge has been slightly altered by the present Bill.  The number of jurors whom the accused person can now challenge peremptorily is somewhat reduced.  I think in no place can he challenge more than ten, and the ordinary number is five.</P>
    <P>The Senate should understand what the meaning of a peremptory challenge is.  A prisoner when he exercises that right need give no reason.  The juror leaves the box and cannot serve even if it were impossible without him to get a juror to carry on the case.  Therefore it means the absolute exclusion of that juror.  If he happens to exhaust that right of peremptory challenge he then has the right to challenge every other juror on the list.  If he can show to the court that a juror is not an impartial person as between the State and the accused the juror disappears.  He cannot act.  Therefore, so far as the accused is concerned there is an absolute <Col N="980" /> security that no one will be put on the jury to whom he objects and who is not, in the opinion of the court, prepared to act honestly and fairly as between the State and the prisoner.  It is true that the State has a right to stand-by; that is, that the Attorney-General or the person acting on his behalf has a right, when a juror is called, to order him to stand-by, but the Attorney-General acting for the State has no right corresponding to the peremptory challenge, because the juror ordered to stand-by only stands by; he is not excluded from the jury. On the contrary, if the jury list is exhausted and there are still vacancies on the jury, the jurors ordered to stand-by can be called again in their order.</P>
    <P>Therefore the protection for the State in this matter is nothing like so great as the protection given by our existing law and by this Bill to the accused person.  The present system embodied in this Bill works no injustice to the accused person.  Senator Bennett's argument when he persuaded the nine Senators to vote for him on the last occasion was this, that there ought to be the same sort of fair balance between the accused and the State.  There is no balance between the accused and the State.  That balance is all the other way.  All an accused person has to do is to get one juror out of twelve to take his view of the case, and that gives him the benefit of the doubt.  The State, to convict the accused, has to get the twelve men; therefore there is no balance between the two.  The balance is weighted against the State, and it is not a question of restoring the balance of fair play between the State and the accused.  I said that this unlimited right to stand-by of the Attorney-General is necessary for the due administration of criminal justice in this country.  The juror should be without fear, favour or affection. He should be without fear, and it is much easier to find the juror who is without favour than to find, in difficult and dangerous times, the juror who is without fear.  He may be a perfectly honest and fair-minded man.  He might be willing to give an honest verdict in an ordinary case, but there are times when that state of affairs does not prevail. <Col N="981" /> Civic courage is not a universal virtue in any clime.  It is not a universal virtue in this country.  I do not say we are very much worse than others, but in dangerous times civic courage is always wanting on the part of otherwise perfectly honest men.  It is not wise, fair or in the public interest to put the onus on the Government of having to challenge, for a cause, a man like that.  It is rather bringing against him a charge of not being a person who can be trusted, in dangerous times, to do his duty as between his country and the accused person.</P>
    <P>I therefore urge in the interests of the administration of justice in this country that it is absolutely necessary that this unlimited vital stand-by should be retained to the Attorney-General. This country ought to be forever grateful to the jurors who have acted on criminal cases during the difficult times we have gone through for the last three or four years.  There is no doubt that the courage and the honesty which they showed have resulted in the establishment of law and order again in this country and if that kind of juror is to be looked for and to be found in this country it is necessary that we should retain the absolute right of stand-by on the part of the Attorney-General.</P>

      <P>I rise to oppose the amendment in its present form.  Senator Brown went to considerable length and laid emphasis on the fact that the number of members in the Seanad <Col N="982" /> when the amendment was carried was small.  The amendment was served in due form and with due notice.  It appeared on the Paper and was within the cognisance of every member of the Senate.  Any Senator interested in the question of trial by jury, I submit, voted in the Senate division on that occasion.  Senator Brown, with his extensive training in argument before jury and judges, said many things here, true, and yet he emphasised those points which suit his own case and glossed over the points that were disadvantageous to the amendment he proposed.  He suggests that the proposal in the Bill is absolutely fair or more than fair to the accused.  In that suggestion he glossed over one particularly interesting fact, that the right of peremptory challenge by the accused was diminished in the most extraordinary fashion by this Bill. How was it diminished?</P>
      <P>The practice has been current in the country from which we inherit trial by jury that the prisoner has the right to challenge 35 jurors in certain cases and 20 jurors in other cases.  In any case, under this Bill the prisoner has the right to challenge no more than five peremptorily.  Mark how the right to challenge has been reduced, from 30 to 25, and now down to five, not 10, as suggested by Senator Brown.  Section 56 (2) par. (a) of this Bill sets forth the number of challenges that are allowed to the prisoner in connection with criminal issues, which are the cases we are dealing with here, not civil cases, and it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In every trial of a criminal issue .... if there is only one accused person such person may challenge without cause shown five jurors and no more.  (b) If there are two or more accused persons they may join in their challenges.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are two prisoners they can challenge ten jurors and no more.  The old constitutional practice had been that they had a right to challenge 20. Yet we are told that this is to be in accordance with the Constitution.  I would have thought that Senator Brown in his great anxiety that trial by jury should not be disparaged by <Col N="983" /> an amendment of the Seanad, would at least have read the whole Bill and compared the facts and he would have seen on reference to Section 56, which I have read, the necessity for the amendment which the Seanad passed. He suggested that the prisoner's right of peremptory challenge is not interfered with.  I ground my case in support of the amendment the Seanad passed, and against this amendment, on the one cardinal fact that the Bill takes away the right of the accused to the peremptory challenge he has hitherto had.  If Senator Brown desires a compromise as between the amendment and the provision in the Bill, I would have thought he would have found some parity of reduction as between the right of stand-by by the accused and the right of stand-by by the State.  If he suggested that we have that right now in our new State, and that we have jurors who are going to do their duty, and because we have more competent men we do not think the prisoner has any necessity for this peremptory challenge and therefore we shall wash it away, I might agree it would be a good thing to do.  In doing that I should have thought Senator Brown would have suggested that we should have limited the Crown's right of stand-by.  If we are to deprive the accused of the right of peremptory challenge I think we ought reasonably to depreciate the extent of the stand-by right to be exercised by the State. Such is not done.  Everything stands against the accused.  I say it is not right.  The State ought to suggest some reasonable compromise such as saying: &ldquo;We will only exercise the right of stand-by to the extent of 15 or 20, or to three times more or four times more than the prisoner's right of peremptory challenge.&rdquo;  I should be prepared to accept such a suggestion as that.  I urge strongly, and I do so in spite of what Senator Brown has said, that the balance is against the prisoner as compared with the constitutional practice hitherto in use.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when the Bill was in Committee, made the case that there was no limit to the number of challenges by the defendant for cause <Col N="984" /> shown.  He made that case, and it was a true case, but then he knows that there is no limit to the State either in challenges for cause shown.  It may be, I grant, that when the five men are ordered to stand by by the accused, the power to challenge them again is denied, and, therefore, what the Minister thinks is a great advantage for the defendant is no disadvantage against the State.</P>
    <P>The right of the prosecutor is greatly strengthened by this Bill, and the right of the accused is greatly diminished.  If the Government suggested it is impossible to find a jury with a sense of right, without the stand-by, then I suggest that trial by jury has failed in this country and ought to be scrapped. The State can empanel a body of men without fear, favour, or affection, even if there are fearful men, and there will be in every community.  The stand-by to the extent of 15 or 20 will surely exhaust the number.  The panel is carefully prepared; the array cannot be challenged in any way.  Senator Brown suggested that the framing of the panel cannot be challenged, because it is taken away by this Bill, and swept away even though the challenger be a partisan of the Government.  Whoever he may be, nothing can be done against the array.  I say it is in the power of the State to select the panel of men absolutely fearless, without fear, favour, or affection, in such a case as this. Therefore, I submit the amendment the Senate passed, and which it is now sought to sweep aside as if it were not the opinion of the Seanad, should not be interfered with.  This amendment ought not to be accepted.</P>
    <P>I saw it suggested that a reasonable compromise might be made limiting in some way the power of stand-by.  If so, I should be prepared to accept it. If you do not put in such a provision the old picture of Justice enthroned as an ennobling figure, with the scales evenly balanced, which to our young minds taught us many things, will be replaced by a picture of Justice enthroned with the scales still, but with the balance tilted as against the accused, and Justice will not be respected. Are we to train jurors to do their duty by branding them as sympathisers <Col N="985" /> with felons?  The way to teach them to do their duty is to show them that we trust them.  Put pour confidence in men and you will make them respect you.  Brand a man as an outlaw and he will be an outlaw.  Senator Brown smiles, but he knows in his heart that these men are free from fear, favour or affection.  Even when the panel is exhausted the resources of the State are not exhausted.  The Minister knows that there can be a change of venue, so that whatever you may say about the amendment that we tried to make, and did make, to this Bill, if you brush away that without any consideration, I say that the fountains of justice will be tainted and juries in this country must disappear, and will be given an ample cause to disappear.  I move that Senator Brown's amendment be not accepted, and I invite the Minister to make some reasonable compromise, and, if he does so, I will be prepared to accept such compromise.</P>

      <P>Senator Bennett insists upon discussing this amendment with reference to the question of the reduction in the number of challenges allowed to the accused.  On that I want to point out that Senator Bennett put down no amendment, on the matter of the challenges allowed to the accused.  So far as I recollect, he did not disagree with that regulation. We are entitled to assume that he considered it a reasonable reduction.  I certainly considered it a reasonable reduction. The number of challenges peremptorily, without cause, allowed to the accused person in a case of felony in the past was twenty.  If three persons were indicted, jointly, and did not agree to join their challenges, these three persons could challenge peremptorily sixty persons without cause. Now let us suppose three persons indicted on a particular offence, say, armed robbery, and that these persons were cute enough not to join in their challenges but challenge separately. They could dispose of sixty jurors. making quite a large hole in the panel, and in effect packing the jury in favour of themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a joke among solicitors that when you have a bad case the thing to do is to get every man with a collar off the jury.  I do not know if a collar is the acid test of integrity.  I am inclined to think it is not.  It has not been my experience that above the collar-line everyone is simply pure-souled, and that below it you have a majority of people who are otherwise.  But it shows the point of view.  Sixty challenges by three persons indicted for armed robbery are simply wholly excessive, when you remember that that is dealing only with peremptory challenges, and that there is no limit to the number of challenges for cause shown, neither under this Bill nor in the past.  It is proposed to reduce the peremptory challenges to five, and I think you should be liberal <Col N="987" /> and progressive enough&mdash;I had no idea Senator Bennett was such a conservative&mdash;to consider things on their merits and not by reference to what obtained in the past.  What obtained in the past was not necessarily sacrosanct.  The fact that twenty challenges were allowed in the past is no cause in itself why five challenges are now insufficient. I think five peremptory challenges to an accused person, or double that number, where there is any question of capital penalty in a case of murder or treason, is amply long.</P>
    <P>What you have to decide in the case of the Attorney-General representing the State is this: Is it desirable to have him challenging for cause stated?  Is his stand-by to be a silent one or for cause stated?  If you were to put the Attorney-General representing the State in the position that he had no silent stand-by he would have to indict as a matter of routine every day in the courts persons other than persons in the dock.  That would be the effect.  Let us suppose there is a question of a jury panel and men charged with armed robbery, housebreaking or something of that kind.  A person's name comes along in the panel.  That person is known to the Attorney-General to be under supervision by the police in connection with the same offence.  Is he to say that in court?  I think it is a good principle that Counsel for the State should indict in court only the person in the dock.  You should not put him in the position of having to make reflections on this man's character or that man's character; that he should have the right of a silent stand-by.  The stand-by may be for any cause and consequently no uncharitable implications may be drawn.  As Senator Brown said, it may be that in times of intimidation a man would not be sufficiently fearless to undertake the task of doing justice between the prisoner and the State. It may be also because the man in question has not a clear record in connection with the same offence.  But it is undesirable I submit that the Attorney-General representing the State, should be put in the position that he would be obliged to cast aspersions of <Col N="988" /> that kind on any person other than the person indicted.</P>
    <P>Senator Bennett waxed rhetorical and talked of the balance as between the State and the prisoner.  As Senator Brown pointed out had the prisoner secured only one dissentient out of twelve there is no conviction.  Is that a balance?  This stand-by of the Attorney-General is necessary and if Senator Brown had not put down his amendment it was my intention to attempt to reverse what nine Senators did on the Committee Stage.  Certainly I would see that the Dáil rejected that amendment.  I would be bound to do that and any person in my position would be bound to do it.  The Senator in the most irresponsible way proposed the deletion of the Attorney-General's stand-by.  He did not even take the trouble to provide for the Attorney-General having a challenge for cause shown, so that the Attorney-General had to accept on behalf of the State any jury that might happen to drift into the box by the hazard of the order of names on the panel.  That is the Senator's idea of sound legislation in the interests of peace, order and justice in the State.  He says now; of course, that it is up to the Minister to suggest a compromise.  I have no compromise to suggest.  I consider the Senator's amendment a foolish one, a thoroughly ridiculous one and I am surprised that nine members were found in this Assembly to vote for it.  I am quite sure that the Dáil would have rejected it unanimously and I am quite sure now with the larger attendance in the Seanad that Senators will see the advisability of passing Senator Brown's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>May I intervene to correct a statement of the Minister? He said that I made no arrangement for cause shown.  My amendment reads</P>
      <P>(c) In addition to the jurors directed to stand by under this section the Attorney-General or the counsel or solicitor representing him may challenge for cause shown any number of jurors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw so far. That simply brings us back to the position whether the Attorney-General <Col N="989" /> should challenge for cause shown in court, or the Attorney-General's representative. The Senator knows the country, or he ought to know it.  He knows that persons charged with particular offences are at pains to canvass jurors.  They are at pains with such relatives and friends as they can muster to intimidate jurors.  I know an instance where a Circuit Judge looking through a hotel window saw a juror underneath and a man's fist held in close proximity to his nose.  The judge found out afterwards that the person in question was a defendant who had been on bail.  With full knowledge of that, and that it is a matter of routine for persons who have pending litigation here in Dublin to come to town ten days or a fortnight before their case comes on&mdash;there is a well beaten track to get a copy of the panel and start an intensive canvass of the jury panel&mdash;the Senator comes in and talks in turgid rhetoric about the unfair balance between the State and the prisoner.  There is not any such balance and will not be any such balance even under the provisions of this Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Senator thought out the amendment the thing he would be bound to realise was that he was going to put the State's representative&mdash;the Attorney-General&mdash;in the position that he would have to be throwing charges and aspersions as a matter of routine every day in the courts on persons other than the prisoner.  A man is charged with incendiarism or armed robbery, and known associates of his&mdash; people under suspicion in connection with the same offence&mdash;come along on the jury panel.  Is the Attorney-General, in addition to indicting the defendant, to state &ldquo;A B&rdquo; is suspect of the same offence or that &ldquo;A. B.&rdquo; is not believed by the State to have sufficient <Col N="990" /> detestation of this particular form of crime to be allowed on the jury?  That is the position under the amendment.  It is an absurd position. It is wholly unsound.  The Attorney-General's stand by, if he is to have one, must be a silent challenge.  Senator Brown pointed out that it is not an absolute exclusion of the person named from the jury, because he is merely put aside and if the panel is exhausted he may ultimately be on the jury, whereas the prisoner's challenge is complete exclusion.</P>
    <P>I think if the Senator understood the question and if he had any experience of the Courts, or had made any close study of the administration of criminal law, he would not come lightly into this House and ask Senators to agree with him that the Attorney-General's stand by was a thing of the past, and was no longer necessary for the administration of justice, and constituted an unfair balance as against the prisoner.  The balance is on the side of the prisoner, and as long as the jury system lasts in this State the balance will be on the side of the prisoner.</P>

      <P>First Schedule.  Before &ldquo;Masters of vessels actually employed as such&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;Commercial travellers whose business generally necessitates their absence from home for five days in the week.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Committee Stage of the Bill, when speaking to an amendment of mine, the Minister said: &ldquo;The Senator suggests with a wave of the hand that we ought to include in this Schedule all commercial travellers.&rdquo; I want to point out that this amendment does not purport to include all commercial travellers, but only about 30 per cent. of them, namely, those whose business necessitates their absence in the country from their homes for five days in the week.  I do not seek exemption for the other 70 per cent.&mdash;those commercial travellers who live in their own homes and have to go intermittently for a day or so to the country.  The commercial travellers I <Col N="994" /> wish to exempt are those whose business keeps them a whole week in the country and who only come home at the week-ends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>You mean those travellers who are absent from home day and night?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMacKean" hpid="Mr. MacKEAN Mr. MacKEAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacKEAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  At the present time commercial travellers, owing to the great depression in trade, are having a very bad time in the country. The salaried commercial traveller is trying by doing double journeys and by working perhaps late into the night to keep up his returns.  Unfortunately, as far as I know, these travellers are not very successful in that, but the condition of the commercial traveller who is working on commission is particularly sad.  He is working at his own loss and at his own expense in the hope of better times to come.  It is the opinion of commercial travellers.  I am sorry to say, that these good times are not looming in the near future at all events.  The Minister told us that individual hardship was never meant to be a criterion of abstention from jury service, but the fact that the commercial traveller is at a loss, that his firm is at a loss, and that his customers are put to great loss owing to the dislocation of business, certainly would make one feel that in the public interest such men should not be taken away from essential business to serve as ordinary jurors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seemed to make a particularly strong point of the fact that in the North of Ireland an effort was made by commercial travellers to secure exemption from jury service, and it was unsuccessful.  Since that time I have been in communication with travellers in the North of Ireland, and I find it is most exceptional for a commercial traveller whose business brings him constantly to the country to serve on a jury.  It is the recognised custom in fact not to summon these men for jury service.  The Minister told us about the North of Ireland and their high ideals of commercial integrity, and all that sort of thing.  He said that they are, in fact, an ideal commercial community, but that even there commercial travellers are not exempted.  I <Col N="995" /> would point out to him that I know the North of Ireland and the commercial genius of its people, and I have found out since this amendment originally came up that it is not the custom to bring home those travellers from their work in the South to serve on juries. They are not going to upset their business in the South or the North either. Their business is too valuable to upset it.</P>
    <P>That is a thing that the business people of the North of Ireland will not do.  Of course the Minister told me on the last day that he could not argue with me if I went into the realms of prophecy but I am not going into the realms of prophecy when I say that they have every hope that in the immediate future not alone those commercial travellers for whom I seek exemption but all commercial travellers will be put on the exemption panel in the North.</P>
    <P>Commercial travellers who go to the country have at the present time to mark out their journeys weeks beforehand. Of course it is a great upset to themselves and their customers if they do not turn up at the appointed time. At present shopkeepers are finding it very hard to get on themselves.  For the last three or four years shopkeepers have been doing the work of banks.  They have been financing small farmers, and the result of the depression in trade in the country is that farmers are not able to meet their obligations and the shopkeepers find it very difficult to keep as much stock on hands as they formerly did.  Therefore it naturally follows that a traveller must be from home more frequently than formerly.  Last week I was speaking to a traveller who represents one of the biggest boot houses in Ireland. I said to him that I was surprised that the tariff had not done considerably more to improve the boot trade in this country.  He explained to me that the reason of that was that there is overproduction in England and that the demand for English boots in England is not as good as it was.  Consequently they are dumping them in Ireland. This traveller informed me that he came home one Friday evening, leaving his motor van in the country, and <Col N="996" /> discovered a jury summons awaiting him.  He was kept ten days hanging about the Court and he discovered when he went back to the country that English and Scotch travellers in his line had completely scooped his customers.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators here employ commercial travellers and a great many are identified with the commercial life of the country.  I believe this amendment should appeal to their business sense.  Commercial travellers have as high an idea as any body of citizens of their civic and national responsibility. Since the establishment of the Free State there was no body of men who more spontaneously and more promptly gave their allegiance to the Free State, and I think they should get some consideration from the Minister in this Bill.  But commercial travellers do not wish to perform services of this kind, and I put it to the Minister that the reluctant juror, like any other worker who is reluctant, is generally inefficient. I would be glad if the Minister would see his way to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>We had better get the proportions of this hardship, if it is a hardship.  Under this Bill it is estimated by officials who are certainly competent to form an estimate that the individual juror in any area is not likely to be called upon for jury service more than once every three or three and a half years.  Probably it might be even a little longer here in the Dublin area.  That gives the measure of the hardship of which Senator MacKean complains.  I did mention on the last occasion that this appeal for exemption has been pushed very insistently in the Northern area, an area in which the commercial traveller certainly plays an important part in the economy of that State, and that the application was turned down.  I think part of the difficulty in arriving at any clear definition is as to who is a commercial traveller&mdash;the man who travels in connection with commerce.  Senator MacKean himself attempted a definition in the Committee Stage, and he said that a commercial traveller was a man who went out into the country looking for money.  That covered a great many things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacKEAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the definition of anything or anybody is the definition by recognised authorities.  I said that the commercial travellers' organisation described the commercial traveller as a person who went into the country to get orders, collect money, and generally to look after the interests of his firm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then in accordance with that definition an insurance agent would be a commercial traveller.  He goes into the country looking for money and to promote to the best of his ability the interests of his employers and he clearly falls within the scope of the Senator's definition or attempt at definition.  I am not sure that a rate collector who is in the employment of a county borough council could not slip in under that definition.  He certainly goes looking for money and he would be covered by that portion of the definition. The fact is that if every organised class that has an association or some form of combination gets the idea of seeking exemption from jury service, whom will we have left?</P>

      <P>We may have, as Senator Mrs. Costello says, to fall back upon women.  The commercial travellers are a class who make good intelligent jurors.  They are capable of grasping and appreciating issues in cases arising out of business transactions and so on; they have an interest in upholding the sanctity of contracts, and so on.  It is proposed to dispense them without any very clear idea of the numbers that would be covered or who would claim to be covered by the exemption.  And really the claim is almost as difficult a matter as if it were a reality, because someone has to look into it, sift it out, and decide whether it is a valid claim or not.  I think if the Seanad were to decide to exempt commercial travellers, a great many people would seek exemption under that head.  It is true that Senator MacKean seeks to limit the exemption to persons whose business ordinarily demands an absence of five days in the week from their homes.  But who is to <Col N="998" /> decide that?  He suggests in the hope of getting his amendment passed, that that would leave 70 per cent. of commercial travellers on the jury list.  I am not as optimistic as that.  I anticipate that if the amendment is passed, every commercial traveller, every man who can by any stretch of the imagination be termed a commercial traveller, would ask for exemption.  Who is to decide how many days he is absent from home?  What body are you going to set up to pronounce upon the validity of his claim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commercial travellers are not exempt in Northern Ireland and are not exempt in Great Britain.  Those are two areas in which the commercial traveller is an important factor.  But it has not been thought advisable in either area to exempt him from the burden of service which will fall upon every individual juror once every three and a half or four years.  I have certain sympathy with Senator MacKean's case, but I put this suggestion to him.  I put it that a man who is actually absent in the country on the day on which he might be required as a juror will, in fact, if that is established, be freed from any penalty for non-attendance; that it will always be considered an adequate excuse that the person was not available because he was in Cork or in Connaught on business connected with his employment. The onus will be on him to establish that.  But once that is established, there could be no question of a fine for non-attendance.  I think that the Senator knows that pleas of that kind have always met with very fair consideration.  The proposal in the Bill is that there should be automatic fines and a subsequent remission on investigation. The investigation can be quite leisurely made, and inquiries can be made after the applicant sends in a written application for remission of the fine.  A letter would be written into the appropriate official, the county registrar, and that letter will go before the judge in due course, and enquiries will be made through the ordinary channels, the police, and so on; and if the fact is established that this man was absent in the country the day he was required for jury service, there <Col N="999" /> would be no question of imposing the penalty in that case, and it would be remitted.</P>
    <P>I think that meets the case there is.  The difficulty is the entire vagueness of the numbers that would be covered by the term.  Quite a large number of people would claim to be commercial travellers and would claim to come within the four corners of the definition that the Senator suggested here on the last stage.  A great body of people connected with the business life of the country would claim, and could claim, that they were commercial travellers, and the very fact that they claimed would put the onus on the administration either to accept their claim or to set up some body whose task it would be to investigate that claim.  That is the difficulty I ask the Senator to see.  It is probably these difficulties that I have pointed out which deterred the administration in Northern Ireland and Great Britain from entertaining this particular claim for exemption.  It would mean an enormous mass of applicants, and these would have either to be accepted automatically or else some body should be set up to pronounce on them.  That is not the task that one would like to take on nowadays, when the whole cry is to restrict administrative expenses, the pruning of officials, and so on.</P>
    <P>If you accept in your Schedule this kind of exemption you must either accept instanter and off-hand all the large number of applications that will come in, or else set some person or body of persons to the task of investigating those claims&mdash;quite a formidable task. I ask the Senator not to ask us at this stage to be pioneers, or at least to allow us to wait until the claim has been accepted as an appealing one in some other area, and I have mentioned the two areas in which the commercial traveller is a more important factor than he is in our particular economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMacKean" hpid="Mr. MacKEAN Mr. MacKEAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacKEAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The same sort of objections were raised when the railway companies were asked to give week-end tickets to commercial travellers, namely, that it would be impossible accurately to define a commercial <Col N="1000" /> traveller and know to whom those week-end tickets should be given. The railway companies are a highly organised concern, know their own business, and take every safeguard against fraud.  They were quite willing to accept a letter from a firm guaranteeing that the person who made the claim was a traveller in their employment.  Similarly, whoever would be drawing up the panel should regard a letter from a reputable person certifying an applicant for exemption to be a traveller in their employment as sufficient evidence that the person seeking exemption was a genuine commercial traveller.  The Minister seems to have an extraordinary conception of what a commercial traveller is.  I congratulate him and thank him that he did not, for the third time, make his joke about the elephant. It is because, perhaps, I am a commercial traveller that I think there is no body of men who stand out so distinctively as the commercial travellers. The Minister said that in the commercial hotels through the country they are readily known, because the hotels are regulated to suit them. That, I think, is a sure sign that somebody recognises them clearly as a definite body, and that certainly they are not the indescribable body of men the Minister wants to make out.  The Minister says they will not be summoned on jury service oftener than once in three and a half years.  That would equally apply to the people who are on the exemption list.  On that list there are doctors, dentists, and various other classes of people none of whom would render jury service with half the inconvenience of the commercial traveller who may, for the purpose of serving on the jury, have to travel 100 miles perhaps to Dublin from Sligo or some other place, upsetting all his arrangements and dislocating his programme generally.</P>

      <P>In view of what the Minister has said with regard to this claim by commercial travellers for exemption I think the House ought not add any more to the list of exemptions. The Minister has distinctly stated that if the commercial traveller <Col N="1001" /> who is away from home on business gives sufficient evidence of that, nothing happens to him if he does not attend to serve on the jury, and for that reason I think no hardship would be inflicted on him.  If the list of exemptions is to be extended I could put forward classes of people who would be more entitled to exemption than the commercial travellers.  The engine-driver, <Col N="1002" /> for instance, and the railway guard who have to be on their trains to do the journey from Dublin to Cork or Belfast would be more entitled to exemption.  Under the provisions of the Bill, as the Minister has stated, if they give sufficient evidence that they were engaged on their duties no penalty is inflicted on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGriffith" hpid="Sir JOHN GRIFFITH Sir JOHN GRIFFITH">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN GRIFFITH</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;First Schedule.  To add at the end of the Schedule the words &lsquo;Civil engineers and architects engaged in the active practice of their profession.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have been asked by the Council of the Institution of Civil Engineers to bring forward this amendment, because the Bill withdraws a privilege enjoyed by civil engineers for many years.  Exemption was granted to them more than 50 years ago, and it has been greatly appreciated by them and their employers. We appreciate the difficulty of the Government regarding persons describing themselves as civil engineers, or attaching the description, &ldquo;civil engineers,&rdquo; to their names.  At present, according to the list of the Institution, there are about 350 corporate members, and 200 of these are resident in the Free State.</P>
      <P>Those at home are engaged as county surveyors, city or town surveyors, engineers to railways and tramways, engineers of waterworks, electrical and mechanical engineers, consulting engineers, and engineers in private practice. Very many of those engineers hold very responsible positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their absence from their work will not be an advantage to the community or to their employers.  The Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland was founded in 1835 and received the Royal Charter in 1877.  Its rules for admission of corporate members are stringent in regard to general scientific and technical education, and also practical experience.  I sincerely trust the Minister will be able to see his way to grant us this request.  It affects a comparatively small section of the community but, I submit, a very important one.  When I was in actual connection <Col N="1003" /> with the Port and Docks Board they habitually applied for permission for me to be exempt, although I believe I was exempt under the general Act.  I cannot help thinking that the Minister will see the force of this view.  There is no doubt about those men being civil engineers, because they passed through the mill and are recognised by their professional brethren as such.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what the Senator has said, for several reasons.  As Senator Brown pointed out, engineers have always been exempted.  Someone said, I believe it was the Minister, that the exemption should be given in the interests of the public and not in the interests of the individual.  I thought that was particularly so in the case of the engineers. Suppose some urgent work has to be done and the engineer is away for a fortnight on a jury and an accident occurs in consequence of his absence, is not that a serious matter, and is it not clear, in the interests of the public, that he should be exempted? In the next place, the number to be exempted is only over 300.  The members are clearly defined and no question can arise as to whether they are engineers or not.  We know that at present very serious floods have occurred in America, and that an area of country equal to about one-third of Ireland is under water.  Supposing an engineer in charge of embankments is away several weeks at a time, is not that a serious consideration?  Having regard to the small number involved and to the fact that they always had those privileges and that injury to the public might result from the absence of engineers, I think the Minister should consider the amendment favourably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will agree with me that exemption from jury service ought not to be given haphazard or without the fullest consideration.  If we get to the time when every block of people who join in an association push their claim sufficiently to get a motion down and secure their exemption, you will deplete your materials for jury panels very substantially.  I do not object to amendments seeking <Col N="1004" /> exemption for particular classes, but I ask those, on whom it falls to consider claims of that kind, to consider them carefully and fully.</P>
      <P>On this question of civil engineers, in the very valuable report of the Northern Ireland Committee which was set up to survey, in a comprehensive fashion, the question of juries, we have the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Civil Engineers:&mdash;We understand that any person can use the title of civil engineer as there is no statutory enactment restricting its use to the members or associate members&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, is the Minister correct in reading that, because here we propose to limit it strictly to the people who are members and who are defined as civil engineers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>That is scarcely a point of order.  I have referred to this Report quite frequently.  It is very valuable, and we used it from time to time in the preparation of this Bill.  I will deal with the Senator's point presently. I appreciate what Senator Sir John Griffith said, that here it is not proposed to give exemption to civil engineers merely, but to people possessed of a quite definite hall-mark in the way of qualifications.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We understand that any person can use the title of civil engineer as there is no statutory enactment restricting its use to the members or associate members of the Institution of Civil Engineers of England or Ireland or graduates in engineering of any University in all the United Kingdom.  Cases are by no means uncommon in which the title has been issued to persons anxious to avoid jury service.  Furthermore, in principle, we see no reason why civil engineers, even when duly qualified, should not serve as jurors.  There is nothing in the nature of their professional work to debar them from so doing, and we are of the opinion they would provide an excellent class of juror.  It is quite an anomaly that they should be exempted from service whilst duly qualified architects are compelled to act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> That is the relevant extract from the Northern Report.  The Committee felt that they saw nothing in the nature of the employment of those persons which demanded their exemption from jury service on grounds of public interest and we have agreed that the criterion should be public interest rather than personal inconvenience.</P>
    <P>I am asked to envisage the position when the water main from Roundwood bursts and the engineer is absent on jury service.  That, of course, would be a great calamity, but if we are to go into questions of that kind one can envisage certain minor disasters in which the absence of a plumber would be a great hardship.  A pipe bursts in one bathroom and the house is rapidly flooding while the only plumber is absent on jury service.  That would be quite a kindred situation too.  I think we should simply ask ourselves if there is a sufficient case for exempting this block of persons because of public interest. Of course, 350 or 400 is not a very big reduction of the total panel, but it is some reduction, and if we keep on making small inroads of this kind we will eventually make a substantial subtraction from our list.  If the Seanad passes this amendment, I will not take the line of asking the Dáil to reject it, while not guaranteeing that the Dáil will pass it.  I ask that the Senator, applying the criterion of public interest, should put to himself the question of whether or not there is in fact a sufficient case for granting this exemption. Personally, I doubt if there is, and I think the kind of case sought to be established can be established with regard to other cases.  The fact that it is not a very strong body numerically and all that is a factor which, of course, differentiates it from Senator MacKean's request which would involve some thousands of people.  At any rate, I ask Senators to recognise that this burden of jury service is a serious matter, and that we should not exempt people, particularly those who would be very excellent material for jury service.</P>

From Sir John Griffith's statement we learned that there are not more than 200 in the Free State.  That is an appreciably small body of highly intelligent and trained men in an employment.  If you take away the supervising engineer you might do a great deal of damage. The Minister talks about a plumber. The plumber might be very bad in regard to the house he was in, but he will not be anything like the engineer in a big shop where a great deal of men are employed.  I think that those words ought to commend themselves to the Seanad.  The Minister says that if we demand that one small exemption we may go on but I hope this is the end of the Jury Bill, and that we are not going to get an opportunity of asking for more exemptions. I do not see how any of us are going to get any further opportunity of proposing any other exemption.</P>

As he pointed out a large number of exemptions are in existence but those who are to be exempted by this amendment are members of a profession that has enjoyed exemption for some 50 years. The very point raised by the Minister as to the number of public officers already exempted makes it clear that if this amendment is passed but a very small body of people will be added to the list of exempted persons.

Already clergymen in Holy Orders of all denominations and other persons who teach or preach in any religious congregation and do not follow any secular occupation were exempt under the ordinary law.  I find now they are put into Part II of this Schedule which means that they are entitled to serve on making application. I suggest that their place is <Col N="1008" /> in the first part of the Schedule as intended when the Bill passed the Dáil.

I do not think we should take the lines of rendering jury service unattainable for clergymen.  I would prefer to leave it as a matter of internal arrangement to each denomination as to whether its members would seek to serve or not.  I doubt if leaving them in Part II. of the Schedule would result in having clergymen in the jury boxes.  If there is a feeling of taking action in the matter, I am open for accepting the suggestion that they be put in Part I. of the Schedule instead of Part II.</P>

The provisions of the Land Act, 1923, with respect to the additional annuity payable where one half-year's compounded arrears of rent is added to the purchase money pursuant to the proviso in sub-section (3) of Section 19 thereof, shall apply to the annuity created under this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 2, sub-section (1).  After the word &lsquo;to&rsquo; in line 25, to insert the word &lsquo;eleven-tenths.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the debate on Second Reading one Senator said that we were having frequent Land Bills brought before us. I do not think that was quite accurate, and I think that we have not had any but this substantial Land Bill since the Act of 1923.  Some Senators may have forgotten the early history of that Bill. Somewhere about 1919, when the pistoleers became active, and raised issues, practically no rent was paid until 1923, when the Land Act was introduced.  In that Act a composition was made with the landlords in regard to the arrears of rent due.  They were wiped out and a section was inserted in the Bill amounting to an undertaking whereby the Government would collect the arrears with a reduction of 26 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have thought that in reason and equity it might have ended there, and that the Government might have been satisfied with the amount they had deducted&mdash;abstracted you might say&mdash;from the landowners.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  Owing to continued pressure and circumstances which were undoubtedly politically embarrassing to the Government this pledge, perhaps not a legal pledge, I understand, but a moral pledge undertaking to collect the arrears, was not carried out.  It is now proposed to clean up the matter by adding these uncollected arrears to the purchase money.  The effect is that there will be a further substantial loss to the owner who will be paid in stock representing a cash loss of approximately 10 per cent.  I agree to this extent, that it might be a great political difficulty for the Government to collect these arrears. There was no actual physical difficulty, any more than there would be to the payment of annuities or rates.  It is probably due to the unpopular position of recipients that the annuities are collected under great financial difficulties <Col N="1013" /> in some cases.  So are the rates, but unfortunately beneficiaries in the case of these arrears are a smaller and, in some quarters, a somewhat discredited class. They are the victims of political expediency. A further 10 per cent. of their miserably diminished incomes is taken from them.</P>
    <P>I think in equity and justice the Government should have found the money themselves.  That could have been done if it was felt that enough had been done to these unfortunate people, many of whom have suffered great necessitous embarrassment, a great loss in their means of living, and amongst whom there is great penury due almost altogether to the circumstances that led to the cessation of the payment of rents. It would have been at least generous and a just act on the part of the Government to have paid this small amount of arrears in full.  That is what the amendment seeks to do.  If it is carried it means that they will get £99 for every £100 due.  I think that is only just.  We have got away altogether from equity and strict law in this matter of land legislation.  We are in the position of men administering rough justice.  I shall have occasion to revert to this question of rough justice later on.  In this case I think they should get at least rough justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Keane should at least be accurate.  He starts by stating that the payment of rent ceased for the first time in 1919. I am not as old as Senator Keane, but I understood that rents ceased to be paid about 1860.  There was another agitation in 1870, and others in 1880, 1890, 1900, 1905 and 1919.  As Senator Keane said, for the first time in 1919 the pistoleer started and there was a refusal to pay rents.  What is the use of making statements like that?  The Senator should at least be accurate when giving his historical survey. The fact of the matter is that so far as the pistoleers intervened at all they intervened to compel payment of rents. That is what happened through the country.  In 1919 and 1920, the pistoleers were sent to various counties to <Col N="1014" /> compel people who were trying to make use of the conditions of the times, to pay annuities, and, in some cases, rents.  It was the first time there was a really serious attempt to distinguish between a land agitation and a political agitation.  I say that the events of 1919 and 1920 were the first serious attempts in this country to distinguish between land agitation and genuine national agitation.</P>
      <P>Senator Keane tells us now that in 1919 the pistoleers came along and the extraordinary, unknown phenomenon occurred, that people refused to pay rents for the first time.  That is not so, and the Senator must know it.  He goes on and talks about political pressure on the Government.  He should not use that expression, for we have not been susceptible to political pressure in this matter.  The Senator should know that.  It was not in response to political pressure that the Land Act of 1923 was introduced.  There was a convention called, a conference between landlords and tenants and an attempt was made to come to an agreement. There was no agreement and we introduced our own Bill.  We introduced it to use the Senator's word, from the point of view of doing broad equity and not from the point of view of landowner or tenant.  I think we succeeded in doing rough justice.  If we yielded to political pressure we would have a different Bill.  There has been political influence used to prevent us from collecting the compounded arrears of rent.  Did we ever try to make it a political issue?  If we did not, who did?  Prominent members of the Farmers' Union.  I think I remember statements about the crowbar brigade made by a colleague of Senator Keane, Colonel O'Callaghan Westropp, of Clare, as to the manner in which we were collecting, not only land purchase annuities but other debts.  We had to stand the same talk from responsible people here and through the country, and the only people who did not attempt to make any political capital out of not allowing debtors to refuse to pay their debts was the Ministry of which I happen to be a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are charged now with adding the arrears to the purchase money for <Col N="1015" /> political reasons.  As I happen to know, most landowners regard that as the best thing in the circumstances. Most responsible bodies considered it the best thing in the circumstances and it is not for political considerations that this section enabling us to add arrears to the purchase money has been added.  It is an economic consideration and strictly economic.  What would have happened if we had not done so?  We are not bound legally to collect all the arrears under the 1923 Land Act.  We are not bound under the Land Act to pay landowners all the arrears of rent.  We are bound to pay all the interest in lieu of rent, whether we collect it or not, but when you come to compounded arrears we are only under an obligation to pay to landowners what we collect.</P>
    <P>In 1923 there was one set of circumstances, and in 1926 another set of circumstances. In 1923 prices were better.  Since then they have fallen steadily.  No one expected in 1923 that prices would fall so steadily and so consistently.  Now we find ourselves in a position where it is almost absolutely certain that the whole of the compounded arrears of rent cannot be collected. You cannot get blood out of a turnip. In any event, any big collection of the compounded arrears would entail a considerable amount of cost.  It is purely a business proposition from the landowners' point of view, and it is better to add these arrears to the purchase money, and hand over the arrears immediately in bonds.</P>
    <P>What is the advantage of that?  The landowners get the arrears immediately. I agree that they get them in bonds. The whole Land Act of 1923 was based by common consent on bonds, not cash. We could not finance land purchase on cash.  No one suggested that we could. We had to adopt the expediency of bonds.  We were not the first to do so. We had the precedent of the British Government, and there was the British Government guarantee with them&mdash;if it warms the Senator to them.  Our proposal is to add the arrears to the purchase money, and to pay in bonds.</P>
    <P>What will be the effect?  The landowners will get, if not immediately in <Col N="1016" /> a short time, 4½ per cent. bonds.  What would the other effect be?  It would mean that they would get the purchase money of the holdings also.  Under the Land Act of 1923 lands cannot be vested until the arrears are collected. Until the land is vested the purchase money cannot be paid to the landlord. This provision would enable us to pay the compounded arrears of rent immediately in bonds, and enable us at the same time to give the purchase money on holdings, which in the ordinary way they would not get for three or four years, until we collected the arrears. Most sensible landowners realise that it would be quite impossible to recover anything like the whole of them under present economic circumstances. It would take a long time to do so, and we could not collect the whole of them. We are under no compliment, no obligation to transfer to owners more than we collect.  In the circumstances this is good business for the landowners.  A number of them are making quite freely a certain amount of sacrifice to the present economic conditions.  It is generally agreed by the landowners that in their own interests it is about the best provision we could give them.  I ask the Seanad to reject the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>EARL OF KERRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question in connection with this section.  It deals with the penalty for cutting ornamental trees.  I think everyone agrees that that is a very laudable and very necessary object.  It is within the knowledge of most Senators that trees <Col N="1018" /> have been disappearing rather rapidly. I want to know how does the Minister propose to get at the offenders and to impose penalties.  I know it is a very difficult problem.  People can cut down trees at night, come along with horses and carts and hide them away. I should like to believe that the Civic Guard will be able to apprehend the offenders and stop this conduct.  I cannot see that they will get very much chance of doing so, and I should like to hear what machinery the Minister proposes to employ for that purpose. That leads to another consideration. Besides ornamental trees, I take it this Bill will do nothing to preserve trees which are scattered derelict about farms.  There are many trees which are just as ornamental which were the property of the landlord or farmer, and which are now left in a derelict condition.  I cannot say that the Government is not inclined to take them over and preserve them, but it must be obvious that the landowner is not in a position to preserve them.  To my certain knowledge, in many cases they are disappearing slowly but surely.  Is it not just as necessary to make some effort to preserve these woods for the sake of the amenities of the scenery as it is to preserve woods standing around the homestead?  I do not know whether the Minister has considered that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it these trees would not be covered by the terms of this sub-section but would it not be possible, if not now at some future time, to make some penalty applicable to the cutting of these trees?  The position as it now stands is that if by any chance the owner of these small plantations which are being destroyed is able to secure a conviction against anyone, he may get the value of the tree which may perhaps be only 10/-.  That is neither useful to him nor a deterrent to the offenders.  I should like that the offence for cutting trees would be considered, not as against the individual but against the State.  The owner does not want the money but he wants to preserve the beauty of the country. If the Civic Guard were given power to apprehend those who cut down trees I do not see any reason why they should <Col N="1019" /> not be equally empowered to claim a conviction against all people who destroy similar trees not actually on the vested holding.  These are two questions on which I would like some enlightenment from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Land Commission has nothing to do with untenanted land not vested.  This section only deals with vested lands and lands subject to an annuity.  They can control trees there.  I should like Senator the Earl of Kerry to realise that this is a rather difficult problem. It is difficult to administer the law where an isolated tree has been cut. In this section a penalty is provided for the cutting of ornamental trees or shelter beds.  If a farmer on his own holding cuts a shelter bed all his neighbours object and you would get information with regard to that.  It takes some time to cut a small group of trees or a small wood and the information would come to the Civic Guard and the Land Commission would proceed.  In the case of ornamental timber it is rather easier to get information as to the cutting than in the case say of a tree on a fence or an isolated tree here and there in a field. However, we can only do the best we can.  We will get information from the farmers or from people in the neighbourhood whose interests are affected and we will proceed on that information.  With regard to the other question, the position is that we have no control over these lands at present. The Land Commission have no control over land that is not vested but it is hoped that a Forestry Bill will be introduced next Session.  At least it it proposed to introduce it and it will deal with that particular subject.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear the Minister state that a Forestry Bill is to be introduced, because the position at present is that there is no law to preserve timber except on lands over which the Minister has control. Even then, as the Minister has shown, the destruction has taken place before any cognisance can be taken of it.  It might possibly strengthen his hand if the Civic Guard were put in a position <Col N="1020" /> to exercise a little more vigilance.  I understand that there has been great discussion amongst culprits as to whether trees were oranmental or merely shelter beds.  In a country which has less than 2 per cent. of its lands under timber and which is so subject to storms and gales it is essential that some measures should be taken to preserve the timber that is still standing. I understand that the gales on the West coast were responsible for the destruction of some of the original forests in this country.  It is surely time that a Forestry Bill should be introduced and that the hands of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture should be strengthened.  I would suggest that the Civic Guard should be put in a position to watch these trees rather than to wait for them to be destroyed before taking action.</P>

      <P>My observations will be very short.  I just desire to say that occupiers of land adjoining the roadside have received notices from the county councils to cut down trees.  On the other hand, according to another law, we are bound to get the permission of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture for doing so.  I do not know whether the Minister has received many applications of that nature.  During the coal strike, when there was a shortage of fuel, a considerable quantity of trees were cut down, and no objection was made to that proceeding.  I think the Minister acted very sensibly in not interfering to prevent the cutting down of trees required for fuel.  I observe that under the section trees planted by a tenant, and I presume by his predecessors, can be cut down by him.  I entirely approve of that, because although a large area under timber might be very desirable, certain trees are sometimes very harmful on <Col N="1021" /> tillage land, and I cannot see how the Minister will have a staff to find out where trees were cut and to take proceedings against the tenant.  I really think the tenants should be allowed to work their holdings as best they can without undue interference as regards the cutting down of trees.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 7, sub-section (6).  To delete in line 5 the word &ldquo;five&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;two.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am proposing this amendment in the interests of the State rather than in the interests of the farmer or landlord. When this Bill was being considered on Second Reading the Minister for Justice made a most important statement.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In this matter Senator Sir John Keane is a revolutionary.  He is struggling to assert a new principle that there is absolute property in land.  My readings in law were not perhaps very sustained or deep, but I did read the first page of Williams' on real property.  If Senator Sir John Keane refers to that he will find a very direct negative to his underlying thesis that there is absolute property in land.  There is not and never has been.  Governments have at all times and from time to time acted on the principle that land is held from the State and that in circumstances which to them seem good and sufficient, the land may be acquired.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section refers to potential building sites, and seeks to prolong the period for another five years.  Under the Act of 1923 any land that had a potential building site was reserved, and was not purchased.  I can best explain what I mean by citing an actual case which came under my notice. There was a tenant of a holding of 100 acres who applied to have that purchased by the State.  The landlord objected, as he held that there was portion of the land, if not all of it, which was a potential building site.  The question was fought out.  The tenant employed a solicitor and counsel, and brought his case before the Judge, and the Judge went and saw the land.  He held the land was not a potential building <Col N="1023" /> site, so that the tenant was more or less secured in possession, and was relieved of the fear that his land might be taken by the landlord for building. What would have been the effect of that?  If it had been reserved for building sites, it would have been held for the next 20, 30 or 40 years, and nothing would have been done to the land. It is very poor grazing land, and the tenant has since spent hundreds of pounds on improving it.  He tried to bring this land into a state of cultivation, but he found that he was prevented by rocks and large boulders underneath. He blew those up, and a dozen men were engaged on the land for the whole winter.  The land is now far more valuable than it otherwise would be.</P>
    <P>The same argument would apply to a large number of other holdings, and, although the land may not be built on for years, anywhere within ten miles of a city you can regard it as potential building-ground.  I think the whole position has been very largely altered by the improved transport facilities. Another very substantial reason for passing this amendment is that we have to give fixity of tenure.  If there is anything a landholder desires it is fixity of tenure.  In this Bill, not only in this section but in other sections, there is a tendency to create a certain amount of insecurity, because large holdings may be taken over, although they have been in the occupation of the same families for generations and centuries. It may be taken, therefore, that they will not expend on the land that amount of money necessary to bring it into proper cultivation.  If portion of a holding can be reserved by the landlord as potential building-ground, what is to happen to the tenant?  Is he to be compensated?  He cannot work the remainder of his land to advantage.  There are very strong reasons why we should hesitate to give any further extension of these powers.</P>

      <P>I think if the Minister for Justice were revising his speech in his more deliberate moments, he would alter the word &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; to &ldquo;reactionary.&rdquo;  I think the <Col N="1024" /> Senator who has just spoken should take on himself the position of a revolutionary. This would be following a revolutionary policy.  The whole case starts with the assumption that the landlord has no rights and that the tenant is the only person who has any rights, although in law it is the landlord who has all the rights.  The tenant is under contract and is placed in a certain position. Now it is proposed, because the taking of building land might be inconvenient to the tenant, he is going to be compensated.  Everybody knows that this building land can only be developed very slowly, and as long as the landlord has those building rights he should not be deprived of them except under the most careful safeguards.  The safeguards are insufficient, but such as they are, they should not be whittled down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting the amendment, and I will ask the Senate not to accept it.  Senator Sir Edward Bigger spoke of the difficulty and drew a vague picture of a case where a tenant has a present tenancy and has done a lot of work on the land and has improved it.  Now he must wait five or six years before he can purchase it, and before the end of those five or six years he runs the risk that the landlord may take it up.  The landlord always had the right of resumption for building purposes, but he must give something like the market value for the land for building purposes if he exercises the right of resumption.  Senators must remember that this Bill applies not only to present but to future tenancies, that is to say, tenancies which enable the landlord to terminate the tenancy on a year's notice or on a six months' notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will have a case where the landlord let land seven or eight years ago on a future tenancy and now the tenant is purchasing.  In that case the landlord has equities.  In that case you have an illustration of the old saying that hard cases make bad law.  Taking into account all the equities of the case and especially the particular fact that I mentioned, namely, that if the owner takes up the land for building, he <Col N="1025" /> must pay something like the market value for it&mdash;the tenants must get the resumption price&mdash;the equities of the case are fairly met and I would ask the Seanad not to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and negatived.</P>

      <P>I beg to move&mdash;</P>
      <P>In section 7, sub-section (6), to add at the end of the sub-section the words: &ldquo;Provided that in the application of this sub-section to land held under a lease containing no provision enabling the landlord to resume possession of such land for building purposes five years from the date of the expiration of such lease by effluxion of time shall be substituted for five years from the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As the section stands at present it gives the landlord, who has made a lease of land which is capable of being built upon and who has preserved the right of re-entry, five years from the date of the passing of this Act to make up his mind as to when he is to put that right of re-entry into operation.  That is very reasonable because otherwise the operations of this Act would be held up indefinitely.  Some limit has to be put on it and five years probably is a very sound limit.  There is another case.  There is the case of the landlord who has no right of re-entry for building purposes under his lease.  Such land owing to the spreading out of a town may become potential building ground.  What my amendment proposes to do is to give him five years from the end of the lease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make a suggestion to the Senator which would mean a slight alteration.  There is undoubtedly a case where a man has let recently under a lease which may be expiring say next year; and nevertheless he has no rights in that case under the Act.  As it stands, the land must be purchased from him.  There is another case where there are 59 years of a lease running, and under the lease the effect of the Senator's amendment would be that the proceedings would have to be deferred first of all for 59 years and then for six years after that. That would nullify the Act.  On the <Col N="1026" /> Report Stage I propose to prepare an amendment which will perhaps meet the point.</P>

      <P>(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-sections (1) and (3) of Section 24 of the Land Act, 1923, there shall not be vested in the Land Commission by virtue of the said Act otherwise than in pursuance of a voluntary agreement any untenanted land so long as the Land Commission are satisfied that such land is being used in a bona fide manner as a farm for the purpose of breeding thoroughbred stock which in the opinion of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture is of a nature and character suitable to the requirements of the country.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 9, sub-section (1).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;or that such land is being farmed so as to give the maximum yield without loss to the owner.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an amendment which sets out what is very reactionary nowadays. That is the right of the owner to use his property as he wishes within, of course, reasonable limits.  If a man chooses to neglect his land I submit that as long as he pays rates and taxes for it, he is entitled to keep it.  It is far more dangerous to interfere with the sanctity of possession, but we have passed a long way from that.  We are up against a position, and I do not use the phrase in a sinister or criminal sense, that represents a form of legal blackmail.  You can keep your land according to this section provided you keep pedigree stock. At that price you can purchase exemption from the acquisition section.  I think that is a very wrong position to take up, especially in the case of a person who is living on his land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> The average position of the person who keeps pedigree stock is, that he has to have a good deal of capital, and is able to run very grave risks, and he has to be a very lucky or a comparatively rich man.  Why should these people be placed in a comparatively privileged position as against the bona fide working farmer who is doing his best, perhaps, tilling a large percentage of his land and harnessed all the time up to the balance-sheet? That is the test.  No man can be expected to farm his land unless he can make it pay.  As long as a man can show he is working his land according to the general methods of food production, he should be allowed to do so just as well as the richer person who can afford to gamble in pedigree stock. Also in the case of pedigree stock, I think that a person who has got a good registered herd, although it may not be pedigree, is in every way contributing to the blood-stock as well as the person with pure pedigree stock.  This is an example of the morass you can get into and the anachronisms you create when you tamper with the liberty of possession.  That has been proved all along.  The Minister has probably in the last four years learned a little of the dangers, from the security point of view, of tampering with the liberty of possession in lands, or in any other commodity whatever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We may be in a morass at present, but it is nothing to the morass we were in before land purchase started, and we would be in a worse morass if this amendment were carried.  No one knows what it means, and it could not be administered.  The Land Commission propose to acquire land and the owner puts up the case: &ldquo;I cannot farm this land in any other way without loss to myself.&rdquo;  You may advise him how to farm it in another way.  He will tell you it is <Col N="1028" /> this or that sort of land, some peculiar sort of land, and that this is the best way it can be farmed.  &ldquo;This is the way that experience has taught me to farm it,&rdquo; he will say, &ldquo;and it is the way that my father farmed it.&rdquo;  It then comes before the Judicial Commissioner who has to inquire as to whether infact there is some other way of making more money out of the land, and unless he decides there is, the Land Commission cannot take the land. The effect would be to stop all purchase. The Land Commission might occasionally be able to get the land, but even those cases could be delayed for years, and it would limit the opportunities of the Land Commission for acquiring land by about 90 per cent. I will not go into the reasons now as it would take too long as to why it was considered people breeding high-class stock animals should be exempted. It was mainly for the reason indicated by Senator Sir John Keane.  It would take a good deal of money to run a pedigree herd.  Much has to be done, including a good deal of tillage.  You cannot run a good pedigree herd without roots to feed your cattle in the winter.  If the Senator reads the section he will find that you cannot run a camouflage pedigree herd.  &ldquo;So long as the Land Commission are satisfied that such land is being used in a bona fide manner as a farm for the purpose of breeding thoroughbred stock which in the opinion of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, is of a nature and character suitable to the requirements of the country.&rdquo;  No landowner who has, say 1,000 acres, can put a pedigree Hereford bull in the middle of that and say he has a pedigree herd.  It must be a farm run in a bona fide way for the production of high-class animals.  There can be no greater asset for the farmers than such a farm, and it is because it is of particular value from the point of view of the farmers and the labourers, and from every other point of view, this exemption was made.  When it is made Senator Sir John Keane comes along and puts in a proviso which he could not define himself, which no judge could interpret, and which would only mean stopping all land purchase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator interprets it too narrowly.  I think thoroughbred stock means high-class stock animals.  When it comes to a question of definition the judge will have to take all the circumstances into account and the decision of the court comes to the Department of Agriculture. If you had registered cattle you should add other exemptions as well. A registered dairy herd is one thing, and high-class stock another thing.  A registered herd is of no importance compared with the farmer who is breeding a class of high stock animals which are distributed through the country.  I do not think it would be right to include a registered dairy herd.  Any farmer with four or five cows he had tested would be brought within that category.  I ask the Senator to leave well alone.  This is an important concession, and if it puts a premium on high stock animals, so much the better.  In any other country rich people keep high-class stock and that is a reason why in Scotland and in England you have first-class animals. It would be the greatest boon to this country if the landowner class would keep pedigree stock.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 12 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;12.&mdash; Where the rateable valuation of the lands comprised in a holding, the main object of the letting of which was for a residence, exceeds the rateable valuation of the principal dwelling-house on the holding and the tenant of the holding was at the passing of the Land Act, 1923, and is at the passing of this Act a person whose principal or only business is farming in bona fide occupation of the said dwelling-house and working and using the said lands as an ordinary agricultural or pastoral farm such holding shall be deemed to have lost its residential character and the provisions of the Land Act, 1923, shall apply thereto notwithstanding any decision of any Court to the contrary made or given prior to the passing of this Act.  Provided that this section shall not alter or affect the liability of the tenant of any holding to which the provisions of the Land Act, 1923, shall become applicable by virtue of this section for rent or arrears of rent accrued due up to and including the gale day next preceding the date of the passing of this Act, as from which gale day the liability of the tenant for payment to the Land Commission of payment in lieu of rent pursuant to <Col N="1032" /> Section 20 of the said Act shall commence to run.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has been found that quite a number of tenants in occupation of holdings, such as those mentioned in the amendment are excluded from the provisions of the 1923 Act and the decisions of the Land Judge, in many cases, have been very difficult to understand.  In some cases holdings have been admitted which appear similar to others that have been excluded, and the object of the amendment is to give a lead to the judge as to what should be the principal points on which he should give his decision.  There is first the fact that the valuation of the land should be in excess of the value of the buildings.  There is, again, that the tenant should be in occupation of the land at the beginning of the 1923 Act, that he should work it as an ordinary agricultural or pastoral farm and that it is his only means of livelihood.  I think with those conditions you will confine the application of this section to men who really have to make their living out of the land.  After all, it will be as much to the advantage of the landlord to get holdings such as those purchased by the tenant, and receive the price in the form of land bonds. He cannot expect more from the tenant than the land is really worth. I may mention that already the Seanad has approved of the Second Reading of a Bill in which a clause similar to this appeared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This point has often been debated in the Seanad and the Dáil.  I do not think you could possibly tie the Land Judge by any such conditions as are set out in the first two or three lines of this amendment.  The Land Judge takes into account, when a case comes before him, the terms of the letting itself, the user of the farm, the present circumstances, the sort of man working on it, and whether it has been worked as an agricultural farm.  Even where the lettings were expressed as residential lettings he takes into account where, in practice, there has been a change.  He takes every possible consideration that could be put down in an amendment, or that would be contained in five or ten pages of Cherry <Col N="1033" /> into account.  I attempted to draft some sort of a section, and to set out all the possible factors that the Land Judge might take into account, and I found that if I attempted to do it I would have to go on to a section almost as big as the whole Bill, and that I would be leaving out some considerations that the Land Judge might take into account.  This is an issue that is being covered by decided cases, the law of which is well known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every possible aspect of the situation has been discussed by lawyers, and no section I could draft would improve the present position, or would give effect to what the Senator wishes accepted. Some sort of a section setting out, as he has set out, that wherever the valuation of the land exceeds the rateable valuation of the principal dwellinghouse then the holding shall be deemed to have lost its residential character, would be a grave injustice. Senators may know cases where grave hardship has been done by reason of a decision of the Land Judge.  We ought to be careful before coming to the conclusion in some cases reported to you, <Col N="1034" /> that grave injustice has been done.  The Judge takes at least four or five hours, and often two or three days to hear any case.  It is only after a long hearing that he decides.  You cannot come to a decision on the merits after hearing only for an hour or two.  The circumstances have to be put up to you by one side and the other.  If such a section were inserted as the Senator made here, twice as many cases of hardship might result.  It would be a serious thing around Dublin.  In nine cases out of ten it was never intended that people in occupation of premises of £31 valuation, and a farm of £30 valuation, should come within the Land Act, because they are not agricultural land.  I see no better way of dealing with a complicated question like this than to leave it to the Land Judge and the present law.  The present law has been stated over and over again.  I feel certain that if you attempt to alter the law by arbitrary action you will often do more injustice than you will leave undone, and you will have a worse state of affairs than before.</P>

    <P>Where prior to the declaration of the appointed day for any lands, the landlord or, in the case of untenanted land, the owner thereof is or has been liable for the cleansing or maintenance in whole or in part of any watercourse, drain, embankment, or other work, either alone or in conjunction with other persons and whether under the terms of a contract of tenancy or otherwise, and has neglected to clean or maintain or to contribute to the cleansing or maintenance of the said work, so as to render necessary an expenditure of money on its cleansing, repair, <Col N="1035" /> or restoration, the Land Commission may either before or after the appointed day, apply to the Judicial Commissioner for an order declaring them entitled to have transferred to them on the allocation of the purchase money such amount of land bonds as they shall certify to be required in order to recoup them for the expenditure made or proposed to be made by them in cleansing, repairing, or restoring such work; and if the Judicial Commissioner is satisfied that the landlord, or owner, either alone or in conjunction with other persons is or was so liable as aforesaid, and that the expenditure so made, or proposed to be made, by the Land Commission has been or is rendered necessary by such neglect, he may order that on the allocation of the purchase money such sum in land bonds as he may consider reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case shall be transferred to the Land Commission out of the land bonds representing the purchase money.</P>

      <P>This amendment deals with cases where landlords were liable for the maintenance of drains and embankments on their estates and neglected them.  The section gives power to deduct from the purchase money an amount that would be necessary to repair that neglect and to make good what the owner was under a legal liability to do.  In principle it is right that at least that should be done.  My amendment limits the amount of the liability to be deducted from the purchase money to the portion of the land directly benefiting by the embankment or drains that should have been kept in order.  I suggest that that is a just amendment.</P>

    <P>(1)  The Land Commission with the concurrence of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health may if they deem it expedient so to do by order require a county council to undertake the cleansing or maintenance, but not including reconstruction, of any watercourse, drain, embankment, or other similar work situate in their county, in respect of which a capital sum has before the passing of this Act been transferred by the Land Commission to the Public Trustee to be held and applied in accordance with any deed of trust or any scheme framed by the Land Commission or is hereafter transferred pursuant to the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of Section 44 of the Land Act, 1923, or in respect of which a capital sum retained and administered by the Land Commission shall hereafter be transferred to the Public Trustee to be held and applied in accordance with a scheme framed under this section and shall by the same or a subsequent order appoint the county council trustees of the deed of trust or scheme in place of the trustees thereof and the deed of trust or scheme shall be varied so far as necessary, or framed so as to provide for the application of the income of the capital sum in or towards the reimbursement to the county <Col N="1037" /> council of the expenditure properly and necessarily incurred in such cleansing or maintenance.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 21, sub-section (1), to delete in lines 43/44 the words &ldquo;if they deem it expedient so to do by order required&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;agree with.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the power to impose the maintenance on the county councils.  I do not think it is fair to throw any more burdens on the county councils.  Really they cannot now do the work they have to do properly.  There are endless committees and boards of health connected with the county councils, and there are incessant complaints about the difficulty of doing the responsible work.  The Bill proposes to hand over the maintenance of embankments to them.  In some cases that might be very arduous work and might involve the employment of increased staffs.  I do not think many cases will arise but it is quite possible that they will.  Although the drainage rate is imposed and can be recovered it is not good business to make such a provision mandatory.  If county councils wish let them take on this duty, but the Board of Works has a staff of officials and it should continue to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the trouble. That was not the old method.  What happened was that it was everyone's business and no one's business.  An embankment might be a very big proposition to keep up.  The section deals with that and with every little trustee scheme in the country.  What happened before was that a landowner had, as a rule, to look after the embankment or drainage work before the estate was purchased.  After it was purchased the Land Commission appointed trustees&mdash;the parish priest, the teacher or some big farmer&mdash;and set aside a certain amount of money for the work.  The Land Commission has not a staff to look after this work. It is not a permanent body.  It must be assumed that Land Commission work must cease sometime.  They have no engineers, inspectors or machinery <Col N="1038" /> for this work.  What they did formerly was to appoint trustees, and these had a certain fund to administer. Sometimes that fund had to be raised from the people whose lands were benefited or alternatively from land that would be injured if the embankment was neglected or if drainage work was not done.  As there was no alternative, trustees were appointed in a parish to look after these little works.  In a minority of cases the embankments were substantial, but the others were small.</P>
      <P>In practice that system absolutely failed all over the country.  There were trustees here and there not doing their duty.  They had their own business to look after.  Two or three responsible farmers were not going to go around to their neighbours and beg them to contribute towards the expenses of maintaining the embankment, especially as in many cases the land of trustees was not affected.  What happened is, they are doing nothing.  You have cases where an expenditure of £10 a year would have kept the embankment or the drain right, but when neglected for 20 years it would take £1,000 to put it right.  We cannot allow that to go on.  Someone must have charge of the maintenance.  In my opinion the Board of Works never had, and never should have, charge of that work. As I said, there are not many substantial schemes, but there are any amount of small schemes that the Board of Works should not be bothered with. The administrative expenses of looking after every little work and seeing if a scheme would be an improvement would be very great.  It would be anything but economical to have the Board of Works looking after these things.  I think the county councils are the obvious bodies to look after that work, once an embankment has been put into repair, and the drains properly cleaned. It is then merely a question of maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county councils should deal with that, as they can strike a rate on the parties whose lands will be benefited. The usual case is where you have 10, 18, 20 or 100 tenants anxious to pay a small sum to keep the embankment or the drain in order, but on the other <Col N="1039" /> hand there is nobody with sufficient initiative to go round and collect the money from the recalcitrant five or six. Naturally the five or six will not pay. The county councils have power to deal with that.  They can on request of a district strike a rate and collect it economically. It will be a small rate. This is not big engineering work. County surveyors can do it.  Certainly county councils should be expected to do this work if they are expected to do all the work under the Drainage and Maintenance Act of 1924.  That Act was passed by the Dáil and Seanad. Under that Act the Board of Works go into a district, put the drains right, and hand them over to the county councils, who must then take over the maintenance.</P>
    <P>It will be an extraordinary state of affairs if you have county councils on one side keeping in repair fairly considerable rivers running through the original drainage districts, and on the other hand if they are not in a position to look after these small little schemes that are contemplated here.  You can take it for granted if the county council does not take them over, or if somebody has not power to say to the county councils, &ldquo;You must take these schemes over,&rdquo; in a great many cases they will not take them over, or there will be great delay in taking them over.  The interests of the county councils are protected by reason of the fact that this must be done with the concurrence of the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <P>I think on the whole the arguments are in favour of the Minister, and I cannot press the amendment.  I think county councils will consider that they can do these jobs on a more expensive scale than they should be done, but it is very much to be hoped that they will seek the co-operation of the parties who own the land, in doing this work.  In many cases these parties will do the work far more cheaply than it could otherwise be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COUNIHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 23.  To delete the section and to substitute the following new section therefor:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;23.&mdash;When the Land Commission acquire retained holdings, or portion of retained holdings, or any land compulsorily, and an appeal is made to the Judicial Commissioner on a question of price, the Judicial Commissioner shall fix the price in accordance with the prevailing market value of the land at the time and not at a price fair to the Land Commission; and the difference if any shall be paid out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas, anything to the contrary in any previous Land Acts notwithstanding.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister will accept the principle of the amendment, as I am sure he will, <Col N="1041" /> the wording can be altered on report in any way he desires.  This amendment seeks to establish what should be the first principle of every Government&mdash; justice and fair play for every citizen in the State.  I contend that the section of the Land Act of 1923, which states that the Land Commission may acquire land compulsorily anywhere at a price fair to the Land Commission, is not an equitable proposition.  A fair price to the Land Commission cannot be a fair price to the owner.  They are two different prices.  The Minister states quite justly that the Land Commission cannot afford to pay even the price they are paying at present, that they cannot resell land to landless men at a figure based on the price they are giving at the present time.  I contend that the solution lies in this amendment, which states that there may be two prices, a price fixed by the Land Commission which is in accordance with the present price, fair to the Land Commission, and if an appeal is made to the Judicial Commissioner, he shall fix the price in accordance with the market value.</P>
    <P>The Minister will likely ask by whom the difference in price is to be provided. Well, the State has found money for the compensation of persons affected by legislation, who were scarcely as justly entitled to it as those people whose lands are taken for less than the market value.  Since the passing of the 1923 Act, it has injured the agricultural industry in a great many ways. Land is now practically valueless as a security, and it will be valueless while this section remains on the Statute Book.  I contend if this section were repealed, and if land owners and farmers, small and large, felt they had more security in the land they would be more inclined to improve it.  Land would then become a real security again.  To my mind that would be a great boon to the nation, and it would be cheaply purchased at the small amount the Treasury would be called upon to pay to make up the difference between what is considered a fair price to the Land Commission and a fair price to the owner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>My views on this subject are very well known and I do not intend to enlarge on the matter at any great length now.  I do say that the Minister should give us his candid opinion and state after four years' experience of the working of the Act, when the time is likely to come when these powers shall have to cease, as cease they must some time, unless the agricultural industry is to be altogether crippled.  I might refer to one case which the Minister knows as well as I do.  In that case the land is now even worth £30 an acre, but the Land Commission has come in and taken it over at £17.  That occurred in the case of a man who is not possessed of a great deal of this world's wealth and he has been brought to the verge of financial ruin.  The virus of that poison is eating into the vitals of our whole economic life.  It is refreshing to have at least one ally here who is a self-made farmer.  I say that of him in the fullest complimentary sense&mdash;a man who has built up a strong position by his own industry, a man who cannot be called a landlord, or who inherited broad acres, but who made his way in the world by his own efforts. I feel that a great many others are already with us, but for reasons which I need not enlarge upon they cannot very well give open expression to their views.  The time is coming when this will be a vital issue amongst farmers, and the sooner the strong men, the ambitious men, the men who wish to use and increase the productivity of their land&mdash;call them profiteers if you like&mdash;the men who are spending money to earn more money, who are real wealth producers and real active agents of progress, come out and say this thing must stop, the better.  It certainly cannot go on.</P>

      <P>I take it that the amendment moved by Senator Counihan means that the general taxpayer is asked to make up the difference between what is alleged to be the true market value of the land and the price which the Land Commission can afford to give the owner.  If that is so, it is the general taxpayer who will have to bear the burden.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Counihan's point is this&mdash;that the man whose land has been taken has to bear the burden and he does not consider it fair that that portion of the community whose land has been taken over should bear the whole loss for the sake of the community.  It is for the benefit of the community the land is being purchased. I cannot see why the men, whose land is being taken over in order that a certain portion of the community should be supplied with land, should bear the expense of that operation.  Senator Counihan's contention is that if such a measure is necessary for the need of the community, it should not be carried out at the expense of the people whose land is to be taken.  We know that the Land Commission cannot pay the full market value of the land.  The fair price given by the Land Commission is not the market value of the land.</P>
      <P>We get a case where an estate has been valued by the Estate Commissioners, and after it is valued by them the Land Commission comes along and values it, and there is a difference of 10 or 15 per cent. between the two valuations.  It has been found that the lowest valuation of the two is always the valuation of the Land Commission. Here you have two Government Departments in direct opposition.  What Senator Counihan is suggesting is that where a case so clear as that exists, the Judge should have some consideration for the market value, and that the State should pay the difference between the two values, and the loss should not fall on the parties whose land is being taken over.  We who have something to do with monetary affairs in the country have come to see that free sale in land property in Ireland is being steadily killed by the present system.  Now, free sale was that for which so many people were fighting so long ago.  That is now being steadily destroyed.  It is being destroyed, not so much by what is being done as by the fear of what is going to be done.  No man will buy land because he knows that the Land Commission has power to come in and take it at their price.  Over the whole country there broods this terror.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> We know that land can be taken over by the Land Commission at a price that is settled by the buyer and not by the public demand for that land at all.  If the Governments in the future decide that that is to go on for ever, then land will steadily come down in value and there will be no free sale for land and nobody will try to improve his land and work his land as long as this fear is hanging over him. We all grant that.  I know that special land legislation was necessary, but it ought to come to an end.  This right to buy land at a price that is not a fair price to the man whose land is being bought, should be put an end to, and I do think that Senator Counihan's amendment would be going a long way towards helping us to get a better sale for the land, and bring about a condition of things that would make for improvement on the land, because the people would know they were going to get the fair market price for it, and not the price fixed by the Land Commission, who from the very nature of their duties, cannot afford to give for the land what it is worth.</P>

      <P>I am not touching on the merits of this amendment, but I want to make one observation in reference to what Senator Jameson says as to free sale of land.  I think it is as well to state that during the boom period farmers bought land at prices far and away beyond the value.  They have not been able to make the land pay interest and bank charges.  But the absence of free sales does not arise from the economic conditions of the country so much as from the intimidation exercised by the neighbours.  There would be free sale all over the country but for this intimidation.  It may be possible that the operations of the Land Commission may tend to make the prospective buyer timorous, but I think the intimidation is the greatest factor, and I think it is as well to state that fact.</P>

      <P>If that amendment is carried it will entail selling the land to the tenants at uneconomic prices, at prices which would make the land uneconomic for them.  It is extraordinary to listen to the arguments put forward by Senators Counihan, Sir John Keane and Jameson.  One would imagine that it was only people with large holdings of land in the past who had done their duty by the community.  I think that anyone who has taken the trouble of going into the question of tillage in Ireland, will find that so far from that being the case, the people who are doing their duty by the public are not the big landowners.  In fact it is these very people who are neglecting their duty.  It is recognised by the Land Commission, and Senator Sir John Keane himself knows it that the amount of food produced by tillage land is three and a half times that produced by the same land used as grazing land. Anyone who looks up the statistics connected with Irish agriculture will find that the percentage of tillage is greater in the case of the smaller landowner and that the larger the holding is, the smaller is the percentage of tillage.  I do not know why Senators Sir John Keane and Counihan should get up here and talk about those men who are prepared to work their land well, and give an amount of employment and all the rest of it.  To try and place them in a position that they have not held in the past will not hold water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt about it, it is very interesting to hear Senator Sir John Keane congratulating Senator Counihan on being a successful farmer.  To my mind the term &ldquo;successful farmer&rdquo; means that these men were in a position to take a great deal of land on the eleven months' system, and graze it. It was not from tillage farming that this wonderful success was achieved. I think that any steps that we might take here that may interfere with the division of land and the dividing up of land in small economic holdings, and giving it to people who are prepared to work it and live out of it, would not be <Col N="1047" /> right, and would not be for the good of the community.  Consequently I will have much pleasure in voting against this amendment.  Further than that, I think that the Land Commission, if they err at all in this matter, err because of giving too great a price for the land rather than giving too little for it.  If the agricultural future of the country is to be secured, it is by giving a minimum price for the land. As a matter of fact, it was doubtful whether in real equity any landowner, or at least the large landowner in any case is entitled to any compensation at all.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw attention to what I consider a great injustice in connection with land purchase.  Tenants were placed by the Land Commission in possession of holdings that were supposed to be economic, but that were really uneconomic, as owing to the price paid for the land rents had to be charged to those tenants which were quite impossible for them to pay.  I know cases where big areas were purchased by the Land Commission, and divided up.  Instead of there being any development of tillage for the last few years, I regret to say there has been a decline by reason of its unprofitableness, owing to foreign competition, which is the ruling factor in prices.  Eighty per cent. of our food stuffs come from foreign countries. That explains why tillage has been declining. It is not because people have not the inclination to till, but because of the loss they see staring them in the face if they did till.  These people, in their anxiety to get possession of land, thought that by getting it they were going out of purgatory into heaven. My experience is they had not sufficient money to stock the land, and they started by sub-letting it.  I gave evidence before a Commission, of which Senator Sir John Keane was a member, and I then said a condition that should apply to a tenant getting a farm from the Land Commission should be that he would give an undertaking not to sublet that land for ten years, so that he would have an interest in his land. Those people who have got those dear <Col N="1048" /> divisions of land have been trying to let them, and in a great many cases they are bankrupt.  Those tenants who got the land under such circumstances ought to be helped, just as much as the other class of people whose land was purchased.</P>

      <P>This is a Second Reading question, and it is hard to discuss it in Committee.  I suggest that this talk of security, and being injured, is overdone.  Senator Jameson, who is in a strong position to discuss this question, stated that owing to the operations of the Land Commission, and the insecurity caused by these operations, a serious state of affairs is arising in the country.  That is a grave statement coming from a Senator who is in a position to know.  It surprises me.  I cannot understand it in the light of the facts as I know them.  We are not discussing whether certain classes are being treated fairly or not.  The serious question has been raised that there is widespread insecurity because of the operations of the Land Commission, and that that is leading to the neglect of land and taking away the initiative from the farmers, and generally having a bad effect all over the country.  How can that be when out of 14,000,000 acres of land I should say there are not more than 3,000,000 acres of untenanted land left.  I had the figures some time ago, but they are not available at the moment, and the number might be a million less or a million more.  I know that it is only a small proportion of the land of the country.  The rest of the land is tenanted and purchased land.  You can take it that over 80 per cent. of the land, and the best land, is tenanted and purchased land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission cannot take tenanted land except at a resumption price.  That is the position, roughly speaking, since 1881.  The provisions were preserved in the Act of 1923.  So far as the tenanted land is concerned the Land Commission cannot resume one acre of it except at its market value.  How then is its security value lost from the point of view of the banker?  The Land Commission cannot <Col N="1049" /> take land subject to land purchase annuities unless they give an equally suitable and not less valuable holding to the tenant purchaser.  That question has been decided by the High Court.  There is not a banker in Ireland who does not know that when a judge has decided that question the bias always, and rightly so, will be on the side of the tenant.  How then is security affected?  There are areas where there is, and always has been, free sale of tenanted land subject to land purchase annuities.  In those areas security of the land has not been affected one iota, because if the Land Commission take the lands they must take them in one case at resumption price, and, in the other, subject to land purchase annuities on the condition of giving an equally suitable and not less valuable holding to the person from whom they take it.  The Land Commission is a good pay, the money is forthcoming and the land is forthcoming. How, then, in the areas where there is a free sale of land are we affected in security?  I cannot see it.  There is as great security in Ireland, especially in certain parts of the country, as in other countries, but there have always been areas where sale has not been exactly free.</P>
    <P>I say that in these years we should have increased the security of the land. When we took tenanted land we took it in an area where there was no other land suitable for the relief of congestion. As a rule, the chances of selling such land in such an area are not extremely bright.  They are less than they would be in another area, and when we put out a tenant from there and gave him a market value, he got 20/- in the pound for the first time in his life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree he does not want it, but I am not on the question whether we are treating a class equitably or not when we took them out.  We are giving them twenty shillings to the pound, and the land was never worth it to them before.  The same, even in a stronger sense, applies to a man who has purchased a holding, say, in Connemara <Col N="1050" /> or West Mayo or Donegal, where we are taking that sort of land. He has a far more valuable holding than his previous one, so for the life of me I cannot see how we are affecting the security as far as 80 per cent. of the land of the country is concerned.  I say we are improving it.  If I were told that the Land Commission was acting illegally, I could understand it, but the net result is that, as a result of purchase, land as a security is being interfered with, I say, only as far as it is untenanted land, and untenanted land does not exhaust a greater proportion than, I should say, one-tenth of the land of the country at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They take tenanted land, untenanted land, and land subject to an annuity, but under different conditions.  They take tenanted land and land subject to an annuity in the west, where there is no other land. When they do they take it in such a way as, in my opinion, subject to what anyone else has to say, it is not interfered with as a banking security.  On the contrary, I think it ought to improve it.  Now, take untenanted land and remember I am dealing with about 10 per cent. of the land left in the country, not much more.  That is substantially correct.  We cannot discuss this question as if it were an entirely new one, as if the first time we heard of land purchase was 1923.  What was untenanted land ever worth as a security since 1860?  It was in, say, County Meath.  We are going into new counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was untenanted land in places like Meath, and perhaps in other places in the Midlands, where there were no congests.  Remember, these areas comprise only a very small proportion of the total area of untenanted land which, in turn, is only a small proportion of the total area of the land of the country, leaving out Meath, Westmeath, and the Midlands.  Was untenanted land ever a good security since 1840?  Of course it was not.  Agitation centred around it, and the Act of 1923 <Col N="1051" /> was an attempt to regularise that agitation. The Land Act of 1923 is its legitimate child, its direct descendant. So far as untenanted land has been affected, and it has always been affected to some extent, in the whole country except an area like Meath, it was not affected by our legislation.  It was always affected, and will be so until this western problem of congestion is settled.</P>
    <P>Now you ask my view upon that question.  We hear a lot about congested districts, the Gaeltacht, and so on. It was discussed the other day in the Seanad.  Everybody seems to be taking a special interest in it; in land purchase, and so on and so forth.  It is good politics.  What are you going to do with it?  Rightly or wrongly you can at least start by ruling out of all possibility certain remedies stated very often.  We heard all about rural industries, teachers, subsidies, grants and so on.  These are not going to be a permanent remedy for congestion. Everyone knows they never can be, and only keep the problem alive.  So far as you can do anything sound it must be on the lines of land purchase.  Let us admit that, and consider whether it is worth while.  It is another question to go ahead and do it.  Start with this: In so far as you can do anything sound and economical for the small farmers, it will be on the lines of land purchase. Again I suggest you can do a lot, without affecting security, both for the small farmer in the West and the big farmer by transferring the big farmer to another part of the country.  You give him land which is security for the first time, and you leave his land in the West for dealing with the congests. People talk about landless men, but it is not landless men who get this land, but the congests.</P>
    <P>There is another misconception about land purchase.  You hear a lot of stories about people who fail on the land.  Practically no congests have failed on the land.  There was more land divided in Galway than in any other county in Ireland and more than a quarter of the whole land divided in Ireland, since the Land Act of 1923 was passed.  After inquiry we <Col N="1052" /> have been only able to trace one farm in Galway that has reverted back, not to the original owner, but that has been secretly bought up.  There were over 300,000 acres of untenanted land divided in Galway alone, and on inquiry it has been found that practically no congests placed on that land have failed.  It is very easy to point out some congests who are not working their land well.  But there are some landowners who are not working their land well and some tenants who are not working their land well.  We all know that the times are difficult now and that it is difficult to get money.  The most sensible thing for a man to do who has got 30 acres of land if he cannot work it all is to let some of it and work the balance.  I have dealt with these points because they were raised on the amendment, but they are all issues more proper to a Second Reading debate.  With regard to this amendment we had the very same complaints in reference to the Wyndham Act, and we did no more in the Land Act of 1923 than was done in the 1909 Act and other Acts. The Land Commission has bought the land it required after paying a fair price to the owner.  These things are not new to this country.  It is no use discussing them as if there had never been a land agitation, as if this problem had not historical roots, and as if land was always as excellent a security here as if it was situated in Surrey in England.  I will make any admissions once comparisons of that sort are started, but if you take them out and say we will buy land at what you call the market value that would stop land purchase.  That admission was made at the beginning once and for all when land purchase was undertaken.  You would stop land purchase or alternatively the State will have to find between half a million and a million for the next ten years.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has proved the justice of my case in his closing remarks.  He said that the Land Commission would have to close down except one-tenth of the farmers of the country contribute the whole price&mdash;about £500,000 a year, that is, the Treasury would have to put up £500,000 a year or otherwise the Land Commission would have to close its doors.  If every farmer in the country was compelled to contribute to the relief of congestion I would say it was just, but when you take one-tenth of the farmers and say: &ldquo;You must sell your property to the Land Commission and lose from half a million to one million owing to congestion,&rdquo; I say it is unfair.  The Minister said that only untenanted land will be taken at less than its market value.  But what constitutes untenanted land?  Untenanted land, under the 1923 Act, is land held under a lease for lives or years, of which sixty or more have to run, and land held under a fee-farm grant and land held in fee-simple.  Take the case of a farmer who may have purchased his holding paying interest to the Land Commission.  That farm may be only 20 acres, but he may have 200 acres held under fee-farm grant.  That is untenanted land, and that land can be taken from him or portion of it, and he will only get two-thirds of the market value.</P>
