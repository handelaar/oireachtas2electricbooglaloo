      <P>The following Message has been received from the Dáil in connection with this Bill:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Dáil Eireann agrees to amendments Nos. 1 to 12 made by Seanad Eireann to the Juries Bill, 1927; it agrees to amendment No. 13 as amended by the deletion of the words &ldquo;unless paid out of public funds&rdquo; in Part II.; to which the agreement of Seanad Eireann is desired.</P>
      <P>The particular matter to which it refers is where the Dáil has made an addition in the amendments sent down from this House.</P>
      <P>It is to be found in Part 2 of the Schedule, after the words &ldquo;Persons actually employed as professors, schoolmasters or teachers in any university, college, school or academy, unless paid out of public funds.&rdquo;  The amendment made by the Dáil was to delete the words &ldquo;unless paid out of public funds.&rdquo;  The question is: Does this House agree to the change?</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Standing Orders be suspended from the 18th to the 23rd May, 1927, inclusive, for the purpose of allowing more than one stage of any Bill to be taken on the same day.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> I have set down this notice of motion for the purpose of facilitating the discharge of business by this House for the rest of the Session.  As is indicated on the Order Paper, there are a large number of Bills to be dealt with.  Most of them are non-controversial, but it would facilitate matters, and, in fact, will be necessary and expedite the business, to take two Stages of some of these Bills, perhaps all of them, on the same day.  Under our Standing Orders two clear days' notice is necessary to suspend the Standing Orders, and if we had to suspend the Standing Orders for each of these Bills it would require five or six separate notices of motion to do so, with two clear days' notice between each one.  If this motion is carried in the form I have put it down, one motion will be sufficient for all purposes, and the advantage will be that we will be able to arrange our business to suit our own convenience as to the way these Bills will come before us.  It is quite obvious that the motion is one which would greatly facilitate the business of this House.</P>

      <P>I rise to oppose this motion, as I cannot see any reasonable case for it.  Crowds of Bills have been, on many occasions, sent up to us for discussion or, perhaps I should say, to be passed without discussion, and on each occasion during the last two years I have objected to this method of doing business.  It is only a few months since our Standing Orders were changed to try to prevent that state of affairs.  No doubt there have been occasions when matters of great national importance necessitated something being done.  The Seanad on these <Col N="1475" /> occasions, I think, smilingly agreed to carry out the wishes of the Dáil.  There were other occasions on which the Seanad did not approve smilingly, but nevertheless they complied grudgingly. Before agreeing to a motion of this sort we ought to ask if there is any national reason or any great emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">

      <P>A very poor effort, one, at all events, to which I cannot agree.  We have Standing Orders and unless there is some emergency we should not suspend them.  If Senator Brown said that some of these matters were very important there might be some reason for doing so. We have a number of Bills to come before us that are of the greatest national importance.  There are two Finance Bills, an Electricity Bill and the Agricultural Credit Bill.  All these are important and we are asked to swallow them practically without reasonable discussion.  I must say that I cannot see any reason for that except that the Government has chosen to set down a certain date for the election, for which they can give no reason.  If they said this election was necessary for some extraordinary reason, that would be something to go on, but they have not given one word of a reason. They simply say: &ldquo;We are going to have an election on a certain date,&rdquo; and probably they have chosen that period for some reason that they have not given; that they are keen on. Public opinion and the Press have agreed that it is most improper that Bills should be passed without proper <Col N="1476" /> consideration.  For that reason I oppose the motion.  As far as I can understand it, the only reason Ministers have for proposing a sudden dissolution is that their association is beginning to get nervous at the idea of their policy being criticised all over the country for a lengthy period and that a calamity is likely to happen to them.  Perhaps there is some other reason.  If so, why do they not give it? They take three or four of the most important Bills that ever came before this House and ask us to dash through them and pass them.  I am rather astonished that Senator Brown proposes such a motion.  I always regarded him as a very independent Senator.  That is the reason he was elected.  Still, he comes down and, for what seems to me party reasons, wants to get Bills through in a great hurry and wipe out all he has ever said about proper discussion of Bills.  I protest against any such thing being done.</P>

    <Title>AGRICULTURAL CREDIT BILL, 1927&mdash;SECOND STAGE.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Agricultural Credit Bill, 1927, be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan) MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for the establishment of an institution to be known as the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The share capital will be £500,000, with a maximum rate of interest of five per cent., the capital and interest to be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  The Corporation shall have the right to issue certificates, to be subscribed for by the public, in denominations to be settled afterwards, with a rate of interest to be not more than three per cent. over and above the bank rate, up to a maximum of £7,000,000, or £1,000,000 in any one year.  The principal and interest of these certificates will also be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  The Corporation may take deposits from co-operative societies, and powers are given to it to issue debentures for, I suppose, temporary purposes.  That is to say, <Col N="1477" /> the Corporation will be financed from two or three sources; (1) share capital up to £500,000, (2) money obtained on certificates up to a maximum of £7,000,000, and (3) deposits from co-operative societies, but not from individuals.  That money is to be available for agricultural credit, for farmers and for farming purposes on the one hand, and for farmers' organisations, such as co-operative societies, on the other.</P>
      <P>The purposes for which the money is to be available are set out in some detail in Section 12.  They speak for themselves and I need not go into them fully.  They will be for ordinary productive purposes such as stocking, farm buildings, and drainage, and so far as co-operative societies are concerned, for the establishment of co-operative societies and for the carrying on of their business.  The Corporation will also act as a sort of clearing house for credit societies.  Credit societies are particularly useful in certain poor districts where the average loan required is anything from £20 to £50, where the ordinary farmer has not very much security to offer as an individual, and consequently it is necessary to get some sort of extra security, the only sort of security he can get, by means of the establishment of a credit society. In my opinion these credit societies will be extremely useful in the really poorer districts, in West Donegal, West Mayo, Connemara and such places.  The Corporation will act as a clearing house for these credit societies, that is to say, it will take surplus deposits, if they have any surplus deposits, and on the other hand will make money available to societies that need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also somewhat of a new departure in this Bill.  There is an attempt to establish what is known as a chattel mortgage.  A chattel mortgage is really an agricultural bill of sale.  It has been the view of every Commission that considered the matter for a long time past that some sort of extra security should be made available for the small farmer in order that he might get the capital he requires. Practically all the Commissions that have dealt with this question have recommended <Col N="1478" /> the same thing, something in the nature of a chattel mortgage. There is a chattel mortgage for agriculture in America at the moment, and I think in some of the Dominions also but the conditions there are, of course, entirely different from the conditions here, and we cannot make any general deduction from American, New Zealand or Australian conditions, and apply them here.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it is obvious that the Irish farmer, of all farmers, needs some additional form of security.  Land is not a good security at the moment, mainly through the farmers' own fault, mainly because it is quite impossible to sell land in the event of the mortgagee being unable to collect his debts.  Whatever the reasons may be, land is not an extra good security, and the condition of things at the moment is that the small farmer, or the big farmer, who wants to get anything from £50 to £200 gets it on a three months' bill, signed by three or four of his neighbours, brings them into town for that purpose, spends the day in town, and has to repeat that process at the end of every three months.  That is most unsatisfactory and extremely expensive. The ordinary bank rate of interest is high enough, but when you have to add to the bank rate of interest the cost of entertainment, and so on, and the time that is lost, not only in the case of the man himself, but in the case of two or three others, the whole transaction becomes most unsatisfactory and most expensive.  Yet, that is the only alternative at the moment as far as farmers are concerned.  A mortgage on land is not a form of security that banks are particularly anxious for, for the reasons given.  If there was good reason for attempting to establish some system of chattel mortgage in other countries, it seems to me that there is a particularly good reason in this country. The trouble is that there are a number of difficulties of detail to be settled, and it is extremely hard to settle them.</P>
    <P>Everyone would agree that a chattel mortgage, on the face of it, is a reasonable sort of security for the farmer who wants to stock land, especially the particular type of farmer who got a holding <Col N="1479" /> under the Land Purchase Acts. That sort of security looks reasonable, and the sort of security he ought to have.  But when you try to give legislative effect to a chattel mortgage, you find difficulties at once.  The trouble is that all the Commissions that examined this question have left the whole matter very much in the air.  None of them made a serious attempt to solve these problems.  I suppose that is because of their magnitude.  It seems to me that we can never carry the question any further until somebody tries to foresee the difficulties and solve them, embody the results in an Act of Parliament, and put it into operation. I do not pretend for a moment that the particular section dealing with a chattel mortgage is water-tight.  I believe it is not.  But I believe that we will never discover where it needs repair, except by establishing a chattel mortgage and putting it into operation. If afterwards it needs adaptation, correction, enlargement, or variation, our office is there to do it.  The alternatives I was faced with when considering the question were either to drop the whole idea where the Commissioners have dropped it, and leave it as a pious wish, or, on the other hand, to insert some provision for a chattel mortgage, and try to put it into operation.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that a chattel mortgage shall be taken by the Corporation itself, or by any of the recognised banks, and by nobody else, and that it shall be registered.  Of course, rents, rates, taxes, and some other charges of that sort have priority, but ordinary debts have not.  The chattel mortgage shall be registered in a secret register to be kept in the office of the County Registrar, to be available for the banks and for the Corporation.  It was the opinion of the Banking Commission, and it was the opinion, I think, of the 1914 Commission on Credits&mdash; which was generally agreed to be a very competent body&mdash;that secrecy was essential for the successful working of a chattel mortgage.  I agree, but I do not think it is right.  I think we have to get to the time in this country when an overdraft is looked upon as an ordinary <Col N="1480" /> commercial necessity, as it is in every go-ahead commercial country&mdash;to the time when people will have all their money invested in productive enterprises, and will try to borrow money cheaply to get into more.  At the moment we are a long way from that, and I am satisfied that unless there is a secret register&mdash;a register at least fairly secret&mdash;you will not have this chattel mortgage availed of.</P>
    <P>The difficulties, of course, are with the secret register.  If you had an open register, then shopkeepers and everybody else would know where they are, but no one would avail of it.  If you have a secret register, I think it will be availed of.  I do not think, when it comes to an examination of the matter, that you are going to injure the ordinary trader very much at all.  That is a matter I discussed with traders.  They agreed in the main that so far as eighty per cent. of their customers are concerned trade is done on the security of the character of the customer, and that this secret chattel register will only affect their dealings with about twenty per cent. of the customers.  It will simply mean that the shopkeeper will be very careful about giving credit to twenty per cent. of his customers, and you provide men, including that twenty per cent., with readier means of getting money and, consequently, doing a cash business, which is so much the better for the shopkeeper, and certainly so much the better for the farmer. There is too much illegitimate credit in this country&mdash;if I may put it in that way.  It is no harm that there should be a tendency to get back to definite institutions for credit, and outside that doing, so far as possible, a cash business.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for the chattel mortgage.  I do not think I need go into it in detail.  As I say, everyone knows what a chattel mortgage is.  It may be taken on any chattels&mdash;it may be a floating chattel mortgage for all the chattels of the farm, or a specific chattel mortgage or both.  A floating chattel mortgage may be made specific and brought down to definite chattels.</P>
    <P>The Corporation itself will do purely and entirely a long-term and intermediate-term business.  The proper <Col N="1481" /> function of joint stock banks is, of course, a short-term business, but they are able to do intermediate-term and even long-term business with a limited number of customers.  They have, however, never been designed to do an entirely long-term business.  On the other hand, only long-term loans in the main, including some intermediate-term loans, are suitable for agriculture. At the best of times, there are only small profits from farming, and a loan cannot be repaid except over a pretty long period.  The banks cannot give loans for a long period.  This Corporation is a recognition of the fact that agriculture needs not only additional credits but, in particular and principally, different kinds of credits for certain purposes.  For productive purposes especially it needs long-term credits, and there is no institution at present specially suitable for giving those long-term credits.  As the Corporation will be confined to long-term credits, it will not cut across the operations of the joint stock banks in any way.  On the other hand, it will undoubtedly strengthen them.  I need not elaborate that at any length.  Any banker will see that it will undoubtedly strengthen them.  It is contemplated&mdash; of course these are all matters for arrangement afterwards&mdash;that this Corporation will be merely a central institution with no branches through the country.  There is no reason that there should be.  It would be an expensive process.  Apart from that there are the ordinary joint stock banks, and it is more than likely that it will be possible to make an arrangement with them that their branches shall act as agents for this Corporation.</P>
    <P>I realise that when we are making arrangements to give additional credits to agriculture we are doing something that is badly needed.  It would have been a mistake, however, to my mind, to provide additional credits for agriculture for the last three or four years.  It is a mistake, especially in an agricultural country, to provide anything like extensive credits on a falling market.  But when prices have fallen and have become stabilised, then credits are wanted and can safely be given.  I think, therefore, <Col N="1482" /> that the establishment of this Corporation just at this time is particularly opportune and useful.  We realise, also, that when we are attempting to provide additional credits for agriculture there is a duty on the other side&mdash;that it is absolutely essential to provide more complete arrangements for collecting bad debts, and this Bill provides for that.  It provides that any person obtaining a loan by a misstatement, or misusing a loan when obtained for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was given, shall be punished by criminal penalties.  So that what I really anticipate under the Bill is that it will make it more easy for the honest man to get credit and more easy to collect debts from the defaulter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as an attempt to deal with a serious aspect of agricultural life.  I am very glad to have had the explanation from the Minister with regard to chattel mortgage.  I had the fear that Section 25 was very loose and that the strictures, so to speak, on the chattel mortgager were very severe.  The Minister assures us it is not water-tight, and one would hope that certain arrangements will be made whereby the conditions which seem so very harsh on the mortgager will possibly be eliminated or made less severe.  I allude particularly to paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) whereby the mortgager is prohibited from selling any farming stock comprised in the chattel mortgage without giving at least three days' previous notice in writing to the mortgagee of his intention to sell the same, and from selling any of such farm stock for less than a fair and reasonable price.  The Minister must be aware, and we must all be aware, that when people mortgage stock it must be for some cause or other pending a sale of stock.  It may be that they are dealing with the mortgagee who lives in Dublin and it may be difficult to get in touch with the mortgagee within three days, to acquaint him that the mortgager is about to sell some stock.  That is a provision that will have to be rectified. I may be reading the section carelessly, <Col N="1483" /> but it does seem to me that the defect that I have indicated is inherent in the paragraph.  Then again, with regard to paragraph (f), that imposes on the mortgager the obligation to preserve and keep safe the farming stock comprised therein.  I wonder if that means that the mortgager has to insure his farm stock.  It would be a very desirable provision, no doubt, but we have to remember that insurance rates are very expensive and that if the ordinary farmer is asked under these provisions, in addition to other charges, to insure his farm stock for chattel mortgage I am afraid that the conditions imposed will tend to the elimination of any advantage that a Bill like this would otherwise produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other section in the Bill to which I would like to allude.  That is Section 13.  Paragraph (a) says: &ldquo;The Corporation shall not be entitled to receive deposits of money or deposits of securities for safe keeping and management from any persons except co-operative societies.&rdquo;  That means that a farmer will be prohibited if he so desires from lodging money on deposit with the Corporation which has been framed to assist him.  I think that is hardly a fair section.  After all, this Bill is a very necessary Bill, and it takes off the shoulders of the joint stock banks a business which, I think, we all hold is not a satisfactory business, and not purely a banking business at all.  But if you want to put that Corporation on a strong basis, I think it is only reasonable that the people for whom the Bill is arranged should be allowed, if they so desire, to lend money on deposit to the Corporation, which would be available for use amongst themselves.  There may be a strong reason why that should not be, as the Government are responsible for the capital of the Corporation.  But if they are assured, as they will be assured, that the management of the Corporation will be all that can be desired&mdash;if in the event of more than £200,000 being invested by the Government they will have the appointment of the Chairman of the Corporation&mdash;there would be no fear of any deposits made by the farmers with the <Col N="1484" /> Corporation being ill-used or ill-spent. They would get in that way a larger sum of money than would be available under the Bill as it stands.  I think a larger sum of money could be carefully and economically used, and I do not think that this section is a reasonable one.  I would ask the Minister to give us some explanation as to why it was thought necessary to insert that particular section in the Bill.  I think, on the whole, the Bill has been carefully thought out, with these exceptions, which, I think, are important.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, believing that it is a step towards what is essentially necessary in a country like Ireland, namely, to secure that men can borrow money when they are determined to pay that money back.  I think the Bill will go far towards doing that.  I think we should try to ensure that the mortgager, who very often cannot be presumed to be a very careful or knowledgeable businessman, will not be put in an unfair position between the mortgagee and the Corporation.  I welcome the Bill as an honest attempt to deal with the present situation.</P>

      <P>I do not think I agree with the construction the Senator put upon paragraph (f) of clause 25, namely, that imposing upon the mortgager the obligation to preserve and keep safe the farming stock. I do not think any court would construe that as involving an obligation to insure, because if so it would have been very simple to say &ldquo;shall insure.&rdquo; I think all the section means is that a man must not allow his stock to stray about, and that he must look after their feeding and their health, and that he must take reasonable care, as every farmer should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. GOGARTY Dr. GOGARTY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>Without indulging in any financial high-falutin, which I am not capable of indulging in, I should like, in supporting this Bill, to make this reflection.  The very existence of the Bill is, in itself, a reflection upon the inadequacy of the Irish joint stock banks.  The Irish joint stock banks have always charged a one per cent. higher rate of interest than the English banks.  The English bank rate at <Col N="1485" /> present is 4½ per cent. and the Irish bank rate is 5½ per cent.  It is no excuse to say that the joint stock banks are operating in a country which is essentially agricultural.  If they are Irish joint stock banks they are agricultural banks, and the need for this Bill is a reflection upon their adequacy to meet the needs of the country, which is largely agricultural.  In one way the Bill may be looked upon as very excellent, from the farmer's point of view, but in another way it may be enabling the poor farmer to pawn his furniture to meet the deflation caused by the banks in this country by the additional one per cent. higher rate of interest than is charged by the banks in England.  There is no mention in this Bill of the rate at which the money is to be lent, but I do hope that the Minister will see that money is lent at a rate equal at least to the current rate of interest charged by the banks in England.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the many branches that the Irish banks have and he said this Corporation will not have branches.  I am glad to hear that, because that will mean a tremendous saving of expense.  Some of the best insurance companies have not got branches, with the result that they give their clients the benefit of the savings effected thereby.  If the farmer is to get money to re-stock his land which was depleted sometimes through his own anxiety to sell when prices were high or from other causes, accidental or otherwise, the money ought to be lent to him at a rate equal to the rate current in the English banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is really a Land Bank which we are setting up.  It is a corporation to lend some millions of money, and I suppose it has a sort of guarantee about the people to whom the money will be lent.  Its chief advantage will be that it will make long-term loans. I do not see why if debts are outstanding the joint stock banks could not make long-term loans.  I welcome the Bill, and I hope there will be a proviso that the rate of interest will not be higher than the Bank rate in England. The English farmers are in a far worse position than our Irish farmers to-day. <Col N="1486" /> Farms can be sold in England cheaper than in Ireland, even though they are assets.  On account of the agitation here no one would lend twopence on an acre of land, because if anyone bought it he would be shot.  That may make for security of tenure, but it certainly does not make for currency of credit.</P>
    <P>In England, on account of the fact that the population of the world is spreading quicker than the agricultural yield, agriculture is in a very bad way. There is the suggestion in the papers to-day to endow plough land.  We are far ahead of them in England because we are taking this step, a step which it will be incumbent on England to take later owing to the parlous condition of agriculture in what may be called the home counties.  As an indication of that there will be a limit sooner or later as a result of an improvement in English agriculture in the matter of a sale for our produce on the English market.  That is another reason why one should support this Bill.  It will enable us to meet competition following the improvements that are certain to be made in England.  There is no doubt but that the agricultural conditions in England are being put on a footing that will militate against the sale of our cattle in England.  I welcome the Bill because I think it will provide us with a valuable sort of security against the improved conditions that are certain to obtain, sooner or later, in England.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and think it is a very advantageous one.  This is a matter with which I had some concern in the past in parts of the West of Ireland.  I must say, speaking from experience, that the people who obtained loans of money from agricultural societies or loan societies were extraordinarily honest in the matter of meeting their obligations.  I was acquainted for a long time with an agricultural society in the West of Ireland.  The people who were trusted with loans of money from that society to enable them to buy various things, never failed to repay the loans they obtained.  In fact, they paid without any difficulty whatever.  I must say that some of the banks at that time did <Col N="1487" /> help a great deal in the matter of giving loans whenever they got any security at all.  There is just one point to which I desire to call attention.  It is to paragraph (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 12.  It states that the Corporation will be entitled to lend or advance money &ldquo;only to the persons and for the purpose hereinafter stated, that is to say (e) to any person (other than a co-operative society) for the purpose of paying off a loan which was originally made to him (whether before or after the passing of this Act) wholly or mainly for a purpose for which a loan could under this section be made to him under this section by the Corporation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The effect of that paragraph seems to me to be this: that the Corporation is to take over from the banks loans which they granted to farmers in former times, at a time when money was at a much cheaper rate than it is now and when prices were higher.  I see great danger to the farmers themselves in that, and I know that a great many farmers object to it.  Indeed, I have been asked by some farmers to press to have it altered in some way.  Some few years ago, when high prices ruled for agricultural produce and other things, numbers of farmers rushed to the banks and got loans of money to enable them to buy land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true. They did, as a matter of fact, rush to the banks.  The banks welcomed them, and sometimes when a farmer went to a bank to do his ordinary business he was persuaded reluctantly to take a loan of money.  Sometimes the farmers were not anxious to take the loans, but they were encouraged by the banks to do so in order that they might buy land on loans.  It is true, of course, that many people at that time, farmers and others, did not look to the future as they ought to have done.  It may be that they had not sufficient experience, but at any rate they ought to have known that the high prices that ruled at that time could not continue, and that prices were bound to drop after a <Col N="1488" /> certain period.  The fact anyway is that they borrowed large sums of money from the banks.  Then the period followed when deflation occurred and when agricultural prices fell.  The land and the stock that constituted a good security for the loans at the time they were obtained from the banks are no longer a security.  Suppose, for instance, that the banks were to sell up these people, they would not be able to get their money back.  The danger that I see in this paragraph is this: that the public are going to be asked to take over these bad debts incurred by the banks.  We all know that in other cases, such, for instance, as railway stock, consols and other forms of securities, if prices fall the people who hold the stock are obliged to bear the loss, but here, as far as I can see&mdash;I am not giving this opinion in any definite way and the Minister will correct me if what I am stating is not the effect of the paragraph&mdash;the banks will get clear of all these bad debts that they have contracted with people who are not now able to meet their obligations.  The position apparently is to be that the Government is to take over these debts from the banks and is to pay them off.  The farmers concerned are then to become liable to the Government, and if the Government is not able to recover from the farmers, then the general public will lose.  That is the position as far as I see it.  I think it is very undesirable that such a state of affairs should be created.  I hope the Minister will give the House an explanation as to how the Government proposes to meet this particular point with which I have been dealing.</P>

      <P>Representing, as I do, the General Council of County Councils of the Free State, a body which is mainly concerned with agriculture, I welcome this Bill.  It has the hearty approval of the General Council.  With regard to the remarks of the last speaker, I do not see anything in the Bill that compels, as the speaker suggested, the Agricultural Board to take over any of those floating debts from any bank.  The Board will deal with applications, with the security of the Government, entirely apart from the <Col N="1489" /> fact whether the money is needed to pay off a banking debt or any other form of debt.  There is a provision in the Bill, of course, which states that money can be advanced even for paying off a debt which was incurred for a purpose for which money might be advanced under this Bill.  The objects for which advances are to be made are set out, and if the loan, in respect of which the debt was incurred by the farmer, was advanced for the purposes or for the objects for which money could be advanced under this Bill, the debtor can come forward to the Society and ask for money to pay off that debt.  The General Council of County Councils in considering that particular clause said that it would be only right that such portion of the debt should be taken over by the Board as would be covered by security.  That is to say, if the loan originally was fully covered for £100, and that owing to the depression in the value of land the cover had shrunk to an amount of about £50, then the banks should not expect the Board to pay off £100, the amount of the original debt.</P>
      <P>The banks are like any other trading concerns.  They must take a certain risk.  The money which the banks handle belongs to the public.  It is not their own money.  The directors, no doubt, have some money invested in the banks, but the big bulk of the money which they handle belongs to the public, and they are merely the trustees of it.  If they failed, as it seems they did, in a time of inflation, to exercise sufficient foresight and shovelled out money in loans, and if they had not sufficient prescience to see that there would be an inevitable depression as the aftermath of the war, with a consequent shrinkage in securities, then they must bear the consequences and, like every other trader in the community who has a bad debt, cut their losses.  I am quite sure they will be prepared to do so, and that if any banker says he has a debt of £100 on a farmer and that his security has shrunk to cover only £50, rather than take the onus and the odium of selling out the farmer to get that £50 he will be glad to compromise for the amount which the security will cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> The old system of agricultural credit conducted under the auspices of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society never was, at any time, very popular with the farmers.  One of the essentials was that the farmers should subscribe a certain amount of money. There was a grant from the Government administered through the I.A.O.S. to the amount of £2 for every £1 subscribed, which was, I think, a very great inducement to the public.  Yet the I.A.O.S. did not, during its time, make very much progress and was not, for one reason or another, ever a popular institution with the farming community.</P>
    <P>The General Council of County Councils was of opinion that, in order to offset that want of popularity, seeing that the I.A.O.S. is still one of the factors in the administration proposed in the Bill, and also to offset the probabilities of there being an undue banking influence on the Board, owing to the large holding of shares which the bankers will have, an effort should be made to secure the good-will of the farming community.  It is feared that the Board will be purely a banking board, and that the bankers will have a dominating influence on the Board.  If that were the position they could transfer bad accounts to the Board.  The predominance of their directors on the Board would facilitate a transaction of that sort.  The General Council thought that at least one nomination should be given to a body like the General Council, which is purely and mainly an agricultural body, and which is quite conversant with the conditions that obtain in the different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>There is in the Bill an omission, I think, as to the objects for which money may be advanced.  The Minister, I think, referred to it when addressing his constituents.  He said that one of the objects would be to enable farmers to overhold their stock when the markets are depressed.  We all know that it is customary for farmers at harvest time, when they have sold their grain, to settle up their accounts with shopkeepers. Last autumn they were not able to do so.  Owing, I suppose, to the ring amongst grain merchants, <Col N="1491" /> prices were so depressed that farmers could scarcely get an offer for the grain they had to sell.  They were at the same time pressed by the shopkeepers, who look for payment of accounts about that time.  They had, perforce, to take such prices as were offered to them for their produce.  I think that if the farmers were given facilities to enable them to overhold their produce or their stock, for even two weeks or a month, during which the markets might be in a depressed condition, it would be a source of the greatest convenience and profit to them.  It is the experience of members of the General Council of County Councils that a provision of that kind is an absolute necessity to assist struggling farmers.  I think the Minister did say, when addressing his constituents, that one of the objects for which money could be advanced was to enable farmers to overhold their stock during periods of depression.</P>
    <P>With regard to the appointment of directors, the Minister has the appointment of three, and in certain circumstances the appointment of chairman. There is nothing in the Bill to say how the other directors are to be appointed or selected, but I presume that will be dealt with in the Articles of Association. Seeing the attitude of the farmers generally to the scheme under the I.A.O.S., where they were asked to contribute £1 where £2 was given by the Government, I think, in order to offer every possible inducement to the public to take up shares in this Corporation, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance should consider whether money invested should not be free from income tax, either as regards capital invested or dividends accruing from investments. That is a principle that might be applied generally in regard to the investment of money for the development of our industries here.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Schedules, and I desire to call the Minister's attention to paragraphs 2 and 4 of the Schedule.  There are two conflicting clauses. Clause 2 of the Schedule states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister for <Col N="1492" /> Lands and Agriculture may if and whenever they so think fit by order made by them jointly authorise certificates of charge to be issued against any class or classes of securities specified in such order and may by such order impose such restrictions as they think fit as to the proportion or amount of any particular class of security (including first mortgages on land) to be included in the securities against which a series of certificates of charge may be issued, and may also by such order authorise certificates of charge to be issued although the Corporation does not hold as security for money advanced by its first mortgages on land to the nominal amount of one hundred thousand pounds.</P>
    <P>Certificates of charge may be issued against securities even though these securities do not include first mortgages on land.  This sub-section (4) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Before issuing a series of certificates of charge the directors shall place under the control of trustees, in such manner by transfer, sub-mortgage, deposit, or otherwise as shall be approved by the Minister, good and sound first mortgages on land held by the Corporation as security for advances made by it to a nominal amount not less than the nominal amount of such series of certificates.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong but it strikes me that they make a condition under sub-section (4) that those certificates lodged shall include sound first mortgages on land, whereas in sub-section (2) they may issue certificates on securities which need not necessarily include sound first mortgages on land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNOR</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak especially for the farmers in the South of Ireland, where the people feel very much that the banks are taking very strong and harsh proceedings in relation to the farmers to whom they were very anxious to lend money when prices were high.  When the reaction came and the value of land fell, they did not show any appreciation of the change.  A great many people believe that the banks acted in a very unfair <Col N="1493" /> manner by forming a combine.  When ordinary people form a combine it is looked upon with suspicion, as it is thought they have no good reason to combine in a great many cases.  It is a well-known fact that the banks have a combine.  No one can get better terms in one bank than in another.  I was asked to assist in bringing some pressure to bear on the Government and the banks with regard to their attitude towards the farmers who borrowed money from them in the dear times.  From the reports in the papers you will notice that in North Tipperary men went to jail and that when cattle were seized for debts there was a rescue.  There is in these things a possibility of very serious happenings. Those people do not intend to repudiate their debts, but they think the banks should show some consideration for the changed times instead of charging 6½ per cent.  In some cases they charged 7½ and 8 per cent. for £10, £20 and £40 bills.  That was entirely unreasonable owing to the change in the times, and it was above the rate of interest in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A friend of mine was offered in England a loan at 1 per cent. less than the Irish banks were charging; he was offered 1 per cent. more for deposits.  A great many people thought that the Government were not as sympathetic to the people as they should be in dealing with the banks.  At the time when the Government asked for the National Loan the banks came forward and subscribed large amounts in the Government interest.  They were more or less under an obligation to the banks then, and the people think they are not anxious to go back on those who were their friends.  That does not go down well.  The people are most anxious to pay their debts, but the depression in agriculture has driven a great many of them to despair, and they are not able.  In the farming industry people have not held their own for the last three or four years, and, with foreign competition daily increasing, it is impossible to do so.  My own opinion is that it would take at least five years to bring the country into the state of prosperity we would wish&mdash;at least in the cattle <Col N="1494" /> trade.  It is pleasing to note that the war between the American beef trusts is almost settled, and that should have a good effect here.  The security the banks have was ample at the time when the debts were contracted, but at present the sale of land is an impossibility. No one will buy it.  I welcome this Bill, because it is a step in the right direction, and it shows that there was a kind and considerate thought in the Minister's mind.  There is the possibility that it will bring a great good to the people for whom it is intended. I was most anxious to give the views of the people in the farming industry, that it is time the Government should act with generosity and sympathy towards the people in respect of the banks.  The banks should not have the whip hand.  Up to a year ago their dividends amounted to 10, 12, and even 18 per cent.  That is a false sign of prosperity.  The dividends were more or less taken from the people owing to the high rate of interest.  Personally, I think the repayment should be extended for a longer period, to give people an opportunity to meet their debts.  With the new beet industry and other things, I think the country will prosper and the people will recover their former position.  Although we may be at a low ebb, there is a hope for the future.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is unfortunate we should have three important measures thrust on us during the last three weeks of the session.  It makes deliberate consideration rather difficult, especially when you have all the stages of a Bill taken in one day. This Bill seems orthodox, but there are certain features which require careful consideration.  One is Section 12 (d), where the Association can lend money</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to any person engaged in or proposing to engage in an enterprise designed for the service of farmers or of farming communities for the purpose of establishing, carrying on or extending such enterprise.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is very wide indeed.  You might have a boot factory for the service of farmers.  I think it should be narrowed down to make the industry ancillary to the farming industry.  A wool factory <Col N="1495" /> might be essential for farmers, but that is not intended, I think.  I do not think the section should be as wide as that, even though articles of association are sometimes very wide.</P>
    <P>As regards the administrative machinery, I think the Minister will find it very costly, if he is going to pay the high rates he proposes and charge low rates.  I do not know how he will work it.  Does he propose to utilise the agricultural instructors and get reports from them?  I hope he will not depend on paper reports of the character and position of the borrower.  It will not do to rely on paper reports and general vague information, because the character of the borrower is really the most valuable security of the lot.  With regard to chattel mortgages, that is a question which should be examined closely.  I know the Commission on Agricultural Credit in England recommended chattel mortgages, but the recommendation was allowed to remain dormant.  Great difficulties were experienced there when they tried to implement these recommendations.  In America there are chattel mortgages, but one does not know to what extent they are really effective in the different States.  One can understand that where you have big farmers, as in Australia, where they handle a big wool trade which is mortgaged, they would adopt this system because they have recognised markets at fixed times.  Even where you have a wheat-growing country, in which the market is organised, you can follow up your chattels. But you cannot do so here, with all farmers selling in different fairs.  I think insurance ought to be compulsory. I will put in an amendment to that effect.  One has to look to the protection of the State and the taxpayer. It would be very unfortunate if the State were to be faced with a loss of 70 per cent of its cattle, as happened in Clare.  There is one important matter, and the Minister has dealt with it, but his information is different from mine.  It has caused apprehension to traders with book debts.  Traders can find out if there is a mortgage on a farm, but there is a possibility of a secret chattel mortgage being slipped <Col N="1496" /> in in priority to their book debts.  That would create rather an unfortunate position and might lead to premature realisation of book debts.  I think that ought to be considered carefully, and also whether it is wise to have those mortgages secret.  In the Dáil, the Minister suggested that by decentralising the registry secrecy might not be so fully secured.  There ought to be equal secrecy whether the registry is in Dublin or in the country.</P>
    <P>There seems to be no machinery for making regulations under Section 25, the section which imposes all those conditions on the borrower.  I do not see how you could carry out in practice that section, with all the regulations about notifying in writing and getting consent of the lender before disposing of chattels.  There are regulations made by the Minister for Justice as to the operations that come under his Department, but there are no regulations made in the other case.  That matter ought to be considered by this House, and these regulations ought to be laid on the Table.</P>
    <P>Senator Bennett is rather concerned with the non-taking of deposits by the Corporation.  To effect that, the whole Bill would have to be recast.  The Corporation would have to go in for short-term lending.  It would have to keep liquid assets and keep a lot of unproductive cash.  It would have to go in for joint stock banking.  I do not know if Senator Bennett wants a State joint stock bank.  That is what would happen if his proposals were adopted.</P>
    <P>Senator Kenny suggests that as borrowers borrowed rather hastily in times of high prices, now the banks should bear the consequences.  I do not know what he means.  The ordinary laws of bankruptey apply to everybody. The banks are asking no more than to carry out the ordinary laws of bankruptcy, like any other traders. Senator Kenny implies that a new code of bankruptcy should be applicable to bank debts.  That would raise a very curious and difficult situation.  If his aims are to be carried into effect and if farmers are to be relieved from paying their debts, it is the State's duty to relieve them.  There should be further grants.  It is impossible to place one <Col N="1497" /> class of creditor in a different position from another.  If you are to deprive one group of creditors from exacting their full pound of flesh, that should apply to everyone else.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposal that the loans to the Corporation should be free of income tax, that would have no influence in bringing in foreign money, because the borrowed money would be subject to income tax in the country in which the national lives.  If an Englishman lent money to the Corporation he could not escape income tax, but would have to pay it in his own country.</P>
    <P>Senator Gogarty, in criticising bank rates, must remember that 50 per cent. of the sales of land are abortive.  That is an important factor.  Creditors are unable to realise 50 per cent. of their debts.  Surely it is clear that the security then is not very good.</P>

      <P>I will deal with inflation in a moment.  Senator Col. Moore raised the question of inflation and asked that the advances should be written down to the present value of money.  He does not imply the corollary of that, that deposits should also be written down.  What is sauce for the goose is also sauce for the gander. If a man deposited £100 in war years, is it suggested he should now get only £70?  Senator O'Connor spoke of the difficulty of enforcing full remedies against debtors, but I remember quite well the Minister for Justice saying in this House that civilisation has broken down when the sheriff ceases to operate.  That is a serious matter.  In some places the sheriff has practically ceased to operate.  If the Minister for Justice states that civilisation has broken down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not say that the Government is in any way responsible.  It has done its <Col N="1498" /> best and has taken up a totally correct attitude on the question of the payment of debts.  As the Minister says, the farmers are to a great extent responsible for the depreciated value of land as a security.  I therefore hope that this Bill will be examined carefully, especially with regard to chattel mortgages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might say a few words as a member of the Commission on whose recommendations the Bill is founded.  The Commission, in dealing with the matter, found, on inquiry into this question of bank loans to farmers, that a state of affairs existed nowadays that was rather difficult to deal with, both from a banking point of view and from that of sound finance.  In ordinary times, before the year 1914, loans to farmers were very liquid.  I have had something like forty years' experience of banking in Ireland, and up to the year 1914 I could have stated definitely that the loans to farmers had a less percentage of bad debts to the banks than any other class of loans which they made. That is not the state of affairs now. I should say that now the exact opposite is the case.  For various reasons which, probably, everybody who has spoken here knows, all the loans that are now out on farms are of a very difficult nature to handle, and I should say that every bank in Ireland has had in the last two or three years to write off large sums for depreciation on loans which they knew they never could recover.  As regards this question, which two or three Senators have raised, I think it is necessary to speak quite plainly, namely, as to why credit is difficult to get, so far as the farming community is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the farmers had dealt with their debts as they used to do, there would not now be this question which we are trying to solve.  In the old days when a farmer owed money to a bank he did his very best to pay it.  He did not go to the bank and say, as many do now, &ldquo;I cannot pay you, I will not pay you, I will not let my farm be sold, nobody in my neighbourhood will buy my farm, and, therefore, your security is worth nothing.&rdquo;  I invite <Col N="1499" /> Senators who have been talking on this subject to think what that means, and what it will mean, to the institution which we are now in favour of having established.  There is no doubt that this institution, with State money, will have to make loans, just as other banks do.  Nobody is going to say that the cattle, for the purpose of which money is going to be lent, will not be at a less price when they come to be sold, than when they are bought.  If as a collateral security for that money the security of the farm is being given, and if that goes on for some time, it is quite easy to see how this institution will also have to call for the sale of the farm, and the State, which is going to supply the capital to this institution, will have lost its money if it cannot sell the farm.  We bankers are the custodians of the money of the vast mass of the people of the Free State.  They have entrusted us with it, and they expect us to look after it.  We lend it out to other people who need money, and we give one rate of interest to our depositors, and we pay all our expenses out of the balance which we get by charging a higher rate to the borrower. We, undoubtedly, must take care of all the money on deposit.  I hope when this institution is established that its directors will take the same care of the money of the State that we feel we have to take as regards the money of our depositors.  I think we should look calmly at the situation here at present.</P>
    <P>The banks have lent a lot of money to buy stock.  Farmers have, year after year, sold their stock for less than they gave for it.  They cannot pay back the banks.  At present there are a vast number of loans to farmers to buy stock on what is called long-term credit.  We cannot call on a farmer to pay back a bill for £300, because we know he has not got it.  He sells his cattle for less money than he gave for them and, gradually, the same situation will come about, and the banks, to get that money, will have to sell the farm.  In an enormous number of cases it is no use to either the farmer or the banks to sell the farm.  It would be better to let the farmer work along and do his best.  I am now talking of <Col N="1500" /> honest clients doing their best to make ends meet, and hoping for better times. when they would be able to make money and pay back the bank.  In the majority of cases the banks are not calling for the sale of the farms.  It is only in cases where they know that no effort is being made to pay the bank that they have to take proceedings to force a sale.  That is the state of affairs to-day, and it will be the state of affairs that will exist after this Bill is passed, and after the State has taken up this new method of banking.  I think I have said enough as to the situation regarding farmers and the banks.  I do not think that the situation is as it has been painted here, and I do not think that the Commission that recommended this institution for the Government when putting forward this Bill meant that the funds of this institution are to be used for taking over a lot of bad debts which the banks have at present.  I hope that that is not so, and I would not vote for this Bill if I thought it was so, for they would have no right to do so.  The banks have no idea that this is the way the money is going to be used.  The Commission intended that this should be fresh money to be available for farming enterprise.  One of the reasons why the banks cannot go further ahead is quite clear.</P>
    <P>When you have to pay back deposits at call you must keep a certain amount of money arising from deposits in perfectly liquid securities.  You must always be able, at once, to have money available that you can hand over to your depositors.  Now, when we have to make advances to farmers, such as I have been talking about, we cannot keep that money available in the way we should, for, if we did, every farmer to whom we lent would be smashed.  Therefore, we have to keep liquid securities ready, besides a lot of cash.  There is only a certain portion of our assets that we could lend to farmers.  That is far more tied up at present than it was ten or fifteen years ago, because farmers themselves are not turning it over, and they cannot pay it back.  In the old days when a farmer paid back we lent that money to another man.  We had a lot <Col N="1501" /> of liquid money and we could pay out, but now we have not got it.  The situation now is that the banks have as much money lent out to the farming interest as they can afford to do with safety to the depositors and to the banks themselves.  We should take that into account and also the fact that our land legislation has created a totally new class of farmer and persons making a living out of the land.  A great many people who are now on the land trying to make a living have not got sufficient capital to pledge to the banks for the purpose of borrowing money.</P>
    <P>The State has created this new form of farming, and it seemed to us on the Commission that the State was bound to carry out the other part of the arrangement, which was to see that the men who were put on the land had the money to work it.  I believe that is one of the main purposes for which this new institution is intended.  It is also an excellent institution in regard to the creamery industry, and for again setting up those small lending banks, or institutions, to which Senator Colonel Moore referred, that is, the banks which lent money at 4 per cent.  As far as my information goes, these have practically all died out.  This new institution is being given money, and, having that behind it, can dictate to those various small associations to which they will give money.  It can help the creameries by advancing the money which they will need on long-term credits.  It can unite all the creameries, look after the marketing, and use Irish Agricultural Association methods for uniting all those various industries, which it would not have the power to do if we did not give it the capital under this Bill.  These are the kind of matters with which it appears to me this institution will have to deal.  I do not think Senators ought to publish the view that bad loans are to be taken over from the banks, that all sorts of people who are at present in an insolvent condition are to be helped, and that there is to be a general millennium because we are starting this not very large State institution.</P>
    <P>Banks are not doing what some of the Senators have suggested they are <Col N="1502" /> doing at present.  I believe every bank in this country is doing its level best to tide over the difficulty.  Wherever it is possible to do so with any safety, the banks are giving their clients every opportunity to meet their obligations, and, as I have said, they only take the last step when compelled to do so by absolute necessity.  I hope the State will not meddle in these matters, and that it will leave the farming community and the banks to get along as in the past, with great consideration for each other.  Also, I hope the farmers will take into account what an enormous amount of harm they are doing to the whole community if they go in for repudiation of debts, and for the idea that the payment of honest debts should not be an obligation on the farmers.  I ask any Senators interested in the matter to read pages 21 and 22 of the Banking Commission's report.  As to the abortive sales of the Land Commission, it says: &ldquo;In 1912-13 the percentage of abortive sales was 19.5; in 1915-16, 14; in 1920-21, 43; and in 1925-26, 57.&rdquo;  That is only the Land Commission sales.  The report states:&mdash;&ldquo;From the table it will be seen that the percentage of abortive sales has recently increased at a somewhat alarming rate.  We are forced to the conclusion that in many cases there exists a strong disinclination to meet just and lawful obligations.  It apparently forms part of the wave of demoralisation which is so marked a feature of the post-war period.&rdquo;  Of course, there were bankers on the Commission, but there were also perfectly independent individuals.  That was the conclusion they came to after hearing the evidence submitted.</P>
    <P>Senator Gogarty referred to the difference between the Irish and the English bank rates.  I am sure if the Senator goes to any Irish bank with the class of security which the English bank requires it would give him the Bank of England rate.  We would do it.  That security does not exist here. We are never asked for that class of loan in this country.  These are loans which banks and others go to the Bank of England for on first-class bankers' bills, and such things, and on which as a minimum rate all the other rates <Col N="1503" /> are built up.  As far as we have been able to find out, the rate for the class of security we get over here on long-term loans is about the same as in England.  I do not think there is any difference in the matter.  I dare say if Irish depositors choose to take their money over and employ it on the London market they might get a little more than we would give for it, but I doubt it on the whole.  I saw a letter in one of the papers this morning dealing with this question of the difference of 1 per cent. between the English and Irish bank rates, but the remarks contained in the letter only show that the writer is not acquainted with the banking facts of the case.</P>
    <P>In practically all points the Bill before us follows the recommendations of the Commission.  On reading it through, but not examining it very carefully word by word, it certainly seems to accomplish the purpose which the Commission had in view.  There are, however, some matters which I think might be improved in Committee. For instance, I think that in Section 4 the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; should not be removed. It probably would be better that the Corporation should be called &ldquo;The Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited.&rdquo;  If the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; is left out, the creditors and people dealing with the Corporation might think that because the shareholders are to be secured by the Government that the ordinary creditors would also be.  As regards the capital of the Corporation, I am of opinion that it would be a great help if the shares were paid in full and, as there would be a Government guarantee behind them, if they were then made trust securities.</P>
    <P>I think that in that case Senator Kenny would find out that it would be an impossible attempt; it would be far better for the farmers who have money to put out on deposit that they should come in when this institution was working and buy the debentures which the Corporation intend to issue, and on which they would have the Government guarantee of their interest, and the shares would be first rate buying if they were fully paid, with a Government guarantee of 5 per cent., which <Col N="1504" /> would be far better than anything that the bankers could offer to them in the way of deposit.  But, of course, they would have to sell their shares when they would want to get their money back, and not get their money on call in the way that we could give it to them.</P>
    <P>I think it would be better in Section 5 if the Minister could have the right of issuing stock at such times as the money is required, and issue the share to the bank and to the public in the proportion of two to three.  As regards Section 10, the Articles of Association would, of course, as in any company, be submitted before the money was put in, either by the banks or any of the other shareholders who bought their shares.  I think Section 11 might be put in better shape so as to be more easily understood.  You will notice that the number of directors, including the chairman, is to be seven, of whom three, not including the chairman, shall be nominated by the Minister.  And, later on, the section says that &ldquo;the Minister must nominate from amongst three directors a chairman of the Corporation.&rdquo; So that the chairman of the Association shall also be nominated. That would look as if the Minister could nominate four of the directors.  I think that section should be re-drafted. I think the intention is that the Minister should only nominate three, including the chairman.</P>
    <P>Here is a section where, undoubtedly, the Bill differs from the recommendations of the Commission.  That is subsection (1) of Section 12, which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To advance money only to the persons and for the purposes hereinafter stated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 12 (1) (a) reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To any person for the purpose of purchasing land for agricultural purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Commission held that it was, undoubtedly, not advisable that any new corporation should be brought into being that was going to lend money for the purchase of land.  The original purchase of land is what I refer to. Some of the Senators who have spoken this afternoon undoubtedly are quite right in saying that not many years <Col N="1505" /> ago advances were made to a great extent for buying farms.  And, apparently, nowadays, the bankers who made the loans are being abused for it. I wish some of the gentlemen who talk about the bankers forcing money on their customers had been present at the table of the bankers when these requests were put forward, and I wish they had read the letters of the borrowers asking the banks to lend them the money.  What was put to us then was the safety of the land, and how much the borrower was going to make if we would only lend the money.  Now-a-days the shoe is on the other foot. The opinion in banking circles, as long as I remember, is that there is an unwillingness to lend money.  As long as I have been in banking I am aware that we have been very slow in lending money, and we have tried to put all the difficulties we could in the way of free lending of money for the purpose of forcing up the prices of farms.  The Banking Commission came to that same conclusion, and they said that this institution, with State money behind it, should not lend money to buy farms. There are conditions in which it might be wise to do so.  But I think that might be dealt with by another subsection. For instance, suppose the association has lent money to a farmer to buy stock, and the debt is gradually increased owing to his losing money and suffering losses in various ways. The bank has to take the security of the farm.  If, eventually, that customer fails, and if the bank has to realise, well then, I think they should be permitted to take another good solvent individual and advance him money with which to buy the farm&mdash;the land which they have already held as security.  But that is a totally different thing from lending money in the ordinary sense to buy land to a man who does not own a farm in which they are not interested, and bringing in another competitor for the farm and increasing the price of the land.  At the present moment this is not a danger. Later on, when the times improve, as we all hope they will, it may become a danger, and I do not think we ought to put that section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The only matter which I think really <Col N="1506" /> one ought to deal with in talking on the Second Reading is this question which the Minister has dealt with so fully: that is, the question of chattel mortgages.  We had a great deal of discussion about chattel mortgages at the Commission.  The bill of sale, we all know, is an impossible thing, and yet we see that a number of people at present who are now farming land are different from a great many of the old farmers.  They are men with practically no security to give except their farms.  If you lend them money to buy stock without some sort of lien on the stock, it was suggested that it was a risky proceeding.  It may be risky enough even with the chattel mortgage.  Still there is more of a hold.  I think you would all see if a customer came along who had his farm and nothing else but his farm and had no capital to buy stock, how the position would be.  Such a man will go to the bank and ask for a loan to buy stock.  The bank must refuse to give that loan.  You would want some other security besides the farm.  That appeared to the British Commission when they inquired into it, and they made a recommendation which was never followed up.</P>
    <P>Now, we came to the conclusion, with the number of new holders in this country, that the experiment should be tried.  We have in different circumstances to act in different ways, and we came to the conclusion that it ought to be tried and that the right people to try it were an association of this description. They have powers, ways of working and knowledge which the ordinary bankers had not.  It gives the same right to the ordinary banker. It may be that clients will go to the ordinary banks and they may be able to get loans, but they are risky loans, and I think we should all recognise that the State, in advancing money to this institution is taking a certain amount of risk.  I believe the State should take a risk, but in this matter they are taking a big risk.  No matter how excellent a man they may have managing this institution, they may edge along the line that means chattel mortgages.  Then there will be risks, and I think you will all see, with depositors <Col N="1507" /> to repay, that you can hardly expect many banks to follow along that line.  The project can only succeed if the farmers to whom the money is lent are perfectly honest men.  That is the one point I want to emphasise.  In my young days the farmers always used to be honest men.  If they borrow money from this association or from a bank, and if they do their best to pay it back, then these chattel mortgages may lead to an enlargement of credit and will be of great use to the farming community. The system of chattel mortgages may be followed up and they may help the banks and customers out of many difficulties. This is the right institution to try it in the first case.</P>
    <P>There is one point, and I hope the Minister will suggest some remedy for it.  There will be lots of customers, probably the safer ones, who will come to this institution and say, &ldquo;I want to buy some stock.  I have some stock on the land, but I want more.  I cannot get the money from the banker.  He says he has given me all he will give me on the security he holds.  I will give you a chattel mortgage, and then you will lend me money to buy stock.&rdquo; As the Bill stands, the new association can take a floating mortgage on all the stock the land holds, including stock purchased with the bank's money. I hold that customers should be compelled to disclose to the association their debts to the banks, and the association should inform the bank, or banks, before they take the chattel mortgage, that they are going to take it.  Otherwise, the new association would take the stock bought with the bank's money, and have it as an extra cover.  I believe a section that would make that right can easily be drafted.</P>
    <P>The question the Minister has dealt with as regards the shopkeeping credit is a very difficult one.  So far as I have been able to make inquiries, I think the Minister is right.  I do not think it is going to cause any great calling-in of credit that will damage the country, and if it makes the shopkeepers reduce the credit which they have been in the habit of giving, I think, on the whole, it will be a benefit I think all bankers will know that one <Col N="1508" /> of the things they are constantly pressing upon their shopkeeping clients is: &ldquo;Do not give such long credit and imperil your own position.&rdquo;  Of course, it will always remain with the shopkeeper to come to his banker and say, &ldquo;How does so and so stand?&rdquo; There are various methods by which people in the business can find out whether or not it would be wise to lend money to a man.  I dare say people in shopkeeping circles would be able to accommodate themselves to the new circumstances and be able to find out information as accurately as before. Even if this leads to a certain curtailment of shopkeeping credit, I am not at all sure that it will not be of benefit to the country as a whole.  Cheap credit of that sort is not good for the community generally.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at more length than I intended, but this is an important Bill, and it is a Bill that will do a great deal of good in the country.  I think it is a Bill which we owe to our Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  It will give him the power he needs, and I hope that he will be the Minister who will have the carrying out of it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister for Finance will tell the House how the clearing house for dealing with a certain class of income tax payers has got on?  I believe that was adumbrated last year.  Its actual working has not yet penetrated to the benefit of the double income tax payer.  I do not suppose the income tax payer minds very much the delay; he will have to pay sooner or later.  It would be desirable, however, that he should know his position and liabilities.  As the Minister for Finance knows, it may be two years after payment that the income tax payer gets a refund. <Col N="1509" /> There are always lots of correspondence and queries in regard to assessment.  It may be fully two years after the date on which payment was made that the matter of rebatement is settled.  It is obviously inconvenient for many taxpayers to make provision over such a lengthy period.</P>

      <P>The conjoint office has been set up.  It has not had very long experience yet, but I understand it is working satisfactorily.  Of course it is only dealing with cases of double residents. It was not proposed that we should, by means of this conjoint office, deal with cases of people who had income tax arising in Great Britain, who might be subject to tax and were themselves resident here.  It is to simplify the cases of double residents, and I understand while the work is in its early stages&mdash;and it is, perhaps, impossible to judge it yet&mdash;that it is working satisfactorily. I think it would not be possible at this time to give a detailed account, but this time next year it is a matter that might be debated at length.  I do not think it could be very fairly judged so far, but I have no reason to believe it is not able to work satisfactorily, and that it will not, in the course of a little time, be able to give all the services that could possibly be given to double residents in a matter of settling claims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to call the Minister's attention to a matter that was the subject of correspondence between his Department and the Waterford Chamber of Commerce for some time.  I was asked by the Waterford Chamber of Commerce to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister on the occasion of the presentation to this House of the Finance Bill. There was a revaluation of the city of Waterford two years ago and, in the aggregate, the assessment was raised 50 <Col N="1510" /> per cent., from £50,000 to £75,000.  The result of that is that income tax payers in Waterford city were assessed over and above the previous year to the extent of 4/- in the £, the increase representing £5,000.  They protested against that.</P>
      <P>It was said that the protest came from the Chamber of Commerce, because it was at the instance of the Waterford Corporation the revaluation was made.  The Chamber of Commerce consists largely of traders and income tax payers.  They protested against the revaluation being made.  They followed up that protest when the revaluation was made and when the demand was made by the Income Tax Commissioners. They protested to the Minister for Finance that there should not be an increase in the income tax for a certain period.  A conference ensued, and it was arranged by the Department for Finance, through their representatives, that the increased income tax, following the increased assessment, would not take effect until the end of the then quinquennial period, which would not terminate until the year 1929.  Those who protested were fairly well satisfied with that, and the matter was allowed to rest.  Then came the Finance Bill of 1925, by which all these reassessments came into operation, and on which income tax was based.  The Minister was approached, and his attention was called to the matter.  He admitted that the promise had been made to the income tax payers of the City of Waterford, but he regretted that the Finance Act of 1925 went through without any advertence to the position in Waterford or the promise ratified, admittedly, by the Minister, and the Bill slipped through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an interview which I had with the Minister at the suggestion of the Chamber of Commerce, I suggested that the remedy would be easy, that the Finance Bill was coming on, and that an exemption clause could be inserted to remedy the position.  The Minister undertook to look into the whole matter and undertook to send a further communication, which we have been expecting for the past week or ten days.  So far it has not reached me. <Col N="1511" /> In view of the position I have been asked by the Chamber of Commerce to ask this House to make a recommendation that there should be inserted in the Bill an exemption clause dealing with Waterford.  As I have already stated, the Minister admitted the position. In correspondence from his Department on September 20th, 1924, the following appeared in a letter sent by Mr. McElligott:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It was also pointed out that the present quinquennial valuation roll for Waterford would be in force for about four years more, and except in the case of new and improved premises the revaluation would not become operative for income tax purposes until the expiry of that period.</P>
    <P>That was a ratification of the promise made by Mr. Fullerton, also on behalf of the Department of Finance.  The whole position is admitted. The inequity is there, a breach of faith with the merchants of the City of Waterford, and they suggested that this is a proper time to have the matter remedied by having an exemption clause in the present Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit a change was made in regard to the coming into force of these assessments without any advertence to the position in Waterford. What happened was: The city moved for a re-valuation.  When it was found that the re-valuation meant a considerable increase in the valuation they got alarmed and tried to have the process stopped.  It was impossible to stop it.  They had set the machinery in motion, and it could not be stopped. In the course of an interview they were told that owing to the fact that these assessments as the law then stood would not come into operation until the end of the quinquennial period they had a respite.  In the course of certain other changes being made in 1925, a change was made in regard to the coming into force of these assessments, and that respite was lost because the position in Waterford was not adverted to.  If we had remembered the position we might not have made the change, but the change was made.  It applied to the whole country.  We could certainly not <Col N="1512" /> make a special exemption for Waterford. As a matter of fact, I do not admit that there is a great grievance of any sort with regard to Waterford. In certain cases there might be some increase, but as far as the ordinary owner-occupier of a business house is concerned, there is no increase, because any increase there may be under Schedule A can be off-set in the reduction allowed against Schedule B.  There will be no increased tax paid.  It seems to me that it is impossible at this stage to take any steps to deal with the matter.  The whole thing flows really from the steps that were taken to have the city re-valued.</P>

I ask Senators, as business men and income tax payers, that for the sake of the credit and the good name of the Government, they should pass a recommendation that an exemption clause be introduced, as far as the City of Waterford is concerned, based on the correspondence and on the Minister's admissions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said, some time ago, that he was handing back to the British Government the income tax on the guaranteed loan.  I think the amount was stated to be £550,000.  I am not clear as to whether it was paid for the past only, or <Col N="1514" /> whether it will be paid for the future. The case seems to me a little uncertain, and I would like it cleared up, if possible.  When I asked the Minister the question he said: &ldquo;The £550,000 was the total sum that we have retained in respect of our claim for income tax.  Consequently, it was held in the Suspense Account.  Our revenue has received no income tax in respect of the interest portion of any land annuities paid before this.&rdquo;  This was paid, I suppose, for the past.  I am not clear whether the income tax that the Minister repaid to the British Government was the whole of the income tax, and from what I have just read it seems to me to be the whole.  I would like to know if the income tax on the guaranteed loan is to be continued to be handed over to the British Government or is to be kept in this country. Perhaps the Minister might inform me on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the expenses of collection, and also with regard to the annuities, supposing these annuities are due to the British Government, as he says they are, but which I do not admit, I cannot understand why the money should be handed over to the holders of the bonds through a second person. Why should not the interest on this debt be paid direct to the bond holders? By paying it over to the British Government we are liable for two things.  First we have to collect it and pay the expense of the collection, and, secondly, we clear the British Government of any expenses, leaving them in a better position than they were before. Then there is the question of income tax, which also depends on what I have asked before.  If that income tax is sent over to England, why should not we, when we collect the annuities and pay the bond holders, keep at least some of the income tax over here? Perhaps we do keep some.  It does not seem to me to be very clear.  I would also ask the Minister why annuities on public offices are being paid to the British Government.  I cannot see in the accounts any statement as to what this money is derived from.  As I understand the matter, the loans made by the British Government were made out of funds in their hands in the <Col N="1515" /> savings bank, and various other moneys that every Government holds in its hands.  These are departmental loans that are being repaid, and repaid only with the money which was actually in hands.  The Free State Government succeeded to these loans, and they should be repaying themselves. I may not be right in these matters, but the whole thing requires explanation.  I questioned the Minister some time ago about the public debt and the national debt.  He said: &ldquo;There is no reference in Article V. to the national debt,&rdquo; and in that he is quite right.  It is the public debt. But I see he goes about the country talking of the wonderful success of the Government in getting rid of the British National Debt.  In Monaghan he is reported as having said, &ldquo;Had they not got agreement, as they had. they would have had all this disturbance and still be responsible for a big share of the British national debt.  Instead, they had evaded the disturbance, and had got the debt squelched.&rdquo;  He told me in a speech the other day that it was not the national debt we got rid of under Article V., but the public debt, and he went on to say that he had no notion what the public debt is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>But he paid five millions to get rid of it.  He cannot tell me if it is the public debt.  He says the British Government did not know&mdash; that nobody knows.  On the other hand, he is constantly stating it.  Not only did he state it in Monaghan, where it might have been a casual and flippant way of talking to a public audience, which I would not much mind, but he stated it in the Dáil. When he was asked how the British Government made up their charge against the Free State, he said they took first the national debt&mdash;not the public debt&mdash;and then took a percentage of the national debt&mdash;1.5 to 100&mdash;and put that down as part of the claim against the Free State.  If it was not the national debt but the public debt, how could they put down 1.5 of a sum which they did not know? <Col N="1516" /> Apparently they had the national debt in mind, which they knew the amount of.  Now the Minister says it is 1.5 of an unknown figure.  All this business seems to be curiously mixed up in the Minister's mind.  Sometimes he uses &ldquo;national debt&rdquo; and sometimes &ldquo;public debt.&rdquo;  Then he says the national debt is not in Article 5.  I should like if he would be sufficiently condescending to give some explanation.  He does not like being questioned on it, I know.</P>

      <P>I wish to call attention to Section 1, with reference to the reduction of income tax.  I want to protest against the reduction of the income tax without the restoration of the shilling taken off the old age pensioners. Two years ago there was a reduction of a shilling in the income tax, and now there is the further reduction of a shilling.  It is hardly fair that the wealthier sections of the community should be enriched, if one might say so, at the expense of the poorest and most defenceless section.  There is no doubt that the aged and infirm poor are the most defenceless section.  It seems to me hardly fair that there should be a further reduction of a shilling in the income tax without restoring the much-needed shilling to the poor old age pensioners.  I have a recollection that the Minister made a promise that on the first opportunity that shilling would be restored.  In all decency, the reduction made in the income tax might have been sixpence instead of a shilling, as the other sixpence would be more than would be required to restore the shilling to the old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>I also think that there ought to have been more relief given in connection with income tax by increasing the minimum sum liable for tax, because in present conditions a great hardship is inflicted on wage earners with the taxable minimum as at present.  With high rent and high cost of living they find it extremely hard to live.  In addition, they are paying their quota of indirect taxation, such as the taxes on boots, clothing, etc.  I think that the Minister might have dealt with the matter on a more equitable basis.</P>

      <P>I have nothing to <Col N="1517" /> add on the points raised by Senator Moore.  With reference to the statement of Senator Sir John Keane, that assessments have not been made in certain cases, they may not have been made, but in other cases they have been made.  It is not, of course, directly the business of the conjoint office to make assessments.  They are made by the proper authority.  The conjoint office really collates the information.  As I say, I think they are proceeding with that work as satisfactorily as can be expected, and that there will be increasingly useful work done in connection with it.</P>
      <P>Senator Farren has stated that we might have done better than give the shilling cut in the income tax.  That, of course, is a matter that we could argue at very considerable length.  The view I have taken in regard to the cut in old age pensions is that the time when we might restore it would be when there was such a change in economic conditions that revenue was showing a tendency to expand.  As long as revenue is showing&mdash;as it has been showing, although in a lesser degree&mdash; a tendency to decrease, we ought not to resume the expenditure which we took off the taxpayers.  In previous years there was a great fall in the revenue from alcoholic liquor, and there were decreases in certain other taxes.  To a considerable extent, if not entirely, that fall has stopped.  There was a slight fall last year in the yield from the beer and spirit duties, but the fall was very much less than it had been previously.  Still, there is no indication so far of an expansion in the yield of revenue, and until we have that expansion I do not think we should add to the expenditure, however desirable the advantage might be.  The Senator referred to the reduction in the old age pensions, but there were certain reductions in taxation which would be very helpful to most families in which old age pensioners live.  For instance, we reduced the tea duty from eightpence, and then we finally abolished it; we have reduced the duty on sugar by 1¾d. per lb.  These are tax reductions which benefit the poor equally with the rich, and more in proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1518" /> Our idea in reducing the income tax was not for the purpose solely of giving relief from taxation, but for getting results that a particular sort of relief in taxation may give.  It was with a view to encouraging investment and producing a certain spirit of confidence in the business community.  It is the belief of the Government that actually the poor and the workers of the country will benefit more by this particular reduction than they would have benefited by a reduction which came directly to them in the first instance. The matter has been already argued, and I do not wish to argue it again.</P>

      <P>I believe I am expressing the opinion of practically everybody interested in the matter of medical education in the Free State when I say I welcome Clause 2 of this Bill.  The great outstanding feature of the Bill is contained in this clause.  It ensures that every medical student or practitioner educated or qualified in the Free State will have equal rights and equal privileges with those educated and qualified in other parts of the kingdom.  It removes once and for all anxiety as regards the future, and I think it cannot, therefore, be too loudly proclaimed or too often reiterated that medical students will be under no disability in entering the medical schools here in future. There are one or two points that I would like to mention, if I may.  I notice Section 10 reads, with regard to the nomination of members of the Council&mdash;&ldquo;not more than two months nor less than one month before every expiration of the term of office of the nominated members of the Council.&rdquo; I think there ought to be an extension of that term.  The time is very short. Some of these bodies, in the summer time, do not meet very often, and I think if the Minister could see his way to extend the period of time to perhaps three months and two months it would be a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 24 deals with foreign practitioners, but there is no mention of reciprocity.  It differs in this respect from some other Acts, such as the General Registration and the Central Midwives' Board.  These two bodies largely have reciprocity, and those registered in the Free State can claim registration in England and vice versa. Dealing with foreign countries, it is very important that there should be reciprocity.  In Canada, for instance, although there is a certain amount of reciprocity, there are two provinces in which there is no reciprocity with England. If the Free State wishes to have reciprocity they might give reciprocity to foreign countries, or to some of the Colonies in return for the same right being granted to the Free State.  It would be very desirable if the Free State could get reciprocity with foreign countries, for instance, in the case of <Col N="1520" /> France and Italy, because there are good openings in the South of France and along the Italian Riviera for medical men.</P>
    <P>Section 29 deals with the removal from the register of persons guilty of &ldquo;infamous conduct.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Minister that at the end of the first portion of the section he might insert the words &ldquo;if it sees fit.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardBigger" hpid="Sir E. BIGGER Sir E. BIGGER">
      <NameTxt>Sir E. BIGGER</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I shall reserve it for Committee.  Section 30 deals with the question of inquiring into the allegations of &ldquo;infamous conduct.&rdquo; I noticed that those who have to carry out the inquiry are the Council, and that the Council will have power to summon witnesses and to examine them on oath.  These provisions are not contained in the English Act, and I am not sure whether they are quite desirable provisions or not. If cases are to be examined into on oath, and that they have a right to summon witnesses, it might mean they should have a legal assessor just as the General Medical Council, but the General Medical Council has no power to examine witnesses.</P>
      <P>Section 31 provides that the Council shall, in every year, cause to be printed and published the Medical Register for the year.  That would be very costly.  I suggest to the Minister that after the first year's register has been published additions made might be in the form of lists of qualified persons, so that it may not be necessary to republish the costly register every year.  If there were a very large number of practitioners from England and the Colonies and other places qualified and entitled to come in and be put upon the register, and if the register had to be printed every year with these new lists added, it might be very costly and I am not sure that it would be worth it.  Section 40, sub-section (2) reads:-</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of the performance of the duty imposed on the Council by the foregoing sub-section the Council may with the approval of the Minister appoint such and so <Col N="1521" /> many fit and proper persons as the Council thinks necessary to be inspectors of examinations and may pay to such persons such remuneration as the Council with the sanction of the Minister for Finance shall determine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that the approval of the Minister is quite right so long as the Minister or the Government are committed to defraying the cost, but after the first two years it is presumed that the cost will be defrayed by the Council's own funds.  That being so, it is quite unnecessary that they should appeal to the Minister when there are eleven members of the profession of high standing capable of doing it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir EDWARD BIGGER</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 40, line 50.  A very important duty is cast upon them under Section 44.  That section deals with the adaptation of Section 5 of the Midwives (Ireland) Act, 1918.  That is a very important part of the functions of the Council. It will be more important as time goes on, especially in cases where unregistered midwives are acting illegally with the assistance of medical men.  Cases of that kind are constantly coming before the General Medical Council in England.  The Midwives Act in England was passed in 1902.  The Irish Act was passed in 1918.  A year's grace was allowed to midwives, who were unqualified, before it became illegal for them to act.  The Irish Central Midwives' Board have five medical men on it.  I suggest that the Minister might possibly see his way to appoint one of them on the Council.  Such an appointment would, I think, make the work run smoothly.  I regret to see under the Schedule that that portion of the agreement gives Northern Ireland the right to appoint the Crown representative for Ireland.  This is one of the highest positions open to members of the medical profession, and it is one that has always been held by Dublin men.  Henceforth it will pass for all time to a representative nominated by the Government of Northern <Col N="1522" /> Ireland.  There is no mention of the Pharmacopoeia, of which the General Medical Council has charge.  It will, I suppose, continue to act in regard to that.  With these few observations I am otherwise pleased with the Bill and heartly approve of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might explain with regard to the amendments handed in this afternoon.  They are all Government amendments, and the delay, to a great extent, was caused by the fact that at a late hour last night I had to meet two Senators with regard to Section 104, which was debated for a considerable time on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  The amendments were being kept back until I could have them all put together and issued <Col N="1524" /> finally.  If there were any amendments of substance which were only being put forward now for the first time, I think there might be some cause for complaint, but I put it to Senators that if they look at the list they will see that is not the position.  There are five amendments dealing with the position of the Grand Canal Company, and although my amendments were not previously discussed by the Seanad, amendments were put forward by Senator Brown on which I said I was ready to meet him.  These amendments show how far I have been able to meet him.  Everything else, I think, with two small exceptions, was, in fact, promised by me.  The wording of the proposed amendments was definitely indicated.</P>
      <P>There are three small amendments proposing to make some clerical changes.  These amendments do not deal with any matter of substance. They merely substitute words in the plural for a word in the singular.  It may be said that these are amendments of substance to Section 59, but although I did not give the wording of these amendments on the Committee Stage. I did indicate what it was my intention to bring forward.  With the exception of the three amendments proposing to make clerical changes, the substance of all the other amendments has been expressed to the Seanad.  Although they were not formally before the Seanad, I indicated what I intended to bring forward.  I offer my apologies to the Seanad for my inability to get those amendments in the form in which they could be put in their hands earlier. The delay was due to pressure of other business.</P>

This is an amendment that requires to be very carefully examined.  At the present time I am not quite clear myself <Col N="1525" /> as to the works which it is proposed to exempt from rates.

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>It deals with the question of audit.  Since I moved this amendment on the Committee Stage a new matter was brought to my notice in reference to Article 62 of the Constitution, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Dáil Eireann shall appoint a Comptroller and Auditor-General to act on behalf of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann).  He shall control all disbursements and shall audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas and shall report to Dáil Eireann at stated periods to be determined by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Government are aware of that Article, and I have no doubt that they have taken legal advice.  I may be told that their action is not an infringement of that Article of the Constitution, and that further, even if it is an infringement of the Constitution, it is not a matter for this House, that they can pass legislation in conflict to the Constitution, and that it is a matter for the courts to determine I would ask the House, however, to have regard for the spirit of the Act, and not for legal technicalities.  The <Col N="1528" /> whole thing is determined by the spirit of the Act.  Presumably this Article of the Constitution was inserted with a good purpose.  It was inserted to ensure that there shall be independence, and that the control of Dáil Eireann itself, which is the sovereign body in matters of finance, shall be brought to bear upon all expenditure of public money.  On that principle, I submit the whole issue should be determined. If it is necessary for expenditure sanctioned in detail by Dáil Eireann to be audited in this manner&mdash; expenditure which is appropriated to a fixed purpose under heads and subheads, which cannot be diverted except by the authority of Parliament itself, and the fact of which diversion would come to the notice of the auditor&mdash;if that is necessary how much more is it necessary that expenditure in bulk, which is merely given on the authority of the Executive Council, and of which the Dáil and the public have little or no knowledge, ought to be subject to the same precautions in regard to audits?  That is the whole principle. If this Article of the Constitution has any meaning whatever, it surely should mean that this money, which is removed further than usual from the control of Parliament, should be audited by a person independent of the Executive, and responsible solely to the supreme authority of the State, which is Dáil Eireann.  I ask the House to consider these facts of a broad and vital principle, and to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I always understood that Senator Sir John Keane was an authority on finance, but his interpretation of that Article of the Constitution, as given here to-night, must for all time dissipate the belief that he has any authoritative point of view with regard to finance.  The Senator has read an Article of the Constitution. Does he think that it does not apply? Does he think that the Auditor-General will, in fact, not say whether or not these moneys have been handed out for the purposes for which the law stands, and that he will not be asked to report on whether the issues have, in fact, reached their destination?  If he does, <Col N="1529" /> he has no knowledge of how the finances of the State are run.  He wants to go further.  He wants to have an examination under that Article of the Constitution of how moneys handed over to the Board are, in fact, expended, and he urges as an argument that if there is a detailed examination of moneys directly voted in the Estimates for ordinary supply services, then there should be all the more examination if the money is handed over in bulk, the fact being that moneys are handed over in bulk for the very purpose of removing them from that supervision. If the Senator's argument were pushed to its logical conclusion the Auditor-General should report on how each individual judge spends his salary.  He would have to go into his domestic arrangements, would have his ordinary household expenditure submitted to examination, put under different headings and would make a report on it. The very purpose of voting the judges' salaries on the Central Fund is to avoid such criticism and examination. All the Auditor-General does is to report that the money has been paid out and has reached its destination.  The Auditor-General would be bound to report with regard to the finances of the Board, that the moneys voted by the Dáil through the Central Fund had, in fact, been paid and had reached their destination.  That is where the Auditor-General comes in and must come in with regard to this Board.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Minister's analogy, that does not apply exactly.  In one case the expenditure is private.  When sums are voted by the Dáil the Board has a duty in the <Col N="1530" /> expenditure.  The Board must devote it to specific purposes, and only to those purposes.  It is not private expenditure on the part of the Board, the same as it is in the case of the judge.  I think that Senator Sir John Keane's idea is to follow the expenditure to its ultimate destination.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General, under the provisions of the Constitution, is the responsible authority to the Oireachtas.  When certain sums are handed over to the Board his responsibility arises as to the disposal of those sums.</P>

      <P>I think, if you examine the Bill, you will find that there is nothing in it which, expressly, at any rate, interferes with the functions of the Auditor-General.  What follows from that is that the Auditor-General has got those duties imposed on him by the Constitution, and I think we may safely trust him to carry them out.  We cannot dictate to him what he is to do in the course of those duties. He knows his own duties.  They are not interfered with, as far as I understand, in this Bill.  It is quite true that the Bill says there is to be an audit by someone else, but, by express legislation, it does not interfere or take away the duties or the powers conferred upon the Auditor-General by the Constitution, and it will be for that official to discharge them according to his conscience and according to his authority.</P>

There are two types of money votes&mdash; ordinary supply services, which are examined in detail on the Estimates, and in respect of which the Auditor-General has the right to pry into every detail.  On the other hand, there are certain things put deliberately on the Central Fund to prevent examination. The judges' salaries constitute one item.  All the Auditor-General has to see is that the money voted to a particular judge reaches its destination. How it is spent does not matter.  Take another example.  There was a grant made to the Royal Dublin Society in consideration of giving up these premises.  That was voted in a particular way.  The only thing the Auditor-General had to vouch for was that the money reached the Royal Dublin Society.  How the Royal Dublin Society spent it was no matter for him.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(2) The wages and conditions of labour of persons employed by the Board shall not be less favourable than those which would be observed if the employment were in the execution of a contract between the Minister and the Board embodying a fair wages clause in accordance with the recognised practice of Government <Col N="1533" /> departments, and all contracts made by the Board shall embody a fair wages clause containing the same stipulations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think this amendment is a reasonable one.  It simply means to embody in this Bill conditions that are applied to every Government contract.  The Government, when they are issuing contracts, and local authorities have a similar clause to this inserted, known as the Fair Wages Clause.  It is embodied in all important contracts to ensure that the people who are competing for those contracts shall be on level terms and, in the second place, it ensures that what is to be performed on behalf of the Government or local authority shall be performed under fair conditions of employment.  I think there should be no difficulty in the Minister accepting this amendment. In the Beet Sugar Act there is a provision almost similar to this.  I do not think there is any need for me to stress it, as the Seanad understands what it means.  It is not asking for any epecial condition, but merely asking that the persons employed shall be treated the same as others employed on Government or public board contracts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I must raise a definite objection to this amendment. The Senator referred to Government contracts.  That analogy, I hold, is not a suitable one.  I have said all along that I do not want this Board to operate on the basis &ldquo;the Government pays.&rdquo;  I want this Board to run its business in the way of an ordinary commercial concern and not to have any terms or conditions imposed upon it other than would be imposed on any commercial concern.  Government contracts by the Purchasing Committee are on an entirely different footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the consideration the Senator spoke of was the primary consideration, or was the consideration present to the minds of the people responsible in that case.  The idea rather was that the Government, being the payer, could afford the extra moneys&mdash;<Col N="1534" /> that the moneys would not have to be pared down in the same way as would happen in the case of a commercial concern up against competition.  It will be the duty of this Board to give its services at the lowest possible cost. This amendment hides the details of what is described as the Fair Wages Clause.  The Fair Wages Clause would mean that in any particular item of the Board's work there must be paid the same wages and there must be the same conditions as are applicable in the district affected, or, if there is no analogy in the district, such wages and conditions as a good employer would give.  I want to give one example of what that would mean.  It would mean, definitely, that in the region adjacent to Dublin, in the first instance, there would spread out, even to clerical workers under the Board, the wages which the municipal employees at present enjoy.  That is not a standard that, without further examination, I should like to see spread.  At the moment electricians are paid a certain rate of wages for work in Dublin, and a country rate, plus country money, for work in the country&mdash;which is really an attempt to get the country up to the Dublin standard.  Without further examination, I cannot say that that is reasonable.  So far as I have been able to examine it up to the present, I think it is pretty unreasonable. There is a very big conflict going on at present with regard to the wages of electricians.  The basis on which these wages were built up was that a particular rate was recognised as being necessary in certain towns, and that rate was not considered necessary for certain country districts and not necessary even for other towns.  This amendment would more or less stereotype the standard.  There will be 135 new areas, and in those new areas there will be no standard on which the Board might fix its terms.  You would then have recourse to the terms or conditions of the nearest area.  You would take the nearest town and have that wage stereotyped and the result would be that you would have an outflow of the Dublin conditions until Dublin conditions would apply all over the country.  That, without examination <Col N="1535" /> of all the details, should not be accepted too readily.  The trade unions will be concerned in this matter.  There will then be the increased number of men who will be brought into the trade unions.  The unions have been able, in some cases, to impose their own conditions. I suggest that it ought to be left to the play as between the employer, which will be the Board, and the employees and their trade unions, to decide what rates of wages will be stabilised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to find the Minister adopting the attitude that he has adopted from the inception of this scheme as regards conditions of labour.  He is objecting here to a clause which is inserted in all Government contracts and in contracts by local authorities.  The insuperable difficulties which he alleges are present here are overcome in the case of Government contractors and contractors to local authorities.  The Minister speaks of this undertaking being a commercial concern.  That is not correct. It is primarily a State concern.  It has been undertaken by State moneys, and it is guaranteed against loss until 1932, or such other time as the Minister determines.  It has a complete monopoly of electric lighting and power, and, to that extent, it has also a guarantee against loss.  It is not a commercial concern.  And even if it were a commercial concern, surely this would be a commercial proposition. The Shannon Board will have to pay commercial prices for everything it buys.  All that is asked here is that it should pay commercial prices for the labour it employs.  There is to be consideration in the scheme for every element except the human element. The Minister was unable to impose the grossly harsh terms that he imposed on the Irish workers on the German workers who were brought here.  They are being paid their trade union rate of wages, and so are other foreigners who have been brought in.  They only came here on the condition that they would be paid the trade union rate of wages.  It is only the Irish element the Minister seeks to exploit.  This scheme has been besmirched and disgraced by <Col N="1536" /> the manner in which the natives have been treated.</P>
      <P>It is a deplorable state of affairs that the Minister should seek to set up a debased standard of living such as he seeks to establish in connection with this scheme.  Everybody knows that he, having the nomination of the Board, will undoubtedly inspire and influence it in regard to the conditions it is going to offer.  He has thrown down the gauntlet to the trade unions, and says that unless by their own efforts they are able to enforce Christian conditions of employment under this scheme, they are not going to get them. It is a bad thing to make that challenge, because, owing to the lack of organisation on the part of the poor wretches whom he was able to round up in the initial stage of the scheme, it was not practicable to force an upheaval, but that condition of affairs is not going to obtain throughout.  He will not be able to exploit the electricians as he exploited the poor tramps and peasants' sons around the Shannon area.  He is once again throwing down the challenge to Labour, and says: &ldquo;Unless you work on the basis which I set out, namely, 32/- a week, you will have to fight for anything more you are to get.&rdquo;  He compensates all and sundry except the people without whose labour the scheme would be impossible. All the difficulties he puts up are mere eye-wash.  These difficulties are present to all Government contracts and contractors.  This fair wages clause is instituted in connection with them.  This is the biggest contract in connection with Government schemes that has been established in this country for generations, and the Minister seeks to perpetuate the conditions which obtained at the inauguration of the scheme.  I do not know if the House is going to pass this amendment, but I trust that Senators will, at all events, show to the Irish workers the same conception of humanity as has been shown to the German workers, that they will not show to the public and, above all, to the Labour elements, that on all occasions, where Labour is concerned, they are found to be against them.</P>

As to how this is going to work and whether it is possible to have it worked, it will be impossible, if it is going to have the effect which the Senator desires.  If one views the varied operations of the Board, and if there is going to be set up, through the medium of the Board, a standard of wages which will eventually be that of Dublin, it will work out that way. If people step in and say that in every matter with which the Board is concerned there is to be a fair wages clause, it will mean that in all labour discussions hereafter that standard will be taken as a basis throughout the <Col N="1538" /> country.  We are told that this is a matter that should be specially granted, and we are told by the Senator that the Board need not pay its way up to 1932, or any further date that may be determined.  That is to say, that as there is plenty of Government money behind the scheme you can pay anything you like in the way of wages. You can put up any claim you like and the Government will pay.  That is the very idea that I want to counter.  I have tried to avoid using the phrase &ldquo;this is a commercial concern.&rdquo;  It ought to be run as a commercial concern, and not simply as if it were to get eternal subventions from Government sources.</P>

      <P>I intended to move this amendment on the Committee Stage.  I handed it to the Minister in the hope that he would see his way to accept it.  I say frankly that the amendment represents the minimum we ought to demand.  I put down that amendment in the terms it contains in the hope it would receive favourable consideration and be accepted.  Although I am only an ordinary humble individual, I am as much interested in the Shannon scheme as the Minister.  From my earliest childhood I have been reading about the water power of Ireland and how it could be used for industrial purposes.  It is with a view to making the Shannon scheme a success that I put down the amendment in the form in which it appears.  It simply asks the Government to have it stated in the Bill that the wages and conditions of employees under the Board shall be in accordance with the practice of Government Departments in the making of contracts.  The Minister ought not to mislead the House by saying that the acceptance of the amendment would mean that the Dublin conditions would prevail through the country, for he knows that is not a true statement of <Col N="1539" /> the position.  In Government contracts in the country Dublin wages and conditions are not applied.  The Minister's statement regarding that is incorrect and dishonest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that because this is a Government undertaking we are endeavouring to squeeze the Government to get from them all we can. I state frankly and honestly, and with regret, that our experience of the Government since they came into power has been that they grind down the unfortunate workers.  On every occasion the Government have used their influence with public boards and contractors, and everybody, to reduce the standard of living of the lowest paid workers.  It is in order to prevent that exploitation and grinding down of the most unfortunate and poorest class of <Col N="1540" /> workers that I introduced the amendment. The intention of the amendment is not to squeeze the Government, but it is an effort to compel the people in control to apply to the workers under the Board the same conditions that would apply to contracts entered into by local authorities.  I hope for the honour of the House that this amendment will be passed.  The majority of the Senators have everything the world could give.  I ask that the unfortunate men who will be engaged in doing the work under this scheme will be given sufficient to enable them to keep body and soul together, and to provide for their wives and families that amount of comfort they are entitled to receive as human beings in a Christian and civilised country.</P>

      <P>I wish to suggest to the Minister that Section 11 is exceedingly drastic.  In the Committee Stage, I asked a question as to whether the holder of certain shares in a Calcutta bank would thereby be precluded from being a member of the Board, and the Minister's answer was &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Since then my attention has been drawn to the debate in the Dáil regarding the Currency Bill, in connection with which a similar position arose.  An amendment was moved by Mr. Blythe that the Chairman and other members of the Board should not hold shares in banks operating in the Saorstát, and he <Col N="1541" /> went on to say that it was not proposed to prevent them from holding shares in banks outside the Saorstát. Under Section 11 of the Electricity Bill a member of the Board is prohibited from holding an interest in any electrical undertaking in any part of the world.  I hold that is unnecessarily drastic, and that the rules that apply to the Currency Commission in this connection might equally apply to the Electricity Board, so that the members of it might hold shares in an electricity undertaking in any other part of the world.</P>

      <P>I think that what Senator Guinness is saying ought certainly appeal to the Minister, whether we are to put it in the form of an amendment or not.  Take my own individual case.  Suppose the Minister was to ask me to go on the Board and I was to accept.  I happen to have a few shares in the Westminster Electrical Undertaking in London as an ordinary shareholder.  There must be a number of people in this country who have shares in electrical undertakings in England.  But because one has shares in the Westminster Electrical Undertaking as an ordinary part of his investments he will have to sell his shares if he accepts a seat on this Board.  A good many people who hold these shares would rather, perhaps, refuse the appointment than have to sell out their shares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 12, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 34 the words &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; (substituted in Committee for the words and figures &ldquo;31st day of December, 1932&rdquo;) and to substitute therefor the words and figures &ldquo;31st day of December, 1934.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The House will realise that if this amendment is carried it will embody a principle which will necessitate a number of consequential amendments which would be easily drawn.  I am only arguing the principle.  The House may probably recollect that when the proposal was put forward in the Dáil to extend the date by which the rates will have to be economic from 1932 to 1942, the Minister said: &ldquo;No; it would never do for the Government to accept that. The public would say the cat was out of the bag.&rdquo;  What happened subsequently I do not know&mdash;I can only surmise, but when an amendment like that was introduced here there was no longer a question of the cat in the bag. The Minister made a slight gesture of protest, and in accepting the amendment he said he would in due course recommend it to the Dáil.  You now have the date of maturity of this scheme indefinite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point that has not been made yet in connection with this definition. The date of its maturity is clearly a probationary date and an experiment with regard to the rates.  We have <Col N="1543" /> heard it said, &ldquo;You cannot alter your fiscal policy, because you set up vested interests.  People come in behind the tariff barrier on the understanding that they will be sheltered,&rdquo; and they have embarked accordingly on enterprises.  It appears to me that the same argument will apply to these rates.  People will say they have been induced to come in and substitute, perhaps, electricity for steam plant on the basis of favoured rates.  But when it comes that these rates will have to be made economic, if ever it does come that these rates have to be economic, there will be just the same outcry, and there will be charges of breach of faith put up.  These are the difficulties and the inhibitions of State enterprises.  The debates we have had all along have arisen out of the inconsistencies and anachronisms of State enterprises.  That is the position with regard to this amendment.  It is at least to make the date definite, and not leave it to the Board to feel that they can go on drifting, but to leave it to the Minister himself.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister said, when I spoke on the Committee Stage, that I was wrongly quoting the experts; that 1932 was the date for the maturity.  If I said 1934 he will correct me.  He said 1932 was the date.  You cannot blow hot and cold with these experts.  You must take them one way or another. I do not think that is his policy.  The Minister does not take what does not suit him.  If it does not suit him to follow the experts he exercises his own free will.  I ask the House to fix a definite date.  If the House rejects 1932 then they should fix it at 1934, and not leave it on the long finger, with all the bad influences of lethargy that must inevitably follow from a policy of that kind.</P>

What I did say was that if I brought forward such an amendment as that there would be a Press <Col N="1544" /> clamour that the cat was out of the bag.  I am prepared to stand by what the experts said.  The experts said five years after the completion of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I have no voice in the matter in this House.  I am quite prepared to accept it, and if the House passes it I will recommend it to the Dáil.  It was because the point was made to me by two or three business men that I put in 1932.  A number of people said that although the scheme could be made remunerative in 1932, it was not good business to say that it must be made remunerative in 1932. We have other considerations that were put up by Senator Sir John Griffith.  I am quite indifferent to the fate of this amendment.</P>

I am perfectly certain that what we settled as to the date on the Committee Stage was a perfectly wise thing.  It leaves the Minister free to press on for 1932 as the date when it should be economic.  I do not think it would be good for the Bill to alter it now.  As it stands, it expresses my views.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 12, sub-section (3).  Before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  Any sum advanced under either the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925, or this Act to meet a liability for arrears and arrears of interest that may remain unspent shall be surrendered to the Minister for Finance and shall not be appropriated for any other purpose.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment which the Minister gave me to understand he might accept.  I said to the Minister that under the section it might be possible that a sum voted specifically to meet interest or arrears of interest would remain unspent and might be diverted to other purposes.  He said he thought it was possible, but would that be very terrible and would it be a wrong thing?  I said that certainly it would be a very wrong thing.  I now put down this amendment and the Seanad will have an opportunity of deciding whether or not it would be a wrong thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has admitted that under the Bill if the money is not spent for a specific purpose it could be used for capital expenditure, the wiring of houses, or compensating undertakers. Any money voted for a particular purpose must be either spent or surrendered to the Minister for Finance.  If we do anything else we will be practically abrogating the whole of our parliamentary responsibility, and we will <Col N="1546" /> be giving a blank cheque to the Government to do what they wish with the money.  We cannot allow things of that sort to be carried on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in answer to the Senator in Committee that it was difficult to reply to a question raised off-hand.  The Senator now brings in an amendment which deals specifically with moneys advanced under the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925, or this Act, to meet liability for arrears and arrears of interest.  No moneys can be advanced under this Bill for those purposes.  Arrears of interest may be forgiven or postponed, but no special advance can be made to meet liability for arrears and arrears of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister said so.  The whole basis of one sub-section is to ensure that if the Board takes over a certain interest during the non-productive period, the Board can pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a carry forward from the 1925 Act.  We have a section referring to a £600,000 item specially spoken of in the 1925 Act, but, leaving that sum out of the question, there can be no money advanced for the purposes specified here.  In so far as there is that particular amount of money, it is really a harking back to the £600,000 mentioned in connection with the 1925 Act.  The moneys there are to be advanced for the special purpose of meeting interest charges; they cannot be advanced for any other purpose. I do not know as between the two measures&mdash;the carry forward from the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925, and what is here&mdash;that the point the Senator has mentioned can really arise.  I have my doubts as to how far this might apply.  I have grave doubts whether there are any sums of money with which the amendment will deal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>The sums are both voted by statute.  My point is they are both to be drawn upon for one and the same purpose.  I want to avoid the danger of the money being drawn upon twice and possibly diverted for other purposes.  My difficulty is clear enough, but it is hard to explain how it is met under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a sum of £600,000 referred to in sub-section (2).  I was asked in the Dáil if this was an additional sum&mdash;something in addition to the £5,200,000.  I said it was not, and it was not meant to be.  We had £4,600,000 for construction work and £600,000 to meet interest charges and losses during unremunerative years.  I then explained to the Dáil that the sum, or the residue of it, had to be carried forward because this situation is bound to arise.  Before I hand over to the Board I shall have expended a certain amount of the £600,000 meeting interest charges, and possibly losses during unremunerative years.  There has to be some portion handed over to the Board for those purposes.</P>
      <P>The Senator's point is this: Can the Board be handed over from the electricity fund established under the 1925 Act moneys not used for the purposes of meeting interest charges or losses during unremunerative years?  I think the Senator, if he reads the 1925 Act, will see the purpose for which the money is voted.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General will be careful to see if the moneys reach their destination and are spent in a particular way.  In so far as the Senator's point deals with sums advanced under this Bill to meet liabilities for arrears and arrears of interest, there are no sums advanced under this Bill for those purposes.  I have stated clearly that under this Bill there is a carry over of the original £600,000, but it is ear-marked by the 1925 Act.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> Section 12, sub-section (9).  To delete in sub-section (9) (inserted in Committee) the words &ldquo;five millions, two hundred and ten thousand pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is, again, an appropriation of money.  In the Shannon Electricity Act the sum of £5,210,000 is made payable for a definite purpose, the construction of the Shannon works and to pay interest during the non-productive period. Under an amendment, which was carried in Committee, the Minister will have power to increase that sum.  I would ask the House to take the view that this £5,210,000 advanced under the Shannon Electricity Act is advanced for a definite purpose.  It is advanced for the purpose of constructing the Shannon works, and it should not be increased merely because the scheme does not fructify within a certain date.  It is a capital expenditure, altogether apart from the operations of the Board.  The Board will operate in a variety of vaguely enunciated ways, in wiring, in compensation, and in extensions to existing undertakings.  But there is nothing vague at all about the sum of £5,210,000 under the Shannon Electricity Act; it is for a definite purpose, and there should be no increase in the sum without proper statutory authority.  If the sum is not sufficient, if the estimates are not realised, it should be the duty of the Minister for Finance or the Government to go to the Dáil and say: &ldquo;We want more money for the purposes of the Shannon Electricity Act,&rdquo; not to do it in the way which is proposed now, practically to obtain more money by order, an order which will be tabled and which can be annulled.  It is quite possible that under this Bill the money might be spent.  I do not say that Governments are out to take advantage of these technicalities, but it is possible that there might be a very big contract under the Shannon Electricity Act and everything might be in readiness whereby the order would be made, but before the order could be made the thing would be done.  My point is that that £5,210,000 is in a totally different category from the floating sum that the Board will have for an undefined purpose, <Col N="1549" /> and I will ask the House to have some regard to the rules that govern expenditure of money and to assert its authority in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am moving to delete, not merely these words, but the whole sub-section, because it has been impressed on me that the increase of these sums by order is not a legitimate way of transacting this business and that it will be necessary to have legislation. I agree, further, with what the Senator said, not with regard to the £5,210,000, but to the £4,600,000 for <Col N="1550" /> construction purposes.  If that is to be increased, a statement ought to be made as to why an increase is required, and there should also be special legislation passed with regard to it.</P>
