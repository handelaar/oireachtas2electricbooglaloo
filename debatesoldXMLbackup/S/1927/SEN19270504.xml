      <P>As Senator Sir John Keane is not here, I move:</P>
      <P>11a.  New Section.  Before Section 23 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;23.&mdash;Where the Land Commission shall purchase untenanted land or resume the whole or any part of a retained holding interest on the purchase money to be paid by the Land Commission in respect thereof shall be paid on the purchase money payable by it at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum as from the expiration of one year from the date of the first inspection of the lands by or on behalf of the Land Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will admit that it means a loss to the owner of land if a long interval takes place between the notice of inspection and the <Col N="1056" /> time of taking possession.  During that period the land cannot be farmed properly, and, at the same time, it cannot be let.  I think it will be admitted it is a loss to the owner.  I hope this will meet the views of the Minister, or that some other way will be found whereby the owner will be saved from a very great loss.  I think it must be clear that there is an injustice where the owner suffers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan) MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not as simple as it looks.  It is a nuisance from the point of view of the owner to have his lands inspected and the proceedings dragged out from one to four years.  This proposes to meet it by means of &ldquo;a rate of five per cent. per annum as from the expiration of one year from the date of the first inspection of the land by or on behalf of, the Land Commission.&rdquo;  I do not think it sets out what the five per cent. is to be paid on.  What about a case where the Land Commission inspects land, and, after inspection, makes an offer, and the acquisition is opposed by the owner and taken before a Judicial Commissioner, who decides that the land shall not be taken?  It may take two years or a year and a half, and the ultimate decision of the Judicial Commissioner might be that the lands would not be taken.  In practice, it would be quite out of the question to make an arrangement under which, in every case, a year after the first inspection interest shall begin to run on an indefinite sum of money, because in twenty-five or thirty per cent. of the cases the proceedings end up in the Land Commission refraining from acquiring land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another side, and that is, that the point of view of the Land Commission is to take land as quickly as it can.  It is in their interest to do so.  What happens in fifty per cent. is, lands are inspected, and an intimation is sent to the owner of the land which the Land Commission proposes to acquire.  The law allows a man to lodge an objection.  The regulations prescribe that the objection shall be heard a certain limited time after it is sent in.  The case is put down for <Col N="1057" /> hearing.  There is a delay of three or four weeks before it is reached by the Land Judge, and it may be six months, or more, before that stage is over. The Judicial Commissioner decides that the lands are to be acquired.  They are inspected again, and that may take three months.  The owner has a certain time within which to lodge an objection. That objection is heard by the Commissioner. There is a certain time again in which he can appeal.  Finally the appeal goes to the Judicial Commissioner, who decides that the price is a fair one.  For one hundred and one reasons, questions of title, of lettings, of who is the real owner of the land, what the tenure of people who own is, and so on, a recalcitrant owner may block the sale.  It takes a long time to decide on the equities of the case.  In that way, anyone can drag out the proceedings for two or three years.  The Senator may take it from me that, in my own experience, most of the delay is caused in that way. In any event it is open to any owner to delay in that way.  If this amendment were accepted there would be the difficulty that, after a long delay, the Judicial Commissioner might decide that the land should not be acquired at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the proposed amendment would not apply in that case.  That difficulty would not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  It would be open to any owner to delay proceedings. The owners do that.  They take advantage of any rights they have under the law.  They could delay proceedings for two or three years or a third party could delay them.  That delay would tend to increase the cost. There would be payment of interest at 5 per cent. for two or three years and you would make land purchase more difficult.  I agree it is a nuisance to an owner to have the Land Commission inspect his land and have the proceedings dragged on for a long time.  In most cases that is because the owner takes advantage of all the legal rights he may have.  In any event there is this question of the owner doing no farming operations and holding up all <Col N="1058" /> work because the Land Commission has inspected his land and he does not know what is going to happen.  So far as ninety-five per cent. of the untenanted land of the country is concerned it is simply grazed on by store stock. Ninety-five per cent. of the untenanted land which the Land Commission takes is not land near towns, not valuable small farms, not the sort of land that is being drained, improved on or reclaimed year by year.  If you were to listen to some people you would imagine that everyone owning a parcel of untenanted land is spending money every year draining, improving it and working on it.  So far as ninety-five per cent. is concerned it is ordinary grazing land.  The owner does not take off his stock when the Land Commission inspects it.  If you were to put this into operation first of all people would delay proceedings in order to get the benefits of the five per cent. on the purchase money as compensation. They are losing nothing in ninety-five per cent. of cases.  You would make it more difficult to carry out land purchase operations.  This five per cent., which would be in the form of a bonus, would have to be added to the purchase money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir NUGENT EVERARD</NameTxt>
      <P>I only move this amendment because Senator Sir John Keane is not in his place at the moment, and I did so without consultation with him.  All the objections that have been put forward by the Minister fall to the ground if there is not unwillingness on the part of the landowner to sell.  I could give instances, and I can, if necessary, give the names privately to the Minister where such is not the case and where, owing, I suppose, to necessary delays, in the applotment of the land and so forth, after the Judicial Commissioner had decided, over a year went by before the land was bought.  The Land Commission may come in and sow a crop but there is very little chance of the landowners being able to reap it, and the land remains uncultivated.  I am speaking of what I know; I am speaking of a farm which was voluntarily given over to the Land Commission, and on which there was a very considerable <Col N="1059" /> portion of tillage, but in the circumstances no tillage could be carried on.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly what the Minister said is true in 90 per cent. of the cases.  The land taken over by the Land Commission, for the purpose of division, is grazing land, and in these cases delays may be brought about by the owner in the hope of prolonging his tenure.  But there are other cases where great grievances have occurred.  I ask the Minister whether, on the Report Stage, he would consider the advisability of introducing some amendments by which such cases of hardship could be met. If the interest would run, say, after the expiration of one or two months from the date of the Judicial Commissioner's decision I think that would meet the case fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>Or if it was made to run from the date of the offer, or two or three months after the offer was made.  Once the offer is made I think no one will dispute that it then becomes a matter of price, and that is not a matter that would cause delay.  I think what I suggest would be a fair compromise.  There is this to be said about grazing land: it is true that probably 80 per cent. of the untenanted land is grazing land, but it is not grazing land entirely in the hands of the owner but grazing land that the owner has let on the 11 months' system, and these delays would prevent them from doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a great deal to be said for the principle of the amendment and that the owner should be paid from the completion of the sale, but it seems to me that the amendment as it stands might make it possible for a man to enjoy the tenure of his land and at the same time receive 5 per cent. on the purchase money.  I do not think the amendment provides against that.  An amendment might be introduced at a later stage to meet the equities of the case, and provided that a man should receive 5 per cent. from the actual time of the seizure of his land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be satisfied with a form of concession.  I do not <Col N="1060" /> agree with the Minister that there is no injustice or inconvenience or loss. I mentioned a case on Second Reading where, two years after the time of the inspection, nothing had been done, and that was only a case taken at random. It is borne in upon me that there are many such cases, and all the time the charges to the owner are going on, interest is accumulating, and every day he finds it harder to meet his obligation. Despite what the Minister says, there is great uncertainty in the letting, or in obtaining of temporary benefits from the land once the evil eye of the Land Commission has fallen on it.  From the moment the inspector comes down no one is going to have anything to do with this land.  Even if it is grazing land it is well known it is under official notice and you will not get the same bidding for that land when put up for letting as you would otherwise obtain. It is not reasonable to suggest that the owner is going to make difficulties and is going to obstruct in order to get the interest.  I have had it brought to my notice that it is invariably the Land Commission who make the delay.  I do not press the amendment in its present form; if the Minister will give me some indication that he will look into it and that there is a case to be met, I am satisfied.</P>

      <P>The matter might be safeguarded if the words were put in&mdash;&ldquo;where the Minister is satisfied that the delay is not due to the owner.&rdquo;  Where you have a willing owner with no objection there is a grievance if there is delay.  If you had a captious man he might hang on for purposes of his own, but where you have an honest vendor, who places no difficulty in the way, it is hard upon him, and something might be done to meet it.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 23.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the Land Commission shall have declared that untenanted land situate outside a congested districts county is required for the purpose of relieving congestion or of facilitating the resale of tenanted land, or that any land wherever situate which was excluded from the operation of sub-section (1) of Section 24 of the Land Act, 1923, by sub-section (2) of that section is required for the purpose of relieving congestion, or shall have commenced proceedings to resume the whole or part of a retained holding, and at any time after the passing of this Act the price or compensation has been fixed by the Judicial Commissioner, the Land Commission, if they consider that the price fixed is such as to make the purchase of the land or the resumption of the holding or part thereof inexpedient, may, on serving notice within such time as may be prescribed, withdraw from the purchase or resumption on such terms as to costs as the Judicial Commissioner may determine and such untenanted land or holding shall not for a period of seven years thereafter be acquired or resumed by <Col N="1062" /> the Land Commission without the consent of the owner or tenant thereof.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After the word &ldquo;determined,&rdquo; in line 60, to insert the words: &ldquo;Provided that if the owner shall within fourteen days after the service of such notice serve notice on the Land Commission of objection to the withdrawal stating the grounds of such objection and that the Judicial Commissioner shall consider the objection reasonable then the notice of withdrawal shall become void and of no effect.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under the Land Act of 1923 the Land Commission could compulsorily acquire land for certain purposes, one being the relief of congestion.  In that case when they served the notice to compulsorily acquire the land, the price had to be fixed by the Judicial Commissioner having regard to the value of land to the owner and its value to the Land Commission&mdash;a very difficult task. Once that price is fixed the Estates Commissioners have got to pay that price if they take the land.  There is no appeal from that price.  Now if they do not like the price that the Judicial Commissioner has fixed upon the lands they can withdraw from the sale.  In my opinion that is not fair.  I do not think they ought to be allowed to withdraw from the sale without some appeal to the Judicial Commissioner.  My amendment proposes that where there is a withdrawal, owing to objection to the price fixed by the Judicial Commissioner, there should be an appeal against that withdrawal and that they should be bound to give it unless they can persuade the Judicial Commissioner that there was good reason for not doing so.  That is all the more necessary, because when you come to the end of the section you find that they can come back and serve notice for compulsorily taking over the land after seven years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

Supposing there is <Col N="1063" /> an agreement to take Senator Brown's amendment could we have an agreement that the other amendment be withdrawn?  If I accept Senator Brown's amendment I hope he will back me up in this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New Section.  Before Section 34 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) The Land Commission shall publish particulars of all cases in which an evicted tenant or a person nominated by them to be the personal representative of a deceased evicted tenant has been or may be hereafter, with their assistance reinstated, as a purchaser of his or his predecessor's former holding or provided with a new parcel of land under the Land Purchase Acts.</P>
      <P>(2) Such particulars shall be in the form of a yearly return, which shall be laid before the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and shall contain such particulars of each case as are set forth in the Schedule to the Evicted Tenants Act, 1907, if and so far as it may be practicable to furnish the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section was originally in the Evicted Tenants Act of 1907, and it <Col N="1064" /> was repealed by the Land Act of 1923. I dare say it was then thought that after the evicted tenants had all been reinstated that there was no occasion for any further return to be laid before either of the Houses of the Oireachtas, giving the particulars of those persons who had been reinstated or who had received another holding.  I am very glad to say that quite a number of evicted tenants have been provided by the Land Commission with alternative holdings.  I observe from an answer to a question put in the Dáil that there are over 50 of these evicted tenants re-instated since the 1923 Act was put into operation.  It will be of assistance to the Minister to have this return available, because he may be asked questions in the other House as to how far the proceedings of the Land Commission cover the reinstatement of evicted tenants.  The amendment I have put down is practically the same as the section in the Evicted Tenants Act of 1907, with a few alterations to make it conform to the present situation.  I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, or a section like this section, was in the Evicted Tenants Act of 1907.  I think it was Section 3 of that Act.  It was discontinued. There was a schedule to the Evicted Tenants Act showing the particulars which had to be returned.  It was found very costly to make out that return, and it was found, as 1920 was approaching, that it was hardly justifiable to spend public money on returns of this kind every year.  That return was published every year, and the Land Commission had to go to the expense of making it out and publishing it.  The Land Act of 1923 repealed that.  I do not see that there is any advantage in restoring that in the present Bill.  Since 1920 the return would be very small, and in view of the fact that a fair number of cases are being dealt with since 1920, the return would be much smaller now and you would have to start preparing this return every year, getting it printed and laying it on the Table of the House, and so on.  I do not think it would justify the expense.  The Senator has another amendment down, and that amendment, No. 16, to insert a new section before Section 35, is of <Col N="1065" /> much more substance, and if I accept that he would perhaps withdraw this one.  That amendment is very much more advantageous to the evicted tenants than the advantage that he hopes to secure from amendment 15, which merely requires a return to be made to the Oireachtas.  The other is quite a substantial matter, and I would be willing to accept it.  It was also the law under the Evicted Tenants Act of 1907, and I would accept it with some slight amendment.  This amendment that we are now discussing would only result in putting the Land Commission to expense.  If anybody who is interested in an evicted tenant gets a question asked in the Dáil, he can secure the information that is asked for in this amendment.</P>

      <P>The section provided for quarterly returns in the old Act.  My amendment asks for yearly returns, and I do not ask or require particulars to be furnished as fully as was provided for in the schedule.

    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) No farming stock or other chattels provided for an evicted tenant by means of a grant or loan under the Land Purchase Acts shall be made available in any bankruptcy or by any other process or proceeding <Col N="1066" /> of law to pay, satisfy or discharge, in whole or in part, any debt contracted or incurred by such evicted tenant prior to the date on which the parcel of land purchased by him became vested in him.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Before the Minister answers, I would like to have an opportunity of explaining this.  It is not a revolutionary proposal at all.  A similar section appears in the Soldiers and Sailors Land Trust Act.  It is simply intended to provide that those persons who are provided with public money should not have that money made available for the payment of debts that had been incurred prior to their getting a parcel of land, farming stock, or other chattels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I think Senator Linehan has answered Senator Keane. The idea of making the distinction is that a debt contracted before the lands or other property were obtained should not be satisfied by an execution against the lands and farming stock so obtained. It was found in practice that if some such provision as this was not inserted, in the circumstances in which a lot of the evicted tenants are, there would be no use in reinstating them and giving them money to buy stock. As a matter of expediency, the line was drawn prior to their getting this land and stock.  If a man gets land from the State and money to stock that land, the least he might do is to pay the annuity on it.  I think that is obvious.</P>

      <P>(1)  Where the Land Commission have put up for sale by public auction any lands which they are entitled to cause to be sold for nonpayment of a purchase annuity charged thereon and the lands have not been sold, they may offer the lands to the council of the county in which they are situate, and in every such case it shall be lawful for the county council, with the concurrence of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to purchase the lands from the Land Commission upon such terms as may be agreed upon notwithstanding that the lands are not required by them for the purpose of any of their statutory powers or duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Any lands purchased by a county council under the section shall, so long as the council continues to hold the same, be administered in accordance with a scheme prepared by the county council and confirmed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who may confirm the same with or without modifications, and shall unless the said Minister otherwise directs be sold subject to the approval of the said Minister, within a period of five years from the purchase thereof by them or within such extended period <Col N="1068" /> as the said Minister may authorise.</P>
    <P>(3)  The proceeds of the sale of any lands under the foregoing sub-section shall be applied in repayment of any moneys borrowed and outstanding in respect of the said lands and if no such moneys are outstanding shall be carried to the credit of the rate or fund out of which the expenses of the county council in respect of the lands are defrayed.</P>
    <P>(4) Any expenses incurred by a county council under this section shall be raised by means of the poor rate as a county-at-large charge, or as a separate charge of such area less than the county as the county council shall with the approval of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health determine.</P>
    <P>(5) For the purposes of this section a county council may borrow money under Article 22 of the schedule to the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898, in like manner as if these purposes were mentioned in the said article.</P>

      <P>I move to delete the section.  I hope the Seanad will give close attention to this section.  It is one which gives the county councils power to acquire land in the event of an abortive sale to recover the arrears of annuity and rates.  I can conceive no body more fundamentally unfitted to resell and negotiate land than the county councils.  You all know the personal feeling and the jealousies and the machinations which are inclined to centre in connection with parcels of land in this country.  The nearer you get down to the people the more tense and awkward that situation becomes. In this section you are giving the county councils power to acquire land from the Land Commission, and to hold that land or divide it up.  There can be no justification for that business at all.  There is an increasing tendency to make the county council a dumping ground for awkward problems that the central authority wants to get rid of. If the county councils get this land, what are they to do with it?  How are they to deal with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> I see no useful purpose that this section can do.  You are more apt to have wirepulling.  Picture what you are going to add to the present irrelevancies of the county councils' discussions. I am sure you will agree with me as to the amount of time that is wasted by the county councils over petty matters that are often not germane to the business of the councils at all.  The most difficult problem of all others is that connected with land.  The county council, when dealing with matters of that kind, cannot get away from personalities.  I know that the section is permissive, but being permissive does not make it any better. You would get all kinds of influences at work inducing the county councils to acquire land, and you would have all the undesirable consequences that flow from that.  I press this amendment of mine most strongly.  I ask those Senators here who have experience of county councils to say that it will not add to the efficiency or the prestige of the county councils to have work of this kind imposed on them.</P>

      <P>I do not rise for the purpose of seconding the amendment, but to remind Senator Sir John Keane that there are urban councils, at any rate, that do own land, and make good use of it for the benefit of the inhabitants of their particular area, whether for the purpose of planting potatoes or grazing cows.  Such land in the neighbourhood of a township is of enormous value&mdash;in urban districts at any rate&mdash;and I do think if this privilege is to be given to county councils there should be some exceptions made where there are a number of townships that do not rejoice in urban councils.  Communal lands are of extreme value to the residents of these townships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me, if Senator Sir John Keane is right, that county councils and all local government bodies should be abolished, and that all local services should be centralised, because, according to the Senator, apparently county councils are unfitted for the exercise of their functions. This section is permissive.  It is <Col N="1070" /> not mandatory on the councils to take the lands.  What Senator Sir John Keane fears is that the councils will unwisely take lands, and that they will make unwise use of the lands.  That frame of mind, if taken logically, leads to the abolition of county councils. There were some discussions here, and in the Dáil, on this section, and all that discussion comes to this, that the county councils are not able to take care of themselves, that they are incompetent bodies who can be got at and wangled, and that they are given over to waste.  Now, all that comes from people who are very careful and jealous about removing the rights and privileges of local bodies and local authorities.  What is the idea of this section?  Senator Sir John Keane has not put it in the way in which it has been expressed in the Dáil.  The usual criticism of the section is: &ldquo;How can the county council farm land?&rdquo; Nobody wants the county council to farm land.  The county council wants land for a great many purposes.  They have tillage schemes, cow-parks, housing and a hundred and one other things in every county, and this is a case of giving them land to meet cases like these.</P>
      <P>There is, let us say, land near a town. Let me take a case that justifies this section.  It is the kind of case that will often happen.  There is land near a town.  There are annuities due on it. There are rates due on it.  Arrears are accumulating and for one reason or another it is very difficult to sell it.  The annuities and the arrears are meanwhile being paid out of the grants towards the rates.  These losses fall on the general body of the ratepayers.  The county council could use these lands. But they have to acquire them under the powers given under the existing Acts.  That would be a very long process and they might find unforeseen difficulties in the way when they wanted to acquire these lands.  The county councils are fairly well tied up under the existing Acts so far as their powers of acquiring property are concerned. If they tried to acquire this land under the existing Acts they might find great difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> But here is a case where there is land near the town and it is useful for housing purposes, cow-parks or tillage, and the unfortunate ratepayers are paying out annuities due on that farm. The owner of the farm can snap his fingers at everybody.  The county council is the ideal body to acquire that land if they want to build houses.  They can do that if they want to do it, and no one is forcing them to do it.  No one is forcing the land on them.  In the same way it might be useful for a hundred and one other purposes.  It is only right that if the land would be found useful for the purposes of the county council that the county council should have power to take over that land on which the annuities and rates are not paid and we should facilitate their doing that in every way and not put them to the trouble and expense of having inquiries that they would have to go through in order to acquire land under the existing Acts.  If the county councils are to be able to meet the cases where annuities are due on land and where no one would buy that land, for one reason or another, and where the land is suitable for the purposes for which the county council may require it, then they should be given that power.  They have an absolute discretion as to the exercise of that power.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission are not attempting to hide behind the county councils.  It is the Land Commission's duty to collect annuities, and they are accepting that responsibility, and will do everything they can to collect them. It is vital that the county councils and the Land Commission should collect the annuities, for, if not, the arrears will have to be made up out of the rates. I see no objection to a certain limited co-operation between the county councils and the Land Commission in carrying out that function.  It is in order that there should be opportunities for co-operation, which could be exercised at the discretion of the county council, that the section is inserted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is not limited to acquiring land which is going to be used for any of the purposes mentioned by the Minister.  It <Col N="1072" /> gives the county council the right to buy land from the Land Commission and they may then, under a scheme which has to be approved by the Minister for Local Government, either let the land or sell it, that is, they become a kind of brokers in the mean time.  I think if they were confined to buying land for the purposes they are statutorily entitled to use the land for that would be all right, but the section goes beyond that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it gives the county council power to buy land other than for statutory purposes, but my argument is that it would be mainly for the statutory purposes they would acquire the land, and, so far as these purposes are concerned, it gives a readier method of acquirement.  But I would not wish to confine it to that. The county council might be able to sell the land where the Land Commission could not.  It is difficult, however, at this stage to foresee the possible uses, outside those that are statutory, to which the county council might put land.  If in some cases they did find where the Land Commission was not able to solve the difficulty of getting annuities, that they, themselves, could buy the land and make economic use of it, even though that use was not within their statutory powers at present, I suggest they should have the power to acquire the land with the consent of the Minister for Local Government. It is important to collect the annuities, to stop every possible gap, and to make it plainer and plainer that there is no way of stopping the collection of annuities, and it is necessary we should have all the powers necessary for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept a compromise on the lines Senator Brown has indicated, that is the acquirement of land for statutory purposes. I see a great danger in this, and I must stress it.  I can see an agitation by evicted tenants to be re-instated on the land acquired by the county councils. I need not elaborate on that. When we realise all that involves, there can be no doctrinaire attitude about the county councils.  We have to face facts as we know them.  I am not in favour <Col N="1073" /> of taking away from the legitimate powers of county councils, but I object to add to their powers and allow them to become a sort of agrarian talking shop.  Senator Sir Nugent Everard says that urban councils are not included in the section.  It would appear that urban councils require accommodation land more than other councils, but I do not know that they are authorised to acquire this land at all.  I think it is an undesirable section.  Losses are likely to be incurred which would fall upon the rates.  You are passing certain of the appropriate statutory duties of the Land Commission on to the county council, which is undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was intended, but the section does not say it, that before the Minister concurs he has to know the purpose.  I think it would meet the case if some words were inserted making it necessary he should know the purpose, so that when he is giving his concurrence he is approving of the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  The section provides that &ldquo;any lands purchased by a county council ... shall, unless the said Minister otherwise directs, be sold subject to the approval of the said Minister.&rdquo;  The Minister would hardly direct without some knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>

      <P>I think this section is a valuable one.  The Minister suggests that there may be in counties parcels of land in possession of people who are not paying their annuities, and which the county councils may be in a position to dispose of satisfactorily.  I have no fear that the county councils <Col N="1074" /> are to become brokers for the purpose of the transfer of land from one section of the community to the other.  The county council can only acquire land if the Minister approves of the purpose for which it is to be acquired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better to avoid that.  Senator Sir John Keane painted a certain picture.  Let us consider for a moment what happens if there is an abortive sale.  The tenant is in debt to the Land Commission for annuities which he refuses to pay.  He gets all he can out of the land, and he does not give a shilling to the Land Commission.  The Land Commission puts up his land for sale, and the sale is abortive.  The county council says: &ldquo;We can use this land and use it for certain purposes.  So far we have been paying the annuities.&rdquo;  The Land Commission say &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; and they take the fellow by the back of the neck and put him out of the place.  The county council is in a much stronger position than any other body in dealing with that land.  Senator Sir John Keane says the county council can divide the land amongst the evicted tenants.  I would rather see it divided amongst any other persons than the person who has it and who will not pay the annuities.</P>

      <P>I think this section is absolutely necessary.  We have found it very difficult on many occasions in Co.  Monaghan when tenants were allowed to run into arrears for many years, and perhaps left the rates unpaid as well, when the land was put up for sale, to get any purchasers.  In Co. Monaghan we instructed the solicitor to attend the sales to see that a certain price was got.  This section puts the county council in the position of being able to purchase the land.  On occasions we found it necessary to acquire land for afforestation and other purposes.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 37 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash; 37.&mdash;From the date of the passing of this Act no deduction on account of arrears of land purchase annuity shall be made from any grant paid to a county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises a very important point. I think the facts are familiar.  In the pre-Treaty days it was necessary to have penal measures by which to insure that the land purchase fund would not fall into arrears.  For that reason arrears of annuities were deducted from the grants and paid into the land purchase fund.  That was the method, that any arrears of annuities were deducted from the grant-in-aid on rates.  That has gone on ever since, and I am asking the House to say it is time it ceased with our own Government.  It is absurd to say that with all the forces of Government, and with, I hope, the improved political situation and a recognition of the fact that debts must be paid, the Central Government are not enabled to do their own work and not <Col N="1076" /> to pass this debt on to the county councils, who are powerless in the matter. Under the new section they have power apparently to traffic in land, but hitherto they had no power.  Lists of arrears were sent down to them, and they had quietly to submit to deductions being made from their grants.  We should get the people back to doing their own work, and not passing their difficulties on to the local authorities.  I can give a case which is, perhaps, exceptional. The sea has broken into the old racecourse at Tramore, and it has been flooded for years.</P>
    <P>I understand the place is now in the hands of a man who is no mark.  The annuity is piling up year after year and is deducted from the county council. That is a monstrous injustice.  I know it is a special case.  The land is of no value whatever now.  I do not know what the law is and whether the rating authority can step in and re-value the land.  I think the annuity represents about £100 yearly and, year after year, that amount is accumulating against the rates payable to the Waterford County Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator say who should pay it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>The general taxpayer, who has to pay for things not as important as this.  The time has gone by when the rates should be mulcted for the payment of arrears of annuities.  I do not make any charge against the Land Commission that I cannot prove, but the effect is, when it is known that the land purchase fund is going to be replenished automatically, naturally those concerned are not as diligent in collecting as they otherwise might be.  The debt is passed on. The line of least resistance is obviously not to press the tenant but deduct from the grants.  Other creditors are prejudiced in that way.  As the amount owing for annuities accumulates ordinary creditors find it difficult to collect their debts.  It is a lax and a demoralising <Col N="1077" /> practice, and I ask the House to say that it should cease, and that the Land Commission should do their own work and collect these annuities, just as the revenue authorities do their work.  There is no reason why there should be a difference between the methods of the Land Commission and other Departments.  The local ratepayers are heavily burdened, now that there is such great agricultural depression, and they should not have to bear this special penal imposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's suggestion is that the taxes instead of the rates should pay these arrears.  I presume he knows enough about the collection of land purchase annuities to know that the collection is the most efficient in the world.  We will always have some arrears for a short time.  I presume the Senator knows that this is interest on borrowed money, and that it must be paid, not the day after it is due but the day it is due.  He knows that you will never have farmers so meticulous about the payment of debts that they will pay the annuities on the very day they are due.  Remember if there are two months' arrears in one case then the money must be found somewhere immediately.  The Senator's suggestion is that it should be found from the taxes instead of from the rates.  He went on in the most illogical manner to say, because the Land Commission knew they could get the money from the rates then their solicitor is lax in collecting.  If, on the other hand, the Land Commission's solicitor was zealous and knew that the money had to be found immediately from taxation that would ginger him up at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>He would have the Finance Minister at his heels.  He is a great deal quicker than the county councils, who have no power to bring pressure to bear on the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am admitting, only for the sake of argument, that the Land Commission is lax in collecting. It is not so as a matter of fact.  The Land Commission goes on collecting the whole time, as the money must be <Col N="1078" /> found.  It is found from the rates now, but the Senator's suggestion is that it should be found from taxation.  One of the results, he says will be that that will immediately affect the Land Commission solicitor, and that he would proceed with the greatest energy.  The Senator explained that the Minister for Finance would have to deal with it. What about the Minister for Local Government?  Other things being equal presumably both are doing their job. One man is anxious to keep the county councils right and the other to see taxes collected.  We must assume that both are doing their work.  We cannot legislate on the assumption that the Minister for Finance will be anxious to do his work while the Minister for Local Government would be the direct opposite.  That is the logical position the Senator put up.  The Senator must be very innocent.  He wants to know why the unfortunate ratepayers rather than the taxpayers should be saddled with this burden, having started by admitting that it must be paid and that no collection, no matter how efficient, will obviate the necessity of having some arrears for a short time.  I wonder does the Senator know why the ratepayers are asked to pay?  Surely it is because in the ordinary case the farmer does not pay the annuity promptly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission in recovering it may have to put the land up for sale. The tenant gets a few neighbours to prevent the auctioneer selling it and to intimidate people from buying it or buying his stock if put into the pound. The neighbours have to do their duty as citizens or pay for not doing it. They have either to pay a portion of the arrears of annuities out of the rates or see that the tenants pay.  I think that is a perfectly proper dilemma to put them in.  I think there is some commonsense behind that.  They who might have obviated the difficulty should be made pay a share of what must be paid, rather than the general taxpayer.  The Senator must know that otherwise it would be extremely difficult for us to do what we are gradually succeeding in doing, getting people to buy farms and stock that have been seized in respect of land purchase <Col N="1079" /> annuities.  Every day the situation is getting somewhat easier.  We find it easier now to get farms sold because people are no longer soft-hearted.  They ask themselves: &ldquo;Why should we pay this man's annuity?  Why should we not take advantage of the fact that his farm is for sale?&rdquo; People are cooperating more than in the past in liquidating their debts.  The Senator, who is all for security, law and order and everything that is right, wants to alter the whole process.</P>

      <P>The Minister draws a parallel between the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Local Government is powerless except that a certain amount of annuities that are in arrear are charged against the rates. The Minister for Finance, as suggested by Senator Keane, is certainly in a position to ginger up the collection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>The parallel between the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance is not the ridiculous parallel that it is suggested it is.  After all, the money is not a gift to the taxpayer.  It is merely a forestalling of the payments. As far as I know the number of annuities in arrear are ridiculously small. From year to year a certain number remain unpaid.  From my knowledge of county councils the preparation of their estimates is a very troublesome process.  They know that grants come from certain sources, and having estimated for these grants they find sometimes that they are not paid.  That disorganises their financial arrangements. I feel that if the amendment were accepted there would be no loss to the State, while things would be made much easier for the county councils.  I <Col N="1080" /> think what the Minister suggests has arisen, not from that innate desire to see that rates should press heavily but from the fact that the people are awakening to a sense of duty, and to see that men who are not making an attempt to farm their land should be deprived of it.  That spirit is growing and will continue to grow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>If the House agrees that land purchase annuities must be paid&mdash;as I take it Senator Keane will insist&mdash;then I think this amendment should be rejected.  A good deal of the disposition to refuse to pay annuities has been caused by the preachings of people who are themselves members of county councils.  If you relieve them of the responsibility of making the ratepayers pay for annuities that have not been paid by the occupiers of the land you are going to make the position even worse than it is.  I think the general experience is that those who fail to pay annuities are people with large holdings and best able to pay.  They do not believe in making the sacrifices that small peasant farmers make to meet their debts.  They are not prepared to put up with the same hardships in order to meet their debts.  That is the class of people mainly responsible for the greater portion of the arrears of annuities. I know that is the general complaint throughout the West of Ireland, with which I am well acquainted.</P>
      <P>There is a general demand that the names of these defaulting annuitants should be published.  It is felt that that demand should be acceded to, and that in every county the names of defaulting tenants should be broadcast in the local newspapers.  In that way a certain amount of local moral pressure would be brought to bear on these people to make them meet their debts. That will be found to have more effect than if the State, through the central exchequer, were responsible for annuities falling due.  It is not fair to the ordinary taxpayer of a county that he should be made responsible for arrears in an adjoining county or in another part of the country.  I think if the occupying tenant is not to be responsible the charge should be a county charge, rather than a national charge.</P>

      <P>I think there is a great deal in the amendment proposed by Senator Sir John Keane.  There should be no obligation on the county council because of the non-payment of annuities. It is up to the Land Commission to try, as far as possible, to recover these annuities which are due to the Commission.  The present state of affairs is that, if any person fails, or neglects, to pay his annuity, the amount of that annuity is deducted from the agricultural grant.  It is, therefore, chargeable to the ratepayers, and it is a loss to them.  No one wants, certainly I do not, to encourage the non-payment of annuities, but I do think that the Land Commission could make a great effort to recover annuities due to them.  County councils are often up against local prejudice of one kind or another, and I think the machinery would be very unwieldy if every county council were obliged to take action for the recovery of annuities. That would be a very troublesome process, and you might get individuals on the council who are interested in the locality from which the defaulting annuitant came, to refuse to give their consent to the county council taking action.  The Land Commission is in quite a different position.  I think it is up to the Land Commission to recover all annuities that are due to them, and that it should not be an obligation of the county council.  The Land Commission has a simple way for recovering these annuities.  I think a greater effort should be made on the part of the Land Commission to recover all annuities due.  It would be much easier for them to do so than to get the county council to collect them. I agree, of course, that the annuities should not be charged on the general taxpayer.</P>

      <P>I believe that is a very good state of affairs, and that nothing we do here should be calculated to bring about a change in that state of affairs.  I believe if this amendment is passed we will have a considerably greater amount of arrears to the Land Commission in the future, and, consequently, a greater reduction in grants to the county council.</P>
      <P>I believe that the various county councils who have had the matter under consideration are taking steps in some cases to publish in the local Press the names of people who owe annuities. Even the threat of publication in the county I come from has had a considerable effect in regard to the payment of arrears, but if the county council or the local authority has no interest in the matter in future, there is a great danger that some councils will encourage defaulters to continue to remain in arrears rather than to pay or to take any steps to encourage them to pay.  I believe it would be a great mistake to pass this amendment.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the discussion, I should like to ask whether the fact that the amount of the accumulated arrears is comparatively small, is not due to the fact that so much of the arrears was deducted in the grants that would otherwise be payable to the county council, and that the number of people who are actually in arrears is not very small?  I would like further to ask whether the Minister is not aware that in many instances county councillors themselves are very large defaulters?</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister would deal with the case I mentioned, where the sea has flooded a large area of land, and state, if for all eternity, the ratepayers are to continue to pay an annuity for this land.  It is held by a man of no means, but there is an annuity payable on it.  In regard to what has been said about the improvement in public opinion, if there is an improvement it is very belated, and it is rather hard to explain, because in 1925 or 1926 the Banking Commission reported, when dealing with rural <Col N="1083" /> credits, that 50 per cent. of the land annuitants were in default.  Perhaps the prospects of getting loans under the new credit schemes has induced more annuitants to pay up.  We are advised in our county council that if, in publishing the names of defaulters, we were to make a single mistake, we would be liable for an action for libel. These names are furnished by the Land Commission, and we have no means of checking them.  We might give the right name and the wrong address, or the right surname and wrong Christian name.  If we gave the wrong address or the wrong name we would leave ourselves open to an action; that is the reason we are afraid to publish the names.  For the life of me, I cannot see any difference between the payment of these annuities and the payment of any other debt to the State. The State does not attach any such conditions to the collection of income tax. Why should it attach it in this case?</P>

      <P>Section 39.  To delete the section and to substitute therefor a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo; 39.&mdash;Regulations may be made by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture to provide for the lease or sale by the Land Commission of any fisheries vested in them under Section 45 of the Land Act, 1923.  If the sale of fishing rights in rivers or waters adjoining or intersecting their holdings be made to the tenant purchasers of such holdings, the purchase price may be made repayable by means of such purchase annuities (to be consolidated with the standard purchase annuites of the holdings in question) as the Land Commission may consider reasonable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section is worded it looks as if the only purchaser contemplated by the section was the tenant, as it says: &ldquo;The regulations made by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture may provide for the sale by the Land Commission to tenant purchasers of fishing rights.&rdquo;  That has been interpreted in parts of the country as meaning that the Land Commission is not going to sell the fishing rights to anybody but the tenant.  I know that is not so and that they are going to sell the fishery rights where they can sell them in lump to some body or individual who will be willing to pay for them and run them properly.  As the section <Col N="1085" /> stands, there is a certain amount of doubt as to whether the tenant is the only contemplated purchaser.  I know he is not, but if the Minister accepts the amendment as framed by Senator the Earl of Kerry, it does exactly what this section effects, and there will be no doubt.  If it is sold to the tenant what he will have to pay can be paid by annual payments with his annuity.</P>

      <P>I understood from Senator the Earl of Kerry that the Minister had discussed this matter with him.  I think some modification like this is necessary because in some places we may have the anomaly that one tenant is owner of the fishing rights along his land and another tenant is not.  In the case of a lake there would be 30 or more riparian owners and the rights would be divided into so many sections that the fishing would be no longer an asset.  I think for the sake of the inland fisheries it is a very important thing to have it made clear.  At present the onus is put on the annuitant to ask that the fishing rights will not be included in his holding.</P>

    <P>I regret to say, owing to my absence in the West, I was unable to give notice of this amendment.  If Senators permit me, I think this would be the best place to raise the question.  It <Col N="1088" /> is a point I raised when the Bill was, under discussion in the first instance. It relates to an improvement schedule When the Bill was before the House for its Second Reading I called attention to the fact that the whole of the work would have to be carried out and the whole of the charges incurred before anybody would know what proportion of the cost he would be liable for.  The section further provides that this information, which I suggest should be given in the first instance, shall be given after the whole of the work is completed.  Hitherto, whenever a drainage district was in contemplation by local boards, the Board had to submit schedules showing the amount of the land improved, its estimated improved value, and the proportion the owner would have to contribute towards the cost of the work.  In the first place, that would be prepared by valuers, and they may make mistakes. If this information were given a man would be in a position to see whether his land was supposed to receive a greater benefit than someone else.  He could raise that question, and it could be investigated.  Under this schedule it is quite possible that he might find himself assessed for a greater improvement than he thought he received, or, in fact, received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DUGGAN (Parliamentary Secretary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the practice has been departed from in this case is that, under the provisions of this Bill, the owner of the land could not have the right to vote as under the ordinary arterial drainage scheme.  The scheme will be entered on irrespective of their wishes.  The reason is that this is an attempt to deal with what is regarded as a national problem, and the evidence of that is the State is paying half the cost and the local councils are contributing further substantial portions.  The owners are only paying an infinitesimal proportion.  The scheme would be delayed very considerably if the particulars asked for in this amendment were to be contained in the draft scheme instead of, as provided in the Bill, in the draft award.</P>

      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary has omitted the <Col N="1089" /> point at issue.  It is true that in the past owners had a right to object, but certainly a person whose lands were improved should know whether he is being charged more than his neighbour. I have been engaged in these matters for a great part of my life.  I know that the work must have been already done to a large extent, and the statement that it would cost a great deal does not hold water.  I think everyone should have the right to know whether he was fairly assessed compared with his neighbour, and I think the only way to get that information is by the lodgment of what is known as the improvement schedule.  It has been of great value, and I do not know why it has been departed from here.</P>

      <P>I found the same difficulty.  The Minister says the amount to be assessed on the occupier is very small and that justifies departure from usual practice.  What evidence has he got?  There is the general fact that the State are paying half the costs and the occupiers and the county councils are paying the other half. That is not relating to the amount of land benefited.  We are entirely in the dark about that.  It is possible that the extra rate on the land might be equal to £2 an acre.  This Bill enables that rate to be imposed on an occupier or alternatively to be borne by the local authority.  This departure from what Senator Barrington states is the usual practice causes us to inquire critically into this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 8.  Before sub-section (5) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5) (a).  The foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply to the compensation (if any) to be paid to the Grand Canal Company in respect of permanent injury to the navigation of the River Barrow and the canals connected therewith by the execution of the said works.</P>
      <P>(b) On the expiration of five years after the works to be executed under the scheme shall have been completed, the Grand Canal Company may require that the questions whether any permanent injury has been occasioned to the said navigation by the execution of the said works and whether any permanent benefit has been occasioned to the said navigation by the execution of the said works shall be referred to the arbitration of a competent engineer appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and such engineer shall also determine whether any and, if any, how much compensation is payable to the Grand Canal Company in respect of such permanent injury (if any) after taking into consideration such permanent benefit (if any).  The costs of both parties of such arbitration shall be in the discretion of the said arbitrator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section provides for two kinds of compensation&mdash;first, for land compulsorily taken, and second, it provides for easements and rights, like rights of water, should they be interfered with. So far as interference with water rights is concerned, the most serious, probably the only serious one, will be interference with the navigation of the Grand Canal Company.  Portion of the Barrow, I think nearly 40 miles of it, is the actual property of the Grand Canal Company.  That is to say, they actually own the bed and soil of the river.  They have canalised the river, and for something like 40 miles they are the owners of it.  They are a great carrying company acting for the public as well as for themselves.  Whatever <Col N="1093" /> scheme is proposed by the Commissioners will affect, to some extent, the River Barrow and the Canal Company. It may, and it is hoped it will, only affect them slightly.  In fact, I think the Minister is optimistic enough to think that it may improve the navigation of the Grand Canal Company.  But water is one of those things which nobody can count upon when it comes to be operated.  What happens at present is this.  At a very heavy downfall of rain, or after a prolonged rainfall, the water is held up by the undrained land round the Barrow.  It is like a sponge; it keeps the water there and lets it off very gradually, so that in fact there is never a very great rush of water down the Barrow Canal navigation, and by means of its being let off slowly the water is kept the longer for their navigation than it otherwise would be.  They are afraid when this drainage scheme comes to be operated the flood will be carried off quickly and may very seriously injure the navigation.  It may reduce the level of the water for considerable periods owing to the fact that the water will rush down instead of coming down gradually as before.</P>
    <P>Nobody can tell what is going to be the effect of this drainage scheme. What I propose by this amendment is that the case of the Grand Canal Company should be taken out of the general provision for compensation provided by this section, and that there should be a separate arbitration as to the estimate of damage, if any, or benefit, if any, that the Grand Canal Company will receive when this scheme has been put into operation.  Nobody can tell what it is going to do.  The arbitration provided for here, in this scheme, is arbitration on a draft award, that is, practically before anybody can tell what will happen under the scheme.  What I propose is that that arbitration should not be held for five years.  During these five years there will be probably one wet year and one dry year.  I myself would rather have ten years than five years in the amendment.  But if you are going to confine it to an arbitration on the draft award the Grand Canal Company <Col N="1094" /> may get very much too little or too much.  I press very strongly upon the Minister the desirability of accepting this amendment.  The only possible objection that can be urged to it is some financial one, that it might be necessary to hold up the money for five or ten years, which is not a usual thing to do in Bills of this kind.  But this is a very peculiar case and I do not see why the money could not be held up.  It will not have to be paid over until the award is made.  It will not increase or alter the capital liability of the Commissioners at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DUGGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty with regard to this amendment is the one pointed out by the Senator himself just now.  The financial scheme of the Bill is that each liability must be settled by the final award.  I do not see how we would get over the difficulty of having an unascertained liability pending for five years.  The cost of the scheme has to be fixed, and the various parties liable have to be assessed.  I do not see how we could get over that liability. I have no objection to the special arbitration asked for, and if the Senator was prepared to accept that part of his amendment we might bring in something in a modified form dealing with it on Report.  But as to the rest of the amendment, the question is how to get over the financial responsibility of having this liability for five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a new section be inserted before Section 13, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No draft award shall be approved by the Commissioners if it is objected to at the inquiry by two-thirds of the occupiers whose lands are to be benefited or by three or more of the county councils mentioned in the Schedule to this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the same point that we had a division on just now.  The Minister is not very helpful over this Bill.  He made certain general statements that this scheme is going to cost so little to the occupiers that the usual procedure is not going to be followed.  He said there is a considerable free grant.  But what is the cost?  Does he know what it is going to cost to the occupier?  Has he any indication how much the land is to benefit?  The area is small but the cost is high.  We are asked, with no knowledge of the facts, to legislate so as to impose these costs upon the occupiers. It is not reasonable to do so. The Minister himself knows that hitherto occupiers had a right to object. I have put it that if two-thirds <Col N="1096" /> of the occupiers object to the draft award or three or more of the county councils, that it does not go on.  I should say that if the Minister is so optimistic about the small costs, he should not object to this amendment which is needed to effectively safeguard those affected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdmundJDuggan" hpid="Mr. DUGGAN Mr. DUGGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DUGGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear whether the Senator appreciates what the effect of his amendment, if accepted, would be.  It would be that after the work had been completed two-thirds of the occupiers, and a certain number of the county councils, who are the persons who would be supposed to contribute the share of the cost, would simply, by coming in and objecting, put themselves in the position that they would not pay anything, the work having already been done.  The State would have to bear the whole cost of the scheme.  It is possible that when the Senator says that no draft award shall be approved by the Commissioners he means that the scheme itself be not approved.</P>

      <P>This section provides for the maintenance of the works for thirty-five years.  During that period half the maintenance is to be met by the Drainage Board and the other half is to be provided out of the moneys which will be provided by the Oireachtas.  These two sums of money will have to be expended by the Commissioners.  They may expend the whole money that comes to them each year in that year, or they may not expend the whole of it, and perhaps some surplus may remain over.  The section, as it stands, gives them a right during the thirty-five years to use the surplus moneys along with what is coming to them every year for maintenance, but the amendment asks that at the end of thirty-five years, if they still have that surplus money, they ought to have the power of spending that on maintenance.

    <P>We can deal with all these amendments together.  Section 27, as it stands, is a section for the protection of the Railway Company, and what it protects is the railway and the railway bridges.  If they are interfered with by the carrying out of this scheme it is only right and proper that a section should be inserted for their protection.  The same thing may happen in the case of the Canal Company. The canal, either in the canalised portion of the Barrow River or the canal itself, may be interfered with by the working of this scheme.  If that is so the same protection should be given to the Canal Company as is given to the Railway Company.  I think the only quarrel that the Minister will have with my amendments is the word &ldquo;works.&rdquo;  I do not think the Minister will object to include the bridges in the section, but I understand that he does object to the use of the word &ldquo;works.&rdquo;  He thinks it is too vague.

      <P>In connection with this motion, amongst the amendments for the consideration of which the Senator seeks to have this Bill re-committed, there are two by Senator Dowdall, and there are amendments that appear for the first time standing in the name of the Government.  The Government amendments have never been discussed, but the Senator's amendments were discussed in the Committee Stage, and again on the Report Stage, and disposed of.  They were moved in the Senator's absence by Senator Bennett.  It would be contrary to precedent under ordinary circumstances if I were to sanction the motion to re-commit the Bill in respect <Col N="1105" /> of amendments which were ruled out in Committee and in Report, but inasmuch as the Government had taken advantage of the holding up of the Report Stage to bring in a number of amendments dealing with the same section to which the Senator's amendments refer, I think the Senator deserves some credit for his adroitness in putting in his amendments while moving to re-commit the Bill.  In permitting this motion to be moved I hope it will never be quoted as a precedent by my successors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I might, with your consent, deal generally with the principle of these amendments.  A simple explanation will suffice.  First of all, there are two new sub-sections &mdash;4 and 6&mdash;to Sections 154 and 155. These are amendments 8 and 9, and are intended to apply to the translation into Irish of any books published in Saorstát Eireann before the Treaty. We had already agreed in principle with regard to the making of compilations for educational purposes.  We want that to apply also to books published in the Free State prior to the Treaty.  The amendment down to Section 167 is merely a drafting amendment to correct a wrong reference to <Col N="1106" /> an earlier section in the Bill.  The last amendment, No. 42, is to ensure that under the section dealing with the provision of copies of books to Trinity College and to English libraries that they will not get double copies.  In addition, there are amendments 24, 25 and 26, which are consequential.  The other amendments put down as from the Government merely make a change in the Bill consequent on what I forecasted might be the result of certain amendments that have been passed. It has been discovered that, in consequence of amendments passed in the Dáil, and accepted here, the Copyright Act of 1911 does not apply to this country.  Consequently, we have taken the step of leaving the Commonwealth Union.  The net result is that, instead of our getting automatic reciprocity as between England and the self-governing Dominions and the Free State we will have to make separate arrangements with each of the Dominions. These can easily be made, but it will mean a little delay.  The net result of these amendments can be summed up in this way: We have two separate sections. Section 175 deals with the immediate extension of this part of the Act to Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the British Dominions and Protectorates. Section 176 gives power to the Governor-General, on the advice of the Executive Council by Order, to extend this to works published elsewhere than Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the British Dominions and Protectorates. We have to delete Section 175 and make such consequential changes in Section 176 and elsewhere in this part of the Act as would allow the Governor-General to extend by Order the same things as were previously decided in the case of foreign countries, also to Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the British Dominions and Protectorates. That is the net result of the other amendments down in the name of the Government.  A big majority of the amendments deal with readjustment of that part of the Act and the new situation.  The net effect of the new situation is that we must make our arrangements with each Dominion and Protectorate separately, instead of having all done at once.</P>

      <P>As I explained, in so far as our relations depend, anything we agree about can be adjusted under Section 176.  In other words, this Order can be made applicable under certain conditions to America. The difficulty about the interregnum period does not lie with us.  It lies in the legislation of the United States. The rule we have seems to forbid the giving of any retro-active effect.  The Order made is the Order which will be enforced here under Section 176 in the interregnum period to which the section refers.  We would have no difficulty with it, but under the existing legislation it is doubtful if the American President could make his Order have retrospective effect.  As far as we can arrange things on this side this arrangement will be made.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 154, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 38 to insert the words &ldquo;in case the author is a citizen of Saorstát Eireann, and desires to secure copyright in Saorstát Eireann, the work for which <Col N="1108" /> copyright is sought to be secured shall be printed in Saorstát Eireann, anything in this Act to the contrary notwithstanding; and&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I see that in the report of the debate on the Committee Stage, Senator Brown&mdash;and I think the Minister&mdash; stated he was fortified by the opinion of the Attorney-General, for both of whose opinions I have the very highest regard.  Senator Brown stated that in his opinion Canada was absolutely outside the Berne Convention. He said: &ldquo;Canada is distinctly outside the Berne Convention and I do not think any lawyer-reading the provisions I have read would come to any other conclusion.&rdquo;  In Copinger's &ldquo;The Law of Copyright,&rdquo; sixth edition, 1927, it is definitely stated that &ldquo;Canada adhered to the Berne Convention and to the Protocol of 1914 on January 1st, 1924.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I believe so.  That is the reason I am raising it now. Copinger's book is the highest authority on copyright law.  Canada cannot be within the Berne Convention if we are outside it.  The Canadian Almanac, 1926, edited by two lawyers, A.W. Thomas and Horace C. Cooner, is more specific.  On page 411 it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the same date Canada's adherence to the revised Convention of Berne and the extension of the British Copyright Act, 1911, became effective.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the divergent views of the lawyers on this question.  I believe the Berne Convention is to meet in Rome this year.  As we have waited so long, it might be well to have the copyright section deleted or amended in the sense that I wish and let our representative get a decisive ruling at the Convention if we are in and Canada out, both countries having the same provisions.  Some time ago I bought an Anthology of Irish verse.  The compiler paid a tribute to the assistance he got from Senator Yeats.  That book was published by Macmillans and was printed in England.  It contained a considerable number of theses which could not be copyright owing to the lapse of time.  It also contained 60 contributions in which copyright existed, and the compiler paid a tribute to the authors' indulgence in allowing him to reproduce them.  The contributions of other people in which no copyright existed were reproduced in England and published there, and copyright was claimed for the whole lot. I submit that if there was such a provision as is embodied in my amendment, that abuse of copyright would not be permitted.  This matter was dealt with at considerable length on the Committee Stage.  We were told in the Press and by Senator Yeats at considerable length that this was an illiterate country in which no one reads. He assured us he would go to the Border if this amendment were carried.  If that is true, what is the object of proposing this amendment? A good many people may read unknown to those who are opposing the amendment.  We were told: &ldquo;Here there are 3,000,000, the vast majority semi-illiterates who read nothing.&rdquo; The same person who wrote that also wrote this.  &ldquo;An Open Letter to Rudyard Kipling,&rdquo; apparently when Kipling was endeavouring to protect his <Col N="1110" /> own copyright in America.  Here is the extract:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;But you, brother (because he was a poet, I suppose), have withheld your fears for your country and mine until they could yield you a profit in two continents.  After all this high speech about the Lord and the hour of national darkness, it shocks me to find this following your verses: &lsquo;Copyrighted in the United States of America by Rudyard Kipling.&rsquo; You are not in want.  You are the most successful man of letters of your time, and yet you are not above making profit out of the perils of your country.  You ape the lordly speech of the Prophets, and you conclude by warning everybody not to reprint your words at their peril.  In Ireland every poet we honour has dedicated his genius to his country without gain, and has given without stint, without any niggardly withholding of his gift when his nation was in dark and evil days.  Not one of our writers, when deeply moved about Ireland, has tried to sell the gift of the spirit.  You, brother, hurt me when you declare your principles, and declare a dividend to yourself out of your patriotism openly and at the same time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The men who are opposing this amendment are the men who got their inspiration and a good deal of their material from what goes on in this country.  After all we are interested in this country and in the people here. Having got a footing here they proceed as the Canadian authors did.  When they have made good in London, Gilbert Parker and Ralph Connor have to go back for their Canadian copyright and print in Canada.  If that is a hardship it is a hardship that at least gives a certain amount of employment, and it may in time enable Canada to introduce very beautiful editions of books. I believe we had a reputation in this country hundreds of years ago for the manner in which books were reproduced. Within the last few years I have seen beautiful books reproduced in Dublin at a comparatively moderate price and I think the citizens of Saorstát Eireann are not under any hardship <Col N="1111" /> if they are compelled to do what Canadian authors have to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say&mdash; notwithstanding what my friend, Senator Dowdall, has urged&mdash;that I am still absolutely of opinion that the introduction of this amendment into this Bill will exclude us from the Berne Convention. In my opinion Canada has broken a condition of the Berne Convention. Canada has not been formally excluded from the Berne Convention. She could be excluded from the Berne Convention to-morrow and it is only because it is not worth anyone's while she has not been.  Why is it not worth while?  Because Canada is 3,500 miles from this country and the only country that is near her is America, and America is not a member of the Berne Convention.  I understand there is to be a meeting of the Berne Convention this year and very probably the question of the Canadian position will be brought up.  If it is I have no doubt whatever that unless Canada changes her law of copyright, she will have to leave the Berne Convention. The results were explained when this matter was before the House by Senator Yeats and by myself, and, I think, also by the Minister.  It would be absolutely fatal and merely mean that every work produced by Irish writers who did not take the rather mean course of making themselves citizens of Great Britain could be pirated in every other country which is a member of the Berne Convention.</P>

It states: &ldquo;In case the author is a citizen <Col N="1112" /> of Saorstát Eireann and desires to secure copyright in Saorstát Eireann the work for which copyright is sought to be secured shall be printed in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  How much of the work is to be printed here?  For instance, if the sales are a prospective 10,000, of which 1,000 is to be sold in the Saorstát, is the whole 10,000 to be printed here, or shall he be compelled only to print as many as he hopes to sell here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems the matter can be very well overcome by printing a very small edition here if the author thinks he can print cheaper outside the Saorstát.  Publication is a commercial matter just the same as every other business matter, and if he can get it printed at a cheaper rate outside naturally he will overcome this provision by printing the very smallest edition possible here.  I think it would be unreasonable to compel him to print here books which he expects to sell elsewhere.  If we can only compel him to print here the number which he can sell here, I do not think we are going to give a tremendous amount of employment to printers.  It is really from that point of view the amendment is proposed&mdash;to get work done here which might otherwise be done elsewhere. If we are going to create a great deal of annoyance and put the few writers we have to a financial loss as a result of it, I do not think it would be worth doing so for the sake of the amount of employment that would be given.  We have not many writers but we have a few undoubtedly and I fear that the printing of the output of these writers to the extent that it is sold in Ireland is an exceedingly small matter. It is certainly hardly a matter that would justify us in putting writers to this additional expense.</P>

The object that Senator Dowdall's amendment would secure is that Irish authors resident in Ireland should before they secure copyright in their own country have at least the book printed in this country.  I would like to ask Senator Yeats to give us the history of the book which he spoke of in such feeling terms on the last occasion.  I would ask him is it true that the British Post Office authorities have really refused to send this book through their channels, that it has been actually refused in America, that the indelicacy and the outrageous character of that book were of such a nature that it would not be permitted to go through the ordinary channels of delivery in any Christian country?  There are eminent men in various countries, many eminent men in literature, eminent men in science, <Col N="1114" /> eminent men in Christian life, and I shall leave it to this House to judge which is the greater eminence, Christian eminence or the eminence that would destroy all semblance of Christianity on the face of the earth?

I do not like it to be supposed that I did not mention the name of James Joyce because the book was a discredit to him.  I did not mention the name, because it had nothing to do with the issue.  Some 150 of the most eminent men in Europe signed the protest against the mutilation and piracy of James Joyce's book in America.  Some of these men sincerely admired that book and thought it a very great book.  Some of those who signed the protest did not admire it at all and signed it simply because of the copyright issue.  I know of one case, certainly, where a very eminent person disapproved greatly of the book, but his signature was given because of the copyright issue.  American publishers had a perfect right to print that book according to the law, because it was not copyright in America.  Reputable American publishers do not so pirate work.  There are more or less disreputable publishers who do.  There is a publisher called Roothe who pirated this book of James Joyce.  I am not going to defend James Joyce.  It is a very difficult question.  Has the Senator ever looked into Rabelais?  Rabelais is looked upon as one of the greatest masters of the past, and what is to be said of James Joyce may be said of Rabelais.</P>

    <P>I would point out to the Senator that attached to this petition is the name of Gentile, the Italian Minister of Education, who has restored religious teaching to the schools in Italy. Another who signed this was the great Catholic philosopher of Spain, Unamuno.  Does he think, leaving aside these men of special religious achievement, that there is nothing to be said for a book or a man testified to by the head of the Spanish Academy, the President of the famous Russian Academy of Letters, by various members <Col N="1116" /> of the French Academy of great eminence, and by the greatest living mathematician, Einstein?  When I heard the Senator put up Irish opinions as against these, as certainly and definitely right, then I was inclined to believe this was an illiterate nation. These things cannot be settled as easily as that.  I do not know whether Joyce's &ldquo;Ulysses&rdquo; is a great work of literature.  I have puzzled a great deal over that question.</P>

      <P>All I will say is that it is the work of an heroic mind.  I think Senator Dowdall acted without due thought in bringing forward this amendment.  I was visited by an eminent Irish scholar who asked me to urge the House to throw out this printing clause in the interests of Irish scholarship, very largely in the interests of Irish Gaelic scholarship. Certain Irish books on phonetics are printed in Copenhagen and Germany because the characters do not exist in any Irish printing office.  If this clause were passed, then in the case of those books written by Irishmen those firms would lose their Irish copyright.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He then however passed on to a very much more serious thing.  Most of the work of scholarship has to be published at certain great presses which are subventioned, the Clarendon Press at Oxford and the University Press at Cambridge.  We may take it that no Irish printer or publisher would deal with that kind of scholarship at all, for such works have a very small immediate sale.  The sale is so small that it would not pay an Irish publisher to print those works without a subvention from the State or the University.  But we are all thinking of the future.  We are hoping that in the course of the next twenty or thirty years a very considerable reading public will grow up in this country. You are dealing with property which lasts not only for the lifetime of the author but for fifty years after his death.  Some of the work of the scholars may be valuable property which they should have the right to <Col N="1117" /> leave to their children.  If you pass this law you will pass a law which will injure Irish scholars.  You will deprive those scholars of a copyright which may grow to be of great monetary value.  We differ from Canada because in Canada there is a publishing centre and wealthy Universities.  I think there are endowed University presses there.  Furthermore, there is nothing in Canada like the great Irish republic of Letters which has grown up here for two centuries.  One of the few means by which an Irish scholar can make money is by contributing to certain great collective publications like the universal histories now being published at the Cambridge Press.  There are three great universal histories, ancient, modern and mediaeval, being published in many volumes by that Press. In those volumes portions are by separate scholars.  Some are by Irish scholars.  There is no possibility of getting those printed in Ireland.  An Irish publisher could take out a whole section of one of those books dealing with Ireland and pirate it here.  If there were no piracy then the Senator's printing clause would be inoperative. It is a clause which the whole world will regard as an incitement to piracy.  There are also such compilations as the &ldquo;Dictionary of National Biography,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Encyclopædia Britannica.&rdquo;  Several of our Irish scholars have worked on these for many years.</P>
    <P>There are always new editions. Universal histories will always be produced. The whole publishing and printing system by which Irish scholars live will be upset not only in dealing with these great compilations but in connection with another side of the question which Senator Dowdall has not thought of.  If his final amendment down on the Paper is carried no Irish writer will be able to serialise his work in England.  A young novelist will not be able to publish his stories in the &ldquo;Windsor&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pall Mall&rdquo; magazines.  I have mentioned a case in which an eminent Irish writer has just finished an important autobiography which in the ordinary course of events would be published in an English <Col N="1118" /> newspaper.  That work could be pirated here.  The Irish newspapers might take out large sections.  What would happen to an Irish author?  He sends a story to the &ldquo;Windsor Magazine.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Windsor Magazine&rdquo; says: &ldquo;No, we cannot publish it; you are a citizen of the Free State.&rdquo; Someone in Ireland would pirate the story and then the right Senator Dowdall proposes to confer upon that person could exclude the &ldquo;Windsor Magazine&rdquo; from Ireland.  Not only are you giving the Irish publisher the right to pirate sections from the magazines, newspapers, the great universal histories, the &ldquo;Dictionary of National Biography,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Encyclopædia Britannica,&rdquo; but you are going to give him the right to exclude from Ireland these publications.  The thing is laughable. A sane man should not give two minutes' thought to the amendment. What are you going to gain in the end?  If you have all the Irish writers that exist printing here in Dublin they are not sufficient to keep your printing presses busy for half a year.</P>

      <P>I cannot give statistics. I know pretty well who the Irish authors are whose works have some value in the market.  They are not very numerous.  If you get them all you cannot make a successful centre of printing in Ireland unless you get English publishers to print here.  At this moment one of the Irish printers is successfully printing a number of popular novels for an English publisher. What will happen when you commit the first conspicuous act of piracy? There is a body called the Publishers' Association and another the Society of Authors.  What will happen will be on a very much larger scale than what happened in the case of that pirated book in America when 150 authors protested not only to American sentiment but also made an appeal to American publishers to withdraw advertisements from a particular journal.  What will happen will be far greater because action will come through the English Publishers' Association and the Society of Authors.  Your entire <Col N="1119" /> printing will be snuffed out and you will outrage the opinion of the world as Canada has not, because you will be the first European nation to break in upon the accord of Europe on the subject of intellectual property.</P>
      <P>America is moving towards the European position.  As late as thirty years ago there was practically no copyright in America.  The works of the most eminent writers, such as Dickens and Thackeray, were pirated. It was a world scandal.  Then gradually the finer tastes of America were able to assert themselves and the Copyright Act was passed.  No educated American looks upon that as final, but that it is simply moving towards the European position.  Naturally, perhaps, Canada adopted the same law, which deals not only with Canadian but with American citizens. You will be very different.  You will not be moving from a condition of piracy, but towards it, and you will bring upon your head an amount of obloquy of which you have no idea.  I do not want to close with what the Senator calls &ldquo;negation.&rdquo;  Ireland is now, intellectually, in the position Edinburgh was at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Gradually Edinburgh became a great centre of publishing and printing. Edinburgh had great intellectual prestige.  We have given you intellectual prestige.  It will be your fault if you do not make Dublin a great centre of printing, but you will not make it a great centre of printing unless you retain the good-will of the publishers and writers of England and the British Empire.</P>

      <P>I desire to say one or two words in reply to what Senator Yeats said so vehemently and earnestly. I deny the assumption that a vote for this amendment is a vote in favour of piracy.  The mover of the amendment assumes, rightly or wrongly, that if this amendment were accepted we would still be within the Berne Convention. That is his argument.  It was my argument also when I protested on the last occasion.  Senator Yeats seems to forget that some piracy is done in other countries.  Some of us have been <Col N="1120" /> in other countries and we have brought back, in our pockets, little editions of paper-covered works that are really pirated goods.  Senator Yeats himself may have transgressed, notwithstanding all his power of protest.  As I intend to vote for the amendment, I rose mainly to say that my last desire would be to be a pirate, and while I realise doubt remains that we may still be within the Berne Convention if we accept this amendment, still I shall vote for the amendment.</P>

      <P>I just want to say a word or two in answer to the last speaker.  I do not intend to destroy the effect of Senator Yeats's argument by going over the ground that he has covered.  I want simply to refer to the doubt which Senator Bennett says exists as to whether we can accept this amendment and still remain within the Berne Convention.  We have been given the opinion of lawyers in regard to this matter.  I have given the considered opinion of the Government's chief legal adviser.  Against that we have Senator Dowdall giving an opinion from two people which is not denied.  He quoted one phrase that Canada adheres to the Berne Convention. That is so.  And secondly, that Canada's adherence to the Berne Convention became effective.  That is so. The argument that must be insisted on is this: that if anyone raises the question whether Canada can do this, and retain her place, Canada would have to make up her mind as between two things which are incompatible.  We should also have to make up our minds similarly.  The point is raised: why has Canada not been put to her election in this matter?  That point has been explained by Senator Brown and Senator Yeats.  Canada passed her legislation in opposition to the United States of America, which is not inside the Berne Convention, and there is no immediate reason why anybody should object to that, Canada being placed, as she is, next to a non-Berne Convention country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But here the situation is different. It does not depend upon what Senator Cummins seems to imagine it does, namely, the relative importance or size of the population of the two countries. <Col N="1121" /> Senator Cummins said something is good enough for Canada, and surely it ought to be good enough for an insignificant country such as we belong to.  But this is not a question of insignificance, it is rather, as Senator Yeats pointed out, that this country is great in letters, and the more important fact, apart from whether she is great or small in the matter of literature she is in the closest proximity to Berne Convention countries.  Every country round about us is inside the Berne Convention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Canada is inside the Berne Convention, at this moment, and the argument is that if the point were raised Canada would have to make its choice between remaining in and dropping the printing conditions.  We would be put to the same choice, but our choice would be brought about quicker than that of Canada, because there are more cases in which our printing conditions would be found to be a material factor, and there are very few in which it matters in Canada.  Another point raised by Senator Cummins was this.  He spoke of something being good enough for loyal Canada, and if so, he asked why should it not be good enough for a country like ours.  There is no question of loyalty to anything except loyalty to the Berne Convention.  We are now definitely outside the Commonwealth Union in this matter.  We have nothing to do with the Union heretofore formed of the countries of the British Empire.  The only loyalty that is to be observed here is loyalty to the Berne Convention; other matters are completely out of place in this matter.</P>
