      <P>The Minister for Lands and Agriculture is unfortunately laid up with a heavy cold, and he asked me to appear for him in the Seanad to-day in connection with this Bill.  I need hardly say that I am not particularly familiar with the provisions of the Bill and that I would not be in a position to stand heavy fire upon it.  It seems to me that the points that will fall for special comment and criticism will be for the most part Committee Stage points.  It would be difficult, analysing the Bill, to state just what general principles underlie it.  It is, in fact, simply a series of specific amendments to the basic Land Act of 1923.  Possibly Senators may see fit to pass the Second Reading of the Bill to-day, and reserve for Committee Stage such comment and criticism as they may wish to make.  I think the Minister's illness is not very serious and that he will be available for the Committee Stage next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the Second Reading of the Bill.  I greatly regret, as I am sure the House does, the cause of the Minister's absence.  This Bill contains several <Col N="852" /> very useful provisions amending the Act of 1923 where it was found defective. There are two sections in the Bill which would require explanation at some future stage.  These are the financial clauses, and also those relating to losses on resale, where the price originally paid for land cannot now be realised.  It would be very well to have figures or an estimate of what the total loss on these sales would be.  I understand that in Section 26 it is proposed that the taxpayers should be called upon to bear the losses incurred in the congested districts where the price of land purchased there cannot now be realised, or where the tenants cannot be got to sign agreements for the full amount, on the ground, possibly that they would not be able to meet the annuities in future.  Possibly the price of land in the congested districts was fixed by the old Congested Districts Board.  I cannot imagine any other reason why the price paid the owner should not now be realised, unless it was caused by the effect of war conditions, and that a greater price was paid for the land than it is now value for. We have also cases known as the Land Bank cases.  These we are committed to, as under the 1923 Act we agreed to take them over.  After inspection and revaluation of the land in these cases it has been found that they cannot be resold without losses being incurred.  We have already bound ourselves to take over these cases, and I cannot see that we can get out of the responsibility in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another clause deals with cases where committees or trustees in different districts, on their own account, or on behalf of uneconomic holders and landless men, went security for the purpose of raising loans to purchase lands.  These lands have been revalued and, in most cases, it was found they were bought at excessive prices, and that resale cannot be proceeded with unless someone bears the loss between the price the land is worth and the price that was originally paid for it. It would be desirable if we had an estimate of what the total loss will be in each of these three instances.  Possibly that estimate can be given at some future stage of the Bill.  This Bill <Col N="853" /> contains nearly all the provisions of a Bill that was introduced into this House by Senator Butler, and which got a Second Reading.  Three-fourths of that Bill is embodied in the present Land Bill, the only omission being holdings known as &ldquo;residential holdings.&rdquo; When we come to the Committee Stage we can discuss whether it would be desirable to have this class of holding included in the Bill or not. As I said, this Bill contains very valuable provisions, is well thought out, and I have great pleasure in supporting the motion for the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. COUNIHAN Mr. COUNIHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COUNIHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the Second Reading of the Bill.  I am sorry to hear that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture is ill, and I hope that he will be restored to health in a short time.  There is necessity for this amending Bill, as it contains very many essential provisions.  There are too many Land Acts.  Practically every year we have had a Land Bill introduced into the Oireachtas, and, as a result, landholders are in a state of anxiety.  They are always looking forward to see what the next Bill will bring forth and if it will affect their property or security.  I think it is time the Government called a halt to land legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only omission, I think, in this Bill is, that it does not propose to repeal objectionable clauses that were in the 1923 Act.  I refer to the clauses which give the Land Commission power to obtain land anywhere or any place at a price fair to the Land Commission. It is rather hard lines that people should be sent out of their homes in order to make room for others, even though the others are congests or landless men.  Another clause gives the Land Commission power to obtain the lands at a price that is fair to the Land Commission.  If the question is asked, what is the meaning of a price fair to the Land Commission, the answer is, a price at which the Land Commission can let the land to landless men or congests at reasonable annuities.  That price does not take into consideration the market value of the land.  I say it is a disgrace to allow that provision to remain on the Statute Book.  It should be repealed, <Col N="854" /> and I hope the Minister for Lands and Agriculture on the Committee Stage will consider an amendment to rectify such a state of affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the Land Bills that I feel no Government need apologise for introducing.  Every Land Bill is rendered necessary by experience.  After all, the land question is a burning question.  I think most of the Land Acts have tended to ameliorate conditions on the land.  I regret the Minister for Lands and Agriculture is not here, and I particularly regret the reason of his absence.  I am glad to hear that his illness is not a serious one.  I would like to support what Senator Linehan said, whereby losses on sales may be charged to the general taxpayer.  Before the Committee Stage I would like that we should have an opportunity of framing amendments, if they are desirable, and that some time should be given members of the Seanad to absorb any explanation the Minister may be able to give on this question so that we may reconcile our minds to the fact that the new section provides for the compulsory investment of land in tenant purchasers in congested districts willy-nilly.  They are to be compelled to take holdings, but is there any chance that any losses that may be incurred with regard to the price may by any side-wind fall on the taxpayer?  I am referring to Section 51.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also refer to Section 9, which deals with stud farms.  Will that section apply to farms breeding thoroughbred cattle as well as to farms breeding thoroughbred horses?  The Minister has assured me that it will.  Purchased holdings which were hitherto excluded from the operations of the 1923 Act are brought in under this Bill for acquisition.  I would like to have some explanation why that is considered essential.  I have no doubt the Minister could satisfy me, but I would like to be satisfied.  The Bill is very comprehensive and it is extremely difficult for the layman to follow.  For example, if there was legislation by reference this Bill is a most specific example of it.  One has to wade through clause after clause and to references to specific sections in the 1923 and other Acts which one <Col N="855" /> thinks might be inserted without any great increase in the dimensions of this Bill.  However, the Bill was framed, as apparently many Land Acts were framed, in order to give opportunities for legal arguments.  Otherwise I think the Bill is an admirable one and should get a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'CONNOR Mr. O'CONNOR">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNOR</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Second Reading of the Bill more or less on the same terms as my colleague, Senator Counihan.  He referred to certain clauses, in which I also feel very strongly that a change should be made.  There is, for instance, the clause in the 1923 Act which gives power to take land anywhere.  If that provision is carried out to its logical conclusion, it will have a very injurious effect on any security that we may have.  Farmers will feel in future that if any change takes place in our Government other people can come along and say &ldquo;I require that field,&rdquo; without any regard to the use to which the field has been put in the past.  They can acquire a field up to a person's very hall door under the powers in this Act. I think it is most unreasonable that people who are the principal ratepayers and supporters of the Government should be left in that state of uncertainty.  Farms on which racehorse breeding establishments are conducted are sufficiently protected and they have a guarantee more or less that they will not be disturbed.  I would also like to see that principle applied to people who breed cattle. They are a necessary factor in promoting the betterment of the country, and I think they should get every encouragement and have every security. That is one of the provisions that should be included in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hard to expect, remembering that so many Land Acts have been passed in years gone by, that we are now dealing with the final Act.  I think myself if Lord Ashbourne's Act were followed up we would have a very different state of affairs to those which existed afterwards.  I know personally of two or three big estates which were purchased by the Government and divided amongst various people.  There is a big ranch in our district which has <Col N="856" /> come to be known as the &ldquo;Free State.&rdquo; I think it is not a complimentary reference, but the people who were put in these lands were at first bounding over one another to take over possession. They are saddled now with rents that it is impossible for them to pay and they are more or less a drag on the country and a drag on themselves. They are trying to meadow the land. They had not the money to stock the land and they carried on in a kind of makeshift manner by trying to meadow the land and setting it to their neighbours on the eleven months' system for grazing.  It became so unprofitable that they are all down and out.  They are really not able to carry on.  Personally I feel that the Government, in order to make this Act a success, should help those people for a time.  The time over which their instalments are to be paid ought to be extended by such a period as would bring the instalments down to a reasonable rate.  These people would then have some chance of prospering and succeeding.  If that is not done I really believe that this Bill will make things worse instead of improving them, and what was considered a great El Dorado by a great many people will become a great failure.  I regret very much that the Minister is unable to be present, but I hope that such steps as are necessary to make this and other Land Acts a success, will be carried through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I will have to offer some general remarks on this Bill, not so much for what it contains as for what it omits.  It is entitled &ldquo;an Act to amend the law relating to the occupation and ownership of land and for other purposes relating thereto.&rdquo;  I am to a certain extent encouraged in what I am going to say by the two speakers who preceded me, Senators Counihan and O'Connor.  If anybody knows more about agricultural conditions in the country than these two gentlemen.  I should like to know who he is.  Each of them has built up his position from small beginnings to be&mdash;it is not perhaps a flattering word&mdash;a capitalist as the result of his own energy.  These Senators see the extraordinarily damaging principle that is involved in this power of compulsory <Col N="857" /> acquisition.  It is a principle that is dangerous not so much for what is evident as for what is concealed, although it is a truism to say that it is the function of statesmen to see hidden dangers in such measures.  I know that to a certain extent what I am going to say is reviving the members of past controversies but I do so advisedly because I believe until we retrace our steps on this question of land we are never going to have land in the position in which it should be, fertilised by capital, by enterprise, and by all those qualities which alone make for wealth-production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that these compulsory acquisition clauses have played their part, quite a substantial part, in the land depression we have got to-day.  There are other causes, of course, but at the very time we wanted capital and security to take more land and to get land cheaply we are met by this obstacle. People never know if they own what they have.  They are met by the agitation of landless men and all and sundry, whom I think we all know so well.  The mere fact of raising the alarm would be quite sufficient to drive away such a timid element as capital. In the same way those who own their lands from day to day do not know their position.  I know there are certain safeguards; that no Government will be mad enough to take land from a man who is using it to make a living, but it is held entirely on sufferance and we never know that one Government may not undo next year what the present Government does to-day.  This state of uncertainty and insecurity is deterring men from developing and improving their holdings, from improving their cowsheds, erecting fences and making roadways, all of which would give employment and all of which are absolutely essential to agricultural production. I had brought to my notice many cases of people who would seriously consider returning to this country and who would purchase demesnes and residences in this country, men of means who would be very large income tax payers, were it not for this uncertainty. I am sure it would be thought very desirable that these people should return. I hold that the effect of these <Col N="858" /> acquisition clauses is a far greater deterrent than income tax rates.  Even though you may have a substantial lowering in the income tax rate tomorrow, that would not be a sufficient inducement so long as you have these acquisition clauses on the Statute Book. I also say, apart from that, that it is essentially unjust that land should be treated differently to other property and that people should not be allowed to get full value for their possessions.</P>
    <P>I would like to make some remarks on the question of administration.  Invariably when you get any service so entirely in the grip of the State, you get all kinds of official complications.  I have one case in mind of which I can privately give the Minister particulars if he has not already got them.  It shows the delay in the carrying out of the acquisition of these estates.  In March, 1925, an owner got notice from the Land Commission that one of its inspectors would visit his land.  In the following April the owner was notified that the inspector would carry out his inspection on the 7th.  Nothing happened until the next year.  In February, 1926, a copy of the provisional list of lands was published.  On the 5th April, 1926, the owner was notified that the holding of 522 statute acres was included in the list published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of retained holdings.  It was published in July, 1926.  My information is up to February last, and I understand that nothing further has been heard of this case.  I am prepared to concede that these things must be slow.  I also say that this official procedure is necessarily slow.  In a case of this kind the owner's position is precarious. It is doubtful even if he would stock his land with the uncertainty of acquisition hanging over him.  He may let it on grazing, but he will sit as tight as he can.  His methods would be for the greatest safety&mdash;that is, getting the least return out of his land.  We are tampering in this matter with our fundamental wealth.  In the meantime interest is pilling up, creditors are getting impatient and the whole of the financial stability of the country is being affected.  There are many other cases of a similar character.</P>
    <P>The claim is put up that there is <Col N="859" /> great virtue in the intensification of holdings.  With due regard to security, and even to security for the capitalist, the congestion problem has to be dealt with.  I do not think it can be dealt with by the re-division of holdings. There must be something more practical than that.  I went to the trouble to go down and see the conditions in one of those divided holdings on the Border.  I examined in detail five holdings. About 40 acres were striped.  In some cases there was a temporary fencing, and wiring of the most provisional kind dividing up those holdings. There was a sort of mud road made for access.  On only one of those holdings was there stock at all.  I was informed that the stock was taken in at so much a head for grazing.  On two of those holdings hay was made; it was bad hay, which had been made with great difficulty.  The new proprietors had not the capital, and had to borrow.  On one of those plots the hay was not cut, and was lying on the land as late as October.  Is there any purpose served by that?  I fail to see it.  I was told there was £2 an acre on those holdings, and they could not last.</P>
    <P>Then, again, I hear my friend, Senator O'Connor, suggesting that we are going deeper into the mire.  I suggest that is the sort of thing you get when you put a large industry like this under the control of the State.  You put off the evil day.  Trying to be kind, you only make it harder for everyone at the end.  You strike at the source of primary wealth production, which can only be built upon by capital, encouragement, and private enterprise. Freedom to own wealth and to make profits or losses, freedom to make a fortune or lose a fortune is the method down the ages in business enterprise. I do not believe we have discovered any better method.  This method of State control has down the ages been tried and proved a failure.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Agriculture is not present, I am not going to inflict detailed points on the Minister for Justice, but ones of a general principle. The Minister for Justice is, perhaps, more capable of answering those than <Col N="860" /> the Minister for Agriculture, because he stands a little further back from the picture.  With regard to the exemption of stud farms, it does not commend itself to me.  I call it a sort of system of blackmail.  Why should men who choose to keep pedigree cattle be exempt from an unjust process?  I suggest that a man carrying out economic farming with labour-saving methods, getting the most out of his employees, with a view to making money, is just as desirable as the person who is breeding pedigree stock. Most of the people who breed pedigree stock are rich people, and lose money.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word on the present method of deducting arrears of annuities from the Grants-in-Aid. The reasons which existed before the Treaty do not exist now.  It is not fair to penalise a local authority on account of unpaid arrears which they have no means to recover.  The effect is to make the Land Commission more dilatory in the collection of arrears if they know that the land purchase fund does not suffer.  On looking through those arrears in my county I see some up to ten years' arrears.  Why has not action been taken all that time?  Surely it is up to the Land Commission to act promptly in dealing with those defaulters and not prejudice the case of other creditors.  Finally, I will refer to some extraordinary provisions as explained by the Minister for Agriculture with regard to fixing the redemption price of the fee farm grant.  As he is reported in the Dáil, he says it must be fixed entirely on some rough and ready principle.  The owner of a fee farm grant has undoubted security, but that is not to apply.  The judge has to proceed on the principle of rough justice to consider what is left over for the occupier, and if he considers enough is left over he is to take it off the interest. He has to give a reasonable proportion to the grantor.  This sort of legislation is based on the principle that you cannot do the ideal thing for every tenant, but that you can only do approximate justice in an Act of Parliament.  If you apply that principle I do not know where you will be.  What will be the effect on financial stability?  That will be gone into in Committee however <Col N="861" /> again.  I wish to reiterate the exceedingly great and fundamental danger to the State that is enshrined in the acquisition powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane has been making a case which has been made in this country a great deal longer than I can remember for the old system of land tenure which was imposed on us by a foreign power.  An effort was made to change the whole system of land tenure here, and thus to make it the same as that of a neighbouring country.  Whether that was a better system, or a bad one, it resulted in driving people from their land and forcing them up into hilly districts and congested places.  That was the real origin of the difficulties of the land question in Ireland.  If the original system had been allowed to go on things would not have been as they have been for the last sixty years or more.  That attempt was made a good many years ago and it failed.  It could not continue.  The country was in a desperate state and then a change began.  The system began to break down in England, and attempts have been made to change the system there. In England it was a system in which the landlord held the land and pushed people in.  There was a great deal of difference there, because in England the landlord made all the improvements. In Ireland he made none, so the case was worse here.  When you push one system on to another, partly succeed and it breaks down you have to resort to a lot of extraordinary methods which, theoretically, are not sound.  I do not say it is sound to take away a man's property and give it to somebody else, but the necessities of the case made it that that should be done; otherwise there would be no people left in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is very much good for Senators to be arguing for an effete system which is dead and gone and can never be revived.  Things are gone too far for that, and things will have to be altered, even in England, because there even they are trying to settle the farmers on the land, in a voluntary way, no doubt.  The old system is not found to be necessary there now any more than it is anywhere else.  It is <Col N="862" /> quite true, as some Senators pointed out, that things can be carried too far. A man may desire to retain some of his land or his demesne, and may not be allowed to do so.  I do not know how far that has gone.  Senator Counihan made a case before in the Seanad for people in the West whose land was taken from them.  It is hard to draw the line on these matters at the present moment, so I shall not go much into these theories.</P>
    <P>What is really serious to-day is the fall in prices.  Lands were bought in the past for very large sums of money &mdash;during the war they were bought at ridiculous prices by the Land Bank. I remember warning the Land Bank that prices were bound to fall, and that war prices could not possibly continue, and that they would go smash.  Something similar occurred in the old days with the Land League.  They bought up an estate in Galway at a price which they could not realise afterwards when they tried to dispose of it, with the result that it has been lying there for many years unoccupied.  People paid large sums of money for land which can never be realised again, with the result that this money, which has been advanced by the Land Bank, would have caused the bank to fail, only that the Government came to their help. They took over the responsibility.  I think it is doubtful whether they ought to have done so.  I do not know if there was any alternative in the matter. But not only did prices fall to what they were bound to fall to, but they have fallen to a much greater extent, so much so that land purchased quite recently is not paying anything to-day. No farmer, whether as owner or tenant is able to make his land pay to-day.  As a farmer said to me the other day, &ldquo;Farmers are now losing money in proportion to the amount of lands they hold.  The more they hold the more they are losing.&rdquo;  That has come under my observation in several cases.  It is quite clear it is impossible for the Land Commission to divide land at the prices that have been paid for it in the recent past, and expect people to be able to pay back in proportion, because, not only have they to pay annuities, but they have also to pay high rates.  Everybody <Col N="863" /> who knows anything about the West of Ireland knows that the annuitants are not capable of paying their instalments, and that bankruptcies are taking place, and many of them are giving up the land.  I see it stated in the papers to-day that numbers of Irish people have sold their land and have gone over to Liverpool to look for work, and are now starving in Liverpool. They do not know now which is the worst, Liverpool or the Free State.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to explain the following paragraph in Section 26: &ldquo;Where the price fixed for untenanted land situated in a congested districts county is such that the re-sale thereof cannot be effected without loss ... and can only be re-sold at a loss, then the interest at the rate of 4½ per cent. per annum and sinking fund at a rate of one-quarter of one per cent. per annum upon so much of the purchase money as the Land Commission shall certify each half-year represents the difference between the total amount of the advances made for the purchase of the land and the total price paid by purchasers of the land from the Land Commission shall subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance, be paid to the Land Commission out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo; Supposing it is found that a man cannot pay the annuities put upon the land and that it will partly fall upon the State, is the Minister for Finance every half-year, for an indefinite number of years, to pay to the Land Commission this difference?  How does he pay it, and does he get the money out of the Oireachtas to do so?  One would suppose that the proper way would be for the Oireachtas to pay a lump sum down to make it up.  The Land Commission coming every half-year and supplying the Minister for Finance with a statement that so many annuitants are not able to pay so much of their annuities and that he, therefore, has to get the money for that purpose from the Oireachtas seems to me to be a thing that will go on for ever.  Perhaps the Minister would explain that matter when he comes to reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of <Col N="864" /> this Land Bill, or indeed any other Land Bill, is to establish security as far as it can be established and to give fixity of tenure to the landholder. That, of course, is fundamental to promoting a disposition on the part of the landholder to make the best use he possibly can of his land.  That is to say, he can lay himself out as a farmer.  In doing so it is no light consideration when he is considering questions in the matter of this industry to lay himself out in a certain method and way of utilising his lands, whether it be for grazing or tillage or mixed purpose of grazing and tillage.  He has to make his plans for years ahead so that anything that tends to instability or insecurity in the tenure of land would naturally militate against these considerations when he sits down to consider his position and to mark out his programme for a number of years ahead.</P>
      <P>Now it is absolutely essential that security shall be given as far as legislation can give it, and particularly in the present depressed state of land in this country.  I do not share the views expressed by some Senators here as to the arbitrary action on the part of the Government with regard to the acquisition of farms and residential holdings. At least, so far as our experience of the past has gone, where land has been utilised fairly and conducted for farming, I do not think that Senators can give instances where compulsory acquisition has been exercised in regard to any such holdings except the surrounding conditions were such as to leave the Government no other course to remedy extraordinary congestion or something of that kind.  But while I would say that the Government are quite right in reserving to themselves that power to combat exceptional conditions of congestion or otherwise, I would also think that a clause might be, very usefully, introduced whereby the Government would be empowered to acquire portion of a holding rather than the whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we consider our position to-day, the adverse balance of last year, amounting to seventeen or eighteen millions, which was paid for by a corresponding decrease in bank deposits, we realise that this drift cannot be <Col N="865" /> allowed to go on, and we must look only to the land as the main source for limiting that condition of things.  We must simply produce more.  We have the anomalous position in this country, at the moment, that with land admitted to be the most fertile in the world we have men, potential sources of wealth, walking about and migrating round this country with their hands in their pockets.  If they only put a spade in their hands or took a plough they could obtain wealth from the ground, yet they are idly walking about from day to day.  We have a drift of 30,000 of the best bone and sinew, the wealth producers, leaving the country year after year from the western districts.  These men are the flower of our population who, according to one of the managers of the Shannon scheme, were the best workers that they&mdash;the Germans&mdash;ever had anything to do with.  And the anomalous position is that the land is idle and stagnant, with great sources of wealth inherent in the soil.  The men are there starving for the land and only eager to be allowed to go and produce and acquire the wealth which is in the soil.  It is the only industry they know anything about.  These people have been reared up to make a living out of patches of soil among the bare rocks. What would they do if they had fairly decent land when they were able to wring out an existence even on a low standard under such conditions?</P>
    <P>I submitted, in another place, last week, for the consideration of a Minister who was present, an experience I had myself where I let three acres of land in the scarcity times to some of the workers in the city of Waterford, giving one-sixteenth of an acre to each. From my experience of the amount of produce taken from these three acres I estimated that each man not only supplied potatoes, cabbages, turnips and other vegetables for his own family but also for ten other families. From the vegetable point of view they produced ten or twelve times more than supported their own families.  I suggested that in certain districts and in the whole of the congested districts the Government might take powers in a Bill like this to say to a large landholder a man with two or three hundred <Col N="866" /> acres, &ldquo;Are you prepared to till a certain portion of your land?&rdquo; and if he said &ldquo; No, I am not, considering the present depressed state of agriculture I would be at a loss, having regard to the cost of labour and material and so on.&rdquo;  They should say, &ldquo;Very well. If you cannot do that the people have some sort of natural right to derive some revenue from the soil; the land is there, the people are there, and both are there by the will of the Creator and the people are entitled so far as their needs as citizens go, to help.  Are you prepared to hand over ten or five per cent. of your land for their use for a period of, say, five years?&rdquo; The Government then by arrangement with the owner, would take over that portion of the land and sub-divide it by way of conacre, allowing the people to rent it for produce. There would be no vested interest as in the French system of conacre.  It would be simply taken for five years and at the end of that time would be handed back to be used for grazing or some such purpose as the owner wished after it had been tilled in the interval.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any farmer would have a grievance against such a proposal as that.  What would be the effect of that?  It would be that around the villages, towns and cities, and in the congested areas, particularly in the west, you would, while these measures of land legislation and other schemes of legislation beneficial to agriculture would be maturing, have sufficient attraction to hold back the people from emigrating. You would stop emigration, because if the people are put in the way of getting land and eking out an existence on it, with the eventual hope of becoming tenants or occupiers of an economic holding, they would stay on in this country.  The disposition of the people is to remain at home if they possibly can make a living at home.  In that way you hold your population. We have all heard the old lines&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A bold peasantry its country's pride,</P>
    <P>When once destroyed can never be supplied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In this connection it does not matter whether the peasantry is destroyed by <Col N="867" /> famine or destroyed by emigration.  In either case, the peasantry is destroyed as far as this country is concerned. Now, while the bread and butter legislation that the Oireachtas has been passing is bringing us to the time when these things will fructify, something needs to be done to keep the people here.  An emigration figure of 30,000 a year represents a population equal to the whole city of Waterford.  If that number emigrates every year you know the inevitable result.  The time will come when the population will not be there.  I throw out the suggestion, and it has universal application throughout the entire area of the Saorstát.  If necessary, take these lands compulsorily, if you wish, temporarily.  Give these lands to the people to plant crops in.  A measure such as that would in a very short time, redress your trade balance because you would have a large number of potential units whose labours would be applied to the land and their energies devoted to producing wealth from the soil.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane indulged in a dissertation on the general principle of land purchase.  His remarks were not directed, very specifically at any rate, to this Bill.  But he fought old battles over again, and he seemed to me to challenge the whole principle underlying the succession of Acts that have been passed dealing with land purchase and the distribution of lands.  One would have thought that this was the first Land Act, or at any rate that land purchase was some new revolutionary principle discovered since the establishment of the Saorstát.  I do not know what Senator Sir John Keane's solution for the congested districts problem is.  Possibly, sterilisation or the lethal chamber, but in the absence of some very modern solution of that kind there seems no other hope but the road of compulsory purchase and the distribution of estates.  The principle of compulsory acquisition is not new. It figures in the Evicted Tenants Act of, I think, 1907, or 1908; to a considerable extent in the Land Purchase Act of 1909; and in the Soldiers and Sailors Act of 1919.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that Senator Keane's remarks <Col N="868" /> were based very largely on the fallacy of treating land as if it were like any other property, like chattel property.  Senator Colonel Moore said he was struggling for the old principle. In fact, he was not.  In this matter Senator Sir John Keane is a revolutionary.  He is struggling to assert a new principle that there is absolute property in land.  My readings in law were not perhaps, very sustained or deep, but I did read the first page of Williams on Real Property.  If Senator Sir John Keane refers to that he will find a very direct negative to his underlying thesis that there is absolute property in land.  There is not and never has been.  Governments have at all times, and from time to time, acted on the principle that land is held from the State, and that in circumstances which to them seem good and sufficient, the land may be acquired.  People were dispossessed of land during the Great War, thrown out of it, and others put in, on the ground that they were not using it sufficiently intensively in the general interests of the community. It is not just a question as if it were property like a man's watch that he could wind or leave unwound as he thought fit, or a man's hat, that he could wear at whatever angle that seemed best to him. The principle has underlain legislation for many a long year that land is held from the State to be used in the interests of the community.  Senator Sir John Keane motored down the country and saw three or four allotments held by tenants who went in under the Act of 1923.  He saw these allotments were fenced and had larch poles; he saw hay that had not been well saved, and he comes back to the Seanad and he says: &ldquo;There is land purchase for you.&rdquo;  I wonder how many large estates there are in the country that he has examined with so critical an eye as that.</P>
    <P>If there is ground for criticism I should say that it lies in this direction &mdash;that the Agricultural Credits Act might have followed more closely on the Land Act of 1923.  There, again, we had to await the result of a Commission, and the Bill that is before the Dáil, and that will shortly be before <Col N="869" /> the Seanad, is based on an important part of the report of the Banking Commission. But to suggest that, because in a particular case in North Dublin or Kildare, Senator Sir John Keane took the trouble of inspecting, there was apparent a lack of that intensive cultivation which could only come with the backing of a little capital with there you had in miniature the failure of land purchase, is simply suggesting the thing that is not.  One could grant all the defects that Senator Sir John Keane mentioned, the green larch poles, the barbed wire, the muddy road, and the hay not well saved, and still deny his thesis that land purchase is a failure, is uneconomic and is something contrary to the best interest of the State and its people.  Senator Bennett, I think, it was who asked would the estimate of the losses on re-sale be furnished.  Taking the Land Bank cases, the Committee cases, and other bank cases, the estimate is about £250,000.</P>
    <P>The Senator raised another point as to the admission of sub-tenants to purchase.  Sub-tenants are genuine tenants, often judicial tenants, and they have not, up to the present, been able to purchase merely for the technical reason that the landlord himself had already purchased, and it was considered proper when introducing this Bill to deal with that matter.  Now, as I warned the Senators at the commencement, I am not in a position to deal in detail with the technical points raised on the Bill.  I do think that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture will be able to deal much more fully and adequately with these points when they are raised on the Committee Stage either by way of amendment, or if the Senator does not wish to put down an amendment, by way of question on the Section when it is before the Seanad.</P>

      <P>This is only a very minor Bill, <Col N="870" /> and the object of it is to obviate a difficulty that has arisen out of what I might describe as a conflict of law or laws.  We passed an Electoral Act in 1925, and the result of that Act is that we have to have an election for local authorities in 1928.  We are to have the election for municipal authorities in January and for the rural authorities in June.  When the Local Government Act was going through, an amendment was inserted which made it obligatory on me to have an election for dissolved local authorities three years after the appointment of Commissioners.  The result is that in some cases we would be placed in the position of having a duplication of elections.  We should have, in the case of Offaly, an election in September of this year and another election in June, 1928.  The cost of that election would be about £600.  That would mean an additional cost, another £600, for an unnecessary election.  We have the same position in the case of the two dissolved local authorities of Tipperary and Cobh.  You will have to have an election in September if this Act is not passed, and as well as that, under the Local Elections Act you will have to have another in January.  The only effect of this Bill is to get away from that necessity, and the Bill provides that in such cases, in cases where under the Local Elections Act you will have to have an election within a year after the election which is necessitated under the Act of 1925, that the second election will not be required.  That is purely a technical matter.  There is no point of principle involved in this Bill which passed through the Dáil without any division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. EAMON J. DUGGAN, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with a very important and rather historic problem, and is a very simple Bill.  It provides a scheme for the drainage of the Barrow, at a maximum cost of £425,000.  One half of that amount will be provided by the Government as a free grant.  The other half will be given on loan by the Government, repayable over a period of thirty-five years by the localities concerned. Now, of the half that is repayable by the localities, portion will be borne by the owners of the land which will be benefited as a result of the drainage.  That is to say, a rate will be levied on the improved lands in the same way as under the Arterial Drainage Act.  The difference between the amounts produced by the Drainage Act and the half will be provided by the counties in which the benefited lands are situated in proportion to the amount of benefited land in each of these counties.  With regard to the figures of repayment of the £212,500, that means an annual charge of on or about £14,000 for thirty-five years.  In addition the localities will pay £2,000 per annum for maintenance.  That mounts to £16,000.  That will be the maximum charge in the counties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the period of repayment expires the localities will have to bear the whole cost of the maintenance.  During the period of 35 years the Government propose to bear half the cost, and the localities the other half, and at the end of that period the localities will have to pay the cost of maintenance, which is estimated at £4,000 a year.  That, I think, explains the finances of the Bill. As I have said, it is a very simple measure, and it has been specifically drawn up in such a way that there will not be a contest between the counties concerned, because the Government felt that if we had to wait until these counties were to agree to the amount they are to bear the Barrow would remain undrained for many a long day. I think Senators are rather familiar with the history of this problem.  It has been the subject of agitation for a couple of hundred years.  Several Royal Commissions sat on it, reports were <Col N="872" /> drawn up and schemes prepared, but none of them was ever carried out. Shortly after the Government came into being a very influential deputation, including the late Senator McEvoy, approached the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and asked the government to undertake the drainage of the Barrow on the basis of a scheme prepared by an engineer named Gamble in the year 1899.  The estimated cost of that scheme was £800,000, and the deputation proposed that the Government should proceed on the basis of that scheme, the Government to put up half the money.  That would be £400,000, nearly double the amount they will have to put up under our scheme. In Meyer-Peter's report, published in 1895, the estimated cost of the scheme was £1,130,000.  His estimate of the cost was based on the estimates of flooding.  There were no actual measurements, but in his report he suggested that these should be taken. These measurements were made by the Board of Works engineers, and as a result we found that in the highest recorded flood, in February, 1926, the flow at the tide was 268,000 cubic feet per minute as compared with Meyer Peter's estimate of 486,000 feet per minute.  That explains the reduced figure at which the Government is satisfied it can satisfactorily carry out the drainage of the Barrow.</P>

      <P>As one who has been very largely engaged in connection with arterial drainage, I should like to congratulate the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary on having at last made some attempt to solve the Barrow drainage problem. Whether Meyer-Peter's, or Gamble's, or the other authorities before them, <Col N="873" /> or the Government's present estimate, is the more correct I am not in a position to say, and time alone will tell us that.  We all hope the Government's proposal will be carried out, but that remains on the knees of the gods.  In connection with the execution of this scheme, the Government have departed from the well-established practice hitherto in force as regards schemes of this kind, and that is in respect to the lodging of schedules showing the lands which are to be benefited, the amount of the benefit to be derived, and the proportion they are to bear to the total expenditure.  The Government's proposal is a departure from the well-established practice in this respect in that no idea is given to people as to what they will have to pay until the whole work is completed, and the final award is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my experience in these matters I know you cannot go into any district and propose to carry out drainage work that you will not be inundated by requests from people all about to include their lands in the scheme.  In a case of this sort they will certainly be more open to that than in the case in which they know in advance what they have to do.  It is only a matter of drafting, but I think it would be a great safeguard both to the State and to the Government, and to the efficiency of the scheme, if these improvement schedules, as they are generally known, were prepared and lodged at the same time as the schedules of the other works are proposed.  It is only human nature that people want everything done for them until they come to pay for it, and when that time arrives the Government need not run away with the notion that they are going to get thanked.  There will be abuse of all sorts.  People will say &ldquo;You forced these works on us, and you never consulted us, and never told us what we were to pay.  If we knew what we had to pay at the start we would not have sanctioned the inception of these works.&rdquo;  It is hard lines to make ratepayers responsible for the carrying out of works of which other people will get the benefit.  If a man's farm is more than doubled in value, as I know in many cases farms will, by the execution of these works, there is no reason <Col N="874" /> why he should not have to pay for it. The ratepayers at large, I do not think, ought to be asked to do so.  In my opinion it would be desirable and helpful if the improvement schedules were lodged at the same time as the scheme, so that the people whose lands are likely to be benefited would get the opportunity of saying whether they wished the work carried out or not.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Government on the energy and determination they have shown in attempting to make the Barrow drainage scheme a success.  I have been living in Kildare for 45 years, and I represented the Board of Agriculture in the county.  I am aware of all these Commissions and reports regarding the drainage of the Barrow, and of the engineering expenses in connection with the preparation of the schemes. Some of them, three or four at least, cost up to £10,000, and yet not a sod was turned so far as carrying out any of the schemes was concerned.  The question of the drainage of the Barrow was a matter of agitation long before the idea of a beet factory being established was heard of.  The late Lord Frederick Fitzgerald mentioned that if the drainage of the Barrow were made a success there would be made available around Carlow and Athy over 4,000 acres of land which are now unproductive. In connection with the drainage of the Barrow the removal of weirs and mills, it was suggested, would be necessary, but compensation should be awarded.  Senator Bennett remarked that the people of the South who had occasion to travel to Dublin at a certain period could see for themselves the seriousness of the Barrow flooding.  It was stated, by way of a joke, that on one occasion people got out of the train at Monasterevan thinking they were at a seaside place, as there was nothing but water for miles around.  I hope the Government will not rest satisfied until they have made a complete success of this scheme, and I hope to live to see this success.</P>

The inquiry will be held, and all parties affected by the proposed project can go before it and state their views for or against.  The landowners will be the principal people affected.  The provision made for repayment to the Board of Works over a series of years will be apportioned on the owners of the land affected.  The amount will be apportioned on the improved productive power of the land.  If the cost is more than that the scheme cannot go through.  There is provision made that under certain circumstances on the recommendation of the Board of Works the Government may bear up to 25 per cent. of the dead weight of the cost. The county councils can come in also, as they would be concerned in the increased assessment of the land and can make a contribution towards the scheme.  In that way they enable the Commissioners to put only such an impost on the area benefited as that area can pay.  There is no commitment to the scheme now.</P>

Looking at the text of the Bill, it seems to me that the scheme of the Bill is this: the Commissioners are to prepare a draft scheme, then an inquiry is to be held, and persons interested will be allowed to attend and make objection, as a result of which the scheme may be altered.  I find no provision which enables the scheme to be rejected.  The scheme will be altered according as the inquiry gives effect to the objections made.  The intention of the Bill is that a scheme is to go on.  I think that is clear.

      <P>Is the House not discussing the Second Reading of the Bill? From remarks that have been made by Senators, it looks as if we would want to read the Bill carefully in order to see what is in it before the Committee Stage.  I have no doubt that if we get an opportunity of doing that, any questions that will arise will be answered. If not, Senators can then try to alter the Bill.  I do not see any benefit in <Col N="879" /> going into the details of the scheme now.  Undoubtedly the Seanad is in favour of a Bill for the drainage of the Barrow.  I do not think that there will be any objection to that proposal here. The wisest thing would be to pass the Second Reading and reserve any remarks for the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Senator, in moving the amendment, does so because he believes that the system that has grown up known as the Extern Minister system, ought not to be given up, and that he really believes it would be much better to continue as at present with a certain number of Ministers who are not members of the Executive council, probably with a desire that vocational councils might afterwards be appointed in connection with these Ministries.  As it stands, the Bill leaves that optional.  It provides that the Constitution as it exists at present can be carried out if a President chosen by the Dáil, with a majority to support him, desires to carry it out.  It further provides for what we might, for brevity, call the British system, or the system which is used in most countries, by which all Ministers are members of the Executive Council, if they desire. What the Senator proposes is a sort of half way between, leaving three Ministers outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to the Senator&mdash;and I think he knows that I have a great deal of sympathy with him because I am not completely convinced that the provisions in the present Constitution <Col N="880" /> if carried out would not have been satisfactory&mdash;that there is no particular gain in making the Executive consist of nine.  It is far better to leave it optional, to leave it to the President to carry out one or the other.  I think that the amendment would not be a gain from any point of view.</P>

      <P>I would like to give the reasons I feel that I am unable to support this Bill.  I hope in giving these reasons I may be able to convince some other Senators to agree with me. We are all aware that when the Constitution, to which we all gave assent, was prepared, a provision was introduced into it to enable a certain number of Ministers to form what is generally known as a Cabinet, and I believe the idea of the extern Ministers was introduced with a view to economy.  At all events it gave an opportunity for economy to be exercised.  These Ministers might be people who had special capacity or special knowledge of doing certain work.  They should not necessarily be members of either House of the Oireachtas and they could be employed in a temporary manner.  It seems to me that to take power now, after this Constitution has only been in force for a few years, to wipe out this provision altogether is quite unnecessary and most undesirable.  I have not heard any valid reason given for the change&mdash;nothing to convince anybody that there is any necessity for it.  It has not been long enough in operation for a proper test to be made, but we may be quite sure of one thing and that is, that if this Bill is passed in its present form full advantage will be taken of it and that in this poor, miserable little country which is not Ireland but only twenty-six counties of Ireland, we will be saddled in future with twelve Ministers and twelve Ministries.  That works out on an average at a Cabinet Minister for nearly every two counties. I would like to know if there is another country in the world which is provided with such an excessive amount of Ministers for the amount of work to be done.</P>

      <P>Every articulate public body in this country has <Col N="881" /> protested against the number of Ministers we already have, and everybody who has a stake in the country has also protested that instead of an increase there should be a diminution in the number of Ministers.  The country is being bled white and there is not the slightest question about it, if this Bill is passed it will be bled whiter still. We have an example of that in the case of the farmers.  The farmers are having extracted from them by direct taxation far more than they are able to pay.  They are deprived of the means of stocking their farms.  If you go through the country you will see that the country is not half stocked. Ministers themselves recognised that fact when they introduced the Bill to enable farmers to borrow money to stock their farms which they should be able to stock by putting a good year against a bad, except for the fact that the money is taken from them in local taxation, which I am sorry to say Ministers have done nothing to curtail, and in public taxation.  The whole of the money is taken away for administrative purposes.  The country is calling for a reduction in the number of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said a moment ago that I did not hear a single argument adduced as to what is the necessity for this Bill, or why our Ministers are so over-worked that they cannot carry on with the existing seven Ministers&mdash;I mean Cabinet Ministers&mdash;and want to increase the number to twelve.  If we look at some other countries and compare what Ministers have to do, and the responsibilities they have to bear, we will see how absurdly under-worked Ministers are here.  There is no question the country as a whole is largely of opinion that it would be a great deal better off with half the legislation that is passed.  I do not know whether Ministers are as much in touch with casual people as some of us Senators are who have to go down the country, but I was greatly struck by what an old fellow said to me recently.  He put it in a very ungrammatical way, but probably in a very epigrammatic way. He asked, &ldquo;What on earth are you all doing up in Dublin?  You are doing nothing but passing Acts of Parliament.  What this country is <Col N="882" /> suffering from is want of neglect.&rdquo; If we had fewer Ministers to devise Acts of Parliament, and if they could devote their attention to cutting down expenses it would be infinitely better than increasing their number and then inflicting upon the country a great many more Acts of Parliament.</P>
    <P>To compare the number of Ministers here with that in other countries, let me give you a few figures.  In Great Britain they have a population of 3½ millions per Cabinet Minister, and each Cabinet Minister has to deal with a revenue of something like 66 millions. In the United States I may say all the Cabinet Ministers are Extern Ministers. None of them has a seat in either House.  Each Minister has to deal with a population of 9.2 millions and a revenue of 20.7 millions.  In France each Minister has to deal with a population of 3 millions&mdash;that is nearly the total population of the Free State&mdash;and with a revenue of 15 millions.  The Minister is looking at me as if to ask: &ldquo;Why are you taking all the big countries?&rdquo; We will come to the small ones.  In Belgium, which is smaller than Ireland, each Minister has to deal with a population of 630,000 people and a revenue of 2.75 millions.  In Holland each Minister has to deal with a population of 600,000 and a revenue of 2¼ millions. In Italy he has to deal with a population of 2.3 millions and a revenue of about 10 millions.  In the Free State, if this Bill passes, each Minister will have only to deal with a population of 290,000 and a revenue of 2.2 million pounds.  After to-day's Budget it will probably be reduced to two million pounds.  With these facts before us I do not see what possible argument there can be for increasing the number of Cabinet Ministers.  It undoubtedly must lead to expense.  For that reason I cannot vote for the Bill, and I hope other Senators will feel in the same position.</P>

      <P>This amendment is really a compromise.  It gives the Minister a little of what he wants, an increase from seven to nine, whereas under the Bill he could go the whole hog and have twelve.  It still leaves a margin and it preserves to Senators and to the citizens&mdash;to wit, Patrick Murphy, of Skibbereen&mdash;some margin of the privileges, nominal though they may be, accorded to them by the Constitution. I think it is a very fair compromise. It will not increase the cost of administration in any sense, as Senator Barrington seems to imply.  Whether a Minister is an extern Minister or an Executive Minister he has to be paid, I presume.  I do not know whether he gets more as an Executive Minister than as an Extern Minister. Whether you take him as a member of the Executive or otherwise, his Department will cost the State the same amount of money.  I made my protest against this Bill previously on the grounds that there was no effective liaison between this and the other House, and that our business and the legislation of the country generally was to that extent injuriously affected.  We wanted a more effective liaison as contemplated in the Constitution.  The provision made in the Constitution to effect that has broken down.  Our experience in this House has shown that to be the case.  I support this amendment to be consistent in my protest on broad lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle underlying the Bill was that it should <Col N="884" /> be open to succeeding Presidents to decide just how much of the field of administration they were prepared to take collective responsibility for, how much of the general field of administration would be thrown into the circle of collective responsibility.  It was asked that there be given to each President discretionary elasticity.  The amendment, in fact, says that there shall not, and that is described as compromise. The amendment limits the expansion of the Executive Council to two additional members, from the present seven to a proposed nine, and I think that is unreasonable.  At the moment, outside the Executive Council in this country, which is predominantly agricultural, you have the Department of Agriculture.  You have local government, a matter which touches people very closely in their everyday lives, and it perhaps comes home more pointedly to a great many people than the central Government.  It is very questionable whether Departments of that kind should be simply matters of single responsibility&mdash;the single responsibility of any Minister&mdash;and Senators know that in fact people have not adjusted their minds to acquitting the Government generally, the Executive Council, of responsibility for these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they feel that things are wrong in Local Government matters they blame the Government.  If they have criticism or comments to make with regard to agriculture, again, it is the Government.  Again I suggest, Deputies, Senators and still less the general public, have not adjusted their minds to this idea of the single responsibility of an individual Minister in respect to an important sphere of administration and personally I do not believe that they ever will.  These matters will always be regarded as of concern and responsibility for the Government generally. I have stated frankly that we do not think as much of the Extern Minister idea as some of us did in 1922, when it was embodied in the Constitution. I attempted to explain that it is a matter of theory, this matter of single responsibility, rather than of fact, for the reason that every important proposal of any of those Ministers has its <Col N="885" /> financial consequences.  It has financial reactions and the Minister for Finance is necessarily and naturally a member of the Executive Council. These matters, because of their financial reactions, become, in fact, matters of collective responsibility. Take the position of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Practically any administrative proposal of his has its financial side, must get the concurrence of the Minister for Finance and consequently becomes the collective responsibility of the Executive Council.  Take the position of the Minister for Agriculture.  His recent move in the matter of the dairy industry involved large expenditure. The Executive Council found itself compelled to sit in judgment on that necessarily because of its financial aspect.  This collective responsibility idea is fictitious theoretically and could only work in practice because there has been such a good understanding between the Extern Ministers and the Executive Council as a body.  There is very little in it, if anything.  We do not secure in fact, as we hoped we might, that mitigation of the rigidity of the party system.  You do not secure in the Dáil free non-party discussions on the proposals of these Ministers.  It would be very difficult to realise that ideal because almost all their proposals involve considerations of finance and thereby and therefore involve the Executive Council and become matters of collective responsibility. That being so, is it unreasonable to ask that each President, on his election, be free to decide whether or not he would resort to this Extern Minister idea at all; whether he would not fix the responsibility for every act of administration and make them all matters of collective responsibility?</P>
    <P>Senator Barrington did not seem to realise what was involved in the Bill He talked the facile talk of economy as if it were a question of the number of Ministers involved rather than of the nature and character of the Ministers and their responsibilities; whether we are going to perpetuate and stereotype this fiction of the single responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture for agriculture, or the Minister for Local <Col N="886" /> Government for local government, and keep those matters removed from the joint responsibility of the Executive Council as a body.  At the moment, at all events, the position is theoretically that these Ministers stand on their own legs and are singly responsible to the Dáil.  If any of them were defeated on a departmental proposal it would have no reactions on the Executive Council. If the Executive Council as a body went out, the Extern Ministers would remain. That is splendid in theory, but does it work out that way in practice? It has had a five years' trial, and we know there must be collective responsibility; for Agriculture, for the Post Office, for matters in Local Government, for any matter that involved expenditure at all, radiate immediately and necessarily into the sphere of the Executive Council, and become matters of collective responsibility.</P>
    <P>Senator Bennett's amendment seeks to say that at least three Departments must be left outside the field of collective responsibility.  Is it wise to tie the hands of a President in the matter of the extent of the general field of administration that he would make the subject of collective responsibility? I do not think it is.</P>
    <P>The question of the number of Ministers to be appointed is quite another matter.  I can assure Senator Barrington that the Extern Minister idea had no aspect whatever of economy.  It was a constitutional fact; it was an idea that you might correct the rigidity of the party system by making certain departments the subject of free non-party discussion and division in the Dáil by excluding them from the sphere of collective responsibility.</P>

      <P>Theoretically you might, no doubt, but in effect, as I pointed out, it would be very difficult to work it, otherwise than it has been worked.  For this reason, suppose the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs singly responsible to the Dáil and not identified in any way politically with the Executive Council.  He has a particular <Col N="887" /> proposal that involves a very large expenditure.  It is put up to the Minister for Finance, and after due consideration turned down by him.  He is to come to the House and rant against the Minister for Finance.  He could say, &ldquo;Believe me, Deputies, I could make this country blossom like a rose only for the tight-fisted Minister for Finance and his colleagues on the Executive Council.&rdquo;  As a matter of every-day procedure, is that an ideal? It is a kind of dog-fight between the Extern Minister and the Executive Council, the one claiming that he could do wonders only for the tight-fistedness of the other.  The Senator has shown in his remarks that he has not adjusted his mind to this Extern Minister idea. He referred to the burden of local rates, a matter which he said Ministers have not done much for.  What Ministers?</P>

      <P>Yes, there is one singly responsible to the Dáil.  The Senator showed in his remarks that he was not adverting to the fact that it was a matter of single responsibility. He threw his charge in a general way against the Executive Council.  He said Ministers had not done sufficient to relieve the burden of local rates. The question of Ministers and the number per head of the population each one has to deal with is one we cannot discuss at length, and one which we should refrain from discussing if only for the reason that it has nothing whatever to do with the Bill.  The Senator in his abstruse calculations might work out what number per head of the population he has to deal with and then we will discuss it on some other occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal underlying this Bill is simply that the President elected after the General Election will be free to take, if he so decides, envisaging his own political circumstances, into the circle of joint collective responsibility <Col N="888" /> the entire field of administration.  It does not say he shall not leave any Department outside to be dealt with as a matter of single responsibility.  It does not propose to cut out of the Constitution the Extern Minister idea entirely; but asks for a discretionary elasticity for the President in the matter of deciding how much of the field of administration shall be the subject of collective responsibility.  I think that is a perfectly reasonable proposal that should be endorsed by any Senator who has given it a few minutes reflection.</P>

      <P>Before this section is adopted I would like, in a very few words, to refer to one aspect of the matter that I do not think has been touched upon to-day.  The Bill is described as an Act to amend the Constitution by increasing the maximum number of members of the Executive Council from seven to twelve.  As I understand the Bill, and I agree with it generally, if passed, the President will have power to absorb into the Executive Council certain individuals, not necessarily the Ministries, which is a totally different thing.  Will it also confer power upon the President to put out of the Executive Council individual Ministers taken in if, in his opinion, any Minister is not required or if a particular Minister will not work with the Executive Council? If this Bill is passed the President might, after the next General Election, bring in a Minister for Agriculture to the Executive Council and he might find that the Minister did not work satisfactorily with the Executive Council and he might wish to have somebody else.  But as I take it, having once got the particular Minister in he cannot get him out.  It is important to know, therefore, is this a Bill for absorbing the Ministry into the Council or only for absorbing the individual Minister.  If it is the Minister representative of the Ministry who goes into the Council it would be naturally open to the President having the power of bringing him in that he should also have the power of putting him out.</P>

      <P>There is no advantage in a Minister being within the Executive Council.  I think the advantage is the other way.  Once a Minister becomes a member of the Executive Council thereby his Department and his administrative acts become a subject of collective responsibility. The Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible, with me, for the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  He is responsible with me for every act of mine from Monday morning until Saturday night and so is every other member of the Executive Council.</P>

If, on the other hand, he says, &ldquo;I do not propose to fill certain posts; the Dáil must fill these and the persons holding these posts will be singly responsible to the Dáil,&rdquo; that is another matter.  There is the Procedure Committee in the Dáil which will have to appoint the Minister and, therefore, the Minister so appointed is, theoretically, responsible to the Dáil.  The Minister for Agriculture was appointed in this way; the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was appointed in this way; the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Fisheries were appointed in this way.  And there is not at present in respect of these Departments <Col N="890" /> collective responsibility with that reservation I have spoken of, namely, whenever there is a proposal involving finance.  In that case the Minister for Finance has to get these proposals and to pronounce judgment upon them and the other members of the Executive Council are jointly responsible with him.</P>

      <P>I think from the observations of the Minister we may take it that if he was President he would absorb all Ministers, and would have them all members of the Executive Council.  We may assume, therefore, from the arguments of the Minister, that the purpose of this Bill is to destroy vocational councils.  He told us that the existing position was wrong, and ought to be changed.  Have we reason to think, with an experience of a short period like three and a half or four years, that we are justified in arriving at a conclusion, that, assuming a change of Government, and a new outlook, this is a power we ought to put into the hands of a President, to exclude an idea given such prominence to in the foundation of this whole Consituation? Ought we to scrap that at such an early period, and allow any future President to absorb into the Executive Council anybody he likes? For my part I do not think it is a good idea.  I think that the present position has not been sufficiently tested and tried.  I believe that in a small country like ours, if the President is enabled to have twelve members in the Executive Council, it would mean that that council would really mean a council of three or four Ministers doing the work, and that the other seven or eight would be nonentities.  My proposal was meant to correct the rigidity of the party system.  The party system apparently is very rigid; there is only one party in this country at the moment, but another party may arise, and more than one other party.  I think the provision to arrange for Extern Ministers and vocational councils, or for the absorption of persons of great capacity was a very valuable one.  I have heard no argument advanced that would satisfy me that the Constitution should be departed from by this amendment <Col N="891" /> Bill.  I think the compromise, as suggested, ought to be accepted by the Seanad.</P>

      <P>One thing that seems to be lost sight of is that the election of vocational Ministers would make it possible to avoid the choice of the people after an election in the country.  In other words, that under a so-called democratic Constitution there would be a loop-hole for sentimentalists and other people being created Extern Ministers without having faced the hustings.  That is one strong argument why the Extern Minister idea ought to be got rid of at once if we are to have constitutional representation in this country.  You might have a crank coming in or a person who by reason of some new trend in liberal thought, such as calling Jews aliens, and being made a Minister, thereby avoiding the democratic choice of the country.  For that reason I stand by the Bill, which leaves it at the discretion of those who assume responsibility, such as a President does, to seek his colleagues from among those the country has provided him with.</P>
