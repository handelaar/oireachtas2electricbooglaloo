    <Title>RAILWAYS (ROAD MOTOR SERVICES) BILL, 1927&mdash;THIRD STAGE.</Title>
    <P>The Seanad went into Committee.</P>
    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Sections 1 and 2 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>(1)  No railway company shall run a road motor service on any route which is not for the time being approved of by the Minister under this section.</P>
    <P>(2)  A railway company proposing to run a road motor service shall submit to the Minister particulars of the route on which such company proposes to run such service and particulars of the nature of the service so proposed to be run and the Minister may, if after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health he thinks proper so to do, approve of such route either with or without modification.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever a route submitted to the Minister under this section by a railway company as a route for a road motor service for the conveyance of passengers is in the opinion of the Minister substantially the same in whole or in part as the route on which a road motor service for passengers is at the time of submission run regularly by some person other than such railway company, the Minister shall not approve under this section of such first-mentioned route until he has given to such person notice of such submission and has considered such (if any) representations as may be made in regard thereto by such person.</P>
    <P>Amendment 1, by Senator Sir John Keane&mdash;&ldquo;to delete the section&rdquo;&mdash;not moved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3, sub-section (2).  After the word &ldquo;service&rdquo; in line 50, to insert the words &ldquo;either generally or temporarily for a period not exceeding twelve months.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If Section 3 is taken in connection with Section 5 of the Bill, it will be seen that if the railway company starts, or proposes to start, a route, it has to get the approval of the Minister.  Once the route has been approved it cannot be abandoned without his consent.  That, of course, is quite a proper arrangement where the route is likely to be a permanent route, and likely to be one which the railway company would be able to maintain as a permanent route. But it might be found to be very necessary to start a kind of experimental route for the purpose of trying what the traffic would be like, and to see if it would be possible to maintain a permanent route.  What my amendment proposes would make the section read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A railway company proposing to run a road motor service either generally or temporarily for a period not exceeding twelve months,&rdquo; and so on.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is to say, that no route which they propose to run for more than twelve months will come under this.  An experimental route to be tried for some period less than twelve months would come under this amendment, and would not make it necessary for the railway company to get the permission of the Minister to withdraw or discontinue such service.  I have an amendment to Section 5 which would prevent a temporary route being continued against the will of the railway company and at a loss.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment which I have heard spoken of previously, and my only difficulty about it is that, if it is passed here, it may be necessary to have some arguments with members of the Dáil about it.  It may be received wholeheartedly by the members of the Dáil. Personally, I am very much disposed <Col N="1219" /> to accept the amendment, but I do not want to hold up the Bill for this.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 3, as amended, and Section 4 put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment by Senator Sir John Keane to delete Section 4 not moved.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
      <P>(1)  A railway company which has commenced to run a road motor service under this Act shall not, so long as the running of such service either with or without modification is lawful under this Act, withdraw or discontinue such service without the permission of the Minister.</P>
      <P>(2)  A railway company which withdraws or discontinues (otherwise than for sufficient reasons beyond their control) a road motor service in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds for every day during which such contravention continues.</P>
      <P>(3)  A road motor service which is run for a particular part of every year shall not be deemed to be withdrawn or discontinued within the meaning of this section so long as it is run for the same or substantially the same part of every consecutive year.</P>
      <P>Amendment by Senator Sir John Keane to delete the section not moved.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might suggest a different wording to this amendment. The wording, as it stands, is a little clumsy.  If the amendment is accepted the section would read:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1220" />&ldquo;(1)  A railway company which has commenced to run a road motor service approved generally under the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 3 of this Act shall not,&rdquo; and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>As distinct from &ldquo;temporary.&rdquo;  It is a clumsy use of the word.  I would suggest that instead of the form in which it appears the wording of the amendment should read &ldquo;a railway company which has commenced to run a road motor service other than a road motor service approved of as temporary.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1221" /> The Seanad went out of Committee.</P>
    <P>The Bill reported.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>In asking the Seanad to meet to-day I was under the impression that we would have been able to have disposed of part of the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Bill, which we considered some days ago on Report, and I also thought we might have advanced the Land Bill another stage to-day.  I find that as a result of the substantial number of amendments inserted in the previous stage in this House, the Bills have not yet emerged from the printer with these amendments.  Accordingly, the Minister responsible for these Bills sent a request yesterday that they should not appear on the Order Paper for to-day.  That request did not reach me until the House had risen.  The reason I mention this is, that the Ministers have asked that the House meet on Tuesday for the purpose of considering them.  Personally, I am quite prepared to fall in with that, but I thought I should mention it to the Seanad, so that Senators would be prepared, if called on, to meet on Tuesday.  We could take the Committee Stage of the Electricity (Supply) Bill on Wednesday. On Tuesday there will be the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, Second Stage; the Barrow Drainage Bill, Report; the Land Bill, Report; and the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Bill, Final Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go this far, with the indulgence of the House, that we will not shut up that stage of it on Tuesday, but will keep it over until Wednesday for your amendment, disposing of the rest.  It will appear as the last item on the Order Paper for Tuesday, and I hope to be able to carry it on sufficiently for your purpose until Wednesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Eireann approves of the ratification in respect of Saorstát Eireann of the Convention concerning Workmen's Compensation for Occupational Diseases and of the acceptance of the Recommendation concerning Workmen's Compensation for Occupational Diseases adopted on the 10th June, 1925, at the Seventh Session of the International Labour Conference held in Geneva.</P>
      <P>This is merely a motion approving of the ratification of this Convention, arrived at by the International Labour Conference, under Part 13 of the Treaty of Versailles.  It provides that the dependents of employees losing their lives or suffering from disease as the result of handling lead, poisoning by mercury or anthrax infection, shall receive compensation in the same way as if they lost their lives or incurred injury through any other accident in the discharge of their duties.  I am informed that it will require no new legislation, as the laws relating to workmen's compensation already in existence are sufficient to cover the Convention, and that all that is required is merely for this House to approve of the ratification of the Convention in respect of Saorstát Eireann as one of the affiliated nations to the International Labour Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I think we are more or less bound to accept it because it has been agreed to at Geneva.  We have a representative there and we are more or less involved in the agreement reached inasmuch as there was no protest.  I think two of the diseases mentioned by the Senator are the two most incapacitating on the list and are diseases that bring the <Col N="1223" /> Workmen's Compensation Acts to a focus, so to speak.  This is merely a matter of ratifying it, and I do not think it will involve any further legislation.</P>
      <P>Motion put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I intervene for a moment in connection with a point to which I should have referred yesterday?  It was rather in the hurry of the debate that I neglected to do so.  A question was raised yesterday as to my not making a preliminary speech on the Second Reading of the Electricity (Supply) Bill.  I had intended to say that it has been my understanding of the procedure in this House that a Minister is not expected to follow the ordinary procedure of the Dáil&mdash;that is to say, to make an introductory speech on a Bill.  I was quite prepared to do that if I had been asked.  I did so on the previous Shannon Bill when I was asked to do so.  My first experience in this House was the Railways Bill, and I understood that that was the procedure.  I had thought that in view of the lengthy discussions that had taken place in the Dáil and elsewhere the provisions of this Bill would have been sufficiently understood, but I do want to explain to the House that there was no intention on my part to treat the House with what appears to have been taken, by one member of the House at least, as discourtesy or an attempt to mislead it by not explaining what I thought had already been well explained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister's explanation, and anything I have said in the matter I now <Col N="1224" /> withdraw.  I speak subject to correction, but I think it has been the general custom for Ministers to make an explanatory statement on the introduction of a Bill here.  That has lapsed to a large extent of late, I recognise, but I do not see that it ought to lapse, especially in the case of a very difficult and lengthy Bill of this sort, which requires explanation.  The Minister's explanation was discussed in other places, but the Seanad is not supposed to depend entirely on discussions in the Dáil and before outside bodies, and on what appears in the newspapers. My opinion is that it would be very much better and more convenient if any Minister, not this Minister in particular, would make a statement before hand on a Bill, and not merely speak at the end in a carping way, and criticise special statements that Senators had made.  I think that would be more convenient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will, of course, understand that this is a matter over which I have no control. It is a matter entirely for the individual Minister concerned. Speaking for myself, I think that generally it would be more desirable&mdash;and I think that the Ministers have recognised that&mdash;that Ministers should make a statement as regards any Bill at the earliest possible stage. But there is no necessity, nor is there any machinery, for moving the Second Stage of a Bill in this House.  Under our Standing Orders a Government Bill is automatically moved from the Chair. I have to do that.  In doing that I am not usurping any of the duties or privileges of the Seanad; I am only carrying out literally and faithfully the directions given to me under the Standing Orders.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 11.30 a.m. until Tuesday, 10th May, at 3 p.m.</P>
