      <P>This Bill has been certified by the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil as a Money Bill.</P>
      <P>Question proposed&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be considered on Report.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Bill I have the following proposal to make: That it be a recommendation from this House &ldquo;That the income-tax for the County Borough of Waterford for the year 1927-28 be levied on the old valuation, in accordance with the undertaking given by the Minister in his letter dated 20th October, 1924, to the ratepayers of the said County Borough.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty about this matter.  You brought this up on the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a different recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>You see the position is that the Minister is not here, and has received no notice of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendation that I proposed yesterday was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1680" />&ldquo;Section 1, sub-section (2).  Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The revaluation made in the year 1924 by the Commissioners of Valuation of the tenements and hereditaments in the County Borough of Waterford shall not become operative for income tax purposes until the expiry of the present quinquennial Valuation Roll for the said County Borough.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The quinquennial period will expire in the income tax year commencing on the 6th of April, 1928.  The present Finance Bill deals with the year from 6th April, 1927, to 6th April, 1928. The recommendation that I am now proposing is as I have read it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite realise the interest that you have taken in this matter, and how important it is for your constituents and that, therefore, you should get every latitude, but I could not accept this recommendation for this reason: So long as you are not seeking to make a recommendation amending the Finance Bill I could not accept an amendment which would affect the incidence of taxation, assuming that this Bill is passed into law. If this Bill be passed into law it definitely fixes the incidence of income tax and the liability for the coming year.  No pious expression of opinion will have any effect upon that, and unless you are seeking by your recommendation to introduce some amendment into the Finance Bill to accomplish your purpose you would not be in order.  Have I made myself clear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>You have, but I submit that Senators are entitled to make recommendations as regards the Bill before it is passed in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but they must be recommendations appropriate to the Bill.  They cannot be recommendations of an administrative character because the Minister has no power to administer anything except the law.  Once this Bill is passed he can give no alleviation such as the Senator desires unless that is provided for in the Act itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1681" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain exemptions for which provision is made in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>If you want to add to those, that is another matter, but that would require a substantive recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>If I cannot proceed by way of moving this recommendation, then the only thing open to me is to proceed by way of making a personal explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>You are quite at liberty to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>In doing that there are two points which will need to be made clear in order that the Seanad may be able to appreciate the position in Waterford.  The first point is: that there was a definite undertaking as to exemption for the quinquennial period entered into by the Minister with the citizens of Waterford.  The second point is that the people of Waterford are being penalised as a result of a departure from that undertaking which was given by the Minister.  As to the first point, I am sorry that the Minister for Finance is not here, but I will read for the Seanad the actual letter from the Minister giving this undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you have made that perfectly clear already. I am only expressing my own opinion, but it occurs to me that you made that quite clear when you spoke on this matter yesterday.  You see the difficulty about this is, that this is really a personal issue between yourself and your constituents and the Minister.  It does not affect the Bill.  If the Minister finds that he is not in a position to carry out that undertaking or any promise that he gave, that, of course, is not binding upon the Executive Council in any way.  It may be that in the result they may find themselves unable to give effect to it, so that really in the end it would only remain as a personal issue, if I may so describe it, between you and your constituents and the Minister.  The Minister and yourself both had your say on that.  I think that your position is quite plain, and I <Col N="1682" /> do not think the action you took requires any further indication on your part, which, if I may venture to say so, was, I think, quite proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister on the first occasion the matter was raised showed that it was possible to introduce a remedy into the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is quite possible, but you see he did not do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, when speaking on the matter, said &ldquo;He admitted that the change under the Finance Act, 1925, was made without any advertence to the position of Waterford... Had they remembered they might not have made the change, but it was made to apply to the whole country.&rdquo;  That shows that on the introduction of the Finance Bill of 1925 the change could have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister admitted that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>The deduction to be drawn from that statement is that it can be remedied in a similar instrument, namely, the Finance Bill of 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister refused to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Senator KENNY Senator KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Senator KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>You have ruled against me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If I ruled against you I would not have allowed you to re-move the recommendation that you moved yesterday.  All that I am saying now is that if you wish to renew the recommendation it would be very difficult for me to allow it in view of the fact that it has been debated twice already.  As I understood from you, you indicated that you proposed to speak for a different purpose now, namely, to make a personal explanation of your own position.  If you would accept a suggestion from me it is that, I think, the House fully appreciates your position and I think no explanation is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite see the Minister's point that for the year 1926-27 the income tax has been <Col N="1683" /> mostly collected under the rules and regulations of the Finance Act of 1925, and that the dislocation that would ensue from trying to readjust the position would be such that it would be almost impossible to do it because I believe that some of the money collected has already gone to the British Treasury.  My present suggestion is to let all that stand as it is and to take it that the ratepayers will be mulcted in income tax for that period at the increased valuation.  They must be satisfied with that.  It is irretrievable and cannot be remedied, but I suggest that for the current financial year, from the 6th April of this year to the 6th April of next year, they should get this concession.  Let this proposition begin to operate then. That will bring them up to the end of the quinquennial period.  The quinquennial period ends on the 6th April of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it should take the form of a recommendation that for the financial year 1927-28, they should be only liable for income tax at the old valuation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my recommendation, and I ask the Seanad to approve of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Have you put it in writing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I will take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenjaminHaughton" hpid="Mr. HAUGHTON Mr. HAUGHTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HAUGHTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator include another important city in his recommendation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have quite a mouthful to chew already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume you refer to Dublin, Senator Haughton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that it is accepted I am quite in order in proceeding with this recommendation.  As to the first point, I think it is already proved.  In fact it was admitted by the Minister himself, here in the House, that &ldquo;the change under the Finance <Col N="1684" /> Act of 1925 was made without any advertence to the position of Waterford. The city moved for a revaluation and when they found that it meant a considerable increase in the valuation of the city, they tried to stop the process.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another common factor in the case.  It is not disputed.  They had asked to have the revaluation and then they did not like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>They meant only to have a readjustment in the incidence of the tax, but when the valuation was increased by 50 per cent., of course it alarmed the whole city.  Continuing his statement the Minister said: &ldquo;It was not possible to do so and they were told that they would have a respite because the assessment would not come into force until the end of the quinquennial period.&rdquo;  I have the Minister's own words, that &ldquo;that respite was lost under the Finance Act of 1925 because the position of Waterford was not adverted to.  Had they remembered they might not have made the change, but it was made to apply to the whole country and they could not make a special exemption for Waterford.&rdquo;  That is a conclusive answer in regard to point No. 1, that an undertaking was entered into between the Minister and the citizens of Waterford&mdash;the Corporation, the Chamber of Commerce and the licensed vintners&mdash;that they were to be exempt for the quinquennial period from the operation of the increased valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to point No. 2, the Minister said that it was really a matter that only meant £1,000 to the citizens, and that that was a very small amount.  To show how irresponsible the Minister is in this matter, and how glibly he talks without any sufficient information, I wired last night to the Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Grubb, as to that matter.  He wired me back this morning, stating that the additional licence duty for last year alone amounted to £1,114 7s. 10d.  The Minister said that it was only a matter of £1,000, and afterwards he said it would only mean about £750.  If I continued drawing attention to it it would, I suppose, ultimately be <Col N="1685" /> whittled down to a shilling or half-a-crown. In one item alone, the increased licence duties, there is an increase of over £1,000.  The income tax under Schedule A for the year 1926-27 was £5,000, and at the present rate of 3s. in the pound for the current year, commencing April 6th last, it will amount to £3,750, plus the increase on the licence duty.  It represents for the suspended portion of the quinquennial period, in the aggregate, a sum of about £12,000 for the City of Waterford. That is an imposition which the city cannot afford to bear.  At the moment it is a dead city.  There are 2,000 unemployed, factories are closing, and traders along the quay front from day to day are simply trying to prevent their shutters from being put up altogether. The traders and citizens cried out when they found that the revaluation had increased their income tax by about 50 per cent.  They knew they would be unable to bear this addition to the tax.  It meant bankruptcy for some of them.  As to the second point, a certain number of the merchants of the city are determined to resist this, and to allow themselves to be brought into court.  The equities of the case are on their side, and they are quite prepared to go to court.  That will be an exposure in court&mdash;the Government charged with a deliberate breach of faith in connection with Waterford Corporation and Chamber of Commerce, because an honourable undertaking was entered into which was ruthlessly and lightly cast aside by the Minister for Finance.  I will read for you a resolution passed at a special meeting of the Directors of the Chamber of Commerce on March 18:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That in view of the imminence of the Finance Act, 1927, we, the Directors of the Waterford Chamber of Commerce, desire to draw the urgent attention of the Minister for Finance to the imposition of the new valuation to the Income Tax and Licensing Act Schedule for the current year in the Borough of Waterford, more especially in face of the definite and clear undertaking given in 1924 that this should not take effect until 1928-29, and we call on <Col N="1686" /> the Minister for Finance to redress this grievance and to fulfil the promise of the Government by inserting a retrospective enabling clause in the forthcoming Finance Act, unless this can be effected by other means.</P>
    <P>I am not asking for that now in my recommendation as I realise that it would cause a considerable amount of dislocation.  They have been mulcted to the extent of £6,000.  I say that for the present financial year, that is, from the 6th April last to the 6th April next, the concession ought to be made.  It would be a small matter to the Treasury but a big thing for Waterford. It is an honourable way out.  I think the Seanad ought to take a stand in a matter of this sort, particularly when an undertaking is given. It would have a very bad effect if the matter came to Court and if it was broadcasted that it was possible that any Minister of any Government could treat the income tax payers of an important city like Waterford in this cavalier and dishonourable way.  This is a way out for the Minister to enable him, as they say abroad, to save his face.  Promises of this sort are rigidly kept in other countries.  A Chinaman, for instance, will never sign a contract, but when its terms are explained to him he simply assents, and he is prepared to go into the Bankruptcy Court and beggar himself and his family rather than commit any breach of contract. I think that we have something to learn in the matter of commercial probity even from the heathen Chinee.  I suggest that the Minister should make every effort to retrieve the Government position in Waterford where electioneering prospects are not very rosy.  The matter with which we are now dealing will render our position there well-nigh impossible if I have to go back and say that my representations have been turned down by the Minister.  Such a result would ruin the chances of the successful return of the Cumann na nGaedheal candidates among the business community. I ask the Minister whether it is honest or politic to refuse to right this wrong, particularly when it can be so easily remedied by adopting the <Col N="1687" /> recommendation which I have proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain to Mr. Blythe that, with some misgiving, I permitted Senator Kenny this morning to move his recommendation in a somewhat altered form.  The recommendation which he now wishes the Seanad to adopt is one exempting for the present financial year the citizens of Waterford from income tax, except on the basis of the quinquennial period of taxation.  The Senator wishes to let the tax for the past years remain as it was.  The recommendation does not claim any adjustment or readjustment of the tax for these years but seeks for a redress during the current financial year, and bases that on the plea of a promise or pledge given by you that that relief would be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not desire, as one connected with the County and City of Waterford, to interfere in this matter, nor do I voice the plea or threat put forward in Senator Kenny's speech, nor do I rise to voice any grievance which the taxpayers of that city may have.  I rise to point out that the good faith of the Government is involved in this matter.  There is a clear Ministerial pledge.  The letter has been read, and one realises that these things are only binding by honour and Parliamentary practice in all reputable countries.  I make a plea to the Minister to meet the case put forward by Senator Kenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what Senator Sir John Keane has said, and in view of what was said last night, my view is that, apart altogether from the denial of the pledge by the Minister, if a pledge was made to give a preference of this kind to one city as apart from any other part of the country, it is not the sort of pledge which this House should support or endorse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to understand the altered position. I quite appreciate his difficulty in acceding to the proposal of yesterday, as it would mean, as he said, a grave dislocation and an almost impossible <Col N="1688" /> readjustment of taxation, because the income tax for the most part has been collected for the year 1926-27, and some of it has been forwarded to people in England.  I have been in communication with Waterford, and I am in a position to make this offer as a reasonable compromise.  The city paid for the year 1926-27, wrongly as they contend, the income tax on an increased assessment. They are satisfied now to suffer that wrong in view of the impossibility of re-adjustment, as outlined by the Minister, but now ask that income tax for the current financial year shall only be levied on the old valuation.  The end of the current financial year will synchronise with the termination of the quinquennial period, and, therefore, to some extent, by agreeing to that, the Minister would redeem his promise. It is a way out, and it will save a great deal of bickering in the city, and probably the Minister will not hear anything more about it.  Failing the granting of that concession, I understand that the Chamber of Commerce are determined to resist the additional payment by bringing the matter to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE: (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only to say that there was no promise in the matter.  What happened was that an explanation of the then existing position was given to the deputation.  Since then, without advertence to that explanation and discussion, the existing position was changed, but there was no such thing as a pledge given to the deputation.  I deny that any pledge was given.  I have said what happened was that the position was explained to them, and perhaps in view of that discussion, if we had adverted to it, we would not change the position, but we did change it and no wrong was done by the change.  It simply meant that the people paid their income tax on a very reasonable valuation, founded on the 1914 and not on the inflated basis.  It would be impossible to go back in the case of Waterford without going back in other cases.  As I pointed out last night, although there was not a general revaluation of Howth there was a series of revisions of property which <Col N="1689" /> had not been altered.  It meant that the township of Howth was almost revalued in the same way as if there had been a general re-valuation.  I do not think we could fairly go back in the case of Waterford without going back in the case of other places, such as Howth.</P>

      <P>On October 20th, 1924, Mr. J.J. McElligott wrote the following letter from the Ministry of Finance:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To the Town Clerk, Waterford. F.91/2/'24.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, transmitting copy of a resolution passed by the Waterford Corporation at a special meeting held on the 29th ultimo, in reference to the revaluation of the County Borough of Waterford, I am directed by the Minister for Finance to state that he understands that the revaluation was undertaken at the request of the Waterford Corporation on the grounds that the existing valuations were irrelative, and consequently the burden of rating was unfairly distributed; that in accordance with that request the necessary warrant directing the Commissioner of Valuation to undertake the revaluation was issued on the 24th November, 1922; and that the lists of the revaluation were issued to you on the 1st ultimo, and the statutory notices of their receipt and of the right of any person concerned to lodge objections within the period of twenty-eight days was <Col N="1690" /> duly issued by you.  The general results of the valuation may be summarised as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The total valuation of the Borough was increased from £51,199 to £76,819.  This represents an increase of slightly over 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>(b)  65 per cent. of the tenements in the Borough have been increased by less than 50 per cent., and, therefore, that proportion of the ratepayers will benefit by the reduction of the rates consequent on the increase of the total of the valuation. Of this 65 per cent. some 10 per cent. of the tenements remain unaltered or have been reduced.  Some 27 per cent. have been increased by small amounts, and the balance of the 65 per cent. has been increased by less than 50 per cent.  In all these cases the ratepayers have been bearing an undue proportion of the rates of the Borough.</P>
    <P>(c)  35 per cent. of the tenements have been increased by over 50 per cent., and the ratepayers concerned have not hitherto been bearing their full share of the burden of rates.</P>
    <P>Consequent upon the agitation which had resulted from the publication of the revaluation lists, a representative of the Valuation Office visited Waterford during the currency of the period within which objection could be lodged. The Minister is informed that he had interviews with the Directors of the Chambers of Commerce, the Committee of the Licensed Vintners' Association, the Corporation and individual ratepayers, and he found that objection to the revaluation was mainly based on its effects in relation to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Income tax under Schedule A.</P>
    <P>(b)  Increase in Licence Duties.</P>
    <P>(c)  The large increase in the value of licensed premises.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out that most of the increases in the valuations occurred in the main thoroughfares and affected the large business concerns, and as in these cases income tax is assessed under Schedule D, the additional impost of the tenant under Schedule A, would, in these cases, be credited in <Col N="1691" /> the assessment under Schedule D, so that little additional burden would, therefore, fall on the taxpayers in this connection.  It was also pointed out that the present quinquennial valuation roll for Waterford would be in force for about four years more, and, except in the case of new and improved premises, the revaluation would not become operative for income tax purposes until the expiry of that period.  It was further pointed out that the valuation of the licensed premises for the first time included the valuation of licence, as had been the case in the revaluation of Belfast and Dublin, but that in all probability the addition of 20 per cent. to the existing valuations for the purposes of determining licence duties would, following the precedent of Belfast and Dublin, be discontinued in whole or in part on application being made to the Revenue Commissioners.  These facts considerably modified the attitude of many of the ratepayers, and while every encouragement was given to lodge objections if it was felt that the slightest injustice had been done, it is significant that although 35 per cent. of the ratepayers must inevitably pay a larger proportion of the rates, only less than 19 per cent. of them lodged objections to their valuations.  It was also stated that as the revaluation would not come into force for rating purposes until all the appeals had been dealt with, it was quite probable that this would occupy a period of some months, and probably the revaluation lists could not be issued in time for an earlier rating than that of the financial year 1926-7.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, therefore, the Minister is unable to accede to the request conveyed in the Corporation's resolution for the suspension of the operation of the revaluation of the County Borough of Waterford.  The suspension would be a decided disadvantage to 65 per cent. of the ratepayers of the borough, and it is probable that any attempt to give effect to the suggestion for suspension would be resisted by most of these ratepayers.  The Minister has been informed that, in fact, a protest against the proposal has been lodged with the Corporation, and, in the circumstances, <Col N="1692" /> he feels sure that the Corporation will now agree with him that it is highly undesirable that the operation of the revaluation should be suspended.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As to the rates, we have no grievance.  That is a local matter.  As to income tax, the undertaking lies there and that is our grievance.</P>

      <P>I am glad that this important Bill has been so ably handled by the Minister.  One of the changes effected by the Bill is a change of name from the General Medical Council to the Medical Registration Council.  As one who has been connected with an important hospital in the South of Ireland for over thirty-seven years and who has been brought into close contact with the medical and surgical profession, I should like to bear testimony to the fact that the past record has been a happy one in regard to appointments for Irishmen not only across Channel, but throughout the British Commonwealth of Nations and the wide world.  All over Great Britain and the Colonies I can point to many men occupying important positions who were qualified in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one provision in the Bill which I regret.  That is the new means of suggesting a representative of this country for the Medical Council across Channel.  The recommendation is to come from the Governor-General of Northern Ireland instead of from the Governor of this State whose personality and popularity would carry as <Col N="1694" /> much confidence and weight as any other individual throughout Europe. I regret that one of the first acts of the Governor of Northern Ireland has been to make a change in the representation on that Council and that the man who so ably represented Ireland on that Council has now ceased to function.  A Northerner has now been appointed.  However, I recognise in this generous act of allowing the North to step in an act of wise statesmanship. It may with the cumulative effect of other things tend to wipe away the artificial boundary that exists between the Six Counties and the Twenty-Six.</P>

      <P>I said I would agree to the principle of Senator Dowdall's amendment.  The amendment, however, provides for reconsideration of rates of charge by local authorities &ldquo;at the expiration of each financial year of such local authority.&rdquo;  The accounts of an electrical undertaking under a municipal authority are not made up until some months of the new financial year have elapsed.  The effect would be that the new rate would not, in fact, come in until the subsequent year.  To meet that difficulty, I have tabled an amendment. The effect is to cut out that rigid time limit and leave the rates to be revised from time to time by the Board.</P>

      <P>To delete the section and to substitute the following new section therefor:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>104.&mdash;(1)  The Executive Council may by order transfer from the Minister or the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland (in this section referred to as the Commissioners) respectively to the Board all or any of the functions, powers, and duties conferred or imposed by or under any statute on the Minister or the Commissioners (as the case may be) in relation to the care or <Col N="1696" /> conservancy of the navigation or the drainage of the River Shannon or any tributary thereof or of works constructed for the improvement of such navigation or drainage, and any such order may transfer all or any of such functions, powers, and duties in relation either to the whole or to any particular parts or part of the said river or any tributary thereof.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where by reason of the existence of the Shannon works it is impracticable for the Commissioners to exercise the functions and powers or perform the duties conferred or imposed on them by any such statute as aforesaid in accordance with the provisions of such statute the Commissioners shall exercise such functions and powers and perform such duties as nearly as may be practicable, having regard to the existence of the said works, in accordance with the provisions of such statute, and upon an order being made by the Executive Council under this section transferring all or any of such functions, powers and duties to the Board, the Board shall exercise the functions and powers and perform the duties to which such order relates as nearly as may be practicable, having regard to the existence of the said works, in accordance with the provisions of such statute.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever any functions, powers, or duties are transferred to the Board by an order under this section the Executive Council may by the same or any subsequent order authorise and require the Board to exercise and perform all or any of such functions, powers, and duties in relation to all or any of the canals, locks, wharves, piers, landing places, quays, or other works constructed by the Minister under the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925 (No. 26 of 1925), and upon such order being made the works to which such order relates shall be deemed to be included in the works in relation to which such functions, powers, and duties are exercisable by virtue of the statute by which the same were created and such statute (with such <Col N="1697" /> modifications, if any, as are specified in such order) shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>(4)  Whenever any functions, powers, or duties are transferred from the Commissioners to the Board by an order under this section the Executive Council may by the same or any subsequent order transfer to and vest in the Board all or any of the locks, lock-houses, eel-weirs, or other property which immediately before the date of such order were vested in the Commissioners and were used by them either for the purpose of or in connection with the exercise or performance of the functions, powers, or duties, so transferred or for the purpose of providing revenue for the exercise or performance of such functions, powers, or duties.</P>
    <P>(5)  Whenever any functions, powers, or duties are transferred from the Commissioners to the Board by an order under this section the Executive Council may by the same or any subsequent order transfer from the services of the Commissioners to the service of the Board any person employed by the Commissioners in relation to or for the purpose of the exercise or performance of such functions, powers, or duties, and every person so transferred shall thereupon become and be a servant of the Board upon the same terms as to remuneration and superannuation, pension, or gratuity (if any) as those on which he was employed by the Commissioners immediately before such transfer and shall for the purpose of such superannuation, pension or gratuity (if any) be entitled to reckon his period of service with the Commissioners as service with the Board.</P>
    <P>(6)  Whenever any functions, powers, or duties are transferred from the Commissioners to the Board by an order under this section the Executive Council may by the same or any subsequent order impose on the Board the obligation to pay as from the date of such order any pension which at the date of such order is payable by the Commissioners to <Col N="1698" /> a person formerly employed by the Commissioners in relation to or for the purpose of the exercise or performance of such functions, powers, and duties, and thereupon the Board shall become and be liable to indemnify the Commissioners against all and every liability in respect of such pension as from the date of such order.</P>
    <P>(7)  An order made by the Executive Council under this section transferring any functions, powers or duties from the Commissioners to the Board may be expressed and if so expressed shall operate to require the Board to keep a separate account in relation to the exercise by it of the functions and powers and the performance by it of the duties to which such order relates and may be expressed and if so expressed shall operate to require that the functions, powers and duties to which such order relates be exercised and performed by officers and servants of the Board employed by it solely in relation to such functions, powers and duties.</P>
    <P>(8)  No order made under this section shall come into operation until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and has been approved by resolution of each such House.</P>

      <P>As one who has taken an active part in opposing this Bill, I desire to say that I have no complaint <Col N="1699" /> to make as to the tone and temper of the debate, though certain epithets directed against me would suggest that my opposition is not genuine but is actuated by an unnational spirit.  These remarks were made because of the suggestion that the scheme should cease to be a Government scheme.  The Government have told us that they had four offers from private undertakings to lease the scheme.  The House can judge whether in view of those facts my opposition to the Second Reading was based on unworthy motives.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, Senator Kenny suggested that certain interests were out to pile all possible charges on to this undertaking for the purpose of making it a failure and that those interests desired to see the scheme a failure.  That suggestion was made after the proposal had been discussed that this scheme should pay its fair share of rates and should not receive a subsidy from the ratepayers.  I leave the House to judge whether in that case my motives were reckless or unnational. I make this plea purely in the interests of independent thought in public life.  Some of us may not see eye to eye with others.  But there is a right to independent criticism.  I think that is a right which should be preserved both in the interests of the Government and in the interests of the dignity of Parliamentary life.  I have no desire to see this scheme a failure. I have every desire to see it a success, provided it is carried out with due regard for established Parliamentary practice and for the canons of sound finance.  That is where my doubt lies and that is why my opposition has been offered.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Sir John Keane's contributions to the debate were valuable.  It is desirable to have differences of opinion, from time to time, on a matter which is of such vast importance as the Shannon scheme.  I think the Government and the Minister are to be congratulated on <Col N="1700" /> the way the matter has been handled. Notwithstanding that this was, in the first instance, in the opinion of some people, a jump in the dark, the whole country will fall into line with the remarks that fell from Senator Jameson earlier in the debate.  The Senator said that we were all now committed to the scheme, and that we should all stand unitedly together and try to make it a success.</P>
      <P>The grievances that were trotted out in the earlier part of the discussion seemed to centre around the loss that the ratepayers of Dublin and neighbourhood would suffer by reason of the scheme.  Might I remind the House that vast changes have taken place in what was formerly known as &ldquo;dear dirty Dublin&rdquo;&mdash;a place that we all have the greatest affection for, for many reasons. I think the Government have no reason to be criticised for their treatment of this handsome city which we all revere so much.  Their attitude towards the city during the few years that they have been functioning has been admirable.</P>

      <P>I am leading up to that.  It has been suggested that the Dublin ratepayers were not fairly treated under this scheme.  The policy of the Government has been a policy of centralisation on a very large scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amongst the other services that have been moved up here are the law courts. We know that the law courts are functioning in Dublin now to a larger extent than ever before.  We are aware that that involves the bringing up to Dublin of numerous witnesses, counsel, etc.  The City of Dublin has largely profited thereby.  Other bodies, ecclesiastical and otherwise, are looking to Dublin more than ever as the capital of the country, and these bodies are composed of people from the extreme north to the south.  I think, at any <Col N="1701" /> rate, that all of us should find great satisfaction in the fact that this great power from the Shannon electrification will ultimately revolutionise things to a very great extent in this country. That power will be derived from that mighty river in the west, so often alluded to in song and story by patriot and poet:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to disabuse the minds of Senators of any impressions they may have formed that I had cast any reflections on any Senator because of any criticisms made by him on the Bill before us.  I entirely disclaim any intention of that sort.  I was, however, concerned with the impression that was abroad in the minds of some of the general public.  It is only in that connection that I used the remarks which I now find were wrongly construed. On the main question of this scheme as a whole there can be no two opinions as to the absolute soundness of judgement and the great courage of those who first conceived this scheme and afterwards carried it into effect. Mr. L.J. Kettle, who is Chairman of the Institute of Engineers, in an address a few years ago to that body, made use of these expressions, or, rather, I should say, gave it as his considered view to the members:&mdash;That &ldquo;electricity supply was not an industry, It is far more.  It is the life-blood of every industry&mdash;cheap and abundant power.&rdquo;  Further on in his address he said that &ldquo;nationalisation is only an extended form of municipalisation.&rdquo; Now, the attitude of the Government in the early stages of this scheme, in holding up other schemes that were in course of projection, the Anna Liffey and other schemes, was, I think, absolutely correct.  If vested interests were created in that way it would make the task of the Government more difficult, and the cost of setting the matter right would eventually fall upon the taxpayers. This would militate against the one desideratum of the country&mdash; cheap power and an abundant supply of power&mdash;a guaranteed continuous supply.  This can only be guaranteed in its continuity when the source is continuous, and we know that the <Col N="1702" /> River Shannon will flow, I suppose, eternally.</P>
      <P>Any other form of power, power derived from coal or any other source, is fitful power.  There is no guarantee of its continuity in its widest sense.  I therefore think that though it may have been harsh at the time to the other syndicates, the Government was quite justified in holding up those other schemes that were initiated by enterprising and patriotic men who were disposed to risk their capital and give their energy and experience in the development of hydro-electric power throughout the Saorstát.  It was unfortunate that they laboured under a sense of grievance at the action of the Government at the time.  The main object in view was the provision of cheap power for the whole country, and anyone who examines the matter carefully must come to the conclusion that the electrification of the Shannon was the best thing the Government could have done at the time.  I hope the ultimate results will confirm that view. There is no wrong going to be perpetrated with regard to the position of the employees of any association or undertaking producing electricity hitherto.  All their rights are assured, their position and their prospects are very considerably improved because of the consequent enlargement of this electric business which will, of course, mean increased employment all round. I do not think there will be any disturbance of the personnel of the employees in the Dublin area.  Certainly we may reasonably look forward to a very considerable expansion in electric development in and around Dublin.  It seems pretty certain that when this transformer from the Shannon is set up here it will have three times the supply capacity of the present undertakings in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government were wise in projecting this scheme, because it is the very thing that is needed to develop our manufacturing arm.  The Government are right also in what they are doing for technical education in order to fit the people to use this great power from the Shannon.  The Minister for Education is doing his best to equip the youth of this country so as to have <Col N="1703" /> them prepared for the time when beneficial results will flow from the Shannon scheme.  In order to ensure that these beneficial results will flow from it, the Minister for Education is working to equip the youth of the country with technical skill.  That is the aim of our technical system now.  Education in technical matters was neglected in the past.  In a technical way, I suppose, we are the most untrained population in Europe and the most unfitted technically. Now, when this Shannon scheme is completed we must, perforce, introduce from other countries technically-skilled people unless we have them trained ourselves at home.  The Minister for Education and the Government appreciate that fact, and education is now being directed more than ever towards the development of technical training.  I certainly will give my support, as I have always given it, to the Shannon scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of those who wishes the scheme to be a success, and who supported it in its general principle from the beginning, I cannot give the Bill as it stands the unmitigated lavish blessing that Senator Kenny has given it.  I have to make a very solemn and final protest against the failure of the Government to accept a fair wages clause in the Bill.  It is, perhaps, a fitting act of a dying Government, at the end of what has been an important session, to refuse to concede the right of the workman to his hire. We only rejoice in schemes of this kind because they help to give the community more of the world's good things, because they enable the people as a whole to have a better standard of living.  The Government think that is quite a good object so long as it does not extend, and this principle is not conceded as far as the ordinary workers are concerned.  Everything else that the new Board will procure in the way of raw material, manufactured articles, etc., they will pay for at the commercial market price, and similarly in regard to foreign labour.  The one commodity they are not prepared to extend that principle to is the human commodity in the Saorstát, for the benefit <Col N="1704" /> of which this scheme was originally projected.</P>
      <P>Those who praise the scheme lavishly and, at the same time, vote as Senator Kenny has done against giving a fair wage to the men who are working the scheme, are not sincere, and the country will judge of their sincerity.  We deplore the action of the Government in this matter because it is an indication to everybody of the Government's mentality in regard to the future of this country.  It shows an absolute lack of confidence in the capacity of the people to do anything except under what would amount to conditions of white slavery.  A good deal of talk has gone on about emigration and the necessity, if possible, of providing employment at home.  The sort of employment the Government propose to give is not calculated to retain a single spirited young man or woman.  Thirty-two shillings a week! The policy enunciated at the beginning of this scheme in regard to wage-earners is evidently to be continued, and the result will be that we will have only the wasters and the inefficient people retained at home and the best of our young people will emigrate.</P>
      <P>Some people are always slobbering about dead patriots, while those who are living are starving.  We believe in giving fairly decent living conditions to people when they are alive instead of erecting monuments to them when they are dead.  This is a scheme which we expected would help us to carry out that policy, but evidently the intention is merely to establish an oriental standard of civilisation in this new State.  We deplore any such intention. We hope that as a result of a change of mind on the part of the present Government, or for that matter a change of Government, a better and more prosperous outlook will prevail, so that we may be able to build up that nation which a great many people seem to visualise.</P>

      <P>It will be necessary for the House to meet at 7 o'clock. Then there will be a motion which we <Col N="1705" /> will be asked to adopt.  Under the Constitution, no suspension of the session of both Houses can be passed affecting the Seanad session except with the Seanad's own consent.  Consequently, when the Dáil to-day will agree, as I understand they will, to bring their own session to a close, it will be necessary, in order that that should be adopted by this House, that we pass a consenting resolution.  That is required by the Constitution.</P>
