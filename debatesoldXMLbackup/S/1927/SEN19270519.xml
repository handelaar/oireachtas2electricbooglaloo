      <P>I move amendment 5a:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11.  After the word &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; wherever the same <Col N="1552" /> occurs to insert the words &ldquo;in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is in connection with the remarks I made yesterday with regard to holdings that possible members of the Board might have in other electricity undertakings.  I think the whole section is very drastic and quite unnecessary, as it will put members of the Board in a very uncomfortable position with regard to holding shares in electricity undertakings.  May I point out that it is not merely an undertaking for the development of electricity that it applies to.  It might also apply to the stock of a Corporation, such as the Dublin Corporation, who are makers and developers of electricity. Under the section, as I read it, a member of the Board will be precluded from holding, say, Dublin Corporation stock.  If, however, the amendment is accepted, it will confine the prohibition to electrical undertakings in the Free State, and will allow a member of the Board to hold shares in undertakings outside the Free State.  As I stated yesterday, when the Currency Bill was being discussed in the Dáil a question was raised as to whether a member of the Currency Commission might hold shares in a bank.  One Deputy suggested that it should be universal in its application. The Minister for Finance took exception to that, and pointed out that although it would be irregular for a member of the Commission to hold shares in an Irish bank, it would be very onerous for him if he was precluded from holding shares in, say, the Bank of England, or any joint stock bank outside the Free State.  Personally, I should like to delete the section altogether, but as that might not meet with the wishes of the Seanad, the amendment suggests that the reservation should be in reference to electrical undertakings within the Free State.</P>

      <P>I think the Senator should make the amendment read: &ldquo;wherever the same occurs in this section&rdquo;; otherwise it would mean that the words were to be inserted whenever the word &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; occurs in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a radical change.  The points on which we went in framing the Bill were the ordinary ones that would occur to people's minds.  We thought, for instance, that it was undesirable that a member of the Board should have shares in, say, the General Electrical Company of America with which the Board might hereafter do business, or hold shares in any manufacturing concern with which the Board were likely to do business. The analogy with the Currency Commission, and what was stated in the Dáil, hardly applies, because the Currency Commission is not likely to do business with banks outside the area of the Free State, whereas the Board's business will be largely with concerns outside the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. GUINNESS Mr. GUINNESS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that one of the provisions of the Currency Bill is that there should be a bank in London to pay the legal tender notes, so that the Board will be concerned with banks outside the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be in any way which can be affected by the fact of a member of the Commission having holdings in any bank outside the Free State?  I think the Minister for Finance's statement was that the holding would really have to be immense before there could be any thought of impartiality being destroyed. The same thing does not hold here.  I think the circumstances are entirely different.  The Board will be dealing for the main portion of their business, in so far as they do business, with electrical undertakings&mdash;for electrical appliances, cable, etc.&mdash;almost entirely with concerns outside the Free State.  I am not addressing the argument particularly to the limitation which the Senator has in mind by putting in the words &ldquo;in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  Outside that there is simply the point which the Seanad will have to consider: Is it advisable to have on the Board, which will be making big contracts, people who may have shares in some of the concerns with which the contracts are to be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not cripple <Col N="1554" /> the Minister if he found that someone he wanted on the Board owned shares in an electricity undertaking in Canada or some such place that had nothing to do with the production of electricity in this country?  The section, as it stands, would preclude the Minister from taking on the Board anyone who owned such shares.  Would it not be better if there were words added that would allow discretion on the part of the Minister to get, for instance, a declaration from anybody who might be nominated as a director as to his holding in any electricity company? Then, if the Minister thought that the shares so held would allow the implication that that company might have dealings with the Board, he should communicate that fact to the proposed director before appointing him.  I think the Minister is crippling himself in his choice by retaining the section, as it stands, and that is my chief objection to it.  I admit that the amendment proposed by Senator Guinness does not relieve the Minister from all his troubles, but it leaves it open to anybody who has shares in a big electrical manufacturing company outside Saorstát Eireann to be eligible for the Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>The people concerned in this matter are not more than three or four&mdash;six is the greatest possible number.  Is it not better to have the section water-tight even if there is a danger of men having shares in other electrical producing companies?  The Minister has pointed out that this Board will be dealing with people concerned in the production of electrical power, and there is the possibility of a man having an interest in an electrical undertaking outside being put on this Board.  It is unfair that a member of the Board should be dealing with an outside company in which he has an interest.  On the whole, I think it is better to leave the section as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to Senator Jameson's point was given by Senator Guinness, who raised it himself yesterday&mdash;that if there was anybody suitable for membership of the Board and it was discovered he held shares in other electrical undertakings it would <Col N="1555" /> be a matter for his choice as to whether he would sell out and become eligible, or whether he would decide to hold the shares he possessed and not be eligible. There is the alternative of choice.  I think it is better in the interests of fair dealings as between the Board and outside firms that the section should remain as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (9) of Section 12 is not in the Bill because the Bill has not been reprinted with the amendments inserted in Committee in the Seanad, but the sub-section has reference to portion of Sir John Griffith's amendment with regard to allowing the 1932 date to be postponed, and this sub-section made arrangements for finances in connection with that.  It has been pointed out since that that is not the proper way to appropriate money, and the deletion of the sub-section would leave the matter in this way: Once the date is extended it will be necessary to make legislative proposals so as to secure the money, and that will follow as a necessary consequence of changing the date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 14 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14.&mdash;All property in the ownership or under the control of the Board shall pay income tax and poor rates.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to ensure that the property controlled by the Board should pay income tax and poor rate.  I do not wish to introduce any personal note, but I feel that if this <Col N="1556" /> had not been discovered the Bill might have gone through both Houses&mdash;I have no recollection of the matter being brought out in the Dáil&mdash;in a manner that would allow these works to be exempt from rates or taxes.  I think if we were to do that we should do it with our eyes open, having regard to the precedent created and the principle involved.  What justification is there for subsidising an electrical undertaking in this very important respect?  How does the production of electricity stand in any different relations with regard to rates and taxes from the work of the farmer who produces milk or the manufacturer who produces any ordinary commodity?</P>
    <P>I can see no difference except, as I said before, that at all costs, even at the sacrifice of consistency and principle, this scheme must be made a success. If the House is prepared to accept that view and to introduce this extraordinarily dangerous precedent, I am afraid I cannot be a party to its decision.  You will have further, as far as I can see, this curious inconsistency that as long as the undertaker remains independent he will pay rates and taxes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator asked me whether it was provided in the Act that the Board would pay income tax on property under Schedule A.  The answer I made was: &ldquo;If the Senator wishes to achieve that purpose he will have to put down an amendment.&rdquo;  The Senator further asked me if I was prepared to put down an amendment and if I had considered the matter.  I replied that the Bill represented my point of view. The exact effect of that is that while I might like to see the property of the Board exempt from income tax, if that is to be achieved it will have to be achieved by an amendment to the Finance Act which I understand is to come later before the Seanad.  It cannot be done under this Bill.  The position with regard to income tax is that the Board will be liable.  With regard to rates I have an amendment down dealing with that question exempting the works from local rates and putting them in the same position as municipal undertakings are in today.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the reply which the Minister gave to me on the Committee Stage is a justification for my misunderstanding of the position.  It is clear now, at all events, that the Board will pay income tax. The arguments that I have to put forward with regard to the payment of rates I shall reserve until we come to the amendment dealing with rates.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 10&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1558" /> Section 19.  After the word &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; in line 54, to insert the words &ldquo;and facilitate the establishment of factories for the consumption of the same.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I raised this question on the Committee Stage I think considerable misapprehension arose as regards the intention of my amendment.  The wording of Section 19 is as follows:&mdash; It shall be the duty of the Board...</P>
    <P>(c)  to distribute, utilise and sell the electricity generated by the Board in the Shannon works, to promote and encourage the purchase and use of such electricity and..</P>
    <P>I proposed on the Committee Stage to add to that &ldquo;including the erection of factories consuming the same.&rdquo;  I understood at the time that the words &ldquo;to promote and encourage&rdquo; would refer to that section but you, sir, pointed out that it would be more advisable to amend my amendment and to bring in a new amendment on the Report Stage.  I have amended the amendment which now reads: &ldquo;And facilitate the establishment of factories for the consumption of the same.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty was this, that I could not very well hold that an amendment imposing on the Board an obligation to promote the establishment or erection of factories was consistent with the purpose of the Bill.  It is another matter to say that they should encourage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>To follow the views that you, sir, expressed on the Committee Stage, I have varied my amendment to read in the terms in which it now appears on the Paper.  I am not going to weary the Seanad with all the arguments I brought forward on the last occasion in favour of the establishment of factories.  I think everyone will be at one with me as to the desirability of establishing new factories.  From the very beginning the country has been led to expect that new factories would be established as a result of this scheme.  It was felt that as a result of the Shannon scheme, new factories would be established, and that that was really the only way to get rid of the unemployment difficulty.  The fundamental idea of the amendment is <Col N="1559" /> that this is to be a permissive duty, as far as the Board is concerned: that it may do these things.  The Act, apparently, has been drafted with the idea of carrying out the assurance which the Minister gave to the country; that the Shannon scheme was to be self-supporting within a few years. There are several ways of making it self-supporting.  It can be made self-supporting either by selling electricity to existing undertakings or to new undertakings.  As regards the difference between the two, I think there can be no doubt as to which would be the more beneficial to the country at large. We have been talking in millions in connection with this scheme.  I have heard people very glibly allude to the fact that 110,000,000 units are to be disposed of.  I do not know that, when speaking like that, people realise what 110,000,000 units mean.  When you talk of 110,000,000 units the figure is not such an enormous one as the average man in the street might think it is. I will endeavour to put the matter in terms that will be readily understood, and that will bring home to people what 110,000,000 units really mean.  The Minister, when introducing the Shannon Electricity Bill, said that it was proposed to establish works to develop something like 90,000 horse-power.  As a matter of fact, if one works out the figures given by the experts, it is not quite as much as that.  Since then the scheme has been modified to a certain extent, because the fall has been reduced by the elimination of the tail race.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, that is not a question that arises on this amendment.  However, to enable people to grasp what 90,000 horse power means I would like to put a concrete example before them.  We read from time to time in the newspapers of new ships being floated.  We see that these new ships have a horse power of from 50,000 to 55,000, so that the total amount of horse power that will be available from the Shannon will be about equivalent to the horse power <Col N="1560" /> generated by two of these large vessels. That is not an enormous quantity.  I do not mention that as an argument against the scheme, because I give the Minister credit for the energetic way in which he has brought the scheme forward.  It is a fine scheme, and he has brought it to a head, not always, however, by methods I approve of.  For the scheme itself, I have nothing but words of praise.  I am afraid, however, if this Bill goes through without any suggestion being made that it is the duty of the Board to try and find the most profitable kind of consumers for the electricity when it is available the idea may go forth that it is no portion of its duty to do so, and that it will be merely obliged to sell to existing undertakings.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask what great advantage the country at large will obtain from bringing this electricity up here to Dublin and selling it to the Tramways Company so that they may run the trams more cheaply?  What great advantage to the country at large will it be that the Dublin Corporation should get their electricity a little cheaper?  It will, however, be an enormous advantage to the country at large if new industries are established. That undoubtedly has been the idea all through.  The speeches of Ministers on the hustings recently prove it and I want to make it quite clear that this Board will have power to do something. I do not want to make it incumbent upon the Minister or the Board if they cannot sell electricity in this way to withhold the sale of electricity elsewhere but I do want to make it clear that it will be portion of their duties to sell it in the best way it can possibly be sold.  If they sell this electricity here in Dublin this 90,000 horse-power is not such a very enormous quantity that it cannot be run through in a very short time.  If it is sold for what seems to me rather more or less unremunerative purposes, then the country and the whole nation will be very injuriously affected.  I think it should be made perfectly clear that they should sell it in the best way and if they cannot sell it in the best way then they can dispose of it in any way they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. <Col N="1561" /> It seems to me that one of the effects of this scheme will be to facilitate factories and the insertion of this particular sub-section will be a sort of instruction to the Board in every way possible to assist factories. Section 45 of the Bill gives the Board power to acquire land compulsorily and if it appears feasible to the Board to establish a factory, say, near a waterway I think it would be a useful direction to the Board that they should acquire land compulsorily to facilitate factories to get electricity in this manner.  I do not think it is necessary to add anything further to the statement made by the Senator who moved the amendment, but I do think that the addition of these words would make it perfectly clear to everybody that the intention of the scheme eventually is that factories should be started in the country by means of electricity.  I think the amendment as proposed goes further and makes it perfectly clear that that intention will be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask Senator how the Board would facilitate the erection of factories?  Remember money is being handed over to the Board for a certain purpose.  We are now going to give, by the amendment, facilities to the Board for the erection of factories.  In other words, the Board is to subsidise the erection of factories. That may not be the Senator's intention, but that is the effect.  Senator Bennett has put down a later amendment. That later amendment is that the Board shall have power to acquire land compulsorily for the erection of factories or other works by persons under agreement with the Board.  That is the way facilities should be given. <Col N="1562" /> That is a departure I should like to call attention to.  Up to date we have had the example of lands being compulsorily acquired for public purposes. Never yet had any leave to be given to acquire lands compulsorily to hand it over to a company, that company to work it on the basis of profit, and that would be the effect with the two amendments joined together.  Outside that facility, what facility can be given? The senator himself says that within the four corners of the Bill he could not see that the Board would have any power to increase the sale of electricity. The section itself states that &ldquo;it shall be the duty of the Board to distribute, utilise and sell electricity generated by the Board in the Shannon works, and to promote and encourage the purchase and use of such electricity.&rdquo;  That is where the offer to the factory may come in if it can be encouraged by the use and provision of cheap electricity. I would ask the Seanad to disagree with this amendment, which would lead to the subsidising of factories by the Board.</P>

The point of view that has been expressed to me about that is, that if the word &ldquo;terms&rdquo; includes security, then security is there without calling attention to the word. If &ldquo;terms&rdquo; does not include security putting the phrase in this way will not operate to bring security inside the clause.

It is necessary to read with this amendment, amendment 2 (a).  I make another proposition with regard to this and, perhaps, the Seanad would like to deal <Col N="1564" /> with it now.  There is a later amendment, No. 12, in Senator Sir John Keane's name, which insists on a date being arranged, but it is quite impossible to be clear as to the time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked by Senator Dowdall to say that the deletion of his amendment scarcely fulfils the position as he desires it.  In this respect, gas and other undertakings are timorous that certain of their rights may be taken from them by order of the Board without consulting them. The Minister was aware of that fact, and up to a certain point this new amendment would meet the wishes of those people, but it is considered that some sort of representation should be made, formal or informal, informing them of any proposed change.  Senator Dowdall's amendment, as accepted by the Seanad, arranged for the insertion of an advertisement giving notice of the intentions of the Board to make certain regulations.  That was the important point in the amendment, but the present amendment does away with that, and does not absolutely arrange for any consultation to be held between the owners of the undertakings and the Board.  The amendment passed by the Seanad did arrange that there should be such consultation.  If the Seanad accepts this amendment and rescinds the amendment made in Committee that arrangement, with regard to advertisement and consultation, will disappear, and it will be in the power of the Minister to decide whether he does, or does not, desire a consultation.  Perhaps, he would make some concession and would amend this amendment so as to provide for consultation with the owners of such undertakings.  Otherwise, on behalf of Senator Dowdall, I would oppose rescinding the previous amendment.</P>

      <P>I should, of course, have mentioned that the sub-section which it is proposed to delete is not the sub-section in the printed Bill but the new sub-section (5) which was inserted by the Seanad.  I think that Senators will agree that that sub-section <Col N="1566" /> was inserted, mainly, because of the closing words in the Senator's speech and a number of people were under the impression that the amendment was accepted by me.  My objection to that amendment was that it imposed the necessity of an advertisement and the holding of a formal inquiry in any case in which it is proposed to make regulations changing the present position with regard to gas undertakings.  I hold that there are certain regulations which could be made, which will have to be made with the consent of both Houses, but it is not necessary to call attention to the fact that such changes are to be made. In such cases it might be considered that the notice was too short and in others that it was too long.  I hold that there is a sufficient guarantee under the Bill.  The present position is stereotyped with regard to gas undertakings.  If there is a regulation about to be made regarding any change it must be done by means of an order laid before both Houses and it could be rejected by an adverse vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Consultation is dependent on the Minister directing an inquiry to be held.  My amendment is that any regulation making a change shall not be made until after consultation with the Minister.  There is to be consultation with the Minister and there is to be service of such notice as the Minister may require and also the holding of such inquiry as he may consider necessary.  The inquiry referred to in Senator Dowdall's amendment depends on the will of the Minister.  If <Col N="1567" /> the Minister decides that it is necessary to hold an inquiry he has the power to impose an obligation on the Board to admit those concerned and to let them be represented professionally. It is discretionary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but the amendment we have passed made it essential that the bodies concerned would know that such an inquiry was to be held.  Under the amendment, as proposed, there may be a consultation between the Board and the persons concerned without the knowledge of the people most interested in the matter.  It is not clear in the section that a consultation with these people would be held before the inquiry takes place.  They would be in the dark.</P>

      <P>Is there any great point in having knowledge of the fact that there is a change to be made, if the Minister says there is to be no inquiry, and no representation at the inquiry, if held?  What is the safeguard in all this?  I had discussions with people concerned, and I believe my amendment would meet their wishes.  What is the guarantee?  It is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has shed his responsibilities with regard to electricity, but that he retains, and must retain, all his responsibilities with regard to gas undertakings, harbours, and ports.  He has a statutory obligation with regard to these which he would be neglecting in particular cases if he did not have an inquiry.  If the point of professional representation is to be stressed, while it is not stated in my amendment I have been advised that that could be imposed as necessary at the holding of an inquiry.  As to the other point: what is the value of having an advertisement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that under the section as it stands you have <Col N="1568" /> between the Board and the Minister a consultation.  The persons concerned are not aware that there is such a consultation, and consequently they have no means of influencing by advice or otherwise the decision to be arrived at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the Minister.  If there is a big point coming up the Minister will say, &ldquo;Let us hear the company, and let us serve notice of the holding of the inquiry.&rdquo; If it is a small matter that will not be done.  The only difference between Senator Dowdall's amendment and my amendment, now before the Seanad, is with regard to the issue of an advertisement. Senator Dowdall's amendment imposes the necessity of people concerned being represented at an inquiry by professional advisers.</P>

      <P>Sub-section 8 of Section 39 deals with the compensation which is to be awarded to authorised undertakers who are not municipal bodies, if their undertaking is taken over by the Board.  As the section stands, that compensation is to be fixed, in default of agreement, by an arbitrator, and if they cannot agree about an arbitrator he is to be appointed by the Minister. These questions of compensation to authorised undertakers will be difficult questions, and I think it would be better to relieve the Minister of the rather invidious task of appointing an arbitrator between the Board and the authorised undertaker.  If you left it simply to arbitration, without saying anything further, and the parties could not agree about an arbitrator, then they would have to come to court.  It is a simple process and the court could appoint as arbitrator a qualified person.</P>

      <P>New section.  Before Section 40 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;40.  The rates for electricity charged by the new undertaker under Section 39 of this Act shall in no case exceed those charged by the former undertaker.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter that was discussed <Col N="1572" /> in Committee.  The amendment seeks to ensure that a new undertaker shall charge no higher rates than a former undertaker.  The Minister is prepared to accept that if Section 59 (1) is given up.  I have examined both and they are totally different things.  The Minister, from what he said, should have no hesitation in accepting this amendment. He said all along that he is very confident that the new rates shall not be more than the old.  That should dispose of the matter.  His argument is if he makes an area self-contained and does not impose any outside charges on that area&mdash;merely arranges that it shall continue as a separate accounting entity and bear its own fair costs&mdash;it is not reasonable to ask him to accept the other condition.  They are quite separate matters.  One is a precaution to ensure that the rate shall not be higher.  The other is intended to ensure that no unfair or outside charge shall be put upon a district like Dublin with a favourable load.  The argument has been that where you have a dense population like Dublin and can give, presumably, lower rates, you should not, in any way, exploit those conditions in favour of less fertile areas. Those are two separate things and I hope the Seanad will agree with me that there is nothing unreasonable in asking the Minister to accept both those conditions.</P>

      <P>That is not stated.  Let me take one undertaking. There is one, not far from Dublin, where the definite policy has been to make a scale of charges which will never make electricity pay its way. The undertaking cost £6,000, and it has cost the ratepayers in that area £10,000 extra.  Is the Board to keep up that uneconomic rate?  If the Board acquired that undertaking at Kildare, it would have, under the amendment, to keep up that uneconomic rate.  That is absurd.  With regard to the reaction of Section 59 (1) on this matter, in one case I unwisely bound myself, in reply to certain criticisms, to apportion to each area definitely and clearly its own liabilities when taking it over.  In addition to that the Senator asks me to provide that the rates for electricity shall in no case exceed those charged by the former undertaker.  I would like that analysed to find out what it means.  It might mean, if both those provisions are put in, that the Board, in acquiring some undertakings down the country, would have to set against the consumers in the new area liability merely for that and, possibly, give the new consumers in that area electricity at a price which would be proportioned to the liability taken over but which would bear no relation to new liabilities&mdash;cost of buildings, extension or anything of the sort.  You stabilise the position without realising what the changed conditions are. Dublin has adopted, since the advent of the Shannon scheme, certain devices for attracting new consumers of electricity. At the moment there are two methods of charge&mdash;one, in which you simply pay a fairly high rate per unit, and another in which there is paid a percentage of the valuation of the house, plus a lower charge per unit. Which of these is to be stabilised, or are both?  Or must the Board be kept down to the established minimum in any one of the devices at present in operation?  There are a variety of circumstances which will have to be adverted to.  To impose a clause of this sort on the Board, together with the extra impediment that is in Section 59 (1), and to say that there shall be apportioned to a particular area the <Col N="1574" /> liability only of that particular area, would tie the Board's hands completely, and would leave it powerless to make changes which would undoubtedly be for the good of the consumer. This amendment would put a tremendous handicap on the Board. People can examine for themselves the variety of charges for services. Some of these charges may be quite wrong.  Some may be particularly favourable to individuals.  We must have regard not merely to the taking over of municipal and authorised undertakings, but to the unauthorised undertaking.  The unauthorised undertaker may have a whole gradation of charges, one favoured consumer having a low rate and others really paying for that.  These charges would be stereotyped for all time as at the date of acquisition.</P>

      <P>To delete all from and including the words &ldquo;the Board&rdquo; in line 50 down to the end of the sub-section.</P>
      <P>There are two other amendments, 29c and 29d, which are on the same point, though amendment 29d is to a different section.  Amendment 29c reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 59, sub-section (2).  Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The Board in making scales fixing the methods of charge and rates of charge for electricity supplied to consumers in a district served by a transformer station which is co-terminus with or includes an area which was previously the area of supply of an authorised undertaker whose undertaking has been acquired by the Board under this Act shall not include any charge in respect of liabilities assumed or payments made by the Board in consequence of the acquisition by the <Col N="1577" /> Board under this Act of an undertaking in a district served by any other transformer station.</P>
    <P>I did mention here in Committee Stage that Section 59, as inserted in the Dáil, had been found to be wrongly phrased.  It imposed a bigger handicap on the Board than I thought was right.  I said then I would bring in an amendment and these two amendments can be taken together.  What was regarded as the protective portion of that section for the use of the Dublin consumer has disappeared, but amendment 29c makes up for that deletion.</P>
    <P>May I be permitted briefly to state the difference between what is proposed to be deleted and what is proposed to be substituted for this?  It gets away from the word &ldquo;area.&rdquo;  The net result is simply this: let me relate it back to the circumstances here.  It means that the Board will have to keep a separate account for the present consumers in Dublin, in Pembroke and in Rathmines, and another charge for the new consumers in each of these three areas, and a further charge for all consumers outside those three and in another district which might be served by the same transformer station. Instead of having seven charges it means that they will have one.  They will have to bear indifferently the acquisition cost in Pembroke, Rathmines and Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Minister does not repeat in the new amendment &ldquo;In respect of charges for distribution.&rdquo; The difficulty I see is this: that you may not pass on the capital charges from one district to another.  But if you make a loss in the service of one district is it not possible to recoup that loss by higher charges in another district?  I am hoping that Dublin and the townships are so self-contained that they will bear the charges applicable only to their own areas and not bear any loss that may occur in working any other areas.  I should like an assurance that that is the position.</P>

      <P>I have always stated that it would not be incumbent on the Board&mdash;and I would scrap the Bill rather than make it incumbent on the Board&mdash;to cut to the bone on every item of the bulk supply charge.  What the Senator says cannot happen.  The Board could not manipulate prices and indicate they were going to charge a certain figure to Dublin consumers because there were losses in Kildare. A fraction of a penny, say .1 of a penny, can be charged all over the country on the bulk supply ex-transformer station for the purpose of setting up an extension fund.  That fund may be used in order to open up new districts.  One cannot have it that the profits made in one area are to be devoted to meeting any losses in another area.  What is possible and I think it would be proper thing, is to give the Board power, not to cut to the bone all these charges, but to apply some small portion for the building up of an extension fund at the start for uneconomic areas.  That is in the Bill.</P>

    <Col N="1580" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not determined in the Bill, but this determination will always be there; that the Board, in fixing their rate, will always have to apportion it.  So much will be allowed for delivery to the transformer station outside the town and so much will be allowed for distribution.  Of course, there will always be a comparison with the local generating cost&mdash;the rate at which electricity can be generated in the locality.  There is a place very far removed where the Shannon lines will not extend for years.  That place could run the Board very tight in the matter of generating cost.  The Board there might have to lower the costs to absolutely cut-to-the-bone prices if it wanted to go into the area.  I do not see it going into that area for many years to come.</P>
      <P>I ask the Seanad to hesitate before determining that there shall be a flat rate. The thing desired by Dublin, Cork and Limerick is that they would be charged with only the station charge plus the cost of delivery over the system.  They would gain, whereas the rest of the country would lose on the cost for bulk supply.  The Board must have leave to determine whether it is going to have a flat rate or different charges for each town.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanation has gone pretty far, but all Ireland is paying for this, and I think electricity ought to be delivered all over the country at the same price.  I do not say the distribution charges should be the same; they would depend upon the size of the town, but electricity ought to be delivered at the same price in all parts of the country.  Otherwise the people in Connaught and other places would have a great grievance.</P>

      <P>This matter is very important and is quite new to me. The position is that each district will bear its own distribution charges and internal capital liabilities, but its profits can be drawn upon to serve outlying districts.  You do not gain much by making a district self-contained as regards distribution charges and its own capital liabilities.  This is different to what is done in Canada.  In Canada that principle has never been adopted.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> There every municipality is entirely is subsidised quite independently.  This is subsidised quite independently.  This fund that has been referred to need not necessarily be expended for extension purposes; it may go to meet losses on distribution in adjoining areas.

Existing undertakings for areas are not protected against payment for that.  It is quite obvious that what would happen is that profits made in one area would help to develop areas where there are no undertakings now.  That may be a good principle, but it is impossible to follow it, in my opinion, under this amendment.

      <P>On behalf of Senator Dowdall I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 59, sub-section (5).  Before sub-section (5) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  Every scale made by the Board fixing the methods of charge or the rates of charge for electricity by a local authority which is an authorised undertaker shall be reconsidered by the Board at the expiration of each financial year of such local authority, and, if necessary, shall be revised and thereafter maintained so that, so far as is reasonably practicable, no contribution from the rates leviable by such local authority under this Act will be required for the purpose of defraying any expenses which such local authority may incur under this Act or otherwise in respect of its authorised undertaking during the next financial year; provided that the Board shall, in no case, make any scale whereby the charge for electricity used by such local authority for lighting or any other purpose shall be at a higher price than that charged to consumers using electricity for similar purposes and for the like hours of supply.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle underlying this amendment has been embodied in other orders in England under the Electricity Acts. The intention really is to secure that local undertakers shall be enabled to balance their budgets and that there should be no loss on any electricity undertaking.  The Bill provides for the revision of prices so as to balance expenditure and revenue.  As it stands, the section provides for the revision of the rates from time to time.  I suggest the section would be better if the amendment were accepted, so that at the end of every financial year there should be a consideration of all the charges in connection with rates.  They <Col N="1583" /> would be adjusted and not be a burden on the ratepayers to make up deficiencies on the electricity undertaking.</P>
    <P>The Minister, no doubt, will say there is a certain provision in a subsequent sub-section providing that as long as the scale is in force it shall not be lawful for any undertaking to charge a price over and above, but Section 71 provides that any deficiency in the undertaking may be made up out of the local rates.  It is to prevent such a deficiency being made up from the local rates that I think this amendment, or some modification of it, would be desirable. For example, I submit that it would be possible for an electricity undertaking to charge for lighting a town a smaller rate than it would charge for ordinary domestic lighting or other purposes.  If that were so, it would be possible to subsidise such a difference out of the rates and make good the deficiency by calling on the local ratepayers.  Such a situation has been made impossible under various Orders made in England.  The Chichester Electrical Special Order (1922) provides for revision of prices so as to balance revenue and expenditure:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The scale of prices charged for electrical energy under this Order shall be such that so far as is reasonably practicable no contributions from the rates of the city will be required for repaying the future expenses of the undertaking during the next three years.  There shall not be made against the district rate or any other rate for energy used by the undertaker for street lighting or any other purpose a charge at a higher price than that charged to consumers using energy for similar purposes and for the like hours of supply.</P>
    <P>In other words, what is suggested in the amendment here is that in no case shall the Board make a charge for electricity used by such local authority for lighting or any other purpose at a higher price than that charged to consumers using electricity for similar purposes and for the like hours of supply.  Under the Bill I would suggest that if a local undertaking so desired they could charge for street <Col N="1584" /> lighting a different rate from that charged for other lighting.  Very likely they would not do so, but there is a possibility, and if the amendment were accepted that would be impossible. There should be a uniform charge over all.  Then the suggestion that at the expiration of each financial year there will be a reconsideration by the Board would help the local undertaking to balance its budget and would ensure that the price would be adjusted each year, so that there would be no loss on the undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to be an important amendment, and this is the first time that I realised it is possible for deficiencies to be put on the rates.  I must blame myself for not reading this complicated Bill more carefully, but now it is apparent that part of the costs of the undertaking can be passed on to the ratepayers.  I wish the Minister would tell us the exact position.  I take it that it is entirely permissive on the part of a local authority to become an undertaker? There is no machinery by which a local authority can be forced to become an undertaker.  It is only when the local authority becomes an undertaker that the question of rates arises.  As long as the Board is the undertaker the rates are exempt.  To that extent the remedy, I suppose, is in the hands of the local authority?  It need not put its neck into the noose unless it likes, but one knows that in the case of local authorities the pill is always coated with sugar; they take on responsibility where there is a small grant attached, and before they know they find there is a very substantial burden on the rates.  That is a common experience.  If a local authority takes on an uneconomic scheme I do not know that this amendment will give much protection, because the rates may be entirely prohibitive.  The undertaking would certainly have to pay the capital charges, and it would mean prohibitive rates for electricity or an increase in the poor rate.  I hope the House will do its best to safeguard local authorities.  The answer to that, I suppose, is that if local authorities incur the obligations it is their own fault.</P>

      <P>The position under the Bill is that a local authority which is an authorised undertaker and not acquired keeps its present position. That is to say, that the rates may be called upon in an unremunerative year to bear the loss.  That is the present position, and I did not set out to change that.  Of course, this amendment is entirely in line with my principle in this whole matter.  My principle is that the service of electricity should be conducted neither at a loss nor to make money, but to make both ends meet.  The Board is empowered with regard to the allocation of the surplus to see that that goes back to the consumer.  This is the other side, that the local authorities shall not be allowed to charge an unremunerative rate and throw the loss on to the ratepayer.  I am quite in sympathy with the principle of the amendment.  I am not so much in sympathy with its drafting, particularly the proviso that &ldquo;the Board shall in no case make any scale whereby the charge for electricity used by such local authorities for lighting or any other purpose&rdquo;&mdash;that is a very big addition &mdash;&ldquo;shall be at a higher price than that charged to consumers using electricity for similar purposes and for the like hours of supply.&rdquo;  What the proviso is designed to meet is quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first phrase has crept into certain electricity orders in England at the request of gas undertakers who found themselves, as big ratepayers, mulcted in heavy losses where remunerative charges were not, in fact, being made by the undertakers of electricity.  Then, when the first part was put in, a gap was discovered, that by the local authority charging itself very heavily for electricity it would in fact have to increase the rates in order to meet the charges for electricity sold to itself. There was that loophole, but that loophole has been stopped without this proviso.  I have not had time to get the amendment considered in its drafting, but the principle is one with which I am in line.  It is the counter to no profit at all that there should be no loss at all.  But remember that if the House accepts the amendment it is definitely moving away from the position of the deficiency.  The undertaker, <Col N="1586" /> being a local authority, has at present power to charge the rates.  This only applies to what Senator Sir John Keane referred, a local authority running a statutory undertaking of its own.  Once the Board steps in the Board cannot change the rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>But what is the attitude of the Minister in regard to local authorities which may wish to become undertakers?  A county council, say, might be persuaded to go into electricity and might begin to borrow money which, presumably, they could get from the Board, and saddle themselves with a very heavy capital liability which they cannot meet because they may have miscalculated. Will the Board in any way guard against that, or will such local authorities be allowed to do what they like? People may not be taking current, and the charge might be 1/- or 1/6 per unit, or even in the famous Mallow case that we had two years ago, 2/1.  That is possible, and then the only remedy, presumably, would be the rates.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that any county council will be discouraged from doing or not allowed to do this.  Municipalities might have some justification for wanting to be undertakers.  Would the Minister give us any assurance to that effect?</P>

      <P>In relation to the first sentence in the amendment, is it intended that the Board shall have the right to revise every year the rate charged by a local authority?  In other words, is it intended that the Board should have power to come to Dublin and say: &ldquo;Your rate for the last year has been sixpence; next year, in view of all the circumstances, it is to be a shilling&rdquo;?  Is that what the amendment seeks to authorise?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If I might put the case of Kildare again, obviously if the Board decided to have anything to do with the Kildare undertaking it would immediately have to raise the Kildare rate.  The Kildare undertaking has been losing money from the start. I think there is no doubt that the rate would have to be raised.  But the necessity would be to prevent the ratepayers from subsidising the electricity undertaking in that town.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 61, sub-section (3).

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to meet a new point which emerged from a rather long amendment by Senator Hooper, moved by Senator Brady.  This amendment pays attention to the keeping open of a generating station for purposes of stand-by.  It refers to the authorised undertaker, with the consent and at the request of the Board, being bound to maintain a generating station, or any part thereof, for the purposes of the Board and at the expense of the Board, and then it continues &ldquo;which expense shall be taken into consideration in fixing the rates of charge for electricity for all areas for the benefit of which such generating station is maintained.&rdquo;  Then we get the case again of the Dublin undertaking being required, some part of the Dublin station scrapped, and the rest of it held open as a stand-by station. It would then be kept open at the expense <Col N="1589" /> of the Board, and the Board would recoup itself from the consumers of all areas for the benefit of which that generating station was being maintained. This meets the point raised in Senator Hooper's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRADY</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment, because it goes a considerable way towards meeting the objects which Senator Hooper had in view in the series of amendments which he tabled for the Committee Stage.  I am sorry he is not here to enjoy the reward of his labours, but he is unavoidably absent.  His object was to secure that if any portion of the undertaking were retained and used, that the benefit that would ensue from such retention would be charged to the people who enjoyed it.  For that reason the Senator is to be congratulated on obtaining a very substantial concession from the Minister, who only carried out the undertaking which he gave in Committee when he said it might be necessary to enlarge Section 61, so as to say that the liability of the generating station used as a stand-by should be transferred to those actually benefited by the stand-by service.</P>

      <P>This is the amendment I referred to when Senator Keane was speaking on the question of exemption from rates and taxes.  It has been explained what the position is in reference to income tax, and that position remains.  This is what I propose with regard to rates.  It puts the Board for the future in line with the present position of municipal authorised undertakings, which are so exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important matter.  The only argument the Minister vouchsafes for the amendment is that in the case of municipal undertakings rates are not charged on the electrical property of the municipality. It might be perhaps clearer and more business-like to do so, but it would be merely taking the money out of one pocket and putting it into the other. The Minister is making this electricity undertaking practically a State operation. <Col N="1591" /> There is to be a Board divorced altogether from municipalities although its property will be, of course, located all over the country within the area of county councils, municipalities, or urban authorities.  First of all we must look at it from the point of view that this is a commercial undertaking.  If we heard that once we have heard it thirty times.  But a municipal undertaking is not a commercial undertaking, &mdash;it is a public utility service.  This is going to be a commercial undertaking, and surely one of the first things it should do is to pay liabilities to the State and to the local authority.  Everybody has to do that.  We would be relieved of many anxieties in commerce if we had not to pay taxes or rates.</P>
      <P>This is a so-called commercial undertaking. Look at it from this point of view alone.  The Board takes power to go in and supersede an undertaker who can give a cheaper service.  But is the test fair?  It is going to supersede an undertaker&mdash;not necessarily a municipal undertaking&mdash;whose undertaking is paying the current rates.  This Board goes in, subsidised to the extent of the rates.  Of course it is not a fair test at all.  From every test the thing appears to be utterly unfair, and will create, moreover, a dangerous precedent. Where is it going to end&mdash;especially with this rapid extension of State enterprise&mdash;if you are going to exempt all those so-called commercial undertakings from contributions to local services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take County Clare, which is a poor county.  Clare has a very considerable property now established in the county.  The use of that property and all the attendant circumstances throw a charge on the local services. The people connected with it use the roads; the employees use the hospitals; they react on the poor law; and the whole of that undertaking is to be exempt from rates.  Is that just?  It is a question of &ldquo;all hands to the pumps.&rdquo;  At any cost this scheme must be passed over to the public&mdash;whether it is done by a dangerous precedent or sound finance does not matter.  The public has to bear it.  In this case the ratepayer, the small farmer in West <Col N="1592" /> Clare, has to subsidise this through free local services.  I really think it is time to cry halt to this wholly unprecedented way of proceeding.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes around in this spirit.  He goes to Canada, sees something there which he likes, and takes it out.  He ignores what he does not like. I know it may be said they do not pay rates in Canada&mdash;I believe they do not pay taxes.  He ignores the fact that the municipalities practically own the hydro-electric undertaking in Canada. He simply takes what he likes.  He goes to Sweden, and sees a State Board there, but he does not realise that there is another undertaking beside it which is commercial and that the two balance one another and create rivalry.  He takes all that suits him out of the various schemes all over the world and puts it in.  I really do ask the House to realise the danger of the precedent&mdash; the injustice to the rural population of this proposal.</P>

      <P>This amendment of the Minister once and for all blows sky-high his repeated allegation that this is a commercial undertaking.  It is commercial when it suits his argument to prevent Parliament having any effective control over it.  He argues that principle all the time, and it was a magnificent argument when it was sought to insert a fair wages clause yesterday.  The majority of bankers and brewers in the House rubbed their hands with glee and voted down the amendment, because we were going to have a grand concern run on strictly commercial lines.  Every commercial undertaking not only has its rights but its responsibilities.  Nobody would dream of calling a concern a &ldquo;commercial undertaking&rdquo; that is going to be exempt from income tax.  Obviously this is now to be exempt from rates.</P>

      <P>It is to be subsidised by the rates, but it is to be run on State funds for a start and is going to get a monopoly, and it cannot lose. It has a monopoly of what it retails or sells, and, consequently, can charge sufficient to make ends meet.  And this is the commercial undertaking we are told about.  It is only commercial, in the accepted sense, to the extent that there is no effective national authority in the country controlling it except a Board to be appointed by the Minister or the Executive Council.  It is a farce talking about it being a commercial undertaking in these circumstances. When the Minister says that he wants it run on commercial lines he is playing with words and trying to humbug the country and the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the people who quote me would quote me accurately when they pretend to give my actual words.  I said yesterday, and made this distinction, and clearly recognised this distinction, that this was not to be regarded as a commercial concern.  I reiterate that; it is not going to be regarded as a commercial concern.  The key note of a commercial concern is a concern doing business for profit making.  It is completely removed from that; it is to be run as a service for the benefit of the people of the country.  I always made the statement, and I continue to make it, that its management should be allowed to operate in the way that a commercial concern is managed.  There is quite a difference, and if anybody is hoodwinked Senator O'Farrell has hoodwinked himself by misquoting me.  I may say the whole electricity undertaking is not commercial in the sense that it is not run for profit.  I put it on the same footing as a municipal undertaking as regards exemption from rates, simply because it is on the same footing.  A municipal undertaking is exempt from rates because it was understood that if there was an <Col N="1594" /> undertaking in a particular area, serving the ratepayers in that area, to pay a contribution to the rates on such an undertaking would be only shifting the money from one pocket to the other. What is the Board going to do?  It is going to serve an aggregation of all the municipalities in the country, an amalgamation of all the municipal electrical concerns.  It is cutting out the profit-making concerns and buying them out on the basis of so many years' purchase of profits.  Thereafter it will stand in the position for the whole country of a single municipal undertaking and should be relieved on exactly the same principle.</P>
      <P>As to what I gathered from my visit to Canada, and as regards all those fantastic ideas which I am supposed to have brought back with me, if Senator Sir John Keane would not pay so much attention to the Sunday newspapers, and if he would confine himself to the arguments brought here and leave me to express my own imagination, if it is my imagination, we would get on much better.  I never even studied what happened in Canada in regard to the hydro-electrical undertaking, but I have certain information upon that point.  I do not agree that what the Senator said is a proper description of what happens in Canada, that the hydro-electrical undertaking there is owned by the municipality.  There is a Board which is elected by the Government, but they are trustees for the municipalities.  So will the Board be here.  They will be elected by the Government and will be trustees for the municipalities.  I put them on the same footing as a municipal undertaking.  They will be trustees and they will benefit the ratepayers in certain districts, and it would simply be shifting moneys about from one pocket to another to ask them to pay rates and then proceed to charge that to the electric consumers of the area.</P>

      <P>The Minister, I think, is not quite correct in his simile. He has compared this work, entered into for the benefit of the whole of Ireland, to a municipal undertaking which is for the benefit of the ratepayers in a particular municipality.  Now here we <Col N="1595" /> have works which are situated in the County Clare.  There is a tremendous lot of damage done in the County Clare where this concern is going.  Men engaged in these works call upon the hospitals; they use the roads which are maintained out of the rates, and they call for the assistance of a great many other public services which are rendered them by the definite locality. They act on the ground that this is a municipal or national undertaking and Clare should suffer this loss.  I do not think that is right.  As a matter of fact if this section is passed Clare will suffer considerable loss.  There is a considerable amount of property that will go to the Board and that at present pays rates in Clare.  That property is being acquired by the Board, and now, in future, it will pay no rates.  I do not think that is right.  I think that these works should pay rates to the immediate district in which they are situate, and which has incurred a considerable amount of expense in consequence of them.</P>

      <P>Really the Minister must be finding himself in a very tight corner when driven to the argument he has advanced, that this Board is to claim the benefits of a municipal undertaking when it ceases altogether to be a municipal undertaking. It abolishes all municipal undertakings and, having extinguished them, it claims to retain certain advantages that were peculiar to municipal undertakings. Does the House realise that the buildings in which we sit actually pay rates?  The whole of the Government offices pay rates.  Every bit of Government property pays rates.  The Civic Guard barracks pay rates, but here is an undertaking, which the Minister says, or does not say, is a commercial undertaking, though not a profit-earning undertaking, and it is to pay no rates.  The Minister applies one test of profit-earning.  Surely there are other tests&mdash;the test, for instance, of paying liabilities.  There is an expenditure side of a commercial account, and in what commercial account do you find the expenditure side exempt from liability to rates to pay for the services <Col N="1596" /> it receives from the local ratepayers? I think this is simply tantamount to confiscation, getting services free and simply passing them on to one section of the community, that is, the electrical consumers.</P>

Looking at the matter impartially, I think it is hardly fair to expect that localities in the counties of Clare and Limerick should be saddled with the expense and the responsibility of maintaining the public services required and with making roads in connection with the Shannon works, and that buildings erected in connection with the scheme should escape from the liability of paying rates.  The Minister says that the municipal undertakings have not to pay.  I do not think it is fair that the ratepayers in these two counties should be required to bear the expense of maintaining services such as roads, etc., in connection with the works which are to supply power all over the country without getting any compensating advantage.  This amendment is an afterthought, because a proposal of this kind was not embodied in the Bill as drafted originally.  Viewing the matter in an impartial way, I think a case has been made against the insertion of this amendment.  I think that the Seanad would be doing an injustice to the ratepayers in the counties of Limerick and Clare if it were to agree to the insertion of this amendment.</P>

      <P>The whole argument has proceeded so far on the lines that the counties of Limerick and Clare are the only counties in question.  Senator Barrington and Senator Sir John Keane have been the most able helpers. I have had to make the scheme a success and not to embarrass it in any way.  We got a contribution to-day from Senator Barrington about the rates in Limerick and in Clare and certain other things.  I ask: have these two counties got no benefits from the Shannon scheme to date that no other part of the country has not got?  Is the position to be that they are going to be allowed to have all the benefits and <Col N="1597" /> not have any small deductions made from what further benefits may hereafter come to them from the scheme? Senator Sir John Keane says that this building in which we are pays rates. It does as an act of grace, and if this amendment is passed the Board will be in exactly the same position as a Government Department is in at the present time.</P>

      <P>I cannot give any undertaking on behalf of the Board.  The same point will arise in connection with the Board as arises in the case of Government Departments in the matter of the payment of rates. Senator Farren spoke about the making of roads.  The roads that are there leading to the power-house we built ourselves under the Shannon scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The roads were impassable before work was ever started on the Shannon scheme.  If certain people in Limerick, of whom Senator Barrington is a good representative, had not been out to clutch everything they could from the Shannon scheme and had not taken up such a selfish attitude as they did at least one other industry would have been established there, but because of the grasping tendency displayed that advantage passed to another district.  What happened in Limerick compares adversely with what occurred in Carlow where the beet sugar factory has been established. Owing to the extravagant demands that were made, and the selfish attitude taken up by certain people in Limerick a particular industry did not go there.  A big number of transformer stations will be scattered all over the country.  Supposing a positive amendment is passed that there shall be a liability to pay rates it means that all over the country, where there is a transformer station settled on property which at any time paid rates, there is going to be a small contribution asked from the Board, and that small contribution will be charged to the consumers in the particular area served by <Col N="1598" /> the station.  That would be putting it in exactly the same position as the municipal undertaking.  With regard to the station at the Pigeon House in Dublin there is no demand made at the moment for the payment of rates because it is understood that a particular section of the ratepayers are getting benefit from it.  That is an argument that should also apply to the Shannon works.  With regard to the power-house at Limerick, there may have been a certain amount of damage done to property. Certain lands may have been taken.  There may have been hindrances and impediments, but if that has been the case there have been corresponding benefits conferred on this area by the scheme, benefits that are very much greater than anything that has been done in the way of harm to the people by taking any property away from them.  As to the rates on land in the County Clare which will be exempt they will be in exactly the same position as if a post office was built there. If the amendment is passed there will be nothing imposed by law to make a payment in lieu of rates.</P>

      <P>The Senator is so persistent that it may be necessary for me to write a letter to the &ldquo;Sunday Times&rdquo; in order to get to him.  If it is not put in, will the counties be in any better position than they are at the moment as regards Government Departments? <Col N="1599" /> They get a contribution in lieu of rates at present from Government Departments.  To make a contribution to local bodies in lieu of rates is not imposed on Government Departments, and they have no right to demand it.  It is simply an act of grace on the part of Government Departments to make such a contribution.  So far as that point is concerned, the Board will be in exactly the same position as a Government Department.  It will be exempt from the liability to pay rates.  The question of local services in Limerick and Clare has been stressed at great length by Senator Barrington. My answer to that is that the roads were torn up and remade with Government money in the form of special grants.  Applications were made to the Minister to repair certain roads that the lorries of Messrs.  Siemens Schuckert never once passed over.  These roads were torn up by the lorries of certain commercial firms in Limerick. These firms were obliged to put extra lorries on the road because of the extra trade brought to Limerick as a result of the Shannon scheme.  Because of the damage that these commercial lorries did to the roads we are to be asked to make that damage good and to pay for it.  The position seems to be that the people in Limerick want to take all the benefits arising from the operation of the Shannon scheme and to pay none of the costs.  That is Senator Barrington's idea of making a contribution towards local services.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister give us some proof of the statement that he has just made? According to my information, Limerick has derived little or no benefit from the works that are going on there in connection with the Shannon scheme, but rather an immense amount of inconvenience. Nearly all the goods consumed on the Shannon works are, I am informed, imported from Germany. German firms supply almost everything that is required, and I do not know that Limerick gains any advantage whatever.</P>

      <P>I am one of those quarrelless, inarticulate members who have done their best all through the debates to help the Minister, because we think it is everything for the country that this scheme should succeed.  But on this point I am not quite sure that there is any justice, as far as I understand it, in relieving the Shannon Board and, therefore, the consumer of electricity, from liability for some portion of the rates at the expense of those ratepayers who, presumably, do not consume electricity.  That is how the matter strikes me.  I waited in vain for any word from the Minister which would be a guide to me as to whether the passage of the Government's amendment is essential to the success of the scheme.  Can the Minister show us that if the Shannon undertaking is saddled with rates it will be so serious a matter that his project will in any way be endangered?  If he can show us that, I think we will have some grounds for assuming that there is no injustice in relieving it of rates and even saddling the ratepayers with some portion of the cost of the benefit that the consumer will receive, but so far we have not had any indication from the Minister that that is the case.  I think it would be a great help to those of us who are anxious to see the scheme a success if he could quietly and without heat, tell us exactly what his views are on that point.</P>

      <P>I think there may be an injustice to the ratepayers involved in the amendment, but the amount at stake is very small.  Rates would only have to be paid, except in the case of Limerick, for transformer stations at the various centres.  These are small things and the amount of rates cannot, in the aggregate, be very large.  The only place where I think the rates would be levied to any large amount would be Limerick.  Unlike Senator Barrington, I think that Limerick has got, and will get, considerable benefits in the future, from this scheme as a set-off against the rates.  I should like the Minister to state whether the amount involved, excluding Limerick, is large.  It is probably extremely small.</P>

      <P>My argument has been misunderstood.  The Senator said something in regard to a contribution for rates.  I simply said that if this was passed the Board would be in the position of a State department and then might give this contribution in lieu of rates.  Senator Guinness has asked if the amount involved would be large.  The amount involved in the case of the station in Clare would be a very big amount, and the law would have to be changed, because the particular method of assessment on a hydro-electrical station would simply leave the hydro-electrical station burdened with a huge cost.  Taken in comparison with other wealth-producing things&mdash;buildings erected around mines, even a coal electrical station&mdash;the hydro-electrical station would run to about four times the amount they would have to pay. Then, in addition, considerable property will be scattered all over the country.  There will be several sub-stations erected all over the country and the rates on these stations would be very considerable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much surprised at the efforts made by a section in this House to load the scheme with every possible expense that can be put upon it.  The very genesis of the scheme was to make up the great leeway that existed in this country, both from a manufacturing point of view and the point of view of science as applied to the agricultural industry, and our backwardness generally, as a country in competition with our neighbours That was what induced the Government at the time to take their courage in their hands, and to inaugurate this scheme and supply cheap power in this country in order to induce capital from abroad to come here and possibly to stimulate the investment of native capital, of which there is a very large amount lying in the banks, and to induce the establishment of industries in this country, because industries will follow.  Manufacturers will come to any country&mdash;capital is very mobile&mdash;if they have an assurance of cheap and continuous power and if the transport facilities and loading facilities at the ports are of a proper kind.  Capital will be induced to come from outside and establish itself here.  That was the whole impulse, the whole consideration and argument that induced the Government, at the time, to take their courage in their hands and to give a forward impulse in this way to our position by establishing the Shannon works and by providing cheap power.  They also felt that it would free us from the risks that we have hitherto incurred of the coal supply, on which manufacturers are dependent, being cut off, and the whole manufacturing industries being brought to a standstill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is argued that works erected under the scheme should be liable to rates. Where is the ratepayers' grievance? Before this scheme was set on foot the works were not there and no rates were being paid, because the buildings or the distributing or transforming plant were not in existence.  This is a new asset created by the people out of their own resources.  The taxpayer is taxed for this scheme, and its development throughout the Free State.  That money has to come out of the Central Fund, and is collected from the taxpayers. <Col N="1603" /> All these works are being newly erected, and the municipalities or the local rate striking bodies derived no rates from these works before they existed.  These works have been brought into existence by the present scheme, and the municipalities put in a plea that rates should be paid on these works and buildings.  Take the biggest end of the construction&mdash;the works and buildings in Clare and Limerick&mdash; is it fair that the ratepayers there should benefit so inordinately out of proportion to the ratepayers in other parts of the community?  Take it that 50 or 60 per cent. of the work in connection with the whole scheme is established in Limerick.  Are the ratepayers there for all time, in addition to the great benefits they have been deriving from the work done in their area, to reap the benefit of this very great rate that is going to be put on that 60 per cent., while the ratepayers in other parts of Ireland who will have to contribute to the upkeep of the scheme will have no corresponding benefit?</P>
    <P>What I take umbrage at is, that, having put our shoulders to the wheel, and having applauded the initiation of this scheme, which proposes to use our own resources and cut ourselves clear from our dependence on the English coal supply, I am surprised to find right through the discussion, and in connection with nearly all amendments tabled here, the Minister seems to be harassed at every point.  There seems to be a disposition now to load the scheme with every liability that can be dragged <Col N="1604" /> in.  It seems to me that some Senators would like to see the scheme a failure. That is the impression left on one's mind by the trend of the arguments. Some members apparently hope that the scheme will eventually be a disaster. It will either be a white elephant, of the whitest possible description, or it will be brilliant success. It can only be a brilliant success by giving it every opportunity and by everybody helping in this great national venture.  It is rather unworthy to stress these matters further, particularly on the lines on which they are being stressed, namely, by vague general attacks which, when analysed, are seen to be full of discrepancies.</P>

      <P>I intended to reply to Senator the Earl of Wicklow, but I think that the answer given to Senator Guinness would cover his point. The burdens would be considerable, and they would be relieved in some way by the charges to the consumers.  There is a big property at Ardnacrusha, and it will be rated in a particular way. The method of assessment is such that hydro-electric stations have to pay four times more than fuel-using stations. There are, in addition, numerous subsidiary buildings throughout the State. There will be a main transformer building and all sorts of sub-stations. Everything, even the very poles, will have to be assessed for rating purposes, if rates have to be paid.</P>

(1) The Executive Council may by order transfer from the Minister or the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland (in this section referred to as the Commissioners) respectively to the Board all or any of the functions, powers, and duties conferred or imposed by or under any statute on the Minister or the Commissioners (as the case may be) in relation to the care or conservancy of the navigation or the drainage of the River Shannon or any tributary thereof or of works constructed for the improvement of such navigation or drainage, and any such order may transfer all or any of such functions, powers, and duties in relation either to the whole or to any particular parts or part of the said river or any tributary thereof.</P>

      <P>(3)  Whenever any functions, powers, or duties are transferred to the Board by an order under this section the Executive Council may by the same or any subsequent order authorise and require the Board to exercise and perform all or any of such functions, powers, and duties in relation to all or any of the canals, locks, wharves, piers, landing places, quays, or other works constructed by the Minister under the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925 (No. 26 of 1925), and upon such order being made the works to which such order relates shall be deemed to be included in the works in relation to which such functions, powers, and duties are exercisable by virtue of the statute by which the same were created and such statute (with such modifications, if any, as are specified in such order) shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>

    <P>(5)  Whenever any functions, powers, or duties are transferred from the Commissioners to the Board by an order under this section the Executive Council may by the same or any subsequent order transfer from the services of the Commissioners to the service of the Board any person employed by the Commissioners in relation to or for the purpose of the exercise or performance of such functions, powers, or duties, and every person so transferred shall thereupon become and be a servant of the Board upon the same terms as to remuneration and superannuation, pension or gratuity (if any) as those on which he was employed by the Commissioners immediately before such transfer and shall for the purpose of such superannuation, pension or gratuity (if any) be entitled to reckon his period of service with the Commissioners as service with the Board.</P>
    <P>(6)  Whenever any functions, powers, or duties are transferred from the Commissioners to the Board by an order under this section the Executive Council may by the same or any subsequent order impose on the Board the obligation to pay as from the date of such order any pension which at the date of such order is payable by the Commissioners to a person formerly employed by the Commissioners in relation to or for the purpose of the exercise or performance of such functions, powers, and duties, and thereupon the Board shall become and be liable to indemnify the Commissioners against <Col N="1608" /> all and every liability in respect of such pension as from the date of such order.</P>
    <P>(7)  An order made by the Executive Council under this section transferring any functions, powers or duties from the Commissioners to the Board may be expressed and if so expressed shall operate to require the Board to keep a separate account in relation to the exercise by it of the functions and powers and the performance by it of the duties to which such order relates and may be expressed and if so expressed shall operate to require that the functions, powers and duties to which such order relates be exercised and performed by officers and servants of the Board employed by it solely in relation to such functions, powers and duties.</P>
    <P>(8)  Every order made by the Executive Council under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if either such House shall, within twenty-one days after the first day on which it sits after such order is laid before it, pass a resolution annulling such order, such order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>

Sub-section (3) is an enlargement of what was in the previous section, 104, and is really a continuation of sub-section (2). Sub-section (4) is an addition, vesting not merely the powers, duties and functions, but it also transfers and vests the property which the Board of Works previously had.  Sub-section (5) deals with the staffs, and it transfers them, preserving all their existing rights with regard to pay, pension etc.  Sub-section (6) is a technical point.  It is an enlargement of one of the points in sub-section (5). Sub-section (7) deals with the Order transferring the powers, duties and functions, and it provides that the Board can be ordered to keep a separate account of the functions and powers handed over.  The last section embodies a provision I promised, that the Order would have to come before both Houses of the Oireachtas, and on an adverse vote by either House the transfer could not be completed.</P>

      <P>These are very important sub-section and raise a lot of very new contentious matter.  If no proceedings could be taken effectively under this new sub-section unless and until the Orders have been confirmed by the Oireachtas, is there any pressure about them?  Might it not be better to make them the subject-matter of a special Bill?  They are exceedingly complicated, and I understand they are not to be put into operation until the Orders made under them are laid before the Oireachtas and sanctioned by them. There will not be very much opportunity for doing that for a considerable time.  I understand the Minister has to <Col N="1610" /> bring in supplementary legislation for other purposes in connection with this Bill.  Might it not be better to leave over this contentious matter until then?</P>

      <P>There is no need rehearsing my objections to the removal of this authority over the Shannon from the Board of Works, for since I moved my previous amendment the Minister has made it clear that it is at the instigation of the Board of Works this section has been introduced. I think it must be generally admitted that this provision as inserted in the Bill was rather immature and did not take into account the difficulties of the transfer.  It has to be met by the carefully prepared section the Minister has put before us to-day.  I may say that since I heard it was at the instance of the Board of Works the change was to be made I tried to think out an amendment necessary for this section.  I may say the Minister has done a great deal towards meeting me.  There is a section of the work regarding which I think a more stringent regulation should be placed on the Board than at present. For instance, I think they should be prohibited from raising the level of Lough Derg above the level which was contemplated in the reports of the experts and of the contractors themselves. I think they should not be allowed to lower the level of Lough Derg below a certain level which will permit of the navigation being carried on by boats of the class of the Grand Canal Company. That, I think, will be readily agreed to, because it was recommended by the <Col N="1611" /> Royal Commission over which Mr. Allport presided that the navigation level might be lowered two feet.  The Commission over which I was chairman came to the same conclusion, that two feet would be an advantage from the point of storage, so there can be no possible reason against inserting such a provision.  I am particularly anxious that there should be a limit to the power of the Board in raising the water level, because to my mind there will be a great temptation for them to do so. One of the defects I consider most glaring in the Shannon scheme is one of storage capacity.  The only means of increasing that is by raising the water level.</P>

I think, as I read them out, we may concur, whether he approves of them or not.  &ldquo;The Electricity Supply Board shall be the Conservancy Board for the Shannon and its tributaries.&rdquo;  I think that is covered by the Minister's amendment.  &ldquo;It shall take over the duties, liabilities and control of drainage, navigation and fisheries in the catchment basin of the River Shannon, at present vested in or under the care of the Commissioners of Public Works.&rdquo;  That is covered also.  For these duties it shall be responsible to the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I believe, as a matter of fact, that the Board of Works are under the authority of the Minister for Finance at present.  That is really a matter of adjustment.  My view is that these works in connection with conservancy will be perfectly exposed to view.  It will make annual reports which will have to be laid before the Parliament year by year.  &ldquo;It shall make annual reports to the Minister for submission to the Dáil and Seanad.&rdquo;  I think that is included. &ldquo;Separate accounts shall be kept of the conservancy receipts and expenditure <Col N="1612" /> and of the electricity supply. These shall be laid before both Houses.&rdquo; The staff of the conservancy shall be separate from the electricity supply staff.  The Board may lower the navigation of Lough Derg two feet.</P>

      <P>Could I not have the alternative of postponing these two clauses until a small Bill is brought in?  The Government amendment is an admission that Section 104 was the result of immature and ill-considered legislation to remove the control of the Shannon conservancy from the Commissioners of Public Works.  The legislation of the last 80 or 90 years is to be repealed on the Report Stage of the Electrical Supply Bill.  That such a clause should have passed through all its stages in the Dáil without challenge passes my comprehension.  No hint was given until the Minister spoke on my amendment of the reasons for the introduction of this clause.  The principal reason appears to be that the Commissioners of Public Works had come to the conclusion they could no longer be responsible for the conservancy of the Shannon in regard to drainage, navigation or fisheries.  If Section 104, even as amended by the Government, is allowed to stand, no control of the regulation of the Shannon will exist. There will be nothing to prevent the Electricity Board from raising the level of the Shannon to any level they desire, or of lowering it to any level. All that the Board need say is that, in the interests of the electric supply, they consider it the best thing to be done, and that they are fortified in this <Col N="1613" /> opinion by the experts, who considered it the most economical thing to do.  The readiness with which the design, as submitted to Parliament, has been departed from already should be a warning to the Seanad to hesitate in granting these powers without due information and consideration.  The improvement of inland navigation, which so fascinated the people of Limerick, has been abandoned; the site of the weir at O'Brien's Bridge has been moved up the river 1½ miles, consequent on imperfect preliminary investigations; portions of the embankments around Lough Derg are to be abandoned, and additional land flooded, the flooded land being bought at a valuation.  I consider it an unfortunate outrage that such legislation should be forced on the Seanad in the Report Stage of the Bill. I would ask the House to accept my amendment and simply delete Section 104.  If the Government then consider it necessary they can bring in a considered Bill to disendow the Commissioners of Public Works of the conservancy of the Shannon and all their obligations and transfer them to the Electricity Supply Board.  If they took that course I am perfectly sure it would receive the support that I tried to give to all the proposals of this Bill. I feel strongly that we have been treated harshly by having this long amendment thrust upon us at the very end of our work without really time for most of the Senators to understand the clause.  I scarcely think half of us who read the clause through understand its full meaning.  For those reasons I ask the Seanad to impress on the Minister to seek a postponement of the legislation necessary to transfer the conservancy of the Shannon from the Board of Works to this Board for electricity supply.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 33:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 104.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  It shall be the duty of the Board to take all such steps as may be necessary to put into and maintain in an efficient condition for navigation by barges of 180 tons the channel leading from the head race at Ardnacrusha to the navigable waters of the Shannon at Sarsfield Bridge, Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rise with a considerable amount of diffidence to propose this amendment, because, to a shy and nervous man like myself, the intimidatory attitude the Minister assumes towards any suggestion which other people regard as an improvement is very embarrassing.  I never had any desire to hamper the Bill, but every desire to amend it.  I never differed with the Minister as to the desirability of carrying out the Shannon works, but we have a serious divergence of opinion as to the methods he adopted to do so.  My whole desire is that the Bill should pass with the utmost advantage to the country at large and with the minimum of injury. There are a great many points on which we differ, but I do not think the Minister treated me fairly in pillorying <Col N="1617" /> me the way he did a short time ago for supporting Senator Sir John Keane. In order that the Seanad should understand the position with regard to navigation, I think it will be desirable, in the first place, to read what the Minister himself said when he was introducing this Bill.  I should preface that by saying that while things were in the hands of the British Treasury they occasionally economised in a way which we did not think desirable.  For example, they commenced works connected with drainage with the best intention, and they did not finish them. The connection between the canal at Limerick and the deep water at Limerick was never completed.  This is the way in which the Minister described the position at the introduction of the scheme:</P>
    <P>With regard to navigation, the present position is more or less this.</P>
    <P>He then proceeds to describe the course of the navigation and goes on:</P>
    <P>The limitations of that third side canal (at Corbally Mills) are what have obstructed navigation on the Shannon up to this.</P>
    <P>Now, those words, &ldquo;up to this,&rdquo; had a particular significance.  The obstruction existed there, and he got his Bill on the understanding that he was going to remove the obstruction.  He describes the position in this way:</P>
    <P>Towards the end of its course here the barge meets with the point where the canal discharges into the Abbey River.  That Abbey River again discharges into the Shannon to meet the two bridges, Matthew Bridge and Balls Bridge. The position with regard to these two bridges is that they have been built so low that only at neap tide is it possible for an 80-ton barge to get access to the river.  It can only get access to the river in one hour out of the twelve, and not even then, one hour out of every twelve.  There are certain seasons in which there is no access to the river, and the risk is so great that the owners of the barges will not take cargoes down unless prohibitive rates for insurance are paid.</P>
    <P>There are several alternatives set <Col N="1618" /> out in the experts' report with regard to the future, under the new conditions.</P>
    <P>The Minister then goes on to describe proposed new works, and traces the passage of a barge:</P>
    <P>It proceeds to O'Brien's Bridge, and it is then diverted into the power canal, and by means of a ship's hoist is lowered to the tail race level.  It proceeds along the tail race water, sailing beyond the point where the Abbey River flows down towards the junction with the side canal already spoken of.  It then passes along the bed of the river, passes Thomond Bridge, which, for this purpose, has to be equipped with a swivel-bridge, and gets its exit through Sarsfield Bridge, also equipped with a swivel-bridge, to the ocean harbour.</P>
    <P>That was the Minister's proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No; that was one of the alternatives.  Did I say anything about the alternatives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister went on:</P>
      <P>So that, so far as navigation is concerned, you have the position that, instead of there being a very dangerous passage for 80-ton barges down to the junction of the side canal with the Abbey River, and an almost impossible passage below these two bridges down to Limerick, you have the position that barges of 150 tons can go down the river from Athlone, pass through the power canal, and be taken into the ship's hoist, left in the tail-race and proceed along the tail-race through Thomond Bridge and Sarsfield Bridge and actually moor at the side of ocean-going vessels.  That is the alternative.  The power scheme has nothing to do with navigation as such, but certain things occur in it which are incidentally good for navigation, and these have been improved upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister then proceeds to mention what has to be done, and he points out that if the navigation is to take the old course there would have to be built into the weir at O'Brien's Bridge a new <Col N="1619" /> lock which he estimated would cost £20,000.  He says:</P>
    <P>So that by interfering with the river for the purpose of power production there would necessarily be incurred a charge of about £20,000. The experts have considered that if the alternative method by which they are to have a ship's hoist put in which is purely for navigation purposes is adopted the power scheme should bear the cost of that to the extent of £20,000, which it would otherwise have to expend on the provision of this lock in the weir at O'Brien's Bridge.</P>
    <P>The Minister proceeds to describe what the ship's hoist would cost, and he mentions:</P>
    <P>Navigation will be charged with £75,000, that is, £95,000 minus the £20,000 which will be charged on the power scheme for the lock facility at O'Brien's Bridge.</P>
    <P>He has abandoned all that on the experts' advice, and he is leaving us with the old defective canal.  He leaves us with this navigation, which he has pointed out was never efficient and never could be efficient.  He is, apparently, putting the £20,000 which was intended for the lock at O'Brien's Bridge to the credit of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he is not; he is putting it into the navigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>In Limerick we think that this is a very unsatisfactory position.  We thought that what the Minister described as a very defective state of affairs &ldquo;up to this&rdquo; should be remedied, and we expected him to carry out the promise which he gave over and over again to improve the navigation so that the barges could come down and moor alongside ocean-going vessels.  There is a very small portion of the river to be dealt with. The Minister is proposing to make the Abbey River navigable as far as the canal lock.  Once the boats get to that position he proposes that they should ascend to the canal harbour by means of the ordinary lock which is at present there.  He is, apparently, overlooking the fact that it is only at certain stages <Col N="1620" /> of the tide that can be done.  The right thing to do is to improve the few hundred yards of the Abbey River running from the canal harbour to where it connects again with the Shannon at the Custom House.  Improvements could be effected on that portion of the river which would enable the barges to get alongside the sea-going ships instead of having to stop at the canal harbour.  That was the proposal originally put forward, and it was on those grounds that the Minister got the Bill.  Changes have taken place in the meantime without outside people being made aware of the fact.</P>
      <P>It was at least expected that Limerick, through the first native Government the people have had for many years, would have been treated in a better way than it was treated under the British Government.  I happen to know that the improvement I have mentioned could be made with the money saved in connection with the lock at O'Brien's Bridge.  It is an improvement which, if carried out, would permit practically the entire internal navigation of Ireland to be brought into direct connection with sea-going vessels at Limerick.  The Minister gave us statistics as to the amount of navigation likely to pass, and he mentioned the traffic passing along there.  How could traffic pass along there in face of the obstacles he so well described and that I have described? What traffic will pass through it with the Shannon scheme in operation is quite another matter.  I ask the Minister to approach this matter not by way of intimidating me or anybody who tries to get a slight improvement made, but in a broad-minded manner.  I ask him to carry out the scheme which was originally outlined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>All this can be answered very briefly.  It is not the duty of any native Government to charge the rest of the country for the carrying out of an improvement at Limerick.  The Senator has read a whole series of statements of mine having regard to one alternative proposed by the experts.  My conclusion was that whichever of these alternatives was to be adopted depended on <Col N="1621" /> what the people were prepared to pay for.  The people interested in navigation there have told us that they are not prepared to pay even a small sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister knows that when he speaks of navigation, the people concerned with navigation are really the Government themselves?  They own the canal.  As regards the people who have been running barges from Dublin to Limerick, it is idle to ask them to pay this cost. The Government own the Shannon navigation and, of course, the Minister has the decision in his own hands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have asked the people who mainly use the canal to make some contribution, and those people are not prepared to pay even a small sum.  The Grand Canal Company operate fully eighty per cent. of the traffic on that stretch.  I cannot see how a Bill dealing with electricity supply can seek to throw it upon the Board to make certain constructional changes in the Shannon works which were not inserted in the 1925 Act.  This, I hold, is an amendment to the 1925 Act and not to this Bill.</P>

The Minister knows perfectly well, and everybody else knows, that the price that will be charged in future will not depend so much upon the amount which is expended as upon the demand for electricity. It is not on the capital expenditure. The capital expenditure involved in this change would be trifling; it would be infinitely more than covered by the £20,000 which they say they will save. If they increase the demand for electricity they will reduce the price.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister the other day whether the navigation would be from Lough Derg to the portion of the river which ocean-going vessels can reach, when the electricity scheme has been completed.  The Minister said, certainly, for 180-ton barges.  Now, so far as I can understand it, he is saying something totally different.  There is, I believe, a stretch of river which is unnavigable, and which, unless it is made navigable, will prevent 180-ton barges going down to meet the ships.  If, on the other hand, it means that this can only happen once in a while, when the tide is in, and for one hour in the day, I do not consider that efficient navigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the only navigation there is.  What I did say to the Senator is a matter I would like to deal with now.  If I led the House to believe that barges of 180 tons would go through the tail-race from the power house, through the Abbey River and down to the harbour, that is wrong. Barges of 180 tons can go into the canal harbour, but from that on the navigation is as it was.  We are not interfering with the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is contrary to what the Minister said the other day.  I asked him could I understand there will be navigation in future for barges from Lough Derg to the sea-going ships, and for what tonnage.  He said, certainly, the navigation would be from Lough Derg to the sea-going ships for 180-ton barges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was the impression created it is not quite correct.  I think the argument now is entirely on another footing; it deals with present conditions, and how far they are being disimproved.  If I did indicate that 180-ton barges can go down that stretch from the canal harbour to the ocean-going vessels, then I want to disabuse the minds of Senators on that point.  That is not so.  I would like a ruling on this point.  There is an amendment that it shall be the duty of the Board to take steps to maintain in an efficient condition the channel leading from the head race.  That is not in the construction of the Shannon <Col N="1623" /> works.  It was one of the alternatives which the navigation people have rejected. The Shannon works will be handed over to the Board in a state that will not allow of this.  Is the amendment a proper one for an Electricity (Supply) Bill?  It was a proper one for the Bill dealing with the construction of the scheme.</P>

I think that that could be changed.  In order to remedy the position I suggest that the Minister should accept the words, instead of &ldquo;not less than five,&rdquo;&ldquo;not more than five,&rdquo; because that is what he intends, that this two years' service would be paid on the basis of a lump sum.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In giving reasons for this amendment I am also giving reasons for amendment 2, which is practically consequential. Under the provisions of the Bill the shares of this Corporation are <Col N="1630" /> guaranteed, both as to payment of a dividend of 5 per cent. and as to the capital repayment in the event of liquidation by the State.  Certificates of charge can also be issued, which are also guaranteed by the State.  There will be, in addition, depositors and certain other creditors of the Corporation who have no guarantee.  It seems to me, in view of the fact that these people&mdash;and quite properly&mdash;have no guarantee, that it is not wise to leave out the word &ldquo;Limited.&rdquo;  I may point out that banks, in many cases, are unlimited, at any rate as far as note issue is concerned.  If you leave out the word &ldquo;Limited,&rdquo; as this Bill does, you may legitimately make a depositor or creditor of this Corporation think, in view of the guarantee which the Government is giving as to the shares, that it is unlimited, and that he really has a State guarantee.  For that reason I am strongly of the opinion&mdash; and I know that quite a number of Senators with whom I have discussed it are of the same opinion&mdash;that it is a mistake.  I am satisfied it will not injure the Corporation in any way to have the word &ldquo;Limited&rdquo; after its name, as is usual in most companies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;and (except in the winding-up of the Corporation) shall be so repayable only out of moneys which are profits as ascertained in accordance with directions of the Minister and in the winding-up of the Corporation shall be so repayable after the creditors of the Corporation have been paid in full.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1632" /> This is an important amendment which I had better explain as best I can.  I have already pointed out on a previous amendment that creditors and depositors have no State guarantee for the moneys which the Corporation hold. The shareholders have a guarantee that 5 per cent. will be paid on their shares. The Bill provides that, if in any year the profits of the Corporation do not reach a sufficient sum to pay 5 per cent., the Minister for Finance, as soon as he is satisfied that these profits have not been made, will advance to the Corporation sufficient money to enable them to pay 5 per cent. to the shareholders. An ordinary limited company would not be allowed by law to pay a dividend unless it made profits&mdash;it could not pay a dividend out of its capital.  This section, as it stands in the Bill, provides that the Minister, having made those various payments to make up the 5 per cent., may, nevertheless, claim on demand, at any time that he thinks fit, and with such interest as he wishes to charge, repayment of those moneys which he has advanced to the Corporation to pay the dividend.  I submit that that is a perfectly proper procedure, if it is repaid out of their profits, but that it would not be a proper proceeding if it is repaid out of the assets of the Corporation.  Further, in the event of liquidation, I do not think that the Minister should be entitled to get this money repaid to him until the depositors have been paid in full, because depositors and other creditors, not having any State guarantee, naturally believe that they have all the assets of the Corporation as their security, and it would, I think, be quite wrong if it should work out, in the event of the Corporation being liquidated, that the Minister should be repaid what he had advanced as dividends out of the moneys of the depositors or of the creditors.</P>

      <P>(2)  At least one of the three directors to be nominated by the Minister under the preceding sub-section shall be so nominated by him after consultation with the General Council of County Councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are hopeful that this Bill will be a very great success, and therefore there should not be in the conditions attached to the administration or otherwise anything that would militate against it.  The General Council of County Councils had the draft Bill under discussion, and in order to ensure the public good-will that we hope will be behind the measure and the confidence and support of those who are directly to benefit by it, they are disposed to think that the personnel of the Board should be very closely looked into.  They are afraid that the agricultural industry will scarcely find due representation on the Board.  Their suspicions in that direction have been aroused by the tone of the report of the Banking Commission and certain <Col N="1634" /> references made therein, and also the proposition as to the method of administration in connection with the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society.  The administration of that society was not a very popular one.  With all the merits of the scheme under which it operated, it did not succeed in distributing its benefits over a very wide area.  After thirty years or so of existence it only succeeded in establishing 34 parish credit societies.</P>
    <P>Many members of the General Council of County Councils had experience of the working of those credit societies in their localities, and, because of the personnel, and a certain attitude taken up by members of that body, those who might have benefited were rather slow to accept the advantages offered to them.  The Executive of the General Council had this matter under consideration.  They thought that the Minister would be well advised, in the absence of an advisory council of agriculture, to make one concession to the agricultural community through this General Council, which is about the only body I suppose that can claim to be thoroughly representative of the agricultural industry in the country at the moment.  They hoped the Minister would take them into counsel, so far as one of his nominations to the Board is concerned.</P>
    <P>The General Council of County Councils is a very old establishment, and has received statutory recognition under various Acts of Parliament.  It has received such a recognition under the University Act, and under the Acts of 1902 and 1925, there are certain authorisations given to the General Council, so that in a sense it is a statutory body.  The Minister would be well advised to take that body into consultation, in so far at least as one of his nominations is concerned. There is a precedent for that in connection with another Department of State.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health consulted the General Council in connection with the setting up of the Roads Advisory Board.  They nominated five members and the Minister accepted four.  I think a body of that sort is useful to the Minister, and would get him more <Col N="1635" /> backing through the country if he worked in with it, and would give an impetus in a matter like this.  It would also make for more harmony and good-will and better understanding, because it would bring the Minister into closer touch with the very people that he wants to avail of the benefits of a measure like this.</P>

    <P>(a)  to any person for the purpose of purchasing land for agricultural purposes;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:-</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (a), to delete lines 57 and 58.</P>
      <P>The House will remember that in speaking on the Bill yesterday I brought forward an objection to the power contained in paragraph (a) of this sub-section, which gives the new Corporation power to lend money to any person for the purchase of land for agricultural purposes.  I pointed out that that was giving a power to which the Banking Commission, on which I served, had strongly objected. They gave it as their opinion that there was no reason whatever for any new plan or provision designed to furnish the buyer or the owner of land with credit for or as a means of financing such purchase.  This is almost the only instance in which there is a direct conflict between the Bill, as now introduced, and the report of the Commission. I also said that from my experience of banking, especially in the last ten years, it would be a very injudicious thing indeed to give a new Corporation, endowed with State funds, any power to lend a farmer or anybody wishing to purchase land money for the purpose of new purchases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> Every bank in the Free State, as far as my experience goes, has been only too willing to lend money to people who propose to purchase land, provided they have got some money themselves. The result has been that when times were good and people were eager to get farms offered for sale, several intending purchasers went to the auctioneer's room, each of them probably backed by a bank.  Keen bidding followed, with the result that the price of farms was forced up to a figure making them a very bad purchase for those eventually getting them.  The price may be all right at the time of the purchase, but in view of what we know now as regards the fall that has taken place in the prices for agricultural produce, such a practice as that is a very dangeous one for the buyer and the banks and everyone connected with the transaction.  The reason why I have put down this amendment is that I think it would be better for this new Corporation not to meddle with such cases.  They will have enough to deal with the purchase of land in other ways: to facilitate purchases in connection with their own banking business. I think it would be better if, in dealing with this amendment, we were also to take amendments 10 and 12, because they are all part and parcel of the same thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so. Amendments 10 and 12 would be consequential on the Senator's present amendment being accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>If the House accepts this amendment and relieves the Corporation from what I look on as a very great responsibility, namely, the right to lend money to new purchasers to buy land, I think it would be desirable. Of course in their ordinary banking business they will need to have the right and the power to deal in land, and this is a matter that is dealt with in the other two amendments. Amendment 10, which I also move, reads:-</P>
      <P>Section 12, sub-section (1).  Before paragraph (e) to insert a new paragraph as follows:-</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e)  to any person (other than a <Col N="1638" /> co-operative society) for the purpose of purchasing for agricultural purposes land which was immediately before the purchase comprised in a security held by the Corporation from the vendor of such land.</P>
    <P>When the Corporation take over a loan they will very likely take over the land of the man making the application as security.  Supposing that individual does not succeed in his business, and that the Corporation have to realise their security then they will have to sell this land that they hold as security.  They may have an excellent new client who will be quite willing to purchase the land, and he probably will have some money to help him in making the purchase.  They will have to lend to him the balance of money that he will need to clear their debt and to realise their security.  That is a thing a bank frequently has to do: to lend money to a new client in order to realise their security.  Amendment 12, which I am moving with the other two, reads:-</P>
    <P>Section 12, sub-section (1).  Before paragraph (f) to insert a new paragraph as follows:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(f)  to any person (other than a co-operative society) for the purpose of paying off a loan which was originally made to him before the passing of this Act wholly or mainly for the purpose of purchasing land for agricultural purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Coropration, in the course of their business, will have undoubtedly to take over loans from other banks.  Let us take the case where they take over a loan.  Supposing a bank has got security on land and that they have as much money advanced on that land as they ought to lend, then the Corporation may see that under this new arrangement which the Bill gives that they could lend more.  For instance, they might take a chattel mortgage, but they would not lend on a chattel mortgage unless they got the security of the land which the bank has.  They will be in the position that they must lend their clients enough money to clear off the existing claims on the land <Col N="1639" /> so that they may be able to take over the land themselves.  That is a necessary part of the carrying on of their ordinary business.  In neither of these cases would the Corporation come in. The Banking Commission, in their report, objected to the lending of money to new purchasers as a single transaction so as to increase the number of bidders at a sale of land.  That is a thing that should not be done.  It is a bad thing to have competitors for a client forcing up the price of land, because then the buyer will undoubtedly get a bad bargain.  I hope that the Seanad will adopt the three amendments that I have moved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the House is agreed to discuss the three amendments together.  I am in agreement with the first and second amendment but the third amendment to my mind is of an altogether different nature.  In my opinion it would enable to be done what Senator Jameson deliberately said on the Second Reading of the Bill he did not wish to be done. He did not wish to have transferred to this Corporation what one may call debts which have been incurred by banks, debts which they knew themselves from the circumstances that have arisen to be more or less bad debts. That is my point of view, even though it may be a completely wrong point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might explain. A Minister, I understand, has not the right to put in an amendment on the Committee Stage, and I asked Senator Jameson to put down that amendment, and for this reason: I think it is useful that the Corporation should be enabled to make a loan to liquidate another loan already made. That is one state of affairs.  It is another state of affairs to make a loan to liquidate a bad debt, and as far as I know it was never suggested that the Corporation should do anything of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (e) of Section 12 states that an advance of money may be made &ldquo;to any person ...for the purpose of paying off a <Col N="1640" /> loan which was originally made to him (whether before or after the passing of this Act) wholly or mainly for a purpose for which a loan could under this section be made to him under this section by the Corporation.&rdquo;  Assume that a man in the year 1922 borrowed from a joint stock bank a sum of £3,000, £2,000 or £1,000 for the purpose of purchasing land.  I submit that this clause would make it possible for that person to raise a loan for the purpose of liquidating the loan that he had in the joint stock bank.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that should not be done.  To my mind that is transferring to the Corporation a debt which is now held by a joint stock bank and it may result in a number of commitments through the country.  I do not say that it will, because Senator Jameson assured us that the banks had no desire to do it.  I think it would be possible under that sub-section, in the case of loans obtained in connection with a number of farms which had been bought at large prices, to pass these loans held by the joint stock banks on to the Corporation.  I think that is possible under the section and I think it is wrong and for that reason I oppose that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>The views expressed by Senator Jameson on this are mine. From the banking point of view it does not matter whether this particular section is inserted or not, because if you have a competent Board, which we assume they will not take over, unless they are extraordinarily foolish, any of the class of loans to which Senator Bennett has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out another class which I think is in the mind of the Minister. A man has borrowed a certain sum of money for which he has given his land as security.  That sum of money was a very much smaller amount than the total value of the land, or he has repaid a very considerable amount of it, but in view of the fact that the particular bank with whom he is dealing, does not consider that they can get a prompt repayment if they were to advance any further substantial sum, they <Col N="1641" /> in many cases decline to increase further the amount of his loan.  This man, if he is a farmer, will probably want additional money, and will come to the Credit Corporation for that money.  He will give them a chattel mortgage, but if he wants a large amount, the chattel mortgage may not be sufficient, and they may ask for the deeds of the lands which he holds.  He will say, &ldquo;I would be delighted to give them, but, unfortunately, they are deposited in another bank as security for a comparatively small amount.&rdquo; The bank, naturally, will not give up the deeds unless he can repay the small loan.  If you do not give the Agricultural Credit Corporation this power there is just a danger that the farming community may find that the Agricultural Credit Corporation is not able to give the facilities which they want.  I think that is the case for the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NugentEverardBart" hpid="Sir N. EVERARD Sir N. EVERARD">
      <NameTxt>Sir N. EVERARD</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Jameson left out of account altogether the case of those new owners of land amongst whom large farms were divided and who became failures.  It would be of advantage to the country if the Agricultural Credit Corporation could come in and make a loan to an enterprising farmer's son to enable him to acquire land which has hitherto been in very inefficient hands.  I think it would be fairer to give owners of land, whose land has not been acquired by the Land Commission, the right to offer their lands for sale.  The Minister must recollect the many experiments made in that direction before the Act of 1923, in fact, before any legislation which gave the Commission power to take land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure a good deal has been heard of the division of lands in Telltown. A rich philanthropist bought land and his ambition was to form a colony of industrious small farmers. He did so, and some of them turned out a success while others turned out to be rank failures.  The result was that the original tenants practically all left and the land is now in the hands of most capable men.  They had a little money and they were able eventually to become the owners under the Act. <Col N="1642" /> Many of them are succeeding very well, but unless they found the money somewhere they could not pay this small amount for whatever was done on the land, which certainly was not very much.  I think it would be an advantage to have a little freer sale than there is at present, because I think it is generally admitted that the sale of land is practically restricted to the Land Commission.  The power the Land Commission have of taking any land anywhere means that a man who desires to acquire more land cannot buy a farm because it may be wanted for division amongst congests or people in the district.  I think from the point of view of the owner and from the point of view of the country it would be an advantage if the Agricultural Credit Corporation could advance money for the purchase of land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the first amendment is concerned, I have no decided views anyway.  If the Agricultural Credit Corporation were empowered to give money de novo for the purchase of land I would not complain. I think possibly it would be an advantage. I have no decided views on the matter.  On the other hand, there is this definitely to be said: that the report of the Banking Commission is against that.  Senator Jameson's views may be expressed in a word, that it is the business of the Corporation to provide credit for farmers &mdash;not to create new ones.  It is a distinction which I am not prepared to quarrel with.  So far as Senator Bennett's views are concerned, I want to say that I would like to see amendment No. 3 inserted.  I think it is vital that the Corporation, if it wishes to give a loan for £1,000 to liquidate a loan originally made for the purchase of land, notwithstanding that the land now, in a free, open market, is only worth £500, can do that if it is foolish enough.  Equally, the directors of the Corporation could make a loan to put up a building or a creamery on security worth only £200.  The only way to guard against that is to appoint competent directors, and I think you can rely upon the shareholders to have sufficient interest in the money they <Col N="1643" /> have invested to nominate competent directors.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it is vital that the Corporation should be in a position to meet a case like this: A farmer has a loan of £1,000 from an existing bank, originally made for the purchase of land.  The security is quite good, but he is not in a position to pay it for three or four or five years, or alternatively he may want extra money and the bank is not in a position to give it. This Corporation would be in a position to give long-term credit and could afford to remain out of their money for three or four years.  The original borrower approaches the Credit Corporation and says: &ldquo;If I am able to offer you the deeds of this farm as security for a loan of £1,000, are you prepared to lend me £1,000?&rdquo; They should be in a position to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; if they think the security is sufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. GUINNESS Mr. GUINNESS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel great difficulty in accepting the first amendment from the fact that the Corporation is being established with the object of giving long-term credits in connection with land.  The Commission reported against advancing money for the direct purchase of land, and Senator Jameson has said that the banks are there to do that work.  I know for a fact that the banks object, and have always objected, to lending money on long terms for the purchase of land.  I believe this Corporation is being established for the purpose of assisting in that direction, and I think that the absolute deletion of this particular clause would prevent them from advancing any money for the purchase of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Corporation is approached by an individual who is anxious to purchase a farm, and he is prepared to put up proper security, I cannot see why it is wrong for the Corporation not to advance the money. The probabilities are that it will not be repaid for several years.  That, of course, is quite contrary to the ordinary principles of banking, but it is not contrary to the principles of a corporation such as this.  It is asking the Corporation to do something for which it was established.  I have difficulty in accepting the deletion of the clause. <Col N="1644" /> The strongest point in favour of deletion is that it has been recommended by the Banking Commission, but, so far as I know, the Commission have given no reasons why it should be so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if Senator Guinness reads the Commission's report he will find a great many reasons given.  To put it quite shortly, they consider that for the ordinary purposes of agriculture there are any amount of institutions ready to advance all the money that should be legitimately applied to the direct purchase of land. They did not think that a new association provided with money from the State ought to enter into this kind of business.  They thought that that was the duty of commercial banks, and that, in the case of a man who wants to purchase land, but who cannot persuade any bank to lend him money, besides what he has got to pay for the farm, the State would be wrong in financing an institution which would step in and lend money under such circumstances to such individuals.</P>

      <P>I spoke on this subject on the Second Stage of the Bill.  I think this amendment is essential.  Small farmers are being pressed to sell their produce on a falling market in order to meet shop bills and other liabilities, but I think they should be given facilities for holding over their stock or farm produce for a better market. I think the Minister, when speaking, either on the Bill or in one of the constituencies, mentioned that one of the objects of the Bill was to enable farmers to hold over their stock and produce to get a better price.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 prohibits loans to co-operative societies which have retail shops in which they sell goods other than those they produce.  That is quite right, because in this country co-operation has been a failure in distribution though it has been a success in production, and wherever a creamery, which produced good butter and cream, had a retail shop in which it sold other goods the shop brought down the creamery. At the same time the section, as it stands, ought to be mitigated to some extent.  Creameries cannot sometimes supply all their customers with butter all the year round, and it may be necessary for them to sell Australian or New Zealand butter.  The amendment is for <Col N="1647" /> the purpose of enabling them to do that at particular times of the year.</P>

    <P>This amendment was put down at the request of the Minister.  Its object, I think, is fairly clear.  There is just a danger that the Bill as amended might restrict the Corporation from advantageously using any surplus money which it had from time to time, either through deposits or during the period when with its capital fully subscribed it has not got customers to use the money.  It is essential they should invest their money in some useful way, as otherwise the Corporation would be at a loss.  There is a danger this particular section might preclude them from purchasing either Irish or English Government bills, which are the most lucrative form of security, and could be repaid from day to day.  The next amendment is put down because legal opinion fears the provision that loans should only be made for purposes of agriculture might prevent this body taking up debentures for the purpose <Col N="1648" /> of temporarily using their surplus moneys, or dealing with deposits they might have.</P>

    <P>(1)  In this Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;chattel mortgage&rdquo; means an instrument under seal made between a farmer of the one part and the Corporation or a bank of the other part whereby the farmer in consideration of moneys advanced to him by the mortgagee covenants with the mortgagee to repay such moneys with interest and charges in favour of the mortgagee either specific farming stock or (by way of floating charge) the farming stock from time to time on his farm or both specific farming stock and the farming stock from time to time on his farm with the repayment of the said moneys and interest;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;specific chattel mortgage&rdquo; means a chattel mortgage whereby a charge on specific farming stock is created;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;floating chattel mortgage&rdquo; means a chattel mortgage whereby a floating charge on the farming stock from time to time on a farm is created;</P>
    <P>a chattel mortgage whereby both a charge on specific farming stock and a floating charge on the farming stock from time to time on a farm are created is included in the expression &ldquo;specific chattel mortgage&rdquo; in so far as a charge on specific farming stock is thereby created and is included in the expression &ldquo;floating chattel mortgage&rdquo; in so far as such floating charge is thereby created;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;farming stock&rdquo; means and includes animals and birds of every kind reared or kept for profit, the produce of such <Col N="1650" /> animals and birds, draught animals of every kind, agricultural machinery and implements, and agricultural crops whether growing in or severed from the land;</P>
    <P>the words &ldquo;mortgagor&rdquo; and &ldquo;mortgagees&rdquo; when used in relation to a chattel mortgage means respectively the farmer by whom and the Corporation or bank to whom such chattel mortgage is made.</P>

      <P>In order to make this amendment clear it is necessary to explain amendments 22, 23, 24 and 26, and 24a which appear on the White Paper.  They are all part and parcel of the same amendment. As the Bill stands the Minister for Justice shall set out the banks which are to be regarded as recognised banks for the purpose of having the right to inspect the register of chattel mortgages, which is otherwise secret. In conversation with the Minister he agreed that the Minister for Finance is the proper person and not the Minister for Justice to authorise that.  In addition to the amendments dealing with that amendment 24a on the White Paper gives to the Minister for Finance the power to make out a list of recognised banks.  The Minister will, no doubt at once make out a list of all the recognised banks.  Anyone could do that, but it is important that in case any new bank might open, or that in the case of any body or person having a bank for the purpose of making loans doing a bona-fide business there should be a right to inspect the register, and that they should be placed on the list by the Minister.  It is equally important the Minister should have some discretion in the matter, because there are what some of us might describe as money-lenders, but who might describe themselves as bankers, and who should not have that right.</P>

      <P>Before Section 26 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;26.  It shall be an obligation on any person who has received or seeks to obtain credit to disclose to the actual or prospective creditor, if he so requires, particulars of any existing chattel mortgage.  Any person who gives information under this section which he knows to be untrue shall be liable on conviction to a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad will remember that these are chattel mortgages.  The Corporation and the banks, by the Bill as it stands, are the only association, institutions or individuals entitled to know about a chattel mortgage before it is given.  Senator Sir John Keane's object <Col N="1654" /> in putting down this amendment is to try and make it possible for ordinary traders, shopkeepers, and others to get this information.  This means that if an individual applies to a shopkeeper for credit or to any other individual for the loan of money, the shopkeeper or person concerned may ask him if he has a chattel mortgage on his property, and if he replies wrongly he will be liable to a penalty.  He is not, however, compelled to answer.  If he does not answer, the other man can form his own conclusions.  If he answers wrongly, he will render himself liable to a penalty.  I think it is quite a reasonable amendment.  It would meet a great many of the complaints that there is some sort of conspiracy between the association and the banks to keep all the information to themselves. I do not know what the Minister's opinion is, but my personal opinion and the opinion of Sir John Keane is that it would be a sensible addition to the Bill.</P>

This is a needless procedure and I do not think it should be introduced, having regard to the fact that the Bill is drafted so widely as regards &ldquo;proper banks.&rdquo;  I was going to suggest that building societies should be allowed the right of inspection, because many leases are given subject to the right to build. Such societies could not be called &ldquo;banks,&rdquo; but they might require to see if there was a chattel mortgage existing.</P>

      <P>I have had the following drafted to meet the points in Senator Sir John Keane's amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 28 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;28.&mdash;(1) It shall be an obligation on every person (hereinafter called the debtor) who seeks from another person (hereinafter called the creditor) the grant or continuance of credit to disclose in writing to the creditor (if required in writing by the creditor so to do) whether there <Col N="1655" /> is or is not a chattel mortgage subsisting in respect of any of the debtor's farming stock and the particulars of every (if any) such chattel mortgage.</P>
    <P>(2)  No creditor shall disclose any information furnished to him by the debtor in pursuance of this section save in so far as such disclosure may be necessary or proper for the purposes of a prosecution under this section or for the institution or conduct of legal proceedings for the recovery of money due by the debtor to the creditor.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every person who shall make in writing a statement in pursuance of this section which is to his knowledge false or misleading in any material respect and every person who shall in contravention of this section disclose any information furnished to him in pursuance of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds.</P>
    <P>What the provision really means is this: If a customer who is on the books of a shopkeeper is asked in writing by the shopkeeper, &ldquo;Have you got a chattel mortgage at present on your stock?&rdquo; he is entitled to answer the question.  If the customer answers, he must tell the truth, under a penalty. I think that is sound enough.  It does not interfere with the secrecy of the chattel mortgage to any great extent. The reason that impelled me to agree to this provision was this: A shopkeeper has on his books a man who owes £100.  He is going on every day and increasing that £100.  Finally, the shopkeeper has to cease giving him credit.  He asks himself, &ldquo;Shall I issue a process or a writ?&rdquo; as the case may be.  He is in the unfortunate position that until he gets a decree he does not know that there is a chattel mortgage. If he had known there was a chattel mortgage, he might not act as he did. It is only right that the creditor should know before he goes to the expense of issuing a writ and getting a decree whether there is a chattel mortgage or not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1656" /> Amendment by Sir John Keane withdrawn. Amendment as tabled by the Minister agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 27:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New Section.  Before Section 28 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash; 28.&mdash;(1)  Whenever a farmer (hereinafter referred to as the intending mortgagor) agrees to make and the Corporation or a recognised bank (hereinafter referred to as the intending mortgagee) agrees to take a chattel mortgage (hereinafter referred to as the proposed chattel mortgage) the intending mortgagor shall furnish to the intending mortgagee a statement in writing stating whether he is or is not then indebted to the Corporation or any recognised bank (hereinafter referred to as the existing creditor) and, if he is so indebted, the name of the existing creditor.</P>
      <P>(2)  If in such statement the intending mortgagor states that he is so indebted the intending mortgagee shall send by post to the existing creditor a notice in writing stating the intention of the intending mortgagee to take a chattel mortgage from the intending mortgagor, and if either the intending mortgagee fails so to send such notice or the proposed chattel mortgage is made within seven days after the day on which such notice is so sent the proposed chattel mortgage shall be deemed to be fraudulent and void as against the existing creditor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  If a chattel mortgage is made without such statement being furnished by the intending mortgagor to the intending mortgagee and the mortgagor was at the date of such chattel mortgage indebted to the Corporation or a recognised bank such chattel mortgage shall if the intending mortgagor was so indebted to the Corporation and the Corporation is not the mortgagee be deemed to be fraudulent and void as against the Corporation and shall if the intending mortgagor was so indebted <Col N="1657" /> to any recognised bank be deemed to be fraudulent and void as against every recognised bank (other than the mortgagee) to which the intending mortgagor was so indebted.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every person who shall make a statement in writing in pursuance of this section which is to his knowledge false or misleading in any material respect shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and be liable on conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding two hundred pounds, or at the discretion of the court, to penal servitude for three years or imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years.</P>
    <P>This amendment is one of some importance and I need hardly say it has been put down after consultation with the Minister.  The object of the amendment is to deal with a situation which might otherwise be serious from the point of view of the banks and from the point of view of the Corporation. As the Bill stands, the register of chattel mortgages is secret.  There is the danger that a man applying to the Corporation for a loan and offering a chattel mortgage might owe a considerable sum of money to somebody else.  We dealt with the case of the shopkeeper in the previous amendment. In the case of banks, another bank would not know that a chattel mortgage was being agreed to by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Conceivably, they might lend money to the individual knowing he had various assets in the form of stock which could be made the subject of chattel mortgage. This amendment provides that a person who owes money to a bank shall disclose the fact to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and that if the Agricultural Credit Corporation decides they will lend him money on a chattel mortgage they shall give seven days' notice to the bank or other body concerned before they complete the transaction.  That may seem to be solely in the interests of the banks.  In a sense it is.  But it is also in the interests of the farming community, because if it were not so provided the banks which lend money at present on the assets which a man is known to possess, would be forced, in order to <Col N="1658" /> safeguard themselves, immediately to ask most of their customers for a chattel mortgage.  If they know that the individual to whom they are lending money cannot give a chattel mortgage elsewhere before they get notice there will be no necessity for them to take the action I have indicated.</P>

Before issuing a series of certificates of charge the directors shall place under the control of trustees, in such manner by transfer, sub-mortgage, deposit, or otherwise as shall be approved by the Minister, good and sound first mortgages on land held by the Corporation as security for advances made by it to a nominal amount not less than the nominal amount of such series of certificates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Schedule deals with the conditions and mode of issue of these certificates of charge, which are certificates issued to the public in the denominations of, I think, £10.  They are secured by first mortgages and other securities specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the <Col N="1660" /> Schedule.  When you come to paragraph 4, which deals with the securities to be given to the trustees, the words used are &ldquo;good and sound first mortgages on land.&rdquo;  That is the only form of security to be given to trustees. That is not correct, because there are other forms of securities.  Those words ought to be struck out and the words suggested in the amendment substituted.</P>

      <P>In connection with the rate of interest to be paid on these certificates of charge and set out in paragraph 7 of the Schedule, these certificates are guaranteed by the Government and interest is also guaranteed. The capital of the Corporation is to be £500,000, carrying 5 per cent. interest.  Capital and interest are guaranteed by the Government.  Why is it necessary, where you have another form of security somewhat similar, to have an interest rate of this complicated nature and different from the rate in connection with the capital of the company?  As the Bill stands at present, the rate of interest on these certificates is not to exceed by more than 3 per cent. per annum, the average rate <Col N="1661" /> of interest paid by the leading banks on moneys held by them on deposit account.  That is a complicated system, and if the Bill were in operation at the present time it would mean that the Government would be paying 5 per cent. on capital and 5½ per cent. on these charge certificates.</P>

      <P>Section 3, sub-section (3).  After the word &ldquo;council,&rdquo; line 26, to insert the words &ldquo;of whom one shall be a member of the Central Midwives Board for Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for putting forward this amendment is that the whole question of the training of midwives is linked with the training of medical students. There is a very definite relationship to the number of midwives and students which each of the maternity hospitals can receive for training.  There is also the further reason that all questions regarding the qualifications of midwives are set out in every issue of the Medical Register.  The matter is so important that the Midwives (Ireland) Act is printed in every medical register issued in England.  It states the duties of the Board, and it is supplied to every medical man who is qualified, showing what his relationship to midwives is. There has always been a member of the English Midwives Board on the General Medical Council when the regulations were under consideration, and it is essential that there should be some person on this new Council who is familiar with these regulations and who can help to explain any alteration which is necessary from time to time. Furthermore, every medical student, when qualified, receives a &ldquo;warning <Col N="1663" /> notice&rdquo; which incorporates a provision contained in the Midwives Act, 1902, the Midwives (Scotland) Act, 1915, and the Midwives (Ireland) Act, 1918.  This provision states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>No woman shall habitually and for gain attend women in child-birth otherwise than under the direction of a qualified medical practitioner unless she be certified under this Act.</P>
    <P>The warning notice then goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>And whereas it has been made to appear to the Council that certain registered medical practitioners have from time to time by their countenance or assistance or by issuing certificates or notifications or other documents of a kindred character knowingly enabled uncertified women on pretence that such women were under their direction, to attend women in child-birth contrary to law.  And whereas such conduct is, in the opinion of the Council, discreditable to the medical profession, and calculated to defeat the purpose of the statute made in the public interest for the protection of mothers and infants, notice is hereby given that any registered practitioner who is proved to have so offended will be liable to have his name erased from the medical register.</P>
    <P>It is important that notice be supplied to such practitioners.  These men are constantly coming before the Council in England.  The practitioners in England are pretty familiar with the law relating to this matter.  It is necessary, in my opinion, that there should be a connecting link between the two bodies.  It is because I believe it is necessary that I move this amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a Medical Practitioners Bill, and the only relation in this Bill to the Central Midwives Board for Ireland is mentioned in Section 44, which states:</P>
      <P>On and after the establishment of the register the reference in Section 5 of the Midwives (Ireland) Act. 1918, to the General Medical Council shall be construed as a reference to the Council and the said Section 5 shall have effect accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1664" /> Senator Bigger has given us some information with regard to the importance of the Central Midwives Board; but the fact is that all the time the Midwives (Ireland) Act, 1918, was in existence, and even during the period of the legislation that it substituted, there was the same obligation imposed on the General Medical Council to look after regulations as there will be in future imposed upon the Council here. Never in the history of the General Medical Council was there a suggestion that there should be definitely and clearly a representative of the Central Midwives Board on the General Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardBigger" hpid="Sir E. BIGGER Sir E. BIGGER">
      <NameTxt>Sir E. BIGGER</NameTxt>
      <P>But there always has been, and in England when the regulations came up for consideration on several occasions they always had a member of the Central Midwives Board of England there.  They never dreamt of altering anything or going into any matter until he was present and able to explain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a good procedure and one that may be followed. But I object to the insistance that there shall be a member of the Central Midwives Board necessarily on the Council.  There is not any such obligation with regard to the English Council.  I have had consultation with medical men generally as to the composition of this Council, and until this paper was brought to my notice I never saw or heard the suggestion that there should be a representative of the Central Midwives Board on the Council.</P>
      <P>How far would one have to go if this were admitted?  There is a Nursing Board.  Why would there not be a representative from that Board admitted? The question of midwifery does come into the students' course, and it is a question that has to be given careful attention by responsible authorities.  It is their duty to see that their representative will be able to look after the whole field of education in regard to this particular subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a demand never was made and never would have been tolerated in England.  There is the further point that this would mean an upsetting of the Council.  There would have to be a <Col N="1665" /> readjustment in the number and the personnel of the Council if this amendment were to be accepted.</P>

      <P>This is to give power to the Council to suspend a medical practitioner found guilty of an offence, for a definite time.  In England the General Medical Council could never suspend a practitioner.  They must strike him off the roll and reinstate him at a subsequent period.  I think it would save a great deal of bother if a practitioner could be suspended for, say, six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What may happen is that he may be restored by an order of the High Court in a certain contingency referred to in another sub-section. The Council, by special direction, may restore him to the rolls.  It is much better that any man guilty of infamous conduct in a professional respect should be removed and, if he is to be reinstated, there should be a reconsideration of the case and a definite direction that there should be reinstatement if that is considered advisable.</P>
      <P>The position the Senator wishes to bring about is that they may suspend a practitioner and afterwards restore him to his original position.  I think the conjunction of sub-section (7) with sub-section (1) of this section absolutely safeguards the position that the Senator wishes to achieve.  I gather that the attitude of the medical profession towards this matter of infamous conduct in a professional respect is that the person found guilty should definitely and clearly be struck off for a term stated.</P>

      <P>I desire to move the following recommendation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 1, sub-section (2).  Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The revaluation made in the year 1924 by the Commissioners of Valuation of the tenements and hereditaments in the County Borough of Waterford shall not become operative for income tax purposes until the expiry of the present quinquennial Valuation Roll for the said County Borough.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The position is this.  In the end of 1924 the Corporation of the City of Waterford requested a revaluation of the city.  The reason they made that request was that the city had not been valued for the previous dozen years. In the interval some parts of the city had fallen away and other parts became more valuable, and the incidence of assessment there was all wrong.  In order to get uniformity of assessment and to bring the valuation up to date the Corporation decided to make the application.  The Corporation at the time desired to get the incidence of taxation or assessment adjusted.  They did not anticipate any very serious increase in taxation.  What happened was: the Commissioners of Valuation arrived, and after investigation they increased the aggregate valuation by fifty per cent.  This appalled the citizens and appalled the Corporation, and they at once set to work to have the operation of this revaluation held over or suspended for a time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chamber of Commerce quite well knew the conditions existing in Waterford at the time.  There was considerable stagnation in trade, and some of the shopkeepers along the Quay were barely keeping their shutters from being permanently put up.  There was great unemployment and about two thousand men were on the dole.  They <Col N="1669" /> saw it would be a hardship on the ratepayers and income tax payers to be burdened with rates based on the increased valuation.  The traders also recognised that they would be penalised in competition with brother traders in the neighbouring towns of Wexford, Kilkenny and Tipperary, the valuation of these places not yet having been accomplished.  I refer, of course, to the new general valuation.  They thought the operation of this new valuation should not be enforced in regard to rates and income tax until such time as these other areas with which they were in competition were also revalued.</P>
    <P>A deputation made representations to the Minister for Finance, and finally the Valuation Department sent down a representative to examine the position. He told the Chamber of Commerce and the Corporation that the position was not so bad as they thought, because there was no suggestion of paying the income tax based on the new valuation until the expiry of the current quinquennial period, which would not be until 1929.  That would safeguard them, at least for that time, and it was expected that in the interval the re-valuation of competing centres such as Tipperary, Wexford and Kilkenny, would be accomplished.  That eased the situation for the moment.  The rates, however, were based on the new valuation, and were forthwith demanded. The rates were not affected by the quinquennial period.  The rates were grumblingly paid.</P>
    <P>Time went on, and the 1924 and 1925 Finance Acts were brought in.  It would appear from what afterwards transpired that by some addition to, or omission from, the Finance Act of 1925 these safeguards that had been mentioned to us were swept away, and that forthwith after the passing of the 1925 Act the taxpayers in Waterford would be liable for the full assessment based on the new valuation.  There were meetings of protest held by the Corporation, the Chamber of Commerce and the Licensed Vintners' Association. There was considerable correspondence with the Ministry, and finally a deputation comprising representatives from the three bodies waited upon the Minister <Col N="1670" /> in Dublin.  The Minister reviewed the whole position.  He did not deny anything that was stated, and regretted that, owing to the Finance Act of 1925, the position was altered, and that no remedy could now be suggested. The deputationists came back to Waterford and there were further meetings. They could not allow the position to rest there.  They contended that what a Finance Bill had altered a Finance Bill could remedy.  They felt that a wrong had been committed by inadvertence. There was no advertence at the time the 1925 Act was passed to the conditions existing in the City of Waterford.  The conditions there had been overlooked.  As the Minister mentioned yesterday, had the position in Waterford been appreciated at the time of the passing of the Finance Act the whole situation would have been remedied. Surely a wrong that is admitted in that way should not be allowed indefinitely to endure.</P>
    <P>Our codes are not so imperfect and the resources of the Ministry and of the Department are not so barren that an admitted wrong, caused by any inadvertence, omission or carelessness inflicted on the income tax payers of Waterford, should remain, and that the attitude now should be that there is no help for it; the thing is done; it is beyond recall and cannot be remedied.  If that is the attitude taken up by the Minister I say it is absolutely illogical and unreasonable.  The large income tax payers in Waterford are members of the Chamber of Commerce &mdash;a very honourable body of men with a very honourable history behind them.  These men, in their trading relations or in any relations with the Government or anybody, would not think of acting in a dishonourable way.  It is their pride, and to their credit be it said, that that has always been the reputation of the merchants and of the Chamber of Commerce in Waterford.</P>
    <P>The Minister entered into an honourable undertaking&mdash;it is over his signature. In his letter to the Chamber of Commerce he endorsed what had been undertaken by his official.  He reiterated that the present quinquennial roll for Waterford would be in force <Col N="1671" /> for about four years more&mdash;that is, the year 1929&mdash;and except in the case of new or improved premises revaluation would not become operative for income tax purposes until the expiry of that period.  There is reservation except for new and improved premises.  That is a reference to the ordinary annual valuation where a new building or addition to a structure was put up and an additional assessment was put on. That additional assessment did not begin to operate for income tax purposes until the end of the quinquennial period.  Any casual assessment made during the five years' period was held in suspense as a basis for income tax until the quinquennial period ended, and then all came in on the same mark on the higher assessment.  That had no relevancy at all to the present valuation, which was a special general valuation, called for for a specific purpose, to make an adjustment in the incidence of taxation in Waterford city.  Attached to that was the special condition given in the Minister's letter that it would not operate for income tax purposes until the end of the then current quinquennial period.  It was in a department by itself, apart from any clause in any Finance Bill.  It was a valuation brought on and accomplished by special request for a specific purpose hedged round and safeguarded by this condition, that it would not operate until a particular period had expired. That is all the Chamber of Commerce asks this House to do.  Failing any satisfactory explanation from the Minister, or any indication as to how they can get any formal redress, their only resource was to wait upon me, and ask me to bring this matter before the Seanad, the members of which are business men and possibly most of them members of Chambers of Commerce. They will see the matter in the light in which the Waterford Chamber of Commerce sees it, as an honourable undertaking.  If it is possible to remedy it they are sure the Seanad will make the necessary recommendation. They will see the equity of the position, and I am sure will make a recommendation to the Dáil, that some exemption clause should be inserted in the Bill. <Col N="1672" /> If it is stated that that cannot be done, I advance this argument that the title of the Finance Act of 1925 and the scope of it is word for word with the title and scope of the Finance Bill of 1927.  If a wrong were perpetrated under that Act, which has the same caption as the Bill of 1927, clearly it is the corresponding instrument, this Bill, that should be availed of to remedy that wrong.  The Minister has already given his final answer&mdash;a most unsatisfactory and illogical one&mdash;that the thing was done through inadvertence, and there was no remedy.  I repeat that that is no answer at all.  The Minister admits all I said.  He admits the promise, and it is now for this House to urge upon him to do this, and, no matter what may be the view in the Dáil, this House will then have done its duty.  The Minister, having made an honourable contract with the city of Waterford, should be held to it.</P>

      <P>I should like to oppose this motion, and I think the Senator is somewhat illogical in bringing it forward.  This evening he spoke at great length against any relief being given to the people of Clare, in another case.  I think the weighty arguments he used then would apply equally well against the recommendation now brought forward.</P>

      <P>If Senator Kenny had omitted the references to hedging around, guarantees, redressing wrongs perpetrated, and honourable understandings, he would have been nearer the facts.  What happened was the Corporation of Waterford, finding that the valuation was very out of date or very irrelevant, asked for a re-valuation of the city.  That set the machine in operation.  The re-valuation was carried out by the Valuation Department; the appeals were heard, and it was found the valuation, besides being redistributed over the premises of the city, had actually been increased by about 50 per cent.  The Corporation, the Chamber of Commerce, and various other people in Waterford, made attempts to stop the machine. They made attempts to set aside what had been already done.  They asked <Col N="1673" /> the Government to suspend until Tibb's Eve the coming into operation of the new valuation.  We were not able to do that.  We told them we could not do it.  We made the valuation explaining to them the effects. There was no such thing given as a promise or any inducement held out to them to take some new line.  We simply told them what the position was at the time.  The revaluation raised the assessment not merely on the income tax but the duty based on the valuation of licensed premises, and so on.  They were told as clearly as they could be told what the position was at the time.  There was no wrong done. What happened was simply that for a long period the people of Waterford have been escaping that valuation, which was very much below what it ought to be.</P>
      <P>This revaluation of the city was carried out on the 1914 basis.  It was not a bit above what the pre-war valuation of the premises would have been.  It was carried out as the re-valuation of the city of Dublin was carried out under the 1914 basis. Actually no wrong was perpetrated by bringing that valuation into effect. Undoubtedly the people in Waterford who moved for revaluation were nonplussed when they found that the total valuation had gone up, and, because they were so vehement about that&mdash;not because they were suffering a wrong&mdash; and felt so astounded, that if their case had been considered when the change was made, we would have, probably, postponed the change.  But it was not adverted to, and consequently the change was not made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The change was made because the system of quinquennial rolls was a system not applicable to Irish conditions at all.  It was used here simply because it was necessary in England. In England, the poor-law valuation is the basis on which Schedule A income tax is collected.  A special valuation is made for income tax purposes, and that special valuation is made, as far as can be, for five years.  Sometimes the period is exceeded.  It cannot be made every year.  It is a big job.  It is supposed to be made every five years and consequently the assessment on <Col N="1674" /> Schedule A tax is only changed every five years.  Here we have a different system.  We have poor law valuation and continual revision.  There was no need for the British system here.  We have, without undertaking big changes in income tax law, tried to simplify and get rid of certain anomalies.  In the process of bringing about certain small simplifications in the 1925 Act we decided to drop what was called the continuation clause, and let the new valuation of premises come into effect for income tax purposes with that for rating purposes.</P>
    <P>There were other places affected. Waterford was the only place in which there was a general revaluation, but in the township of Howth the rating authority did not confine itself to sending forward for revaluation merely the premises which had undergone structural alteration.  It sent forward a list of other premises so that in a period of three or four years, almost all the houses in Howth were revalued, and the new valuation has come into effect there.  I think there are certain other cases throughout the country.  It would certainly be altogether wrong to give a concession to Waterford without giving it to the other places. There is very little money in this because most of the houses upon which the valuation was increased were business houses occupied by the owners. Where the additional Schedule A tax is charged that would be allowed against the tax payable under Schedule D.  As far as can be seen, with a 3/- income tax the net increase in Waterford would be perhaps £750.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is allowing for the rebate.  There will be delay, of course, owing to the three years' average, but that is about what the increase will be.  I think it is trivial considering that since this change was effected the income tax rate has gone down 2/-, so that the increase in valuation is very much less severe to the people, and considering that the Corporation has increased expenditure and its demand on the ratepayers by £20,000.  I think if some of the energy devoted to getting rid of the results of <Col N="1675" /> the city's demand for re-valuation were devoted to inducing the Corporation to reduce its demands the energy would be much better expended.  Administratively this change would be a most serious matter, because 6,000 assessments have been made in Waterford alone.  Other assessments in Howth and elsewhere would also have to be dealt with.  All the steps have been taken.  In many cases the tax has been collected and undoubtedly tax has been deducted from ground landlords, and payments made to people who have mortgage interests.  It is possible we have even repaid some of that tax to people living in England.  If we were to undo the whole thing and go back over it, it would require not a simple section like this, but a complicated section. It would cause very great difficulty. If it was right that this city should be revalued when it was asked for, and on the 1914 basis, it is not too much that the people should pay tax on that valuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with Senator Kenny because exactly the same thing happened to myself.  An alteration was made in premises of which I am part owner, and as a result we found, unfortunately, that there was a revaluation and the valuation was increased.  In or about the same time the Finance Bill came in the quinquennial period ended, and the result was that we had to pay income tax on the increased valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>But I do not see why Waterford should be treated differently from persons in similar circumstances in other cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the Minister and Senator Douglas have evaded the crux of the whole matter&mdash;the promise.  In these other cases&mdash;the Minister travelled over a wide range&mdash;there were no promises at all.  It is the promise, the actual undertaking given by the Minister over his own hand, that is the gravamen of the whole position. He says that when his representative <Col N="1676" /> went down to Waterford very many matters were considered&mdash;the licensing duties and things of that sort.  They all have a bearing on this particular thing, because the income tax of licensed vintners is affected by this, and very seriously affected.  Their licence duties are based largely on the valuations.  The Minister tried to whittle this matter down to £750, but it runs into thousands of pounds.  Overtaxation in 1926 on the increased valuation meant £5,000, at 4/- in the £ on the extra £25,000, and in 1927, on the 3/- basis, instead of the £750 that the Minister referred to, besides the extra taxation and income tax on the licensed trade, it will amount to about £3,500. Finally we asked the Minister&mdash;and he has not yet replied to it&mdash;on what clause of the 1925 Act he relied in making the statement that the promise made to the citizens of Waterford could not be observed?  That Act was submitted to the solicitors of the Waterford Chamber of Commerce and they said that they could not see exactly what the Minister's argument was.  The Minister said that the 1925 Act as far as the city of Waterford was concerned altered the whole situation, but they cannot find that that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that there was no wrong and no hardship, that the re-valuation was made on the 1914 basis, and all that.  We do not say that there was any wrong.  It simply lies as between one individual and another. If A makes a promise and gives an honourable undertaking to B and afterwards repudiates the whole thing, the wrong is there; B is certainly wronged if he has to pay several thousand pounds a year as a result, and it would be quite reasonable that B should be very emphatic in stating his wrong. The Minister also tried to buttress up his position by saying that matters had now gone too far, but he never dealt with the promise at all.  He has no consideration for the people who are harassed by the income tax collector with final notices and threats of proceedings. He now says that things have gone too far, the income tax has been largely collected, and some payments have been sent to England.  But <Col N="1677" /> the Minister had very considerable notice; this agitation has been going on for a couple of years, and it was open to him at any time to put a stay on the collection of income tax.</P>
    <P>Of course the income tax collector had his duty to perform.  When asked about sending the final demand notices to those merchants in the city of Waterford he said: &ldquo;What can I do? I must collect my warrant.  Once I get my instructions I have to go ahead. I am responsible for the collection.&rdquo; The Minister never tried to put a stay on him, although we asked him to do it.  He allowed the whole machinery to work.  Senator Douglas has sympathy with me personally, as I am one of those affected, but I have no sympathy with him.  If the Minister had promised him that he would be exempt, at least for four years, and then if he told the House that the promise was thrown aside, and the Minister repudiated the whole thing, what would he think?  That is our position here.  In order to ventilate the matter, at any <Col N="1678" /> rate, we, as honourable men, should pass this recommendation.  If it does not do any good, it will not do any harm.  We, at any rate, vindicate ourselves.</P>
