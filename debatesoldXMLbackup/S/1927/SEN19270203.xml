      <P>On a point of order, are we not breaking Standing Orders, 59 particularly, by taking this Bill and the three subsequent ones on the day immediately following the Second Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I was going to call attention to it and to point out that it gives an illustration of how difficult and dangerous it may be if we the up our hands too tightly in the matter of suspension of Standing Orders.  We have, of course, an alternative which the Committee on Procedure ought to consider carefully and it is this, that where a Bill has passed through its second or third Stage without opposition or amendment the House should have power&mdash;it should not be compelled&mdash;to take the remaining stages at the same sitting.  Otherwise, it would be almost incumbent on you to kill certain measures which are required to come into operation at once. I wish to say with regard to this Medical Bill that I think Senators have a right to complain; we have no Minister in charge of it or anyone to tell us what it is about.  We have been left entirely to ourselves to find out <Col N="186" /> whether it is urgent or not.  You can only ascertain the urgency by a close inspection of the Bill because looking at the contents of the Bill it would appear if it were passed before the 21st February that would be sufficient for the Government's purpose, but my attention has been called to the statement made by the President in the other House.  He there pointed out that inasmuch as the Order to be made under this Bill, if it passes into law, has to be made before the 21st February, and making allowance for the seven days which have to elapse before the Bill, after passing, can come into operation, that it must be through this House not later than the 14th February.  It seems to me, therefore, unless we allow it to go through to-day, it being an uncontested Bill, as I understand it is, it would be necessary for me to convene this House next Wednesday for the sole and only purpose of passing this Bill through the Report and Final Stages.  That is a procedure that would take only about five minutes in the case of an uncontested Bill.  Accordingly I directed the Clerk to put this Bill on the Agenda to-day in view of its urgency.</P>
      <P>Different considerations apply to the Bills dealing with the Constitution, and as regards those I put them on the Agenda in case any Senators might think it desirable to dispose of the Committee Stages to-day.  I am not going to ask the House or press them to take them to-day, but we can deal with them when we come to them.  The immediate matter is the Medical Bill, and I do not know whether the Minister for Local Government has anything to do with that Bill.  He probably will explain to the House the urgency of it. I think I have made the point clear, but if I am wrong in what I said I would be glad if he would correct me.</P>

      <P>This Bill is only to continue the present arrangements with regard to the Medical Act until a more important Bill is brought into being.  Negotiations at present are pending to bring forward that Bill, but we feel it will take at least three or four months before those arrangements <Col N="187" /> are completed.  It is in order to complete our arrangements and not to have complete chaos in their arrangement with regard to the Medical Acts that this Bill is brought before the Seanad, and it is absolutely necessary that it should be in force before the 21st.  We also have to allow time for the Order to come into operation.</P>

      <P>Before you put that, do you not think what we are up against is that the Seanad is not going to meet next week?  There is no other reason why we should not take it next Wednesday and put it in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be better that the Seanad should recognise that we are breaking No. 11 of our Standing Orders to meet every Wednesday? You have tried very hard to meet our convenience by letting us off as often as you can and only summoning us when there is plenty of business. The result of that has been just what we are at now that the Seanad has to do things, which I do not think they ought to do, that is to suspend their Standing Orders in this way.  I take it for granted the Government could not have avoided this.  But I think it could have hurried up a bit.  I do not think when it is a choice of putting the Government in a difficulty or of having the Seanad meet once a week, which they ought to do, that there is a strong case made out for the suspension of Standing Orders.  We can always have a number of Senators in this House to do our business.  This is not a contentious Bill, and it seems to me that it <Col N="188" /> were far better for the Seanad if we had an understanding to meet throughout the Session on Wednesdays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite that.  The Standing Order indicates &ldquo;should the business so notified be, in the opinion of the Cathaoirleach, neither of such urgency nor importance as to justify the holding of a meeting.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole point of this is urgency.  It is very important apparently that this Bill must be got through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I leave the matter entirely in the hands of the Seanad.  I can only say that there would be a good deal of complaint if I were to convene a meeting of the Seanad for Wednesday next and the sole and only business to be disposed of would be an unopposed Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you aware that there are three other Bills, two of them contentious, and we will have four Bills at least?  They are on the Order Paper in violation of the Standing Orders and I shall oppose them because of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Cathaoirleach that from now on for two or three months we should make an effort to meet every Wednesday. If that leads to a great inconvenience and outcry then we can consider the situation but at any rate we will be doing our duty.  The Government will have no grounds for complaints which have been frequently, with some justification, urged against the Seanad. If there is no business to take up the time on Monday it is quite possible to send out notice.  In any case we will have members here to do the business. The country members will know whether the business is important or not.  If we do not suspend Standing Orders except in cases of urgency country members will know that important business will only be done in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that the Chairman's desire is to facilitate those at a distance. I think he has been over-anxious to facilitate members of the Seanad and it has resulted in a certain amount of criticism.  It is always easy to discuss <Col N="189" /> a Bill which is practically unopposed. I suggest we should take the Committee Stage to-day, meet next Wednesday and take the Committee Stage of the Constitution Bills.  If we should agree to take the Report and Final Stages of the Medical Bill to-day the whole thing would be better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>There is great force in what the Senator says.  I think from and after this day fortnight we will require to meet every week.  Owing to the fact that the Dáil adjourned recently for a fortnight we have very little business coming from the Dáil at present.</P>
      <P>I am greatly afraid, once it becomes a practice to hold a meeting of the Seanad every week, wholly regardless of the amount and the nature of the business, we may occasionally find ourselves without a quorum, and I think that would be more to the discredit of the Seanad than anything else.  It is, however, a matter for the Seanad to decide.  They can always remedy that state of affairs by attending.</P>
      <P>In regard to this particular Bill, I think the Committee Stage cannot be taken to-day unless the Standing Orders are suspended.  If the Seanad does not intend to put the Bill through its remaining stages to-day I do not think there is anything to be gained in suspending the Standing Orders. The best course would be to let every other Stage, including the Committee Stage, remain over until next Wednesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that as there is a question of urgency involved there is a good deal to be said for suspending the Standing Orders in order to take the Committee Stage.  That does not apply to the remaining Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>What is to be gained by passing the Committee Stage to-day if we are going to meet on Wednesday next to transact the formal business of passing the Fourth and Final Stages of the Bill?  That would take only three or four minutes.  If we do not intend to put the Bill through all its stages to-day, why should we suspend the Standing Orders at all, and why not take all the remaining Stages on Wednesday next?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MOLLOY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is most ridiculous to have a meeting every Wednesday. It would be very inconvenient for the country members and, in addition, it would impose an additional tax on the State.  The vouchers issued to enable country members to travel would amount to £40 or £50 weekly.  I think the business can be nicely done at fortnightly meetings.  That would obviate the expense I have referred to and would not be inconvenient for the country members.  It is all very nice for the Senators who live in or near the city to attend every week, but to have country members attending here next Wednesday at an expense of £40 or £50 on the State in order to pass a Bill that is not in any way contentious, is merely a waste of time and a waste of State funds.</P>

      <P>What Standing Order makes it necessary to postpone the Committee Stage of this Medical Bill until next Wednesday?  I think we are entitled to take it to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite certain about that.  There is a Standing Order which requires an interval of two days&mdash;certainly one day in the case of Government Bills.  I think the interval in the case of Private Bills is two days.  I think Standing Order 73 touches on that matter.  Standing Order 73 sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the case of a Government Bill the motion for its Second Reading, for its reference to a Committee, for the consideration in Committee of the preamble and sections of the Bill, for considering the Bill on Report or for the passing of the Bill, shall not require to be proposed or seconded, but shall be put from the Chair.  Not more than one stage of any Bill shall be taken on the same day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Standing Order 59 sets out that amendments to a Bill must be in by eleven o'clock in the forenoon on the day before the Bill is to be considered.  That is not practicable if the Seanad adjourns at 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening of the day prior <Col N="191" /> to the consideration of the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time it does not get rid of the fact that the only interval required between the different Stages of a Government Bill is one day.  The two may be difficult to work together, but I think in practice any Senator who wanted to move an amendment to this Medical (No. 2) Bill could have handed it in before he left the House last night, and then he would have complied with the Standing Orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest, as I moved the suspension of the Standing Orders, that if the Seanad does not suspend Standing Orders in relation to this Bill, it will not have very much to do, because the Constitution (Amendment) Bills cannot be proceeded with to-day unless in that case also we suspend Standing Orders and the Seanad will probably object to suspending Standing Orders in relation to the Constitution (Amendment) Bills as they are matters of very great importance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards three of them we are in the position that they are practically uncontested. The fourth Bill did form the subject-matter of discussion and it has been referred to a Select Committee.  I doubt very much if that Committee will be able to sit and report in time for next Wednesday.  If we adjourn the consideration of these Bills until Wednesday, it seems to me that the business will not occupy the House more than a quarter of an hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Medical (No. 2) Bill goes I quite agree with you.  That measure will not occupy very many minutes.  In regard to the Constitution (Amendment No. 2) Bill there are some matters of a controversial nature and that will probably take some time.  The only other Bill that we can discuss to-day is the Local Government Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.  Let us consider first what we are to do with this Medical (No. 2) Bill.  If we are not <Col N="192" /> going to put it through all its Stages to-day, I think we had better confine ourselves to the Committee Stage.  If any Senator thinks he has not had time to put in amendments to this Medical (No. 2) Bill and moves that the consideration of the Committee Stage be adjourned until next Wednesday, I will put that motion to the House.  If there is no desire to move an amendment to the Bill and if, as I think, it is perfectly in order before us to-day, we had better dispose of it. There is a motion at present before the Seanad.  It has been proposed and seconded that the Standing Orders be suspended for the purpose of enabling the remaining Stages of the Medical (No. 2) Bill, 1926, to be considered to-day.</P>

We discussed the question of the position of the Speaker yesterday and I would like to find a solution of what, no doubt, appears to the Seanad a somewhat involved situation.  What I propose to do is to move, in line 31, the omission of the words &ldquo;not&rdquo; and &ldquo;any,&rdquo; and the insertion in place of &ldquo;any&rdquo; of the words &ldquo;his former.&rdquo; The section would then read, beginning in line 30:&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, is it really worth our while discussing an amendment for the circulation of which there has been no time? This is an indication of the impossibility of doing business here in the proper way.  The Minister has not thought it worth his while to attend the meeting of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I move that the consideration of this and the other Bills be postponed to admit of the attendance of the Minister.  We have very long discussions here almost every day about procedure and Standing Orders and some of us are beginning to get fed up and pretty well ashamed of the House and the manner in which we deal with business.  There is a deplorable lack of business instinct in the way in which we conduct our proceedings. It is absurd to discuss an amendment that has not been circulated&mdash;an amendment to a very important Bill. The Minister in charge is not even present and Senators cannot pretend that they are taking their business seriously if they allow themselves to deal with things in this manner.</P>

      <P>It must be perfectly obvious to the House that during the last half-hour we have been engaged in a discussion to accommodate a measure and to make up for the precipitate way in which amendments have been thrust upon us.  I suppose we ought to be grateful that they have not used the telegraphic system for putting them before us.  The whole House has been put into a chaotic condition, and it has required all your ingenuity, sir, to find a way for allowing the House to function. The matter has really come to that.  It is really too bad the precipitate way in which these amendments have been thrust on us, not through your fault or the fault of the House. It is not right that the House should have to use these tactics and should have been put to the pin of its collar in the way of ingenuity to refer these Bills to a Select Committee.  I do not think that they should be referred to a Select Committee, but rather that the House should have an opportunity of discussing them at large.  I agree with anyone who suggests that we should fix a date and have a thorough discussion on them.  Select Committees merely means avoiding discussion and a hole-and-corner method of getting amendments through that might not be at all welcome to the country or to the House at large.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name: Section 6, sub-section (4), to delete the sub-section. The sub-section reads:</P>
      <P>The council shall make the poor rate for any local financial year in respect of every hereditament and tenement in the county without distinguishing between agricultural and other hereditaments.</P>
      <P>I think it is obvious that when the agricultural grant will have to be applied to the relief of rates on lands that it would not be advisable to make a flat rate over land and buildings, and for that reason I move the deletion of the sub-section.</P>

      <P>This amendment, combined with the amendment which the Seanad passed yesterday, strikes at the whole root of the Bill at present before the <Col N="197" /> House.  The two sections in the Bill which I regard as the vital and important ones are Sections 6 and 7.  The putting into operation of these two sections will effect a great simplification in the present system of applotment and, as a result of that simplification, will lead to a saving of something like £30,000 in the country.  It was mainly with the object of being able to secure that benefit to the ratepayers this year that I was anxious to get the Bill through before the vital date&mdash;the 21st February.  That being so, I will find it necessary to advise the Dáil not to accept this amendment or any amendment of the section under any circumstances.  These two sections deal with a very intricate and delicate matter.  Realising that it was impossible to put into a form of words that would be understood, I had an explanation of the section circularised as a memorandum amongst members of the Dáil and Seanad.  It showed how the applotment worked out under the two systems.  I thought that Senator Linehan, as a result of considering that document, would have taken a reasonable view of this section.  As I say it is vital to the Bill, and the only effect of his amendment is to nullify the section.  I have thought for that reason that perhaps before the Seanad comes to a final decision on the matter I should explain in detail the point raised by Senator Linehan's amendment and show the fallacy that is inherent in his argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agricultural Grant was originally under the Act of 1898 divided into three parts, in relief respectively of the following three kinds of expenditure: Expenditure charged on the whole county; expenditure charged on the rural district, and expenditure charged on the union.  The amount of each of these portions was determined for each county, rural district, or union according to the amount of expenditure in the area, which amount was determined by reference to a standard year.  The effect was that in the districts or unions in which by reason of low valuation or expensive services the rates would be high, the agricultural grant was larger. The Minister always had power to <Col N="198" /> amalgamate unions, and rural districts in the same county.  When this was done the agricultural grant for union and district charges in the amalgamated area was distributed equally over that area.  Obviously since the amalgamated area bore all the expenses equally, the benefit of the agricultural grant had to be given equally too.</P>
    <P>By the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, the expenditure which had previously been union charges was made a charge on the whole county.  The effect was the same as if the unions in the county were amalgamated and following the old principle, and the only equitable one, the Minister provided for the pooling of the agricultural grant for union charges.  This was done in 1924 by the Agricultural Grant (Adaptation) Order, 1924, which Order was laid before both Houses under Section 20 of the Act, and, no resolution annulling it having been passed, became as much law as the original Act.  Acting under that Order the agricultural grant for union charges has been pooled in the rates for the last two years.</P>
    <P>By the Local Government Act, 1925, all the expenditure which made up the rural district charges at the time when the agricultural grant was fixed, became county charges.  Again the effect is exactly the same as where a number of rural districts were amalgamated under the old code.  The agricultural grant for rural district charges was therefore dealt with in the same way by an adaptation order&mdash;the Local Government (Application and Adaptation of Enactments) Order, 1925&mdash;which Order was again laid before both Houses and was allowed to become on statutory force without comment.  In the rate for last year all the agricultural grant was legally treated as a grant for all the agricultural land in the county on an equal basis.  Subsections (5) and (6) do not purport to make any change in this respect, but only provide a new method of giving the agricultural land this benefit without altering the principle.  That new method, which Senator Linehan's amendment makes impossible, would have saved some £30,000 to the rates each year.  The Senator cited a number of figures which gave a wholly <Col N="199" /> wrong idea of the change.  He has mentioned a number of rural districts in which the agricultural ratepayers will lose by the pooling of the grant. It will be found that in every such case these ratepayers have already benefited to a greater extent by the pooling of the expenditure which the grant is intended to relieve.</P>
    <P>Figures are available of the reduction and increase of the rates in the various unions caused by the charging of the union expenditure on the county. To take cases mentioned by the Senator:&mdash;</P>

    <P>It will be seen that whereas the Unions of Dunmanway and Clonakilty have to bear a greatly increased expenditure for Castletown, the Senator wishes to preserve to Castletown their large share of the grant.  The same applies in the other two cases and to the pooling of the expenditure which was charged on the rural district.  It would be better to postpone the benefits of the Bill for a year than to introduce such a change.  It would completely destroy the whole value of the two sections, and accordingly it would be necessary for me, if the Bill passes the Seanad in this form, to ask the Dáil to throw it out.</P>

      <P>After that explanation the whole subject assumes a different complexion, but I think the Minister is largely responsible for our failure to understand the position.

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  In this matter the Minister has been legislating by Order up to the present. He has repealed a very important section of the 1898 Act by simply laying an Order on the Table of the House.  As you know, sir, several of these Orders are not noticed by Senators.  The titles of some of them would not indicate what they really contained.  I take up the Order that was made on the Local Government Act of 1925, and the heading of that Order which deals with the agricultural grants as it appeared in the Agenda sent to Senators was simply this: &ldquo;The Local Government (Application and Adaptation of Enactments) Order, 1925.&rdquo;  There is not a word about making a change in the agricultural grant.  I hold that if it is necessary to make a change in any Act of Parliament the proper thing to do is to bring forward a Bill and let it be discussed by the House.  In making this Order it is very doubtful whether the <Col N="201" /> Minister had full legal power to do so, because the section under which he has that power says that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health may by order do amongst other matters the following: that is to say, apply to the boards of health any existing enactment relating to the county councils or district councils with such modifications as he shall deem necessary. It appears now that when we gave power to the Minister in any of the Acts that have been passed to make Orders, surely we did not intend these Orders to mean a repeal of very important enactments without notice to the House?</P>

      <P>I am afraid it comes to that, Senator.  I may say it has been the subject of very grave concern and complaint on the part of people in England&mdash;this growing tendency of giving Ministers this <i>carte blanche</i> in the making of Orders, for it is largely doing away with the necessity for legislation, and it is very difficult, as you yourself have found, to pick out a piece of legislation in one of these Orders which otherwise seems innocuous.  That, however, is not the fault of the Minister but of the Seanad, if they do not restrict his power of making Orders.  As long as the Minister has the power he is entitled to exercise it.</P>

      <P>The agricultural grant fixed at that date now forms the basis of several other matters, such as the fixing of the judicial rents, and the annuities which are based on the judicial rents.  It is a very serious thing to make a change in the amount of the agricultural grant given to any rural district.  I think it would be quite easy for the Minister to work out a simple scheme of keeping the accounts of the county councils without interfering with the existing rights of ratepayers in certain rural districts to the agricultural grants which were allotted to them in 1898.</P>

If the House is satisfied that the amendment moved to-day is wrong, as they seem to think it is, they ought to restore themselves to a position of logic and good sense by going back on what they did yesterday.

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(9) Sub-section 3 of Section 69 of the Principal Act shall be amended by the deletion of the words &ldquo;the Housing of the Working-Classes (Ireland) Acts, 1883-1919,&rdquo; and the sub-section as so amended shall apply as from the passing of this Act to any house erected under the aforesaid Acts.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is for the purpose of dealing equitably with people who occupy similar types of houses.  There seemed to be some confusion in the minds of members of the House yesterday when I spoke on this particular subject.  In order to try and make myself perfectly clear in the matter it will be necessary for me to go into some details.  First I have to call the attention of Senators to the Housing (Building Facilities) Act, 1924.  Under Section 2 of that Act provision was made that the Minister for Finance would have power to grant from moneys out of the Exchequer a sum of £100 to a local authority, or to a <Col N="204" /> private individual, or to a public utility society, who would build houses of a certain type.  In addition to that under Section 6 of the Act the local authorities were empowered to make a grant equivalent to the grant that was made by the Minister for Finance to a private individual, or to a public utility society, for the purpose of erecting houses that would comply with the requirements of the Act.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, under Section 7 of that Act, power was given to the local authority to grant remission of rates spread over a period of twenty years, commencing with the payment of five per cent. of the total rates in the first year, and increasing by five per cent. each year, until at the end of the twentieth year the remission of rates disappeared.  Under Section 3 of the 1925 Act provision was made to make similar grants by the State to a local authority, a private individual, or a public utility society to build houses. Under the second schedule of the Act the amounts stated were: to a local authority, £100, for the building of a five-roomed house; to a private individual, or speculative builder, £75, for a five-roomed house; to a public utility society, £100, for a five-roomed house. Under the 1925 Act, as under the 1924 Act, local authorities were empowered to make similar grants to private individuals, speculative builders and public utility societies, as those given by the State.  In addition, under the 1925 Act the remission of rates was continued over a period of 20 years. Then we come to the Local Government Act of 1925, and as was explained yesterday, on the Report Stage of this Bill a section was introduced which gave power for the remission of rates on new buildings, but it deliberately cut out houses built under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, and the Building Facilities Acts. I am afraid that Senators yesterday did not clearly understand the position or the sense of my amendment, and I want to state clearly and frankly what I seek to achieve&mdash;that there shall be the same equity and justice for the class of people I am pleading for as is being given to others.  Before I sit down I hope to be able to convince the <Col N="205" /> House of the reasonableness and justice of the case I am putting forward.</P>
    <P>When the new section was being introduced into the Local Government Act of 1925, I tried to make a case that justice was not being done all round. There was misapprehension on the part of some Senators with regard to the point I endeavoured to make.  Apparently, Senators at that time thought, and are still of the opinion, that the people who occupy the houses built by the local authority under these Building Facilities Acts, are in a similar position to that of tenants prior to 1922.  I want to point out that people in occupation of houses built by the local authority since 1922 are not in the position of tenants at all, but of owner-occupiers.  They are in an identical position with the tenant farmers who bought their holdings under the various Land Acts.  They did not enter their houses as weekly tenants, but they entered after signing an agreement to purchase the house for a specified sum, and whether they pay weekly or monthly or annually their payments are annuities and not rents. The Dublin Corporation, before the Commissioners came into being, fixed the price of those houses and told the tenants they would have to pay so much per week or per month or per annum for repayment of principal and interest, and, in addition, the current rates on the proper valuation of the houses, as well as the ground rents, and also be responsible for maintenance. After 40 years they will be the owners of those houses, just like the tenant farmers who bought under the Land Acts, when they have their annuities paid.</P>
    <P>Under the 1924 and 1925 Acts the local authorities were given power, and it was mandatory if the Minister so desired, to grant remission of rates, and I venture to say that in every case, practically, since 1924, where a house has been built either by a building speculator, a private individual or a public utility society, the remission of rates has been given, as well as the subsidy. I want Senators to get out of their minds that the occupier of a house built by the local authority has got the subsidy and that that is his share.  I <Col N="206" /> want to point out the distinction that was made in connection with the occupier of a house built by a private individual, a building speculator, or a public utility society, who also got the subsidy.  The public utility society houses got their subsidy of £200.  The tenants of houses built by a local authority got the benefit of the subsidy when the purchase price was being fixed.  The argument is that if you give to one set of tenants a remission of rates for twenty years on a similar type of house built under similar Acts, it is unjust if you do not give the occupiers of the houses built by the local authority the same remission.</P>
    <P>I shall give the Seanad a concrete case.  At Marino the municipality have built over a thousand houses and the occupiers of those houses have got the benefit of the subsidy, but have not got the benefit of the remission of rates. A public utility society, with the establishment of which I had something to do, and which was formed by a trade union, has also built houses at Marino, and got the subsidy for them, and the occupiers of those houses get the benefit of the remission of rates.  So that you have on one side of the road occupiers of houses getting the remission of rates as well as the subsidy, and on the other side occupiers who got the subsidy but do not get the remission of rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. The position is somewhat different in these cases.  In one case the houses were built by the municipality out of <Col N="207" /> a grant given under the Building Facilities Acts under which a subsidy was given.  On the other hand, you have houses built by a public utility society, each member of which, in order to get a house, had to find a certain amount of money.  They have paid in a certain amount of capital into the funds of the society.  Their case is not on all-fours with the other.  In the other case the purchase price is fixed by the municipality and instalments have to be paid over a period of forty years to pay off the principal and interest.  In addition to that, they have to pay the current rates and ground rent.  What arrangement the society is making I do not know.  In the case of the tenants I speak of, at Marino, the instalments are as high as 17/3 per week&mdash;I do not know that the instalments on the other houses are so high, but I have no hesitation in saying that they are entitled to the remission of rates.</P>

      <P>They are separate, but they are paid in bulk.  To prove that the rates are paid by the occupiers, I may say that when the reduction in the rates took place the instalments were reduced.  Is not that clear evidence that they pay their full rates?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">

      <P>I think that cannot be contradicted.  When the reduction in the rates took place there was a reduction in the weekly or monthly payments made by these people.  I may say that I have had considerable difficulty in trying to frame an amendment to cover what I wanted.  The whole matter is complicated.  You have to deal with the 1924 and 1925 Housing Acts, the Local Government Act of 1925 and the present Bill.  I think, however, that the amendment I am proposing will do justice all round.  Senator Brown, when moving the insertion of the Section in the 1925 Act, was under a misapprehension with regard to the real position.  When he considers the matter I think he will agree with the case I am putting forward, that unless this or a similar amendment <Col N="208" /> is passed, we are doing an injustice to one section of the community.  We are all anxious that proper houses should be provided to house the working classes.  I believe that practically all the social evils from which we suffer are bound up with this question of housing.  In 99.9 per cent. of cases where working-class families have been given decent houses to live in, the whole character of living of those families has been changed for the better.  Anyone who has visited any of these new dwellings in Dublin will be amazed at the change that has taken place in the manner in which these families live now as compared with the time when they lived in the slums.  I am one of the pioneers in this question of the purchasing of these houses by occupiers. I believe it is a good thing to have these people purchasing the houses and owning them, because it tends to make them good citizens.  If, however, investigations are made by the Local Government Department it will be found that even the best of these people find themselves unable to meet the payments for the houses because of the high rates they have to pay.  The people who inhabit these houses have all very large families and the wages they receive at present are not sufficient to enable them to pay 17/3 per week.  I am endeavouring to ease that burden a little for the sake of everybody concerned.  I hope I have made the position quite clear&mdash;it is full of complications and technicalities&mdash; but I have endeavoured to explain it as well as I could.  I think Senators will understand my point, that I want the same facilities for people living in houses built by the municipality as regards the remission of rates as are given to people living in other houses that got a similar subsidy and are also getting the remission of rates.</P>

      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy and I believe a number of Senators have great sympathy with what Senator Farren wants to do but I would like to call attention to the form of his amendment.  It is to delete from Section 69 (3) of the Act of 1925 <Col N="209" /> the words &ldquo;the Housing of the Working-Classes (Ireland) Acts.&rdquo;  That does not touch what we did yesterday when we inserted a new Section 12 in the present Bill.  The exclusion of the Housing of the Working-Classes Acts appears in that Clause 12 as well as in Section 69 of the Act of 1925.  So far as the amendment is concerned, in its present shape what it would really do would be to give retrospective effect to what the Senator is so anxious to have done in Section 69 of the Act of 1925 while not affecting the clause inserted in the Bill yesterday which also excludes houses built under the Housing of the Working-Classes Acts from the benefit of this Act.  The only benefit they will get in the section that we passed yesterday is in the case of houses built after the passing of this Act and before the 30th October, 1930, and also any houses at present in existence that may have been improved or enlarged in that period.  I do not know whether I have made myself clear.  What I want the Senator to understand is that I think the form of his amendment is defective.  I think it would create a great deal of confusion if you try to give retrospective effect to this relief; that is, to try to carry it back.</P>

      <P>The main point that the Senator made and the one that impressed me at the outset as rather important was that you had houses apparently of the same kind erected side by side at Marino and that in the one case the remission of rates applied and in the other it did not, and that that was a very inequitable proceeding.  The Senator omitted to inform us that the provisions under which they were constructed were quite different.  In one case where the Corporation had constructed the houses they did so at a cost of £750.  They were sold on a basis of £440, which meant that the purchase price was only four-sevenths of the cost.  In the other case the houses only came in under the ordinary Building Acts and only got a grant of £100 with the remission of the rates.  I think anybody will see that, if anything the houses built by the local authority were much the better bargain, and why put them in a still more favourable position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not know what the cost price was of the houses built by the Public Utility Society, but I know that in the case of St. Barnabas's Utility Society they received in addition to the £100 from the State £100 from the municipality.  I state that definitely.  I state, further, that some of the societies having got £100 from the State, plus £100 from the municipality, also got facilities in the way of loans from the municipality.  They got roadways made and things like that, and they got their drainage constructed. So I think if you count the whole lot up there will not be much difference between the two sets of houses, considering that the one in addition to everything else got their roads and drains.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that would assist you in the matter because the period of repayment may be different.  There are different periods although they are almost similar types of houses.  One may be slightly better than the others but I do not think that the amount of the repayment would explain. Some of the payments may be spread over a thirty or thirty-five year period and the payments in the case of the municipal houses are spread over 40 years.  If a person was able to put £50 down it might alter the price. The whole thing is complicated but the amount of the instalment does not affect the question.</P>
