    <Title>Road Traffic Bill, 1933&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Any member of the Gárda Síochána may request any person driving a mechanically-propelled vehicle or producing his driving licence at a Gárda Síochána station in pursuance of the next preceding section to sign his name in a book and with a pencil to be provided by such member and at the place in such book indicated by such member, and if such person on being so requested and on being provided with such book and pencil refuses or neglects to sign his name in such book or with such pencil or at the place in such book indicated by such member he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 27:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 40.  To delete lines 5 to 9 inclusive and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;and if such person being so requested and on being provided with a book and pencil refuses or neglects to sign his name in such book at the place indicated&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section to my mind ought to be entirely recast, though the amendment does not attempt to do anything of that kind.  If Senators will read the section they will be tempted to think that it emanated from Jimmy O'Dea or some other pantomimist.  (<i>Section read.</i>)  It is going to be a penalty for a man, on being asked to sign his name in a book, if he signs it with his own fountain pen.  He must sign it with a pencil to be provided by the Guard.  I think if the intention is to be very precise, it should say, &ldquo;the pencil shall <Col N="1598" /> be duly sharpened by the Guard.&rdquo;  It does not do that.  It does not say what kind the pencil is to be.  If the person who is being requested to sign happens to be a sign-writer, he will assume that the pencil is a sign-writer's pencil, and not a lead pencil.  In general the whole section seems to lend itself to derision and contempt.  Seriously, I think the question has to be faced: what is the intention?  I take it that the object of asking a man to sign his name is so that it may be compared with the signature on the driving licence. Surely it would be better, for the purpose of comparison, if the signature was written in some medium in which the signature of the driving licence was written.  That is to say, if ink is available, and if the signature on the licence is an ink signature, it would be an advantage, for the purpose of comparison, if the signature requested by the Guards should also be an ink signature.  But by this section we prohibit accepting a signature written in ink.  My amendment wants to take away from the arrested person, or from the person being asked to sign his name, the excuse of saying that he has no pencil, or no pen.  If he refuses, on being presented with a pencil, he will be guilty of an offence.  It does not leave the section in such a way, that the person who is held up by a Guard must sign his name with a pencil to be provided by the Guard.  I think that is bringing the statute into a certain amount of contempt.  Another matter which does not arise directly from my amendment, but appertains to the section is this, and I put it to the Minister, that a Guard might utilise the section to compel a man driving a motor-car to put his signature to a blank cheque, in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Any member of the Gárda Síochána may request any person driving a mechanically propelled vehicle to sign his name in a book, and with a pencil to be provided by such member, and at the place in such book to be provided by such member, a blank cheque book, and, if he refuses to sign he will be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Of course, that shows the absurdity of the section as it stands.  Really it ought to be recast, with the object of <Col N="1599" /> providing that the book, if it is in a Gárda station, should be a register. If a Guard is to be given the duty of holding up people on the roads, in order to examine licences, and to check the signatures with the licences, he should have a properly drawn up book for that purpose.  I do not know why the device of photographs should not be used.  But that is apart from this section.  I hold that the section ought to be entirely recast, and made much simpler and more direct.  Short of that my amendment wants to make it possible for a man to sign his name in the way he is accustomed to signing it, and, if he has a fountain pen, to sign with a fountain pen and to remove any excuse for refusing to sign on the ground that he had not a pencil or a pen.  Certainly, as the section stands it seems to be very trivial and to be unnecessarily detailed. In the details it gives an opportunity for misuse by a Guard who might be a villain.  Generally the section seems to me to leave itself open, not only to abuse, but to make a laughing stock of the whole statute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the amendment proposed by Senator Johnson would have the effect that he wishes, when he says that he desires to make this section more direct and more explicit.  If there is any fault to be found with the section as it stands, it is that it is so direct and so definite.  The removal of the words that the Senator suggests would leave it vague and indeterminate, and might leave loopholes for all sorts of difficulties to be put in the way of the officer who desired to get the signature of an individual motorist he stops on a road or elsewhere. The point mentioned by the Senator, that some man might produce a sign-writer's pencil, is more against him that in his favour.  That is the difficulty we want to guard against&mdash; people setting out to do freak things of that kind.  I think it is just as likely that a Civic Guard will act with common sense, as it is that a motorist will act with common sense. <Col N="1600" /> Unquestionably, there are difficulties in the matter of getting signatures, but in order to prevent freakishness, and to make the thing as simple and as direct as possible, this wording was selected.  It has been discussed by the officials in conjunction with the legal advisers, and the draftsman. Other wordings were suggested when the Bill was before the Dáil, but after discussion, the other amendments were generally withdrawn.  We realise that it is a ticklish kind of section, and one that may raise difficulties.  It is to prevent difficulties, and to make it as direct and as simple as possible, that the matter has been set down in detail in this fashion.  If there is any common sense left in the country from the point of view of the Civic Guards or the motoring public, I think that the matter will work out simply enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's defence, a very common defence, is that one has to assume that a man will act with common sense.  If men were going to act with common sense in every case, there would be no necessity for this Bill at all.  It is to deal with people who are not going to act with common sense that these statutes are set up.  My objection is to putting the ordinary civilian in the position of being an offender against a statute that is passed by the Oireachtas and liable to a penalty of £5 for preferring to sign his name with a fountain pen of his own rather than with a pencil provided by the Guards. That is the effect of the section and I for one object to putting into a statute, for which I have any responsibility, such a provision.  If nobody else in the House has any feeling in the matter I am not going to force my opinions on the House but I have made my protest and I stand by the protest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 28:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 46, sub-section (2), to delete in line ten the words &ldquo;thirty-five&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;thirty&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is intended to substitute a speed of 30 miles per hour for 35 miles per hour which is the rate set down in the Bill.  I do not know whether in this connection I could quote a certain Dublin paper with approval but recently it had in its leading article some information in regard to the mortality arising out of motor accidents and it said that if as many cattle died from foot-and-mouth disease as children and other persons were injured in motor accidents, legislation to deal with the matter would not be delayed for a single week.  It is idle to tell people like me that speed does not add to the danger of motoring. It does add to the danger.  I have been in two motor accidents and I am happy to say that we were lucky enough on both occasions to be going <Col N="1602" /> slowly.  I do not think I would be here to move any amendments if we had been going at a rate of 35 miles an hour.  In addition much danger is occasioned owing to the vibration caused by heavy vehicles.  We are dealing with heavy vehicles in this section. When these vehicles are travelling between walls and between buildings the danger in increased.  I need not refer to the splashing of walls which is responsible for disfiguring many building in our cities and towns.  I base this amendment entirely on the increased mortality arising from motor accidents and I ask the House to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment and my only objection to it is that it does not go far enough.  I think it would be wise for the Minister at a later stage to introduce a Government amendment to keep all motor driven vehicles down to a certain speed limit.  Senator Dowdall has given an instance of the harm that is being done by high speed.  I might say that the other evening I was standing in a field about 50 yards from the road when a four-ton lorry passed along travelling at about 30 miles an hour.  At that point, 50 yards from the road, I could feel the vibration caused by that vehicle.  Such a speed must be very injurious to the road, particularly to the foundation of the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I also desire to support the amendment.  I live in the country close to a main road and my experience is, that having regard to the increasing volume of traffic, the speeds at which many motorists travel are highly dangerous.  Now that legislation is being enacted to deal with traffic generally I think that we should endeavour to restrict the tendency towards increased speed and so ensure the safety of human lives and the protection of pedestrians.  I think that the whole danger in motoring and the increased number of accidents have to be attributed to the speed at which many drivers travel and it is our duty to see that that danger is minimised. Like Senator Dowdall I had two or three very narrow escapes when motoring.  I attribute that to the slow <Col N="1603" /> rate at which we were driving around bends in the road.  If it had not been for the slow rate at which we were travelling, the car coming in the opposite direction would have smashed our car in pieces.  There is a tendency even with buses to travel at an enormous speed.  I went home yesterday evening on a bus and I am sure it travelled at not less than 40 miles an hour over a good portion of the road, but it was a good straight road.  The tendency with bus drivers is to prevent any other vehicle passing them out with the result that there is a sort of competition between buses in speed.  That is a tendency that should be stopped and buses should be compelled to reduce their speed wherever necessary.  I heartily support the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardBigger" hpid="Sir E. Bigger Sir E. Bigger">
      <NameTxt>Sir E. Bigger</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in supporting the amendment.  Take a road such as that from Dublin to Dalkey.  It is not by any means a straight road.  There are a great many bends on it and it is very narrow in certain places.  It would be positively dangerous for a vehicle of this kind to travel at 35 miles an hour on such a road.  I think that a 30 miles limit is quite a moderate suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the amendment.  All the danger in this traffic is due to speed.  There are times when it may be safe for a car to travel at a high speed but the danger arises when approaching a cross-roads. When I am approaching a cross-roads or coming on to a main road, I drive as slowly as I possibly can and I look in both directions along the main road to see if I have time to turn.  If I see no other car approaching I proceed to turn but frequently other cars come upon me before I have turned although they were not in sight when I first looked.  They are on top of me in the next minute because of the extraordinary speed at which they travel. Some of them travel not only at 30 miles but up to 35 and 40 miles.  I have seen two buses and a car trying to pass one another on the road at the same time.  There is then no room for any other vehicle to pass in the opposite direction.  I think that is an <Col N="1604" /> extremely dangerous practice.  I do not see any necessity for anybody to travel at a greater speed than 30 miles an hour.  We were quite content to travel at seven or eight miles an hour in the old horse days.  Now we want to jump up to 40 miles an hour and it is quite unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a very necessary amendment both in the interests of human life and private property.  I think many accidents occur because of fast driving and if we fix a high speed it would give great encouragement to young people to indulge in practices of this sort.  I hope the amendment will be accepted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that inserting a speed of 35 miles requires a good deal of justification from the Minister having regard to the report of the Departmental Committee in which it was suggested that the maximum speeds for heavy motor vehicles, such as buses and chara-a-banc of the single-deck type, should be 25 miles an hour.  The amendment suggests 30 and the Bill says 35.  If the Inter-Departmental Committee saw justification for recommending a 25 limit, it would require a very good deal of argument from the Minister to justify 35 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that the whole House is against me on this amendment.  Nevertheless I feel inclined to defend it.  When the Bill was originally introduced two years ago a limit of 25 miles an hour was put into it.  There was a considerable <Col N="1605" /> amount of discussion and the Minister at the time brought in an amendment and made it 35.  After a very full discussion in the Dáil the 35-mile limit was accepted.  They, of course, realised that the report of the Committee on which this Bill was founded recommended that 25 miles per hour should be the maximum for buses, but that was five years ago.  I think motoring has speeded up considerably since that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Seanad is inclined to go slower than the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what strikes me, that the Seanad, whether it be due to its wisdom or otherwise, is inclined to go slower than the Dáil in this matter.  The point that appeals to me at the moment, making a defence for this, is that after all, if I may say so with all respect, every Senator has his own motor car and the bus is the poor man's motor car.  He may require at times to travel at 35 miles quite as much as a Senator may like to travel at 50 miles.  I hope I am not making a charge against any individual member of the Seanad, but I am sure that on occasions they have driven up to 50 miles per hour in their cars if only in an attempt to reach the Seanad in time for prayers.  The section does not propose to allow buses to go at 35 miles an hour all the time.  That is put in as a maximum.  There are places and occasions governed by certain sections of the Bill where even 30 miles an hour would be regarded as a dangerous speed.  There are regulations to prevent a man going at anything like 30 miles an hour.  Take the Dalkey road to which Senator Bigger referred. That is one of the busiest roads in the country, and 30 miles an hour would certainly be a dangerous speed on it at certain times of the day.  I am told that buses go at 40 miles an hour.  I have heard, as Senator Counihan has suggested, they have done even a greater speed than that.  On the whole I think that 35 miles an hour as <Col N="1606" /> a maximum would not be too much considering the very strict laws and regulations that will be made to govern certain areas and certain conditions of traffic.  As I have said we have no special view on this beyond the consensus of opinion of the Oireachtas, but it does appear to me personally that 35 miles an hour, as a maximum, is not too great even for a bus.</P>
      <P>In Dublin, for instance, buses are every day becoming more and more the medium of transport for great numbers of people at certain periods of the day for getting to their offices and to their homes.  They are in great demand in the mornings and at dinner hour.  A speed of 35 miles an hour would be dangerous in certain areas in and around the City of Dublin, but there are times, I think, when it should be allowed.  It is unquestionable that when you have too high a speed the risks are very great, but I put it to the House that 35 miles an hour as a maximum for buses is not too great, considering that 50 miles an hour in the case of private motor cars on certain roads is quite common nowadays. Certainly, 40 miles an hour is quite common in the case of private motor cars.  In view of the fact that a very big section of people in Dublin use buses nowadays and that we have speeded up in the last five years since this report on traffic was adopted and published, I think 35 miles an hour, as a maximum, would not be too great.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>But that in no way detracts from my fairly intimate knowledge of the numbers of accidents that arise from buses and motors.  I am connected with insurance and I would like the Minister and his advisers&mdash;the information available would, I think, be a revelation to them&mdash;to make fairly minute inquiries into the rate at which motors can <Col N="1607" /> insure.  I think the Minister will find that his 30 or 35 miles an hour, and what he said about speeding up, is not viewed with any satisfaction by the people who have to foot the bill in cases of accidents.  In fact there are a great many motor companies that cannot get insured at all at present. The Minister tells us that we have speeded up in the last five years.  I can tell him that we have speeded up in accidents, too.  In view of that I intend to press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>

I want to point out to him that the average speed for many long distance trains&mdash;I am leaving out express trains&mdash;is 30 miles an hour.  These trains run on an iron road with perfect safety.  In view of that, I do not think buses should be allowed to go at the speed he mentioned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 31:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 51, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;place&rdquo; in line 55 to insert the words &ldquo;recklessly or.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to insert the word &ldquo;recklessly,&rdquo; so that the section will read: &ldquo;Every person who drives a vehicle in a public place or at a speed or in a manner,&rdquo; and so on.  The section as it stands does not use the word &ldquo;recklessly.&rdquo;  It says that &ldquo;Every person who drives a vehicle in a public place at a speed or in a manner which, having regard to all the circumstances of the case... is dangerous to the public,&rdquo; and so on.  I do not know why the word &ldquo;recklessly&rdquo; has been omitted.  It is contained in the recommendations of the Committee and is in the existing law on the matter.  To leave out the word &ldquo;recklessly&rdquo; modifies, I think, this measure detrimentally. I suggest it is wrong for a person to drive a car recklessly in any case, whether at a slow speed or at a high speed, and that it is not enough to say it is an offence to drive in a manner which, having regard to the circumstances of the case, is dangerous to the public.  Reckless driving should be an offence.  I may be met with the contention that if a car is driven in a manner which is dangerous to the public that is equal to being driven <Col N="1609" /> recklessly.  I think that point is not a good one because to prove whether a car would have been dangerous to the public, driven in the manner in which it was driven, might be very difficult, whereas reckless driving should be an offence without having to prove that that the public was in danger.  I make the point that a passenger even in a private motor car has to be considered. I question very much whether danger to a passenger in a private car driven recklessly would be covered by the term &ldquo;danger to the public.&rdquo;  I want to make it clear that if a car is driven recklessly it is an offence, and that if we leave out that word we are leaving it open for a car to be driven recklessly. I submit that the proof that it was dangerous to the public should not lie on the prosecution.  A passenger in a private motor car, a friend of the driver's, might not be deemed to be a member of the public, and if the car is driven recklessly to the danger of that passenger there is no offence under the section as it stands.  In the recommendations of the Committee, and in the existing law under the British Act, reckless driving is an offence and I think it ought to have been made an offence under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I have the same object in view as Senator Johnson.  When I read the section amended by the insertion of the words &ldquo;recklessly or&rdquo; I came to the conclusion that this would be an example which rather frequently occurs in legislation where a strong word weakens a section.  If Senators will look at the section they will understand what I mean.  The word &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; has a special meaning in the law, and for this reason that if a person by reckless driving injures another he becomes criminally liable. The section as amended by the insertion of the words proposed would, I submit, leave in the minds of the Tribunal construing the section that the legislature intended that the class of driving sought to be prohibited was driving which was in the nature of reckless driving because the phrase &ldquo;at a speed or in a manner dangerous to the public&rdquo; would be construed as being <i>in pari materia</i> with the word &ldquo;reckless&rdquo;.  Taking the section as <Col N="1610" /> it stands, without the use of the word &ldquo;reckless,&rdquo; an offence is committed if the speed is such, or the manner of driving is such, apart altogether from speed, as to be likely to cause danger to the public. That leaves in the Tribunal a very wide discretion.  The Tribunal can convict for an offence under that section although a man may not be driving recklessly.  It is for these reasons that I think the use of the word &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; in this section would really defeat the object the Senator has in view.  It is simply for that reason that I would be inclined to oppose this amendment, having the same object in view as the Senator, and knowing, as I do, the construction put on the word &ldquo;reckless,&rdquo; which brings this offence at once from the character of a civil wrong into the character of a criminal offence. Everybody knows that the evidence required in a case where a crime is imputed must be much stronger than in a case where merely a civil wrong is sought to be redressed.  If the Senator would consider these matters he might not press that amendment.</P>

      <P>I should certainly like to hear another lawyer confirming or otherwise the arguments made by the Senator who has just sat down.  I can understand that kind of a case being made to a court by the Senator speaking in another capacity to prove that a man was not driving to the danger of the public although he may have been driving recklessly, if the section remains as it is, but he is not very convincing when I note the fact that other draftsmen, on more than one occasion in other parliaments have had this matter before them and have decided, time after time, that the word &ldquo;recklessly&rdquo; should be inserted.  In the law as it stands and in the British Road Traffic Act, after quite a number of years' experience, they inserted these words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If any person drives a motor vehicle on the road recklessly or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that they had all the legal considerations before them that the Senator has put before the House <Col N="1611" /> and yet, despite that, they re-inserted this word &ldquo;recklessly&rdquo; not believing that it was weakening the section.  I am far from being convinced by the argument the Senator has raised.  I think that, on the contrary, the section as it stands is distinctly weakening the existing law in regard to driving.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;recklessly&rdquo; was deliberately left out of this section by the draftsman and by everybody concerned.  In our view, &ldquo;recklessly&rdquo; refers to a state of mind and it is difficult to prove the state of mind of the driver.  It is difficult to prove that he was in a reckless state of mind.  We have in the section everything necessary to prove that he drove in a manner dangerous to the public and that that would cover reckless driving.  But recklessness in driving is a state of mind which is not easy to prove and it has led to a great many appeals in the British courts.  It is in the British Act but we believe that our section is an improvement on the British section dealing with this matter and that it is more easy to prove &ldquo;driving dangerously to the public.&rdquo;  With regard to the point made by Senator Johnson, that a driver might drive to the danger of a person sitting in his car, if he was he would certainly be driving to the danger of the public and is covered by this section, but if he is driving recklessly somebody has got to prove it. We have put in the section enough to enable an officer of the law to prove that he drove to the danger of the public, in some way endangering life or property, but we claim that recklessness is much more difficult to prove and it would not be so easy to get a conviction as it would be under the section as we have set it out here.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to take the same view as the Minister and the last speech of Senator Johnson has convinced me that the Minister is right, because the Senator says that driving at 70 miles an hour is driving recklessly.  I think I am correct in stating, that, under the present law there is a speed limit which is not enforced in the strict sense of the word. It is already illegal to drive recklessly and we know quite well that the weakness has been that it is practically impossible to prove that a person is driving recklessly and the number of convictions has been very small indeed. When taking away the speed limit, it was necessary to provide some kind of offence which would not necessarily be a criminal offence, or of the same category, but which could be dealt with drastically.  Senator Johnson's idea of driving recklessly is driving at 70 miles an hour, but I do not think he would be able to persuade everybody that that is driving recklessly.  In the vast majority of cars, it would be driving dangerously to the public, without the slightest doubt.  There may be, conceivably, cars and places in which that would not be driving to the danger of the public but, generally speaking, there would be no doubt that it is.  My own feeling is that, if you leave the law as it stands, in regard to &ldquo;driving recklessly&rdquo; in the very few cases in which you can get convictions, you will get them, but the somewhat lesser convictions under this Act will be far easier than if you include the word &ldquo;recklessly.&rdquo;</P>

My recollection is that he was very strongly in favour of allowing the law to remain as it stands as so many cases have been before the courts on the matter and it had been discussed so often and definite decisions by different courts had been given.  Speaking from recollection, it was his view, as it was the view of others, also, that it would be better to leave the law as it stands.</P>

      <P>This is the section dealing with the insurance of motor vehicles.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he has had brought to his mind the question that the injured person, in the case of a motor accident, should be subrogated to the rights of the insured person, in other words that the insurance money should be available as a fund to meet the damages which the injured person sustains?  My reason for mentioning the matter is this: Suppose an insolvent person is insured for, say <Col N="1618" /> £1,000 and he runs down another person and damages of £800 or £900 are awarded.</P>
      <P>The £1,000 insurance is payable to the person who is insured.  In case he is insolvent, his other creditors will come in and share in the amount of that insurance, so that only a poundage will be paid to the person who has been injured and who recovers damages.  That, I think, is the legal position at present.  I do not know whether the Minister can make any arrangement to rectify that.  It has happened more than once that the person who got damages against another had not been able to recover the full amount of his damages, even though the person who caused the injury was insured.  I have had some cases of that class myself, and there has been a curiously large number of cases in which that state of affairs has arisen. I think that that ought to be dealt with.  This compulsory insurance is intended to be a protection to the public who are run down by reckless and insolvent drivers.  It is no real protection so long as the other creditors of the person who causes the injury can come in and share in the amount of the insurance.  I do not know whether it will be easy to remedy that state of the law.  I am sure the Minister has considered it and endeavoured to make arrangements accordingly.  I think that an effort, at least, ought to be made to remedy that position.  It is for that reason that I call attention at the appropriate place in the Bill to what is, in many cases, a crying evil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ascertain from the Minister if steps have been taken to deal with another problem arising out of insurance&mdash;that is, to meet the claims of people who have suffered loss by reason of accidents to themselves or to their breadwinners. The principle of compulsory third-party insurance has been introduced in <Col N="1619" /> this Bill, and I should like to know if any provision has been made for securing that, when a vehicle is insured, it is properly insured.  A couple of years ago a dreadful accident occurred to a bus in Dublin.  Some of the passengers lost their lives, while others were maimed for life.  Not a single penny of compensation was paid to the dependents of those who lost their lives or to those who were injured.  It transpired afterwards that the bus was insured but that the manner of insurance was not correct, with the result that the company with whom the insurance was entered into got off scot free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advocating for many years in this House and outside it compulsory third-party insurance for every mechanical vehicle.  It is dreadful to contemplate that an accident may happen, through carelessness or otherwise, to one of these buses and that four or five breadwinners may lose their lives, leaving widows and orphans without any means of subsistence. The law should protect passengers and should secure that, under whatever policy of insurance has been entered into, compensation will be paid to those entitled to it.  For those who may be maimed for life, there is what is known as &ldquo;home help,&rdquo; but no decent, respectable, working-class man or woman wants to go through the procedure they have to go through in order to get home help.  I admit there are tremendous difficulties in the way&mdash; that each individual is responsible for the insurance of his own vehicle&mdash;but some legislation ought to be introduced whereby an insurance company which issues a third-party policy should accept the risks attaching to it and that it should be their responsibility to see, when the car is being insured, that everything is in order with regard to the particulars.  The Minister ought to consider this matter seriously.  It is a very important point.  I know the Minister is sympathetic to the point of view I have put forward.  If the matter is not covered, I am satisfied, from what I know of the Minister, that he will take the necessary steps <Col N="1620" /> so far as the law permits to see that the necessary provision is made.</P>

      <P>I think that the point raised by Senator Farren is dealt with in the Bill.  I should like, however, the Minister to deal with the point in reply, because I want to get clear on the matter.  Once the Bill becomes law, nobody can drive a car without having the certificate of an insurance company that he is insured as required by this Act.  Is it clear that when an insurance company issues that certificate they will be liable for any damage caused to third parties notwithstanding any flaw that may subsequently be found in the insurance?  That point is not as clear as it ought to be in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>They go on charging the same price year after year, so that, eventually, the yearly insurance is more, perhaps, than the value of the car.  If insurance companies are making large profits, the least they can do is to compensate those who have suffered by these third-party accidents. We ought not to be too favourable to these insurance people.  They are making large sums of money and we ought to press them.</P>

      <P>In reference to what Senator Douglas has said, I should like to be satisfied that the issue of the certificate will preclude the insurance company from making any legal objection to the validity of the <Col N="1621" /> insurance.  I should be surprised to hear that that point has been as fully covered as it ought to be.  I hope the Minister will elucidate the matter further.  A policy is always issued subject to conditions.  They are called &ldquo;conditions of the policy&rdquo;.  If these conditions are not fulfilled or if there is any fraud in reference to the particulars, insurance law, which is contained in a great number of statutes, protects the insurance company and prevents the recovery of the amount of the insurance.  The law in regard to fraud on insurance companies and in regard to breach of condition in an insurance policy has been very strictly construed both on the civil side and on the criminal side of the courts.  It is only a few days since we had a criminal proceeding against a person for giving fraudulent particulars and for breach of condition. Therefore, I think that the issue by an insurance company of a certificate that a car is insured would not be sufficient to bind the insurance company if the insurance were obtained by a fraudulent statement or if a condition of the insurance were broken.  As the matter has been raised by Senator Farren and spoken to by Senator Douglas, it would be well that it should be set finally at rest.  It can only be set finally at rest by making the insurance company which issues the certificate liable for the amount of the insurance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The question which has been raised is bigger than it appears to be.  An insurance company may be quite honest, it may not be attempting to get away from its liability by a side-wind or on a technicality, but it may not, in fact, have the resources to enable it to meet its liabilities.  We are making it obligatory for drivers of motor vehicles to take out a third-party insurance, and we are requiring the insurance companies to make some kind of deposit. But I do not think that there is anything in the present proposals to give the insured person any real assurance that he will get the amount of the damages for which he has insured. We are assuming a private bargain <Col N="1622" /> between an individual insurer and an individual company.  We are taking certain safeguards in regard to the company, but we are not making assurance double sure by providing that the company will be able to meet its liabilities.  I know that this raises a much bigger question than the mere question of motor car insurance.  I think the problem can only be solved by some kind of State guarantee of the capacity of the insurance company to fulfil the obligations it has entered into.  An insurance company working within a narrow circle may believe that it is competent to deal with ordinary risks but the case referred to by Senator Farren&mdash;eighteen or twenty persons killed or maimed for life&mdash;represents a liability of an extraordinary nature which it may not be able to meet.  I want to see that the insured person who has acted in good faith will get the amount he is entitled to even though the company has not carried out its ordinary commercial or financial business in a satisfactory way.  I do not think that that can be done until the State steps in and either takes over liability or makes it obligatory on the companies to set aside certain sums which will cover their liability beyond any doubt.</P>

If we were to insist that all the risks should be covered then the premiums would be out of all proportion. As a matter of fact the insurance companies refused to quote.  It is only where negligence is proved under present conditions that we can impose compulsory insurance.  Then as to the point raised by Senator Comyn, if insurance is obtained by misrepresentation <Col N="1623" /> or by fraud, and if that is proved, there is no insurance.  The insurance company gets clear out of its liability in such a case.  I think that should be so, if a person misstates the value of a car.  We put down a limited value on a car or on property in the Bill. If persons misrepresent the facts when seeking insurance, I think it is only fair, where there is any fraud or misrepresentation of that kind, that the other parties to the contract&mdash;the insurance company&mdash;should get out of their liability.</P>

      <P>The injured person would get nothing.  We have had consultations with the representatives of the insurance companies of the Free State, and of companies doing business here from other countries, and we have impressed upon them that they must change their view point with regard to their responsibility, under the proposed law, and that when they insure a car they must take full responsibility.  They have agreed to accept that view.  On the other point that the Cathaoirleach mentioned, the responsibility for seeing that the companies are liable to meet their liabilities, to a certain extent that is covered by reason of the guarantees. A money deposit of £15,000 must be put down, and it is liable to be called upon.</P>

      <P>No, it is limited to £15,000.  If it was called upon up to 100 per cent. they would have to keep the deposit up to that.  Difficulties have been put up regarding certain insurance companies here, Irish insurance companies, that find that difficult.  Whether difficult or not they want us to try to meet them on the question of the deposit.  Probably that matter will be discussed later. To the extent of £15,000 we have endeavoured to secure that at least that amount of money will be available for all time from the different insurance companies that propose to <Col N="1624" /> carry on business in this country in order to meet any liabilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Portion of the Minister's speech did not seem to me to be quite satisfactory, and I am not satisfied that it would not be possible, in strict fairness, to get the insurance companies to go somewhat further than the Minister stated.  In this case we are dealing with third-party insurance.  The difference in rates of insurance between third-party insurance and the value of a car is comparatively small.  There is a difference in horse power and in the size of cars.  In the case of value, I think the difference in the rate for a car valued between £200 and £300 is 2/6 or something small.  I am only referring to the legal liability, where a company insures, in order that some onus might reasonably be put on them to satisfy themselves as to the essential facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is misrepresentation and there is fraud.  Fraud is a deliberate attempt to insure a Rolls Royce as though it was a Ford car, or something of that <Col N="1625" /> kind, to get the benefit of a much lower rate.  Misrepresentation may be of a very simple character.  I have not got an insurance form here, and it is some time since I filled one, but according to the regulations the Treasury rating has to be given, and the horse power to a recognised scale. It is very easy to make a miscalculation when stating whether the car was a 15.8 or a 15.9 or 15 or 16 horse power. I think I am correct in saying that some policies insist on a 15.8 car being treated as 16, while others treat it as 15.  There can be misrepresentation of a simple character, and it would be outrageous, to use a mild word, if the insurance company could say that the policy was invalid.  A car might cost £300, £400 or £500, but when insuring it is not insured at the cost price, but at the value at the time of insurance, which is a very problematical figure. Perfectly <i>bona fide</i> a wrong figure could be put down.  If there is any loophole with regard to matters of that kind, the Bill would need strengthening. Where there is deliberate fraud there might be a case for the insurance company, but in a case of misrepresentation it is not sufficient to give the insurance company any kind of loophole.</P>
    <P>In third-party insurance I do not think it would be unreasonable to provide that when issuing a certificate the insurance company should have made sufficient inquiries.  Before it issues a policy an insurance company must have some regard for the person being insured.  They do not take everybody. I have some experience that the general attitude of insurance companies, when dealing with a man of standing, and with a certain amount of reputation, is that they will know quite well that if £200 is put on a car when it is value only for £150, there is no harm done.  There may be new insurance companies formed.  Some of them may be weak.  We ought to try to prevent anything happening.  The Minister should see whether it would be reasonable to provide that when issuing certificates insurance companies should satisfy themselves on these matters.  I thought the Bill covered that position, but the Minister's speech <Col N="1626" /> makes me doubt it.  If not covered steps should be taken to see that it is.</P>

      <P>I think I will do the opposite.  I know from fairly intimate experience, regarding minor defects in proposal forms, such as those outlined by Senator Douglas, that no insurance company with any regard for its reputation could afford to deny liability in cases of that kind.  Where an insurance company wished to vindicate a certain question of principle I have known it to fight a case and to succeed and then to pay.  That was done merely to vindicate a principle.  It will be found in practice, I am quite sure, when there is no deliberate fraud or misrepresentation, that no insurance company dare deny liability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no great difficulty in the way of insisting, as far as third-party insurance is concerned, that the insurance company that issues a policy must accept responsibility.  In third-party insurance a car is not being insured against loss, against fire or against damage.  The insurance is against damaging a car, a person or property.  The only thing the insurance company are entitled to ascertain is the reliability of the mechanical portions of the car.  Surely, before insuring a car, the company should have it examined by an inspector to see if it is in mechanical order.  I feel strongly on this point.  We must protect the public.  If the Minister looks into the matter between now and the Report Stage I think there will be no great difficulty in seeing, as far as third-party insurance is concerned, that the company which issues a certificate and accepts a premium must accept responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had consultations with the representatives of the insurance companies and we put this point to them.  We found it impossible to draft a section covering the point which, at the same time, would be satisfactory to the insurance companies and under which they would agree to <Col N="1627" /> quote premiums.  Up to the present they have refused to do so.  We have put it to them, and they have agreed that they will have to undertake increased liabilities when this Bill is passed.  We have failed so far to get them to agree to bind themselves, so that we could put it in the Bill to bind them to examine every car, and to make the position absolutely as watertight as we would like.  They will refuse to quote any premiums accepting liability in that way.  The points raised by Senator Douglas have been covered. I refer him to Sections 65 and 75 (1) (e).  If the Senator looks at these sections before the Report Stage, if the points he refers to are not covered, I would be glad if he brought them up again so that there would be an opportunity of going into them.  As far as possible we are anxious to have these points covered.  In Section 75 (1) (e) we have tried to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Such vehicle insurer or vehicle guarantor shall not, as a ground for refusing payment of moneys to the claimant or as a defence to proceedings by the claimant, rely on or plead any invalidity of such policy of insurance, guarantee, or combined policy and guarantee (as the case may be) arising from any fraud or any misrepresentation or false statement (whether fraudulent or innocent) to which the claimant was not a party or privy and which, if constituting a misdemeanour under this Part of this Act, was not the subject of a prosecution and conviction under the relevant section of this Part of this Act.</P>

      <P>On this section there are some matters that seem to be of considerable importance, and it <Col N="1628" /> depends on the explanation that may be given whether or not there should be an amendment on the Report Stage. I have been asked a question in respect to sub-section (1) which provides that where a person is convicted and another person is in court, the court may fine the convicted person and pay over to the injured person the amount of the fine by way of damages.  The question is raised which I cannot answer: What <i>locus standi</i> has such a party to the parties, the prosecutor and the defendant, who are before the court?  The second question is whether the provision in the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, setting a limit of jurisdiction in tort of £10 for the District Justice, is maintained by the section.  Are damages limited to £10?  The third question which is less a legal question than a mere layman's question, is whether in sub-section (2) where a default of payment has been made and the defendant is sent to prison, the liability for paying the fine by way of damages is annulled?  Is the third party in this case going to be deprived of any chance of getting damages once the defendant prefers to go to jail rather than pay?  In that case I suppose the third party will be very careful not to consent to the damages being inflicted by any court of summary jurisdiction.  These are the three questions that are raised in this section, and they seem to me to be of some importance.  Perhaps the Minister could throw some light on them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, I think, really explains itself.  It is the subject matter in regard to which Senator Wilson is <Col N="1630" /> just about to become eloquent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the deposits that must be lodged by insurance companies who undertake to do this particular line of insurance work and who will be entitled to get certificates to the effect that they are solvent to carry on the insurance they propose to accept.  It has been <Col N="1637" /> brought to my notice that the Bill as it stands is likely to prevent some of the Irish insurance companies from carrying on this particular type of business.  The section provides that before an insurance company can get a certificate it must make a deposit of £15,000.  If that be insisted upon I am told that some of the Irish insurance offices, who have not been doing a great deal of business in this particular line, will be severely handicapped.  We are all agreed that the amount of money going out of the country for all classes of insurance is imposing a severe drain on the financial resources of the country, and that it is a matter that ought to be attended to.  If the conditions I refer to are insisted on most of the Irish offices will be prevented from doing this particular class of business.  In that event, instead of checking the flow of money from the country in connection with insurance business we will simply be increasing it.  I do not want to boost any insurance company that is not prepared to meet its obligations.  A company may be very wealthy, but under the 1909 Act it is only entitled to use the money received for a particular class of business in connection with that particular class of business.  Some of the Irish offices have very large deposits in National Loan and in other Irish securities.  These offices may not have been doing a very considerable portion of their business in motor vehicle insurance.  It is practically a new business in this country.  Some of the Irish offices have not been doing sufficient business in motor insurance to enable them, out of that particular branch of their business, to make this deposit of £15,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not put down any amendment, but I am just bringing this matter to the notice of the Minister.  The object aimed at is to check the drain of money that flows from this to other countries in connection with insurance business, and to put the Irish offices on at least an equal footing with foreign companies, so that they will get a fair chance.  I do not want to get anybody to insure with companies <Col N="1638" /> which will not be able to meet their liabilities.  There are some companies, however, which, while perfectly solvent in all their other branches of business have not, because of the fact that they came late into the market, a great volume of this particular type of business, and not sufficient funds at their disposal out of it to meet the deposit of £15,000.  I hope the Minister will consider the matter between now and Report Stage, and see if something cannot be done to safeguard the position.</P>

In the other branches of their business they are well able to deposit four or five times the amount specified, but under a special Act of Parliament they are only entitled to make, out of a certain branch of their business, the deposit required to cover that particular branch.</P>

      <P>The point that Senator Farren raises is one of considerable importance.  We had this morning a considerable amount of discussion on the question of ensuring that companies will be in a position to meet their <Col N="1639" /> liabilities.  After all, while it would be my personal wish and probably the wish of the House to do everything possible to encourage Irish institutions &mdash;industrial, commercial or any other kind&mdash;we will have to do that bearing in mind all the time our responsibility to the public at large.  I am quite willing and would be enthusiastic to help any Irish institution, insurance companies or others, but as a Minister I certainly could not take responsibility for anything that would involve a risk to the public&mdash;that the liability of these insurance companies could not be met. If we could be satisfied that there is no danger or risk in that way, that the companies can meet their liabilities and that the public will be safeguarded&mdash; we are obliged under the Bill to secure the interests of the public&mdash;I will examine the matter and see what can be done.

      <P>On behalf of Senator Sir William Hickie I move amendment 54:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 90.  To delete sub-sections (3) to (6), inclusive.</P>
      <P>I had a letter from the Senator asking me to move this amendment for him.  The object of it is to delete from Section 90 the provision whereby passengers may be carried for reward on lorries on certain occasions.  The intention, as disclosed in the debates on the section in the Dáil, is to facilitate lorry owners on Sundays to convey for reward people proposing to attend G.A.A. hurling and football matches.  The lorry that conveys pigs, sheep, calves and manures on Saturday is to be permitted to carry passengers on Sunday.  A lorry owner cannot possibly insure, even if he so desired, against third party risks where passengers are concerned, so that passengers so travelling are entirely unprotected.  From a hygienic point of view, the proposal is a barbarous one, particularly at a time when there are greater passenger transport facilities than at any time in this or previous generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be asked how the patrons of the G.A.A. managed to attend football matches before lorries were made available to carry them.  Anybody who has any experience of this traffic will admit passengers are, in the main, crowded into the lorries in a condition which is unsafe and indecent.  The journey home, very often late at night, after the excitement of the day, is invariably not a very edifying spectacle.  At a time when an attempt is being made to put all branches of transport on an ordered basis and when, with that <Col N="1643" /> object in view, very serious restrictions are being imposed upon the regular vendors of passenger transport, it is an amazing proposition to allow the owners of lorries to come along on the few days on which there is a fair amount of traffic passing and to &ldquo;collar&rdquo; that traffic for their own profits.  During many days of the week the regular buses may be working at a loss, and surely these should be given the opportunity to try and make up their losses on the few busy days?  They are required to pay reasonable rates of wages and observe reasonable conditions of employment, and yet they are to be ousted on special days by the owners of private lorries, who work under no such restrictions at all.  In the absence of the Senator, who is a particular friend of mine, I have great pleasure in putting forward his views on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this amendment.  I am not very much impressed by the question asked in that statement as to how country boys got to football matches before motor cars were introduced.  They used the ancient method of &ldquo;shanks's mare.&rdquo; You might as well ask how people ate their meat before forks were introduced. The statement argues against a case which is not put forward in these sub-sections because the case put forward in these sub-sections is perfectly reasonable.  The sub-sections set out:</P>
      <P>(3)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  application is made by the owner of a mechanically propelled vehicle to an officer of the Gárda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent for the issue of such permit as is hereinafter mentioned, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  such officer is satisfied that a forthcoming event is likely to attract an assemblage of the public and that, having regard to the facilities available to the public for the transport of passengers to and from the place of occurrence of such event and to any other facilities <Col N="1644" /> capable of being procured for such transport, the issue of the permit so applied for is reasonably necessary or desirable, and</P>
    <P>(c)  such officer has given to the Minister for Industry and Commerce at least seven days' notice of the application for such permit and has received from that Minister no objection to the issue of such permit,</P>
    <P>such officer may issue ...</P>
    <P>The case is put that country boys may have to travel in a lorry in which cattle, sheep and pigs have been carried during the week.  Is there anything wrong in that?  Are not farmers and farmers' sons always feeding cattle and going into the byres?  If the vehicle is dirty or insanitary, the officer of the Gárda Síochána will have the option of refusing this licence and, in regard to the injury that may be done to persons in the haulage trade, provision is made in this section to protect them also, because the licence cannot be issued unless the superintendent is satisfied that, owing to the circumstances of the case, there is not sufficient accommodation for the public. He must have regard to the facilities available to the public for the transport of passengers, so that the question of sanitary conditions can be left in the hands of the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána.  The rights of the hirers of motor cars are sufficiently protected and country boys are enabled to have a lift in a motor car to a hurling or football match or to use a motor car, the modern method of conveyance, in substitution for the ancient method of progression which my friend, Senator O'Connor, and myself and others have resorted to in former times.  We often walked many miles to a football or hurling match and I am sure we would have been very glad to get a lift.  If there was a Ford ton truck, we would have been delighted to get a lift in it.</P>
    <P>Country boys ought not to be legislated out of existence.  Legislation should not be such as to make country boys hate the country.  Let them have their innocent and healthy amusement, and let them have it <Col N="1645" /> free, if possible.  There is, of course, provision here for the charging of something, but the amount usually charged is the price of the petrol. Sometimes they pay nothing and sometimes there is something given to the driver, but, inasmuch as the driver has likely enjoyed the sport, frequently he will not charge anything. I think that if Senator Sir William Hickie considered this whole matter in his usual large-hearted way, he would not press this amendment which, because of his illness and his consideration of the case at home, he was probably inclined to regard in too Puritanical a frame of mind. I think this is a very useful amendment for many reasons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I, personally, have always taken the greatest interest in our sports&mdash;my sons were All-Ireland champions in hurling and football&mdash;and, consequently, I am anxious to give all the assistance I can to them.  That is why I have taken an interest in this amendment of Senator Sir William Hickie's.  He is as much a sport as anyone, and he comes from a district, North Tipperary, where sport is proverbial. I do not think he has any intention of injuring these sporting gatherings.  I had a conversation with him, and what he really wanted to avoid was the danger caused by overcrowding these lorries, which are not insured. He had in mind the safety of the people attending these meetings. Some of these lorries, of course, are made quite comfortable by the placing of rows of chairs in them, and I do not mind the people having their amusement provided there is no overcrowding or danger of accident.  If accidents occur there is nothing for the people involved but sympathy.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the question of insurance in relation to these people who are passengers in an ordinary lorry covered by ordinary insurance. That insurance makes no provision for the carrying of passengers.  It will be said that when a lorry is given by the owner for the carriage of boys to a football match, it is insured but the insurance company repudiates liability because the lorry is used for the carriage of passengers.  In that case, the action would be against the owner of the lorry who, in many cases, is a <Col N="1647" /> man of straw.  A fortnight ago, in the County Dublin, the owner of a lorry was involved in an accident, in which somebody was very severely injured.  The insurance company will not pay the insurance and the owner of the lorry is unable to pay anything.  When making provisions of this sort I think that some reference should be made to the position of the public.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 57:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 144, sub-section (1).  Before paragraph (h) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(h)  regulating and controlling the conduct of vehicles in passing or meeting animals on the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment because I know, from experience, the great danger caused by the increased traffic on the roads to cattle and sheep.  I consider it essential that drivers of motor vehicles should exercise greater care and control when meeting cattle and sheep on the road.  The increase in the volume of motor traffic is detrimental to the safety of live-stock and to obviate further damage to live-stock it is essential that greater control be exercised.  When a vehicle does not slow up when approaching live-stock, it causes them to be frightened and, perhaps, to rush under the wheels, when they invariably get injured.  I hold that it is essential that a motorist when meeting live-stock should allow an opportunity for them to be driven past.  Time should be allowed when vehicles are passing stock to allow them to be driven out of the way.  I wish to add a word about a matter mentioned by Senator Miss Browne, who is not present to-day.  It is essential that people leading young horses should be allowed to ask the driver of a motor car or lorry to slow up in the event of a young horse showing signs of fright.  They should be allowed to put up a hand as a sign to the driver of the vehicle to slow up and give them a chance of passing.  The person with the horse should also be allowed to pass on the safe side&mdash;that is, between the vehicle and the horse.  I know a good deal about the cattle and sheep traffic.  Great impatience is sometimes shown by drivers of motor vehicles to those in charge of sheep and cattle.  They seem to think that the stock are a nuisance on the road and that they should not be <Col N="1650" /> there at all.  It should be compulsory on the driver of a motor vehicle to pull up when meeting cattle and sheep on the road.  These cattle and sheep cannot be expected to have sufficient intelligence to move out of the way. They generally get scared or frightened.  It is the business of the motorist to make way for them. After all, they have a prior claim to his.</P>
    <P>At all events, cattle and sheep have been using the roads for a longer period than motorists and they should not be endangered by the impatience of motorists.  I have no desire to be in any way hostile to motorists, but I certainly feel great hostility when I see them acting most unreasonably and driving, in a barbarous way, headlong through a flock of sheep or a herd of cattle.  We ourselves had a herd of ten cattle on the road about a fortnight ago.  A motor vehicle came along and hit one, with the result that it was killed.  The owner of the vehicle paid for it, of course, but it is unreasonable that conduct of that kind should be allowed.  It could be all obviated by pulling up in time.  The factor of speed is the great factor in these matters.  It is the wish of the majority of the people, and particularly of those using the roads for live stock, that cattle and sheep should be protected on the roads.  I ask the Minister to look into the matter from the view-point which I have explained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>152.  It shall not be lawful for any <Col N="1651" /> person riding a two-wheeled mechanically-propelled vehicle to take any passenger thereon.</P>
    <P>This is an entirely different proposition from that with which I have just now been dealing.  I ask the Minister to put a stop to any two persons making a habit of riding on a cycle.  I have seen so many accidents that I consider the practice of two persons riding on these two-wheeled machines is highly dangerous.  More deaths must have occurred from pillion riding than from any other form of motoring.  These people almost take the sight out of your eyes by the speed at which they round bends of the road.  When an accident does occur, it invariably results in the death of one of the parties, if not of both.  In case of storm, the pillion riders are exposed to every chance of the elements.  A son of mine, when he started cycle riding, went in for this practice, and I saw so many accidents that I was always uneasy while he was engaged in this habit.  These bicycles skid very easily if the surface is greasy, and it is impossible to carry on pillion riding safely at a high speed.  I consider it a kindness to the people concerned to put a stop to pillion riding.  Let people ride singly as much as they please, but pillion riding should be ended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Few men or women have a kinder heart than has Senator O'Connor.  He showed his kindness towards cattle in a previous amendment. He shows his humanity now towards man.  Having listened to Senator O'Connor, I am satisfied that he does not wish in any way to interfere with the legitimate enjoyment of any of our people.  The reason he has put down this amendment is, I take it, to save man from himself and to prevent him from leading woman to destruction by pillion riding.  Senator O'Connor has told us of the many accidents that occur by pillion riding. I happen to live at a place called Portmarnock, famous for many things, including its golf course and its many huts.  Every Sunday in the summer I see dozens and dozens of these pillion-riding people going to the strand to <Col N="1652" /> enjoy themselves, during the past five or six years, and I have never known of a solitary accident.  Accidents will occur in all sorts of sports, enjoyments and pastimes.  We saw the other day a very sad aeroplane accident at our very doors and under our very eyes. Almost every day people are unfortunately killed or injured by motor cars and motor lorries.  We have even experience of accidents by children falling out of perambulators.  Even on the golf course&mdash;some of my golfing friends will bear me out in this&mdash;after an occasional visit to the nineteenth hole, your opponent has a tendency to &ldquo;slice,&rdquo; and if you do not duck, and duck quickly, you are likely to suffer as a result.  We have accidents in all lines of life.  There is a very old saying which Senator O'Connor reminded me of: &ldquo;There is no love like the first love.&rdquo;  I was one of the first men in Ireland to ride a motor bicycle.  While not wishing to appear to my friends around me as being a kind of Don Juan, I confess that on many and many an occasion I took my neighbour's daughter for a spin.  I assure Senator O'Connor that I felt far happier&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I feel that there was less danger then, perhaps, than when I grew up and got a motor car or, perhaps, than there is in following the Ward Hounds, or going down the Mediterranean or the Mississippi or in boating on the Danube or flying from Paris to Berlin.  There are accidents everywhere.  Coming in here, one might slip on the carpet and break his leg.  A young fellow who may not be able to afford the luxury of an aeroplane or a fleet of ponies may, by his industry, get together sufficient money to buy a motor cycle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be particularly hard on many people if this amendment were passed.  Take the case of a person living outside the city, when coming to business in the morning he would be prevented from carrying a pal, let it be a boy or a girl, into town.  It is well, in my opinion, that a young fellow should be able on a summer's evening to take his wife, <Col N="1653" /> his daughter, his sweetheart or his mother-in-law out for a ride on a bicycle and to enjoy the fresh air. That is far healthier than going to the pictures, stopping on the backstairs of tenement houses, or even going to the parks.  Senator O'Connor dropped into verse in support of his amendment.  If I cannot sing a verse in the House I will quote one which was very popular in their youth.  I am not suggesting that they should join in it now.  Here goes.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter, because we know that there has been a considerable number of accidents, not because of pillion riding but through reckless driving.  I rode a motor bicycle for a few years and I carried passengers on the pillion seat.  I never had an accident, because I was very careful in the management of the machine.  I admit that there has been a considerable number of accidents with pillion riders, but I think it would be unjust to prevent a man carrying a passenger on the back of his bicycle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be pillion riding if a passenger was at the side. When passengers are carried at the side the machine becomes a three-wheeled vehicle.  It would be unjust to legislate that a person should be prevented from carrying a brother, a sister or someone else's brother or <Col N="1654" /> sister, a wife or a daughter on the back of a motor bicycle.  For that reason I will vote against the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on what Senator Farren has said I will quote from the report of the InterDepartmental Committee on the control and regulation of road traffic on this question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The question of the prohibition of pillion riding was raised at our public sittings and, from the views ascertained, we think that no case has been made that pillion riders are particularly dangerous to other users of the road and, in the circumstances, we do not feel that the matter requires special regulation.</P>
      <P>Some Senator spoke of statistics.  I wonder whether the figures referred to the danger to other users of the road, and whether there has been an excessive number of accidents in the case of pillion riders.  Almost universally pillion riders are adults, and if they are prepared to take the risk I am not sure that we ought to legislate against it.  I would have more sympathy, for instance, if there was an amendment to prevent a man taking a child in the front of a two-wheeled bicycle.  The child is not a free agent. In the case of the pillion rider he or she is usually a free agent and, on the whole, unless there are very convincing statistics to show that the number of accidents to pillion riders is very great, and that the number of accidents to other users of the roads has increased, since the report was issued in 1928, I do not think a case has been made for prohibition, although such prohibition appears in the British Road Traffic Act of 1930.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">

      <P>There is a restriction in the British Act dealing with the type of seat and things of that kind.  I am afraid statistics bear out the statement that there has been a large number of accidents due to pillion riding.  In the year 1932 the statistics show that <Col N="1655" /> there were 57 fatal accidents, three being on motor bicycles on which there were pillion riders, and two cases where cars drove into motor bicycles. There were three fatal accidents to pillion riders in 1932.</P>

      <P>Section 162, sub-section (1).  To delete in lines 51-52 the words &ldquo;drives or uses or takes possession of&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;takes and drives away&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a much more important <Col N="1657" /> amendment.  I take it that there should not be any question on the part of any member of the Seanad of the desirability of making &ldquo;joy riding&rdquo;&mdash;temporarily stealing a motor vehicle&mdash;an offence and the subject of severe punishment.  I have never been able to understand the law which allows a person to take away a motor vehicle, almost with impunity.  I think as the sub-section is drawn it goes much further than one desires.  It does not include only a motor car.  If it is an offence to use a motor lorry without defining what the use is, without depriving the owner of any power of the use or the enjoyment of his machine, I think the offence is a much milder one, if it is an offence at all. Members of the House who have taken part in a political campaign, know that they have taken the opportunity to use a motor lorry, which happened to be standing in a market place, to address a meeting, without the consent of the owner of the lorry.  The use of the lorry for that purpose should not be subject to this penalty, which means a fine of £50, or six months' imprisonment.  Therefore the offence aimed at here is included with a much milder offence.</P>
    <P>The phraseology of my amendment is directed to the offence that everyone desires to put down, that is, taking and driving away motor cars. I am not going to be dogmatic but I feel strongly that to include the words &ldquo;uses or takes possession of&rdquo; makes the section much wider than is desirable. Take the words &ldquo;or takes possession of.&rdquo;  A motor garage owner takes possession of a vehicle from the person who brings it in.  That person may not be the owner and may not have lawful authority, but the garage owner is going to be made amenable to the law by the sub-section as it is drafted, if he takes possession of a motor vehicle from any person who may have stolen a vehicle.  He does that without guilty knowledge, but the very fact that he is liable under this section would make him very chary of taking possession of the car unless he was very fully convinced of the lawful authority of the person who drove it into his garage.</P>

There is no doubt that he would be in possession of it but I do not think he would be guilty of the offence mentioned in sub-section (1).  As the Minister has pointed out, there is sufficient protection in sub-section (2).  I do not know that any form of words could have been devised to meet the case of a man honestly in possession of a car which was not his property other than the words in sub-section (2).  While paying every respect to what Senator Johnson has said and considering also the substituted words which the Senator proposes, I think that the section as drafted meets the case much more fully and reasonably than if the amendment were accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Senator has suggested is that you should substitute for the words &ldquo;drives or uses or takes possession of,&rdquo; the words &ldquo;takes and drives away.&rdquo;  I can imagine two or three loopholes in the Act if these words were inserted.  Suppose a person intended to have a joy-ride in a motor car, went into a motor car before he drove it away and was captured.  He would escape under that section.  Senator Johnson's amendment would render necessary proof of two things&mdash;firstly, the taking, and, secondly, the driving away. I cannot help thinking that such a position as that must have been in the mind of the draftsman when he used the words which he has used. Notwithstanding what the Senator has said I feel that the section, which apparently has been considered in view of legal decisions in similar cases <Col N="1659" /> under other Acts of Parliament, has been very carefully considered by the draftsman and I would not feel happy in altering it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Our view is that the words proposed to be substituted by Senator Johnson are defective, and would leave many loopholes.  Suppose a person was found with a motor car the property of somebody else a considerable distance away from the place where the owner left the car and that a substantial time had expired, how is one to prove that he took that car?  It would be very difficult to prove that the individual who was found in control of the car at the time, took the car.  It is also doubtful what &ldquo;driving away&rdquo; would mean. How far would a person have to drive a car before he was deemed to have driven it away?  If he had only gone ten yards would that be considered driving away?  This is a type of offence which has grown considerably especially in Dublin and it is giving the Gárda a tremendous amount of trouble.  I could mention half a dozen friends of my own whose cars have been taken away within the last few weeks.  It is a type of offence that people commit very light-heartedly, but, nevertheless, it is a serious offence and it is one that I think we must take stern measures to deal with.  I think it would not be wise to use any less strict words than are proposed in the section.</P>

      <P>I can only say that the words in the British 1930 Act, which I have copied, are: &ldquo;Every person who takes and drives away a vehicle without having the consent of the owner.&rdquo;  I am not standing for that, but I am rather criticising the present phraseology as being too all-inclusive. I would lay more stress on the words &ldquo;or uses&rdquo; with which I shall deal in the next section.</P>

      <P>To delete in line 51 the words &ldquo;or uses.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the possible conviction <Col N="1660" /> for a very minor offence, if it is an offence at all, which might be obtained as a result of these words, &ldquo;or uses.&rdquo; Every person who uses a motor lorry in a market place without the consent of the owner shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £50 or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months or both.  A reference has been made to sub-section (2), but under that section the person in charge has to show that he believed or had reasonable grounds for believing he had lawful authority.  I contend that he could not show that he believed or that he had reasonable grounds for believing that he had lawful authority under such circumstances. While he might be guilty of the offence of trespass, it could not be held that he was guilty of anything like the offence of stealing the car.  If you keep these two words &ldquo;or uses&rdquo; in the section they widen the section so much that a person guilty of a very venial offence of trespass is guilty of the very grave offence of stealing and is subject to these very heavy penalties.  I think the section is too wide and too stringent for such an offence.  That is why I suggest that the words should be deleted from the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">

      <P>I could quite understand how disconcerting it would be to one who was in any way engaged in a peroration in the market place to be accused by the Gárda under this section.  Probably it is something like that that Senator Johnson had in his mind.  He may not be using, in the strict sense, a motor car, and the motor car might have been taken out of the yard of a political opponent.  I can assure the Senator that the Gárda who would come forward and charge a politician under circumstances of that kind would be likely not to gain promotion thereby, because he would have been proved to have been an absurd person.  I do not really think that under the sub-section he would be called upon to show that he had reasonable grounds for believing that he had a right to be on the lorry. Human language is imperfect.  The law has to be administered in a <Col N="1661" /> reasonable spirit, and we have to trust to the officers of the law that they will not make it inconvenient for people who are reasonably using motor cars in that way.</P>

      <P>Our position is that it might happen that a person would be found using a car that would be stolen.  We could not prove that he had taken possession of it or how he had come into possession of it, but he was there using it.  We must provide for cases in which a car would be found under these conditions.  He does not take possession from the owner perhaps.  He may have got it from a third, a fourth or a fifth person.  We must provide that people who come into possession of cars must take the precaution to see that they are acting properly and that they do not use such cars unless they are satisfied that they can properly use such cars.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 63:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 162, sub-section (2).  To delete the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put this amendment down because I want to make sure that this section does not give a person who has stolen a car too great a liberty to get out of the consequences of his offence. When a person is charged with having stolen a car it would be a good defence for such a person to show that when he did the act&mdash;to show, to disclose, to reveal, as the dictionary says&mdash;that he believed and had reasonable grounds for believing that he had lawful authority for doing such an act.  All he has got to do then is to persuade the owner of the car: &ldquo;The penalty is very heavy and if you say the word then I can get off.&rdquo;  I think that gives a loophole to the motor car thief to get out of the consequences of his theft.  I might draw attention to sub-section (1) of Section 164 where there is a penalty provided for a man who interferes with the mechanism of a motor vehicle, but there is no sub-section in connection with that which gives him an opportunity of getting out of the consequences of his interference.  I should <Col N="1662" /> like if the Minister would justify this sub-section because it seems to me to be too lenient to the thief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are entitled to justify the sub-section and not to be putting on the Minister the obligation of defending every word in this Bill.  The word &ldquo;show&rdquo; is referred to by Senator Johnson and it is regarded as being synonymous with &ldquo;make apparent.&rdquo;  Senators must remember that it is only when the person is charged that he must &ldquo;show.&rdquo; It would be a good defence to show that he had reasonable ground to believe that he was authorised.  The word &ldquo;show&rdquo; in that sense means that he must make it apparent to the mind of the Tribunal. The only way he can do that is by some reasonable proof.  Senator Johnson says, all he has to do is to get the owner to give evidence.  The Senator indicates how serious the offence is. But if he could get the owner to give false evidence he would get out of any charge.  I appreciate the public spirit of Senator Johnson in trying to make every one of these sections watertight. I repeat what I said earlier, that if you alter any part of Sections 1 or 2 you will injure the effect of the section. It is my firm belief that these sections have been fully considered and carefully drafted, and that they go as near to the truth and to what is in the mind of Senator Johnson as words can bring them.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to deal with this point.  If this section is deleted, will it still remain for the defendant to prove to the court that he had no guilty motive in taking possession or using or driving a car which did not belong to him?  It is common knowledge.  Every person who is charged is in that position.  When we put in a hint to the defendant &ldquo;Now it would be a good defence for you to do so and so&rdquo; it seems to me to be weakening the character of the section as against the stealer of motor cars.</P>

If it were not put in the judge would have no option <Col N="1663" /> or power under the Bill to take into consideration the fact that this individual may have honestly believed that, having got permission on a former occasion from this person to use his car, or that some friend of his had got such leave, he did not think it wrong to do so in this instance.  He would not be able to make that plea, so that the magistrate would have no option, even where there was a <i>bona fide</i> mistake, but to make such a person subject to the full penalties of the law.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This suggests that there should be a guilty purpose.  The section provides that every person who, without the consent of the owner or without lawful authority interferes with the mechanism of a mechanically-propelled vehicle while it is stationary in a public place should be guilty of an offence.  My suggestion is that mere interference, without any guilty intent and without doing any damage either to the car or inconvenience to the owner, is not an offence of the character indicated in the section, and that what is essential to the guilt should <Col N="1664" /> be intent to cause inconvenience to the owner or driver or damage to the car.</P>

      <P>New section.  Before Section 169 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;169.  Whenever a person drives a mechanically propelled vehicle with the consent (whether expressed or to be implied from the circumstances) of the owner of such vehicle, such person shall, for the purposes of determining the liability or non-liability of such owner for injury occasioned by the negligent driving of such vehicle by such person, be deemed to drive such vehicle as the servant of such owner, but only in so far as such person acts in accordance with the terms of such consent.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The present position is that the owner of a motor car is not liable for damage caused to third parties by the negligent driving of the car by some person other than the owner even though that person is driving with his consent unless it can be shown that the person is driving the car as the servant of the owner. Many motor insurance policies now in force purport to cover third-party claims arising from the driving of a car by persons other than the owner. Some policies cover all claims arising out of this driving whether the claims are against the owner himself or the driver.  In many cases, however, the policy only covers claims against the owner himself.  There are occasions when a car may be driven by a person with the owner's authority, and nevertheless no claim against the owner arises for the negligence of that driver because he cannot be held to be the servant of the owner.  We are proposing here to make such person a servant of the owner for the purpose of the section so as to make the owner liable.</P>
