      <P>I find on reading the Official Report of the Debates on the last occasion on which we met here prior to yesterday that I am reported as having said that we have in this country at present sufficient oats and wheat to meet our own requirements. What I did say&mdash;and the official reporter probably did not catch it&mdash; was that we have not in this country at present sufficient oats or wheat to meet our own requirements.  I want it to go on record so that it may be corrected as I did not make the correction at the proper time.</P>

      <P>In connection with the adjournment of the House, I may as well give Senators a statement as to the business before the House. The position as to the business of the Seanad is that we have received from the Dáil the Unemployment Assistance Bill, 1933; the Unemployment Insurance Bill, 1933, and the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1933.  On the Dáil Order Paper for to-day the three Constitution (Amendment) Bills are down for Committee Stage and the Merchant Shipping (Safety and Load-line Conventions) Bill, 1933, for Report Stage.  It is possible that all or any of these Bills may reach us before the end of the week.  I have heard that there is a possibility of the Dáil adjourning for two or three weeks and that is a matter on which the Minister for Lands and Fisheries might be able to give us definite information.  It remains for the House to decide whether it is better to meet next Wednesday and to proceed with whatever business we have together with any other business that may come to us this week or adjourn until a day when the Dáil is likely to be sitting again. Perhaps the Minister would inform the House what business the Government considers urgent and whether there is any necessity for our meeting next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed this with several of the Ministers at lunch and their opinion was that the three Constitution Bills would be finished in the Dáil to-day and that they would be ready to be dealt with by the Seanad next week.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is anxious to get his <Col N="1531" /> two Bills put through as early as possible, and he and the other Ministers concerned would feel grateful if this House would take up the business as soon as it could as they are anxious to get these Bills through.</P>

      <P>I suggest that we should meet next Wednesday to deal with the Bills already sent to us and others that may come.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.7 p.m. until Wednesday, 18th October, 1933.</P>
