    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I would very earnestly ask the Seanad to pass the Second Reading of this Bill.  As Senator O'Farrell said yesterday, it is not entirely to our credit that we are practically the last of the civilised nations to adopt the principle which underlies this Bill.  In Scotland they have a Bill which has been working for some time and is easily enforced and eminently satisfactory.  In England they have long had a voluntary system which was worked by the local authorities making by-laws which had to get the assent of the board of health.  In England they have an Act which comes into force on 1st January next and in Northern Ireland they have a system which is similar to that which still prevails in England and will prevail until 1st January, but there, <Col N="2144" /> too, I believe, it is working very satisfactorily. In this country, as Senator O'Farrell reminded the Seanad yesterday, there are a very large number of butchers who already use the humane killer.  We have, I think, at least 30 of the principal butchers in Dublin who kill their animals with the humane killer and find it eminently satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The principle underlying this Bill is that animals slaughtered for our human needs should suffer as little as possible in the process.  That will be assented to by every humane minded person.  The only objection that could possibly be raised to this Bill is that it might be difficult to enforce.  I myself at one time was rather doubtful about that but, fortunately, after making inquiries from the authorities of our Guards, we found that they themselves were of opinion that there would be no difficulty in enforcing this, even in the country parts of the Free State.  There is, however, a section in the Bill which provides that any butcher's yard which is two miles from a Guard Barrack will not come within the scope of the Bill.  It might be more difficult to have the law enforced in cases like this and, therefore, that section was introduced into the Bill in order that there should be no difficulty in enforcing it, because it is a bad thing to have legislation which cannot be reasonably enforced.  As Senator O'Farrell yesterday went so fully through the Bill, I do not think it is necessary to say any more, but I do urge the Seanad to accept the Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Farrell and Senator Brown have very ably put forward the case in favour of the Bill but their main arguments, I think, would be very aptly described by the Irish saying we use in Kerry: &ldquo;D'innis bean dom, d'innis bean di.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;I heard it from a woman who heard it from a woman.&rdquo; Their main argument was in favour of the use of the humane killer and if they had confined themselves to that section in the Bill, they would not find very much opposition in this House. But I want to tell the House that this <Col N="2145" /> Bill is not quite so simple and so harmless as the Senators would lead us to believe.  There is a danger that Senators who know nothing about the business with which this Bill proposes to deal, in view of the names attached to the Bill, may be inclined to take the Bill without question.  I think everyone will admit that the names of the Senators attached to the Bill command the confidence and respect of the House and that we would all go a long way to meet their wishes, provided they were advocating something about which they knew a good deal. I am afraid, however, that, in this case, they know nothing about the business they are proposing to legislate for.  The Senators whose names are attached to the Bill are not the real promoters of the Bill.  The real promoter of the Bill is the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. I have no grievance against that Society.  I think they are a very excellent body whose members are kind-hearted people who do a lot of good in preventing unnecessary cruelty to dumb animals, but the danger is that they are inclined to go too far and in their anxiety to prevent cruelty to animals they inflict extreme cruelty and hardship in very many cases on human beings.  I read, for instance, some time ago, a case in the Press in which a farmer was prosecuted for leaving two sheep tied to a gate on the night of the fair in a certain town. The farmer's defence was that he had sold the two sheep but that the buyer had not turned up to claim them.  The district justice, in that case, decided that there was a gross cruelty in leaving the sheep tied to a gate for the night without food or water and the farmer was sentenced to a month in jail without the option of a fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know anything about the town and I have no connection with it; I know nothing about the man prosecuted or about the district justice but the sentence struck me as being so barbarous that I sent the cutting from the paper to the Minister for Justice. The Minister replied that there was an appeal pending against the sentence and he could not interfere for the time being.  I lost sight of the case and I do <Col N="2146" /> not know what happened afterwards. but in my considered opinion, there was no cruelty inflicted on the two sheep in that case but there was terrible cruelty inflicted on the farmer and the farmer's family as a result of his having been sentenced to a month in jail. Speaking about the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I correct the Senator?  The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has nothing to do with the Bill.  On the contrary, I had great difficulty in persuading them to give support to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept his statement of course, but I still contend that I am entitled to comment on the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals as there is a section in the Bill which gives powers to the society to work some parts of the Bill, Section 5 for instance. I do not want to say anything against the society.  I have no grievance against it but I would like to point out that it is grossly unfair and it is not good business for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to be passing resolutions complimenting Civic Guards for doing their duty and on having such a number of prosecutions and convictions.  I think that the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals should at least stop that. There are only a few general remarks which I want to make about the Bill. I do not want to be taken as being against the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals but I should like to offer a few remarks in regard to the Bill.  Of course any practical person reading the Bill could see that it is <Col N="2147" /> drawn up by some people who know very little of the practical side of the business.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of the first section reads:</P>
      <P>Every person engaged in driving or bringing any animal to a slaughter house or knacker's yard shall so drive or convey the animal as to avoid the infliction upon the animal of any unnecessary suffering, pain or fatigue.</P>
      <P>The expression &ldquo;unnecessary suffering, pain or fatigue&rdquo; is very wide. Who is to decide what is fatigue?  If Senator O'Farrell would walk out along the road any day and see cattle coming into Dublin, even stall-fed cattle, when they have only to walk a mile or two, he would find that they are puffing with their tongues out. When cattle are let out of the stall they run for the first quarter of a mile and then in a short while they are puffed out.  What is to be done in these cases?  If an officer of the society comes along and finds a man driving cattle which show signs of distress and fatigue, as they will appear distressed and fatigued, he will launch a prosecution against the owner.  Does Senator Brown agree that a farmer should be prosecuted and fined because the animals appear puffed out in circumstances such as that?  I think that is a section that is putting too much power into the hands of officers of the society, Civic Guards or anybody else.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 2 states that no animal shall be kept in a slaughter house or knacker's yard for more than 12 hours without having a sufficient quantity of wholesome food or water.  I agree that the animal should have water, but to give it wholesome food during a period of 12 hours before slaughter would be most detrimental to the flesh.  Any housewife will know that you should not kill a chicken full of food.  I am surprised that Senator O'Farrell should say that a beast should get food during a period of 12 hours before slaughter.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>Not during the 12 hours before slaughter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be retained for more than 12 hours without getting food.  If the clause provided that the animal should have plenty of water and that it should have food 24 hours before slaughter I would agree but I could not agree to any shorter period.  Sub-section (4) of Section 2 states:</P>
      <P>No person shall slaughter or cause or suffer to be slaughtered any animal or dress or cause or suffer to be dressed the carcase of any animal within the view of another animal.</P>
      <P>It is very questionable whether an animal which sees another animal killed and dressed has the intelligence to know that it is going to be slaughtered itself next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCostello" hpid="Mrs. Costello Mrs. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It has intuition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case I think that that section cannot be carried out without inflicting a terrible lot of hardship.  I do not think that work can be carried on under it.  If Senator O'Farrell or Senator Brown went even to the Dublin Abattoir they would see that there are about 15 or 20 sheep slaughtered at the one time.  There is only about a minute or two between the operations of bringing the animal in and slaughtering it.  If every sheep has to be slaughtered, skinned, dressed and taken away before they bring in another sheep I cannot see how they will get through the work there at all. I have no objection to sub-section (5).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to sub-section (6) I would agree that every animal should be killed by a mechanically operated implement.  Even on that point it is very questionable whether the mechanical killer, the captive bolt or shot, is in any way more humane than the pole-axe.  When we were operating the fresh meat factory in Drogheda, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals sent down some of their officers to give a demonstration with the mechanically operated captive bolt in killing cattle and we gave a demonstration of killing <Col N="2149" /> with the pole-axe.  The officers of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals admitted there that the pole-axe when used by a competent and expert man is as humane as the captive bolt.  Senator O'Farrell pointed out numerous cases in which he alleged there was terrible cruelty as a result of the use of the pole-axe.  If I wanted to look the matter up I could point to some cases of cruelty and mismanagement in the use of the mechanically operated instruments, but as I say I am not going to contest that clause.  If the Senator had confined himself to that clause there would be no objection to the Bill.  The provision in the section with regard to persons under the age of 16 is fairly questionable.</P>
    <P>Section 3 says:</P>
    <P>A licence to slaughter or stun animals in accordance with the provisions of this Act shall not be granted except to a person of the age of 18 years or upwards.</P>
    <P>What is the necessity for a licence at all?  Then the licence is only valid for the sanitary district in which it is issued.  Take, for instance, the case of a butcher who falls sick in Swords.  In that case a man would have to be got to go to Swords to take his place. Before he could slaughter an animal there he would have to go to the sanitary officer and get a licence to enable him to slaughter in that locality. Perhaps the sanitary officer would not be available and he might have to wait a whole day before he could see him.  He might be required for only two or three days and would have to pay 5/- for his licence.  Does Senator O'Farrell approve of a provision whereby butchers would have to pay 5/- for every job they undertake?  They would have to pay 5/- for a licence in every one of the districts into which they went.  I think the thing is preposterous. It does not stop at one payment of 5/-.  Then a butcher has to pay 1/- every year to have the licence renewed.  Is it the sanitary officer who is to get that 5/-?  There should be no necessity for licensing a butcher.  Everyone should be allowed <Col N="2150" /> to carry on his trade as long as he does it within the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>

      <P>Section 5 provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any member of the Gárda Síochána and any person authorised in writing by a sanitary authority and the officers of any society or institution for the protection of animals authorised by the Department of Local Government and Public Health or the Department of Agriculture for that purpose may enter any slaughterhouse or knacker's yard in the district of the local authority at any time when business is or appears to be in progress or is usually carried on therein ....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this would entail a great amount of hardship on butchers or the owners of slaughterhouses throughout the country.  First of all, you have the sanitary officer for the district; then you have his assistant; you have the Gárda Síochána; and you have innumerable visits from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  I ask the House how could any man carry on a business with all these visits from people who know very little about the work to be done.  We were discussing a Dangerous Drugs Bill the other day.  One of the supporters of this Bill, Senator Sir E. Coey Bigger, objected to anybody under the rank of a sergeant in the Gárda Síochána entering a premises or making any inquiries with regard to the use and keeping of dangerous drugs.  Should not Senator Sir E. Coey Bigger have the same consideration for the butchers of the country, who are doing legitimate work, as he has for the people who are dealing with dangerous drugs?  An amendment was inserted in that Bill that no member of the Gárda under the rank of a sergeant should have any <Col N="2151" /> authority under that Bill.  I am very anxious for a Bill of this sort, but I want a common-sense Bill and I want an agreed Bill to leave this House. Before we agree to the Bill, I want to have the people who are directly interested in and concerned with the trade consulted and have their opinion on it.  I shall vote for the Second Reading and ask the House to support it, but after that I shall propose to have it sent to a Select Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the principle enshrined in this Bill&mdash;the human slaughter of animals.  I am in favour of every restriction possible so as to bring about less suffering in the process of slaughtering animals. Like Senator Counihan, however, I object to having tacked on to that a lot of unnecessary regulations which would have the effect of rendering the whole Bill a matter of anxiety to the people engaged in the trade.  The peculiar thing is that every animal except the pig is supposed to come under the scope of the Bill.  There is no mention of the suffering which may be inflicted on the pig.  I wonder why it is permissible to slaughter pigs as they are being slaughtered at present and why a differentiation is made between the pig and the horse, ass, mule, cow, sheep, goat and kid.  That is a point on which I should like to have some explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, any amount of suffering can be inflicted on an animal when it is going to feed a Jew or a Mohammedan It is only those animals which are to feed Christians which are to come under the operations of the Bill.  Let us look at the thing from a broad point of view.  I am not making points which can be considered petty.  If an animal is to be slaughtered for the feeding of Jews or Mohammedans they can do anything they like with it, but if it is intended for food for Christians it is brought into another category and certain regulations and restrictions are to be enforced.  I think legislation of that sort is foolish.  It is said that animals should not be slaughtered in sight of other animals.  Only to-day I was at the Dublin abattoir.  A number <Col N="2152" /> of pigs were brought in and put in a pen where a number of animals had been previously slaughtered.  These pigs began licking up the blood of the animals which had been slaughtered. These pigs did not seem to care about what had happened there.  The blood was there and they did not mind it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>Then they deserve to be left out of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an instrument used in the abattoir at present which is operated by electricity.  That particular instrument is one which I would be glad to see in use wherever it can be operated.  This system of shooting is very annoying.  Having these guns all over the country, especially in a country like ours where we have such a body of gunmen, is not a matter for a jest.  The humane killer could be put to the back of a man as well as to the back of a sheep.  It is a dangerous instrument.  I would advocate the slaughter of animals by the operation of this new instrument which stuns the animal by electricity.  We have the Shannon Scheme extending all over the country; it is in every town.  This instrument stuns the animal without the slightest trouble.  There is no shot. The animal seems to fall off and is ready for the knife.  If you provided for the use of that instrument, instead of this mechanically-operated one which anybody can carry round with him, it would be for the benefit of the community.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of the killing of animals with the least possible pain. I take the same view as that taken by Senator Counihan, that we ought to pass the Second Reading and, if possible, strip the Bill afterwards of those provisions which would allow of meddling by people who may be actuated by very humane motives, but who have not sufficient knowledge of the business to know that they may be interfering unduly, and have a Bill providing for the humane killing of animals which can be operated properly so that nobody, whatever his motives may be, will have the right to interfere with people who are conducting their business in a proper manner.</P>

      <P>Even at the risk of being referred to as a &ldquo;he-man&rdquo; by Senator O'Farrell, I must say I am not in agreement with the Bill as it stands.

      <P>That decides my attitude. I am not in favour of the Bill. If the law is to apply to slaughterhouses in the towns and within two miles of a Gárda station, the matter should be pursued further.  As I happen to be particularly interested in the farming community, I can see serious difficulties ahead.  If the Bill is to deal with the ordinary slaughterhouses, then it should also cover the cases of the farmers throughout the country who kill their own pigs and cattle.  If it were so extended, it would be an absolutely ridiculous measure, because I do not believe it would be possible to enforce the law. I do not know whether the movers of this Bill are aware that in several parts of the country&mdash;I might say in every county in Ireland&mdash;it is the regular practice for farmers to kill pigs in their own farmyards and to kill more than one pig at a time.  If this measure is to apply to one section of the community, it should apply to every other section.  If it is to cover the case of one type of animals, it should be made to apply to all other types of animals. The farmers at present are killing cattle as well as pigs.  Senator Counihan and other Senators will agree with me when I say that the farmer will find it hard to put up £10 to buy one of these blunderbuses, or whatever description is applied to them by Senator Wilson.  That is one way of looking at the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A thing that strikes me as peculiar is that people do not seem to realise the difference between the methods of killing various animals.  I dare say a great many supporters of the Bill have never killed any of the types of animals referred to.  I have killed <Col N="2154" /> cattle, pigs, geese, ducks and chickens. So far as my experience goes, the most revolting thing to kill is a goose.  If it were possible to invent some method, which would be practicable, for the painless killing of all these animals, I should be in favour of it, but I think that this Bill does not meet the case at all.  It does not take in all the animals and, if you tried to take all of them in, it would be impossible to operate the measure.  I spoke about the sensations I experienced in the killing of animals.  To my mind the striking of a beast with an axe is not a very nerve-racking operation at all.  Some people might think it a terrible thing. In the country, a goose is killed by bending over the neck, cutting the back of it with a knife and letting the animal bleed to death.</P>

      <P>Senator Miss Browne says &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  They may do it in a different way in Wexford.  They do a lot of queer things down there.  But that is the way a goose is killed in Tipperary and several other counties.  They kill chickens in the same way.  It may be barbarous, but it is done, and it is far more cruel to do that than to strike a bullock with an axe, provided you strike accurately.  The Bill has been brought in to deal with slaughterhouses, and if there is any chance of expert handling of the pole-axe it is in the slaughterhouse.  At an ordinary farmer's place, the man with the pole-axe might strike an inch to the right or to the left, but in the slaughterhouse there is every probability that the man will do his job properly.  I believe that the Bill is incomplete. The principle is probably all right but, as it stands, the Bill could not possibly be effective.  If an attempt were made to enforce it, it would be unequal administration of the law and I would not be in favour of that.  On the other hand, if the Bill were amended to such a pitch as to bring in the other animals and to be applicable in the case of other classes of people, you would be making it compulsory on a woman living in a cottage to carry out some kind of painless operation on a pig.</P>

There is at present a disposition amongst groups and associations to interfere in the business of other men, to interfere in the business of the greatest class in this country and to regulate for us, the farmers, and those associated with us, the conduct of our business.  I say quite frankly that, perhaps, that practice has gone far enough.  I do think that the slaughter of animals is a brutal thing.  I was once in a slaughterhouse and I have never paid a second visit because of the inherent and necessary brutality of destroying a living animal.  I should like to remind the House that for hundreds of years in the history of our country butchers were never allowed on the jury in a capital case.  I can refer to Senator Brown for confirmation of that.  Therefore, it has always been recognised <Col N="2156" /> that the slaughter of animals is a brutal thing.  But, this also has been recognised.  Man apparently has assumed to himself the right to destroy other animals for his own sustenance. The members of the farming community are the people who love animals most; no man loves an animal as much as a farmer does.</P>

      <P>Of necessity, they must sometimes.  I agree that every precaution should be taken to see that animals, not merely in a slaughterhouse, but elsewhere, should suffer as little as possible in the exercise by man of his right to take their lives. Because I agree with that, I think it is unfortunate that this measure should be brought forward as a private Bill, representing the ideas of people who may have distorted views and who do not understand as thoroughly, as do farmers and people in the business, the nature of the work they purport to legislate for.</P>
      <P>Take sub-section 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every person engaged in driving or bringing any animal to a slaughterhouse or knacker's yard shall so drive or convey the animal as to avoid the infliction upon the animal of any unnecessary suffering, pain or fatigue.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2157" /> Do you think that is a new discovery? Why is that put into the Bill?  As long ago as 1849 a section equally well expressed was made law and it has been for almost 100 years the law that you must not inflict unnecessary pain on animals, not merely animals going to a slaughterhouse, but animals going anywhere.  What is the purpose of bringing that into this measure?  I think it is unnecessary and it seems to be brought in there with the object of showing that everybody, with the exception of the people at the back of this Bill, is a barbarian and that we are dealing with a barbarous state of society.</P>
    <P>Take the next sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every owner or occupier of a slaughterhouse or knacker's yard .... shall cause every animal which is confined in such slaughterhouse, knacker's yard or premises preparatory to being slaughtered to be provided with a sufficient quantity of wholesome water and where such animal is confined for a period exceeding 12 hours with a sufficient quantity of wholesome food.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As regards water, of course nobody would be so inhuman as to allow an animal to suffer from thirst.  But who drew up that section providing that the animal should be fed?</P>

      <P>I hope it will not be in any Act for which this legislature will have responsibility, because I imagine that no person who knows anything about the slaughter of animals even in a farmyard would think of feeding the animal immediately before slaughter. That would be a cruel thing and, as Senator Counihan said, it is injurious to the animal from the point of view of human food, and that is our only justification for taking the life of an animal.  I am in favour of having animals which are slaughtered in great numbers taken proper care of and slaughtered with the least possible suffering and pain and with the smallest reaction on human beings themselves. At the same time I think it is going <Col N="2158" /> rather far to say that no person under the age of 16 years shall be admitted to, or permitted to remain in a slaughterhouse or knacker's yard during the process of slaughtering any animal or dressing or cutting up the carcase of any animal.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robinson says it does, and let us assume that it does. This is a statute which has tremendous powers of expansion.  It is confined, in the first place, to knackers' yards situated at a distance of not more than two miles by road from a barrack or station of the Gárda Síochána.  If you are two miles away from a barrack or a Gárda station, all the law of the jungle can prevail; nature there can reign with tooth and claw.  Then these five or six gentlemen who back the Bill are to be the originators of the new regime.  That is the meaning of this.  Once they get a Bill of this kind run through, applying to the charmed circle within two miles of a Gárda Síochána barracks, they will say, and with perfect truth, that it is absurd to have regulations which are not of general application.  There would be absolutely no answer to that contention.  Therefore you must argue this case and discuss this matter on the basis that it is ultimately to apply to every farmstead in this land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat again that it is not fair that gentlemen who are not farmers and who do not in any real sense, except as leaders in their county, represent the farming community, should come forward with a measure of this kind without consultation with the farming community or those interested in agriculture. For this reason I thought it <Col N="2159" /> right to speak on this measure and in as far as I can, to call a halt as far as my voice will go, to unnecessary interference with the farming community or those who do their business.  I am in favour, of course, of this humane killer in slaughterhouses if it can be proved&mdash;and it has not yet been proved &mdash;to be in all cases superior to the old method of stunning the animal by means of an axe.  I will not submit to be regarded in any way as less humane than my friend, Senator O'Farrell.  I have as great love for animals, I think, as has any person in this country.  If Senator O'Farrell is prepared to regulate in this State that no animals at all should be killed I would be just as ready to support him as I would to support interference of this character.</P>
    <P>There is another matter and it is about the 5/- fee.  A question was asked about this 5/- fee.  What is it for?  The purpose of that 5/- fee is simply to finance groups of interfering people.  That is the purpose of the 5/- fee.</P>
    <P>I think, as this Bill has been introduced, it ought to receive a Second Reading, but I can promise those responsible for the measure that when it comes to be discussed in Committee it will receive a fairly thorough overhauling and, perhaps, it will emerge a more reasonable and better Bill than it was on its entry into this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>As one interested in farming and cattle rearing, I want to give my views on this measure.  For over 30 years I have been supplying cattle for slaughter in Dublin and I have had opportunities of seeing cattle slaughtered.  Relatives and friends of mine were in the butchering trade and I had in that way opportunities of seeing everything in connection with the slaughter of animals. Like Senator Comyn, I would not agree that I have not as much sympathy and feeling for animals suffering from pain as any Senator in this House or as any person identified with the live stock industry.  I have been in the habit of supplying 30 or 40 cattle a week to butchers supplying the Army <Col N="2160" /> in the Curragh.  Butchers are all trained men at their business and I have seen them all my life at their business.  Up to about 20 years ago the pole-axe was altogether in use. There was up to that time nothing at all known about the humane killer. I must say that in all my experience I have never seen one of the men wielding the pole-axe to make a mistake. They kill the beast in the most humane way, and before killing, the beast is brought into a passage, firmly secured, and everything is done in a proper way.</P>
      <P>Personally I do not agree that the new improved method of killing by the humane killer is any improvement.  At the same time I am of opinion that it should be kept on for partial use.  I have seen the humane killer at use in the abattoir and slaughterhouses in Dublin and there it has a certain advantage.  But in the commencement of its introduction I am aware that it led to accidents and that it injured men engaged in the slaughter.  At the same time in the abattoir I approve of this new method and I think it is quite in order there.  That is, however, different to making it compulsory throughout the country places and in the country towns and districts.  In my view that would be a danger to and a hardship on the farming community. I would be sorry to see its use made compulsory.  As I have said, in the abattoir here and in slaughterhouses where 1,200 cattle are killed in the course of a week I would agree that the humane killer should be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also see that there is a new method of slaughtering sheep.  There is no doubt that that has the effect of stunning the animal and that is an advantage. I would be in favour of the new method applied to the killing of pigs. To that extent I have no hesitation in agreeing with these new methods, and I would say that if possible they might be encouraged and approved of in certain places.  But to make them compulsory throughout the whole country and to have it so that people would be liable to prosecution for using the pole-axe would be very prejudicial to those engaged in the trade and it should not be tolerated.  It <Col N="2161" /> would be a distinct injury to the trade in connection with the slaughter of animals.</P>
    <P>A good many people connected with the Humane Society say that there is a certain amount of inhumanity in people who slaughter animals.  They say that they become insensible to the pain inflicted on the animal.  They allege that there is want of feeling and inhumanity on the part of people engaged in slaughterhouses.  Two or three years ago this matter came up here before and I brought on myself a certain amount of adverse criticism because of the opinions I held on this matter.  This was given expression to in particular by the lady section of the Humane Society.  I asked then that a deputation of these ladies should go down to the end of Grafton Street and come right along and see there in the shop windows the skins of animals that had been slaughtered and afterwards made into ladies' overcoats and furs. I asked those ladies to inquire then as to how these little animals were slaughtered and whether the slaughter was done with the humane killer.  This would apply of course in the case of such animals as seals, foxes and other small animals of that kind.  I told them that there was a grave question of cruelty in the slaughter of all these animals.  I said also that if the ladies would understand it properly it was in most cases only a matter of painting the lily, for the ladies were quite good-looking and would look just as well without wearing the skins of these little animals.</P>
    <P>These are my views and this is how I look at the matter.  Apart from that I would be delighted to see everything in the way of the slaughter of animals carried out in the most humane manner possible.  With regard to Section 1, sub-section (3) of the Bill where it is laid down that the animal preparatory to being slaughtered shall be provided with a sufficient quantity of wholesome water, I, like everyone else, will agree that is correct and very fair.  However, I would point out that if you allow cattle or any beast to be full of food at the time of slaughter it will affect the quality of the meat.  If cattle <Col N="2162" /> are allowed to have food for at least 24 or 36 hours previous to being slaughtered the result will be that the meat of that animal will not set.  That is the expression used in the trade.  If the cattle are slaughtered while quite empty and at the lowest possible temperature the meat will keep a week longer than if the cattle were slaughtered when full of food.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that, before the Bill goes through this House, a committee representative of the farming industry and of those engaged in the slaughter of cattle and of the provision of meat supplies generally should be consulted. They represent an important section of the community.  Naturally, their object is to make a success of their business and they can only do that by being able to offer the best class of article to the public and selling it under the best possible conditions.  They should not be penalised by harsh legislation or by anything that would interfere with them in the carrying on of their business.</P>
    <P>I think that some of the sections of this Bill go entirely too far.  They propose to interfere too much with people in the conduct of their business.  Those connected with the butchering business have gone to great expense and trouble to learn the best methods of carrying it on.  I had two of my own sons taught the butchering business so that they might learn everything about meat.  It has been stated that it is a cruel thing to allow other cattle to be present while an animal is being slaughtered; that they suffer a great deal from fear.  I do not know if that is the case, but I do know that cattle have a great objection to the smell of blood and that it has the effect of making them get very excited and into a great temper.  The smell of blood seems at times to make them almost mad.  I have seen that happen sometimes in the open fields.  I do not know that they are affected otherwise, except by the smell of blood.  I agree that care ought to be taken to save animals from getting into that state. Care should also be taken that their temperature is at the lowest possible point at the time of slaughter.  That can be brought about by not feeding <Col N="2163" /> them for 24 or 36 hours before they are slaughtered.  As I said earlier, I think that those connected with the butchering trade should be consulted before the Bill is allowed to leave this House. Representatives of the trade should be able to put valuable suggestions before a committee of the House if one is set up to go into the matter.  Legislation of this kind should not be passed hastily.  People connected with the cattle and live-stock industry should have their views heard.  It would be a foolish thing to adopt any other procedure in connection with the Bill. The members of the Humane Society are no doubt striving to do very good work.  The objects of the society are commendable and everyone gives the members of it credit for their good intentions.  Their activities have resulted in saving animals from a lot of cruelty that would otherwise take place.  At the same time it would be a very serious thing for this House to pass a measure the effect of which would be calculated to interfere with one of our most important industries. Some of those connected with the Humane Society may be carried away more or less by an enthusiasm that is not exactly well placed.  Therefore, I urge on the Seanad not to pass this Bill hastily because, in my opinion, it is open to a great many objections.</P>

      <P>I propose supporting the Bill.  I had intended reading extracts from a memorandum that I have obtained dealing exclusively with the slaughter of sheep, but since it is felt that humane slaughter might reasonably be applied to cattle and that it would be quite unreasonable to apply it to sheep&mdash;no objection was raised to the Bill on that ground, and anyway the matter was dealt with to a certain extent by Senator O'Farrell&mdash;it is hardly necessary for me, I think, to delay the House by reading this extract dealing with the slaughter of sheep.  If any question should be raised, I can give the memorandum to Senator O'Farrell so that he may avaíl of it when replying. There is one other matter that I want to refer to.  It is in connection <Col N="2164" /> with Section 6, the section that refers to kosher killing.  Senator O'Farrell, when moving the Second Reading of the Bill, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want to utter a personal note here and it is this, that this section must not as far as I am concerned indicate any approval or commendation on my part of the Jewish or Mohammedan method of slaughter. On the contrary it is to me rather revolting to think that anybody should imagine that he is going to win spiritual favour for himself in the eyes of an All-Merciful Providence by inflicting tortures upon the dumb units of His creation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the time at my disposal I have failed to discover that any Jew believes that he will get spiritual favour &ldquo;for himself in the eyes of an All-Merciful Providence by inflicting tortures upon the dumb units of His creation.&rdquo;  I think that the rules in connection with kosher killing had their origination probably at the time when Our Lord gave to Moses the Tablets on the Mountain which included a great deal more than the Ten Commandments, but I have failed to find any text actually stating the circumstances under which this arose except that we find this in 2 Chronicles, chap. xxii, verse 17: &ldquo;For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified; therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the Passovers.&rdquo;  To this day the man who receives a certificate from the chief Rabbi under the instructions of the head committee who regulate these things must be a man of piety and virtue; he must have a certain amount of rabbinical and biblical knowledge.  That, I imagine, was the best effort of the Jews of those days of providing humane slaughter: that is to say that only a man whom the councils of the Jews regarded as a suitable person to carry out this operation was appointed, and that as a result you would get a certain class of man who generation after generation of Levites would have received a special knowledge in connection with it.  The result would be that the animals to be slaughtered would receive better treatment.  I think that <Col N="2165" /> is much more likely as an explanation of kosher killing than that they would find &ldquo;spiritual favour in the eyes of an All-Merciful Providence.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I had no convictions upon the subject of this Bill until I came here this afternoon.  We have now heard a good many arguments on both sides and I find myself, after having heard those arguments, generally in favour of the Bill.  I do not say it cannot be improved in Committee, but I think it is generally agreed, at any rate, that it should be given a Second Reading. One of my reasons in favour of the Bill is that the slaughter of large warm-blooded animals is a very brutal process and has a brutalising effect upon the people engaged in it.  The less brutal it can be made the better, in the interests of the human beings engaged in the work as well as in the interest of the animals that have to be slaughtered.  I am not in favour of meddlesome legislation.  We have had a good deal of that and a great deal of it has never been able to be put into practice.  I am impressed by Senator Counihan's remarks referring to sub-section (4) of Section 1, that is, rendering unlawful the slaughter of any animal in the presence of any other animal.  If that is practical I think it should be done, and those who say it is not practical should afford proof that it is not practical.  Another argument with which I am not impressed is this: We are told the Bill is not comprehensive and that, there-because of that it is impracticable, we are told also that it is impracticable to make it comprehensive and that, therefore, the whole Bill is bad.  That is purely destructive criticism and it is not fair at all.  Either you think the whole thing is nonsense or it is not. If you think it is nonsense you should say so.  But to condemn it because it is not comprehensive, and for that reason to say that you must do nothing is quite unreasonable.</P>

    <P>Because the Bill exempts pigs is not, I think, any reason why we should reject the Bill; and, because it exempts Jewish butchers and Mohammedans and certain knackers' yards further than two miles from a Civic <Col N="2166" /> Guard barracks, is not a sufficient cause for its rejection.  There is an old French saying: &ldquo;The best is the enemy of the good.&rdquo;  Very freely translated I think it means: do not stop reform because it is not absolutely complete reform.  It is much better to have partial reform, in a matter of this kind, than to have none at all.</P>
    <P>As to the difficulties that the farmers may be put to under the Bill I am not quite clear and I think that matter wants more explanation.  Reading the first section one would think no difficulty would be caused because it speaks of slaughterhouses and knackers' yards. One would understand that where business is carried on on a big scale, people would be able to afford humane appliances in the conduct of their business.  When we come to the definition in Section 9 we find:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the expression slaughterhouse means any building, premises or place used in connection with the business of killing animals for the purpose of the flesh being used as butcher's meat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That does raise the question of practicability but that no doubt will be gone again into in Committee.  I think, when we examine these cases, it is incumbent that the matter should be examined in Committee.  It is generally agreed that there should be some legislation on these points and I repeat it is incumbent upon the critics to prove definitely and not by generalisation that the phases of the Bill to which they take objection are not practicable.</P>

      <P>I want to say a word or two in support of this Bill.  I speak as a representative of the ordinary farmer who has no connection with the killing of animals except pigs and poultry on the farm.  When I read the Bill first it struck me to ask: Would it apply to the very numerous people who have become amateur butchers because of the ramifications of the economic war and because of the impossibility of selling their beasts?  All round the country where I live the farmers have <Col N="2167" /> taken to killing sheep and cattle which they cannot sell.  Would they come under the Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be impossible for many of these farmers, who have become extremely poor, to spend £5 upon a humane killer.  That is what troubles me about the Bill.  I have been making enquiries and asking some of those people how they kill their animals when they slaughter them.  I find that in the vast majority of cases their animals are slaughtered with sporting guns.  A man who is a good sporting shot is called upon to come to the farmer's place, and the animal is shot and I am told that it works out very humanely.  Very rarely does it occur that death is not quite sudden. As long as I can remember, farmers in certain villages, who kill pigs and sheep, kill a bullock or two at Christmas, and almost invariably that killing is done by the use of a shotgun of the ordinary kind.  It would be absolutely impossible for the vast majority of those poor farmers to buy a humane killer unless they could co-operate and buy one that could be passed around from one to the other. I would like to hear more about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the whole I am in entire sympathy with the Bill.  I agree with Senator Bagwell that if we cannot absolutely prevent pain, in every single instance, we should do all we can to have the animals that we use for food slaughtered humanely.  There are very few people in my opinion who would say that we should not have this Bill and everybody wishes that it should get a Second Reading.  I agree it might be improved in Committee. We might then consider the general outlook of the people with regard to the matter of cruelty to animals.  It is not a pleasant thing to have to say, indeed it is a humiliating thing to have to admit, that we are far behind most civilised countries in our outlook in that matter.  We are more on a level with the Spaniards and the Italians than we are with the people of <Col N="2168" /> Northern Europe.  While we are supposed to be a chivalrous people, we are by no means free from reproach upon the question of cruelty to animals. That is the common attitude throughout the country and you would be laughed at if you suggested anything else.  A man works a horse all its life and then when it becomes no more use for his purpose he sells it for a few shillings to a tinker.  That is a terrible thing to have to say.  Senator Comyn said that the people are remarkable in their fondness for animals.  That is not true.  I take no pleasure whatever in saying that.  Our reputation in regard to kindness to animals is that we are far behind other people in the world.  We are behind the hard-headed and unsentimental Scotch and, also, we are behind the people of the United States.  The greatest fanatic that the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has produced would not equal it.  A man gets six months for what he would get a sixpenny fine in this country.  In the City of New York some years ago, when they gave up the horse-driven trams, they did not have an auction to sell the horses.  There was a big outcry for the prevention of that and a public park was bought and these horses were pensioned off for the rest of their lives.  That is an actual fact, and I am just giving it in order to show the general outlook of these people on this question.</P>
    <P>Senator Quirke mentioned the slaughter of poultry.  I am surprised that that very wasteful method of bleeding poultry is still in existence in any part of the country.  We have long since abandoned that method in our part of the country.  The method of slaughtering all birds now is exactly the same as the hanging of a human being.  You take the head of the bird between your fingers and give the neck a sudden twist and the bird feels no pain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, sir, I may inform Senator Miss Browne that it is from the viewpoint of economy that they do the bleeding, and when the woman cuts the back of the chicken's neck or the <Col N="2169" /> goose's neck she is making provision for the following morning's breakfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that that method had gone out of date many years ago.  Of course, the bird is of much better quality when the blood is allowed to run down to the head.  That is the method in my part of the country.</P>

      <P>That is all I wish to say.  I wish to give general support to the Bill and undoubtedly it can be improved in Committee.  Nobody knows better than I do that fanatical people do a great deal more harm than good when they try to deal with this question of cruelty to animals.  I myself have received the most outlandish and absurd letters from various people.  I received a letter a short time ago from a well-meaning lady in which she informed me that she had attended a poultry instruction class conducted by the county council poultry lecturer.  She said that she was shocked at the horrible cruelty of choking chickens and she wanted me to bring it up here as a matter of national importance.  People like that often do a lot more harm than good and they unfortunately give the impression that the other very sensible people with plenty of commonsense who are interested in this matter of the prevention of cruelty to animals are all fanatics also.  In that way they do a considerable amount of harm.  I have got many other letters of the same kind from people who, no doubt, are very well meaning but who do not understand the question.  I welcome the Bill and I hope it will be supported here and get general support through the country.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a point of principle, and that is why premises more than two miles from a barrack should be exempted from the operation of this Act.  It seems an extraordinary piece of legislation and, I should imagine, quite unprecedented. To my mind, it presupposes an altogether wrong attitude towards the <Col N="2170" /> police.  People do not do things merely because they are afraid of the police but because they have a respect for the law.  The police are merely incidental or auxiliary to it.  Such things should be done incidentally and irrespective of whether or not the police can enforce them.  Besides, two miles seems to be a very narrow limit.  I should imagine that the ambit of the duties of the police extends far more than two miles from the barrack in these days of rapid locomotion, and it seems ridiculous that this provision should apply inside the two-mile limit and not outside it.  Such legislation seems inconsistent and absurd.</P>

      <P>I was not here when the Bill was introduced and, therefore, missed some of the arguments of the promoters of the Bill. What I desire to draw particular attention to is sub-section (4) of Section 1 of the Bill.  That sub-section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No person shall slaughter or cause or suffer to be slaughtered any animal or dress or cause or suffer to be dressed the carcass of any animal within the view of another animal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it is only a very few weeks ago&mdash; certainly not more than a couple of months&mdash;since a case of this kind was brought before the public.  This case occurred immediately behind one of the most fashionable streets in Dublin, Grafton Street, and a prosecution took place.  An ordinary citizen, passing down a lane behind that street, saw certain sheep being killed, dressed and so on, while their fellow-animals were within a few yards of the slaughter. This ordinary citizen went to one of the humane societies and brought an officer of the society there to look on. The door was open, everybody could see what was going on, children and young people could stand and look on. The officer of the humane society saw what was going on and brought a prosecution.  The person responsible for this slaughter in this yard, with an open door and with the slaughter going on before the other animals, got completely out of the case on the evidence of a veterinary expert who came to the <Col N="2171" /> court and gave it as his opinion that sheep had no feelings.  They absolutely, he said, had no feelings of any kind and the slaughter of their sisters and their brothers within the immediate proximity had no effect on them.  Therefore, I think that sub-section (4) of Section 1 is most desirable, because I think very few, or at least not many citizens, realise that most of the meat they eat is slaughtered in the back-lanes of the City of Dublin.  Those who live in the vicinity of those yards know what that means.  I think that for that reason sub-section (4) will have to be supported.</P>
    <P>I might say also, although it has nothing to do with the Bill, that private slaughterhouses should be abolished.  There is a magnificent abattoir, splendidly equipped and licensed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the sheep are killed in front of each other there, too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanePower" hpid="Mrs. Wyse-Power Mrs. Wyse-Power">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Wyse-Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, there are licensed slaughter yards.  At the time the abattoir was built the pressure of this very powerful trade was as strong then as it is now and these concessions were given to these private slaughterhouses. As I say, it has nothing to do with the Bill but, in a way, it hinges on it.  I think, however, that if a Bill of that kind were asked for there would be no difficulty in getting it.  I support this Bill from a humane motive and also from a practical motive because the slaughter of animals for export for foreign use has been carried out with the humane instrument and we have not heard of any mistakes or any complaints in that connection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Until this debate started I never thought there were so many callous-minded people composing the Seanad.  Even some of those who supported the Bill have done so in a rather apologetic strain, as if they felt ashamed, and looked upon it as a sort of weakness in their character.  To listen to the general debate, in the course of which there was not one solid argument advanced against the Bill, one would imagine that something <Col N="2172" /> unprecedented and unheard of was being proposed.  I pointed out last evening, and it has been pointed out since, that laws along exactly the same line as this, are in operation in Scotland and in Northern Ireland for some time past, and that a similar law will apply in England and Wales as from January 1st.  We have reports to the effect that no difficulty whatever has been experienced in the administration of these laws, in what is just another part of Ireland, where they have exactly the same problems, where they have the farmers&mdash;as we always will, I hope&mdash;where they have butchers and all the he-men and the old women.  As far as one can learn the Act has been administered there without a semblance of difficulty or complaint from anybody.  Going outside this country I find in Finland legislation of this kind for all animals including pigs and the bigger types of poultry, turkeys and geese since 1902. It is also compulsory for cattle, sheep and lambs.  For the slaughter of pigs special cages are installed.  In Switzerland humane slaughter is compulsory since 1923 as a result of a referendum. That is a tribute to the people of Switzerland with their farming and other problems, who are able to extend enlightened consideration to dumb beasts that cannot speak for themselves and that are subject to the complete control and authority of mankind. Humane slaughter is compulsory in Bavaria since 1930 for cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, horses, mules, jennets and dogs.  In Anhalt this applies also to rabbits and poultry, and in Schleswig-Holstein fish are included. In Norway it is compulsory for all animals since the 1st of January of this year.  Reindeer are now included. Humane slaughter has been in operation in Bray, beside Dublin, since 1932 and we have had no complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In slaughterhouses where animals are killed for export they are stunned by a mechanical killer since 1930, as a result of an amendment moved to a Bill by me.  If it is good and proper to have that provision in operation in slaughterhouses for export purposes, surely it is equally right and proper that it should apply to slaughter for <Col N="2173" /> home consumption.  To listen to some of the speeches made here one would imagine that this was the only country in which there were farmers and butchers who made their living by slaughtering animals and selling them. Across the Channel the vast majority of the cattle, sheep and pigs that we produce are killed by humane methods. We are nothing like as advanced a community as many of these nations that have adopted this method. Senator Counihan suggested that the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was the real promoter of this Bill.  Senator Brown gave him his reply.  Even if it was, surely that would not detract from the merits of the Bill.  The Bill should be considered on the merits and without prejudice of any kind.  The Senator thought there was scandalous injustice in the case of a man who tied up two sheep and left them there for a considerable time, because the person who bought them did not turn up.  It was not the Society that was responsible for that but the District Justice who merely administered the law of the land as it stands.  It was strange to hear the Senator condemning the Society for congratulating the Guards for performing their duties.  I am afraid that is an indication that the objections to this Bill are not in detail but in principle, and that people will not state their real opinions but try to jettison the Bill by a side wind.</P>
    <P>Complaint has been made about the provision for driving animals for the purpose of slaughter, so that the minimum of hardship and suffering shall be involved.  Senator Counihan is a great admirer of most things that are done in England, particularly as he sends his cattle there.  The British Bill contains this provision:</P>
    <P>Every person engaged in driving or bringing any animal to the place of slaughter shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  avoid, as far as practicable, driving or bringing in the animal over any ground which is likely to cause the animal to slip or fall; and</P>
    <P>(b)  otherwise adopt such methods and precautions as will prevent the <Col N="2174" /> infliction upon the animal of unnecessary suffering and pain.</P>

      <P>If there is a law of the type the Senator mentions in operation it is a law that was passed by the British Parliament.  Why then was it considered necessary to insert this provision in the last British Act? As a lawyer the Senator will probably be able to say something about that. The question of the provision of food for an animal who is kept for more than 12 hours is a matter of detail. Some people seem to think that if you can improve the quality of the meat you are entitled to starve an animal to death.  I refuse to admit that that is justifiable in the sight of either God or man.  There seems to be no real justification for keeping animals an unreasonable time awaiting slaughter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems reasonable. If animals are only kept 12 hours there is no provision regarding the supply of food.  I do not think there would be any difference of opinion in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Objection has been raised regarding the killing and dressing of carcases before other animals.  The other animals, presumably, are awaiting slaughter.  Surely they should not be in the slaughterhouse while the bodies are being cut up.  In 99 per cent. of cases all that is necessary is the erection of a very small covered partition, which might be movable, to shut off beasts while other animals were being slaughtered.  Any butcher or slaughter man would have very little trouble in getting a partition erected for a few shillings and putting canvas about it. Some reference has been made to the <Col N="2175" /> captive bolt as being dangerous, that people might go around pushing the pistol into someone's body and perhaps fire a bullet.  A person anxious to commit murder will always find means of doing so.  As this bolt only travels two and a half inches it would be necessary to press it against a person's body, and when fired it makes a sound like a gun.  That cannot be done on the quiet.  That is placing an extraordinarily low value on the morality of those concerned.  We are asked, why should licences be necessary?  The question is: why should not licences be necessary?  How are all sorts of incompetent individuals to be prevented from exercising their brutal tastes upon beasts unless there is some control through the medium of licences?</P>
    <P>Last evening, when discussing this very Bill with four other Senators, one Senator informed me&mdash;I think he looked on me as an unpardonable weakling&mdash;that when he was a young lad in a country town he and his companions gave 2d. a time to the local butcher to allow them to fell cattle that were going to be slaughtered.  It was a local pastime, and I suppose I shall be accused of interfering with the social amenities of the place if that sort of thing is stopped.  Senator Comyn, in an amazing type of speech for a lawyer, asks why should we fix an age limit.  Why fix the age of 16 as the age under which children shall not be present at the killing of animals?  How can a young person accustomed, I suppose, from the age of ten or 12, to blood and life-taking and all the essential barbarities of the slaughterhouse, be brought up with anything but a callous and brutal type of mentality?  He ridicules the idea of fixing an age limit at all.  Why 16?  Why is 16 mentioned in certain Acts of Parliament regarding the age of consent and so on?  Why is a certain limit fixed beyond which a publican may not sell beer or spirits to a person except in a sealed vessel? Why is an age limit fixed in regard to betting houses?  Why have we in the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat Exports) Bill imposed a limit so that <Col N="2176" /> nobody under the age of 18 can get a licence?  The idea of a lawyer asking a question like that seems to me to be perfectly absurd.</P>
    <P>The drastic statement is made that the small fee for the issue of a licence, which, of course, has to be charged to cover the expenses involved therein, shall be given to finance interfering people.  The Senator was anxious for a glib figure of speech and he used that expression, knowing very well that the local sanitary authority could not subscribe that money or any portion of it to any society.  That is the type of opposition that this Bill has received.  Another objection has been the suggestion that the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Local Government may give a permit to certain people other than Civic Guards to inspect these slaughterhouses. Here again, our friends in Scotland are not particularly fanatical or tender-hearted people, and Section 4 of their Bill provides:</P>
    <P>Any constable or any person authorised in writing by the local authority may enter a slaughterhouse or a knacker's yard....</P>
    <P>In the Northern Ireland Bill, the provision is:</P>
    <P>Any officer or constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary or any person authorised in writing by the local authority....</P>
    <P>Ours is more close than that because we confine it to the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government.  They are not going to allow irresponsibles and merely interfering people to inspect slaughterhouses. I took it from some of the arguments that there is no objection to the Bill being passed provided no means are made available for its enforcement.  I am not prepared to subscribe to that policy.  Senator Quirke made rather an amusing speech. He said that the Bill to be consistent or of any use should be made to apply to all including the individual farmer in which event it would be ridiculous. So we should do certain things in order to be consistent so as to make ourselves ridiculous.  I think he was just <Col N="2177" /> building up a straw man.  He was sorry that a lot of objections were not in it that he hoped would be in it so that he could knock them down or in any case, point them out.  He points out that the farmers could not afford to pay £10 for a mechanical killer.  There really is not such a price.  The highest price one can pay is £5, but this does not happen to apply at all to the farmers.  I do not know why the farmers are mentioned.  One would imagine that every farmer was a butcher but the biggest thing that the great majority of farmers in Ireland ever kill is a turkey and even until very recently, they did not kill their own pigs.</P>

      <P>The Senator said that he was once in a slaughterhouse and could never be tempted to enter one again because of the horror of it. This is the Senator who comes along and inveighs against this Bill and while giving it a sort of lip sympathy in a general way, attacks every section of it.  He admits that something should be done but this Bill does not do what he wants and he gives no indication of what he would like to be done.  He says it is a pity it is not a Government measure.  None of the other Bills in Northern Ireland, Scotland or England were Government measures.  This has been left to private members in all these parliaments and when a Bill is passed by the Oireachtas it ceases to be a Private <Col N="2178" /> Member's Bill or a Government Bill. It is then an Act of the Oireachtas and has exactly the same moral authority as if introduced by a Minister because it has the support of at least the majority of the people's representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were asked if the promoters own a four-footed beast.  I own a dog but I do not know whether it is necessary for a person to own a four-footed beast in order to have some conceptions as to what is right when you go to slaughter that beast.  One Senator suggested that we should have a committee of butchers or, at least, a lot of butchers on the committee to deal with this Bill.  Just a few minutes before, Senator Comyn said that butchers were not allowed on juries where a capital charge is concerned. That is news to me but it is an indication of the fact that one should not allow a person who is accustomed to taking life&mdash;and this is no charge against his character&mdash;to be the judge of what is humane and what is not. We are all more or less the victims of circumstances, and familiarity with blood, familiarity with life-taking of any kind, renders us callous, no matter how we are composed and what would appear frightfully cruel, and rightly so, to a normal being would appear the normal thing to a person of that type.  Senator Quirke admitted that selling a beast was rather a pleasant operation so far as he was concerned.  He had no nervousness or anything of the kind and that, I presume, is because of familiarity.  That is not the mentality that we should allow to govern the relationships of men and beasts in this country any more than in any other country.  The law lays it down at present that nobody shall deliberately treat with cruelty or deliberately neglect a beast. Senator Counihan and Senator O'Connor seem to think that if a beast gets into their possession, they have a perfect right to do with that beast as they think fit.  I dissent from that entirely; otherwise, all these laws that seek to prevent the dumb creation from unnecessary suffering are invalid and unreasonable and unjust.  I should object to any slaughterman or <Col N="2179" /> any committee of slaughtermen being the judges as to what is right and proper in a matter of this kind.  I think it is a preposterous proposal.</P>
    <P>A question has been raised regarding the exemption of slaughterhouses two miles or more distant from a Civic Guard station.  That is a weak point in the Bill but it can be remedied on the Committee Stage.  The reason it was inserted in the Bill was to overcome all those numerous objections we have heard&mdash;firstly, the difficulty of administration and secondly, the fact that you might compel people to employ a humane killer although they might only slaughter a beast once for a wonder.  The definition in the Bill really confines it to slaughterhouses proper and to knackers' yards; it does not apply to the ordinary odd killing.  If that is the only objection to the Bill, I do not think anybody need lose a night's sleep over it because it can be amended and we can then see what the objections are in the other direction.  Another question was raised as to why pigs have not been included in the scope of the Bill.  They have not been included because the strongest objections, to the extent to which there were any objections, have been against the use of the humane killer in the case of pigs, for reasons which some butchers and slaughtermen consider very weighty indeed.  They have been omitted in the Scotch Bill and in the Northern Ireland Bill, but they are included in the English Bill wherever an electrical supply is available or can be reasonably made available for the use of the new electric stunner that is now in vogue.  Personally, I see no reason at all for exempting them, and I admit the inconsistency of the measure in leaving them out, but that is a matter for Committee. The object of the Bill is to ensure the exercise of the maximum of humanity with the minimum of inconvenience to those concerned.  A great deal of talk has been made with regard to the alleged interference with the business of the farmer.  This has got absolutely nothing to do with the farmer.  It is <Col N="2180" /> not a question of interfering with him. I do not know how anybody could suggest that it has anything to do with the farmer who is not normally a butcher.  I believe there is a sufficiency of decency, of enlightened outlook and moral courage in the Seanad to ensure a Second Reading for the Bill and also its passage through the various other stages in the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>My reason for suggesting that this Bill should be sent to a Select Committee of the Seanad is, as has been stated by several Senators, that the promoters of the Bill and, indeed, the majority of Senators here, know practically nothing about the business for which we are legislating. I say it is unfair and unjust to pass legislation, penalising and imposing several restrictions on business people, without giving them an opportunity of placing their case before a Committee.  That is the reason I say <Col N="2181" /> that the Bill should be referred to a Select Committee.  The number of people to be heard need not be very large.  I propose to bring before this Select Committee the President of the Victuallers' Association in Dublin, the Chief Veterinary Inspector of the Corporation and a professor of the Veterinary College together with a few others.  The promoters of the Bill can get whoever they like to give evidence. I am not a butcher and I have no connection with butchers.  My main concern is that I am here representing the livestock trade and the farming community. The more expense we put on butchers the more there will be to deduct from the producer, who is the farmer.  I do not believe that it is right to pass legislation which would penalise any section of the community without giving them an opportunity of placing their case before the public. Furthermore, I am anxious that we should have a commonsense Bill.  I am anxious to have a Slaughter of Animals Bill, but I want a commonsense Bill.  I want a Bill that will leave the House with the practically unanimous approval of the Seanad.  If it does not do that, I am very doubtful that it will ever pass in the other House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second Senator Counihan's proposition.  I think it would be a great mistake to allow a Bill of such far-reaching importance, which applies to a very large industry, to pass this House without having it properly considered and without hearing representatives from the trade concerned.  I have had an opportunity of obtaining the views of men who are engaged in that trade. In regard to the provision in Senator O'Farrell's Bill, as to the inhumanity of leaving animals without food for 12 hours before slaughter, I am certain that you would not get two men in the butchering trade to agree that an animal should not be left without food for at least 24 hours before it is killed. There is no cruelty involved when these animals are supplied with water. The longer they are left to fast, the better is the condition of the meat and it is in the interests of the butcher to <Col N="2182" /> have his meat in the best possible order to satisfy his customers.  I think it would be a great mistake for the Seanad to allow this Bill to pass without having it throughly examined, seeing that there are so many interests involved.  It should not be allowed to go from this House in a condition which would leave any room for complaint by the men who are living by this industry. The butchers at least have a right to be consulted and it is only right that they should be given an opportunity of going before this committee.  It will not delay the passage of the Bill six months.  The people, on whose living the provisions of the Bill have a direct bearing, should be consulted before it becomes law.  I have been approached already by some leading butchers who would be glad to have an opportunity of appearing before a committee. Therefore I support in the strongest possible manner the motion to refer the Bill to a Select Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see a measure dealing with the humane slaughter of animals made part of the law of this land.  For that reason I support the appointment of a committee to take whatever evidence they may think proper to produce a measure which will be in accord with the general sense of the people.  I am not at all influenced by the fact that we are told there are similar measures in operation in Switzerland and Czecho-Slovakia.  We know as well as any other people how to conduct our own business.  I am of opinion that if this committee is not set up and if this Bill goes to discussion in Committee of the House <Col N="2183" /> without some sort of friendly interchange of views, probably the Bill will be lost in this House, and if not lost here will probably be lost in the Dáil, because, of course, there are people in the Dáil who have a very intimate personal knowledge of matters of this kind.  It is desirable that the matter should be discussed on its merits and that nobody should be allowed to feel any sense of resentment by reason of the fact that a measure of this character, affecting the great mass of the people, should be brought forward and imposed upon them by others.  That is the danger which the supporters of this Bill have to face&mdash;the feeling that we are being dictated to in our business by others. I would be very sorry that that feeling should prevail to any considerable extent, because it might have the effect of preventing this measure, as amended, from becoming law.  That is the reason I support the proposal of Senator Counihan to send it to a committee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have still fairly good powers of hearing.  I am referring solely to what was said by Senator Comyn just now before I rose.  He said that this was a Bill that might affect the large mass of the people and he gave that as a reason for sending it to a committee and not discussing it in this House.  If I were to put that forward as a reason in connection with any of the public Bills which affect the large mass of the people, I have no doubt I would be ridiculed by Senator Comyn.  It is no reason.  That there may be experience in other countries and, therefore, we must not hear about it, seems to be an equally absurd reason.  To my mind, the position is simply this: here we have a measure of which a number of us are strongly in favour; others say they are in favour of it, but do not like certain provisions of it.  Surely, if that be the case, it should be the easiest possible type of measure to have a friendly discussion about in the House.  I may be wrong, but I do not see any reason why if the statements made are true they should not be much more easily and readily discussed in the House. If, in the course of the discussion, abstruse points arise which cannot be dealt with, it is still possible at any time, by a special motion made, to send a particular point to a special committee.  If you look at the Standing Orders you will find that a special section in the Bill can be sent to a special committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know perfectly well that this Bill does not represent all that everybody who is in favour of humane slaughter wants.  The Bill is a compromise, to a large extent, based on experience elsewhere and may, to some extent, be experimental. Deliberately, no demand is made to <Col N="2185" /> apply it to the farmers at present until we have some experience of the whole matter.  It is an attempt at reaching a commonsense measure.  I think I can speak for the other Senators whose names are on the back of the Bill and say that that is all we want and that we are prepared to listen to reasonable arguments.  What I do not believe would help the least bit would be a committee in which we should have experts contradicting each other, as I know would be the case, on nearly all these points.  You can get two veterinary experts, both apparently of equal standing, to contradict each other completely on the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan thinks that very few of us know very much about it. If knowing about it means actually taking part in the trade, I think the number must be infinitesimal, if any.  If knowing about it means having studied the case on both sides, then quite a number have gone to the trouble of finding out and do know something of the case that can be made against parts of the Bill.  The reason why certain things are not in the Bill is because we are convinced of the case against them, and we recognise that there is certain difficulty.  That is the reason why pigs are not included.  How many Bills of the greatest importance are passed here of which a large number know all about them?  You would never pass a Bill at all, otherwise, you would send every Bill to a special committee.  Here is a Bill on which there is no Party Whip.  This is the last kind of a Bill to send to a select committee. We have had lip-service paid to it from the whole House and I believe from the vast majority of the House genuine support of the Bill.  If you want to get the opposite thing, to have every single thing voted by a bare majority, then get a whole lot of experts and get the enthusiasts to give evidence.  Of course there may be, in the course of the Committee discussion on this Bill, some points which we are not able to deal with without some expert evidence, but I think all the points likely to arise can be dealt with by the use of commonsense in this <Col N="2186" /> House, particularly if amendments are carefully prepared and if time is given for their consideration.  If that is not the case, then I think I am correct in saying that portion of the Bill, or even the whole of it, can be sent to a Special Committee.</P>

They might agree with the Bill but it is absurd to pass the Bill without giving them an opportunity of stating their views. Some things in the Bill are foolish. I was coming down the North Circular road at Mountjoy this morning and I saw a drove of bullocks being sent for shipment.  They had spent three or four hours standing in the market and seven or eight of these bullocks were going along with their tongues out.  Because they were going to the docks it was all right, but if they were going to a slaughterhouse the man in charge would be brought before a court and fined £5.  He would also have to employ a solicitor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move&mdash;&ldquo;That this Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  Before I introduced this Bill I consulted with the Minister for Agriculture and I may say that I have received his whole-hearted support. This is a very short and simple Bill and it does not require much explanation. As Senators are aware, since the passing of the Animals (Anæsthetics) Act, 1919, it was unlawful for any person to dishorn any animal over one month old without first administering a general anæsthetic of such strength as to render the animal insensible to pain during the whole process of the operation.  This Bill proposes to repeal that Act.  In the opinion of any commonsense or practical person that Act should never have been applied to Ireland.  It was never enforced, it can never be enforced and it never will be enforced and any law that cannot be enforced should not be retained on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>Every year in this country we dishorn about 200,000 cattle.  These 200,000 illegal operations are performed by about 20,000 farmers and there are only one or two proscutions every year arising out of the 200,000 illegal operations. In consequence of that state of affairs the law, when it is not properly enforced, should be repealed.  Is it cruel to dishorn cattle?  I contend it is not cruel.  I will admit that it is a painful operation, but it is a quick operation.  I have often dishorned hundreds of cattle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us consider the hardship and expense that would be inflicted on farmers if the law were to be enforced.  It would take at least 2/6 to 3/- worth of chloroform to put a beast to sleep; it would necessitate the attendance of a veterinary surgeon, and, in view of the present price of cattle, a farmer living five or six miles away from a vet, and having only one or two cattle to dishorn would have to pay practically the whole value of the two cattle in order to get the operation performed.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, an anæsthetic, when properly administered, will save pain for the half minute during which the horns are taken off, but I would like to lay emphasis on the phrase &ldquo;properly administered.&rdquo;  There is no indication in the Animals (Anæsthetic) Act as to who is to administer the anæsthetic.  I have heard, on reliable authority, of cattle that were put under an anæsthetic for dishorning purposes and they died while under it.  I have heard of cases where cattle were put under an anæsthetic for dishorning purposes and when they were allowed up they pushed their heads against the walls and ran mad around the place. I have never heard of cattle doing anything like that when there was no anæsthetic used.  I have it on the best authority that cattle suffer more discomfort when dishorned under an anæsthetic than when they are dishorned in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Seanad to look at the matter from another aspect.  In the Free State we produce 1,000,000 cattle every year.  We export about 800,000 cattle.  The majority of our cattle have to be transported long distances by rail and sea.  In the first instance, they are taken from the principal breeding parts of the country, the south, west and midlands, and are railed to the port, then shipped to Great Britain and again railed through that country.  Everyone will admit that hornless cattle are very much safer in travel than horned cattle. They cause less injury to one another when going to the fairs or markets and they thrive better.  There is another consideration.  Our customers in England and Scotland require hornless <Col N="2191" /> cattle for house and yard feeding and, unless we are able to supply the goods they require, they will get what they want from Canada where, incidentally, there is no Anæsthetics Act.</P>
    <P>A big proportion of our polled cattle are sent to Scotland and the North of England.  They are fed there in loose houses and covered yards during the winter and spring; they are stall-fed or yard-fed.  Would it not be more cruel if these cattle, instead of being fed loosely around these yards, were to be tied up in a stall, chained and kept there in the same position for the five or six months while they would be fattening?  That is a point of view that people opposed to dishorn cattle might look into.</P>
    <P>This Act cannot be enforced in this country; it would not be worth while endeavouring to enforce it.  Even if it were enforced it would only save pain for about half a minute.  I will ask the House to give this Bill a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second this motion and I hope this measure will be considered with the same calmness and full consideration as this subject has received in this country and in the courts of this country.  There is a law in force here which provides a penalty for cruelty to animals, and cruelty is defined as any unnecessary pain or ill-treatment.  An organisation in Great Britain, where there is a similar law in force, brought proceedings for the dishorning of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In England it was decided by the magistrates and upheld by two judges that the dishorning of cattle was cruelty.  There then came before the courts in this country a case from the County Meath where a farmer named MacMahon was prosecuted for dishorning his cattle.  That was in 1891. The magistrates having taken evidence submitted a number of facts for the consideration of the court.  The first fact was that the dishorning of cattle does cause temporary pain; following upon the dishorning there is also some pain.  It also found that the cattle which were dishorned were more suitable for the purpose of fattening inasmuch <Col N="2192" /> as they throve better.  The cattle were quieter and they found that dishorning enabled them to be fed in what are called straw sheds, that is, sheds partly open.  In these straw sheds the cattle throve much better than if they were confined within stalls.</P>
    <P>There was also a finding, and I see it repeated here by Senator Counihan, that horned animals are considerably injured in transit and that dishorning saves them a very great amount of injury and pain.  The question also arose as to the pain and injury which horned animals do to each other if they are put into a straw yard and allowed to gore each other. Everybody knows what a terrible thing it is when one animal gores another.  As far as a human being can estimate the pain that an animal suffers from the reaction afterwards is much more than what is suffered through being dishorned.  That is to say, the pain of being gored is more than the pain suffered through being dishorned.</P>
    <P>That case was fully debated and very wise men came to this conclusion, that it was not cruelty&mdash;that the mere infliction of pain was not cruelty, provided it is reasonably necessary for the ordinary use of the animal.  If we have control over the animal creation at all then we have the right to use the animals reasonably for the purposes of mankind and it was held in the Irish Courts by three eminent judges that the dishorning of cattle was not cruelty, and the case was dismissed.</P>
    <P>Then in Scotland another case came forward following the Irish case.  The Scottish judges decided that the dishorning of animals in Scotland was not cruelty.  Lord Young, one of the judges said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a rather invidious thing that a great industry, properly conducted by people interested in it and having an interest in their own property and their own animals, should be interfered with on humanitarian grounds by other people who have not the same interest in it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2193" /> Now what you have on this question of the dishorning of animals is this:&mdash; That there were 14 judges in the three countries who offered an opinion and gave their decision upon it.  Ten of these judges were of opinion, and so decided, that dishorning was not cruelty and was not an offence under the 1849 Act, which is a very skilfully drawn Act to prevent dumb creatures from being injured.  These ten judges decided it was not cruelty and two English and two Irish judges decided it was.  Therefore, how the matter stood since 1849 was this, that in England it was illegal to dishorn cattle and in Ireland and Scotland it was not, the fact being that the entire trade in fattening animals was done in Ireland and Scotland and in only one English county.</P>
    <P>Other alternative methods were suggested. It was suggested that instead of dishorning the animal that caustic should be put on the head of the calf when a fortnight old so as to dehorn the animal.  That was regarded as being absolutely impracticable and for various reasons.  One was that horns were given the animals for their protection. Milch cattle are usually bought and sold horned.  A man will not be likely to buy a springing heifer unless he can see the horns, because it is the greatest index to the quality of the animal.  Moreover it is an ornament, it is a protection and it is a good thing for young calves, early growing cattle and cows to have horns.</P>

      <P>Neither Senator Brown nor I can estimate what pain the animal suffers.  I should say the amount of pain is not great, that it is not at all as great as the pain an animal suffers through being gored. Neither do I know what is the effect of an anæsthetic upon the animal, and few people who know nothing about it are entitled to offer opinions. Neither Senator Brown nor I know how much the pain is.  This is a question on which we know nothing except from observation.  I would be of opinion that the animal sustains greater injury and perhaps greater consequential pain through being put under an anæsthetic than it does by having its horns sawn off in 15 or 20 seconds.</P>

      <P>The Senator is not a bovine animal.  The statute speaks of bovine animals.  Let me submit to the House for its consideration&mdash;does the giving of an anæsthetic to bovine animals cause pain?  This Act was passed in 1919 in Great Britain when there were no representatives from this country in that Parliament and when the position and the interests of the persons concerned were not before that Parliament.  This dishorning clause was put in in a schedule. We all know what schedules are. <Col N="2195" /> That was shoved into a schedule with various other matters in relation to cats, dogs, horses and other animals and bovine animals.  The cow comes under bovine animals.  I do not know what else comes under that description, but this was put into the schedule and slipped into legislation, a peculiar law <i>per incuria.</i></P>

        <i>Per incuria</i>, that is without due care.  There was no representative from this country in the Parliament that passed that law, and that law so far as it relates to the other operations on animals, so far as it relates to operations on cats, I do not know how far it has been enforced or obeyed.  So far as it relates to valuable horses, it has been enforced in some cases, but so far as it relates to the dishorning of cattle it has been absolutely and entirely ignored.</P>

      <P>I said so far as the statute relates.  There were other matters as well as the dishorning of cattle dealt with.  My friend, apparently, has not read the Act of Parliament which he is here now proposing to repeal.  There is a large schedule of operations on these animals, including bovine animals, in respect of which an anæsthetic has to be administered by law.  So far as the dishorning of cattle is concerned it has not been obeyed.  It is a law that has not been enforced because it could not be enforced.  It is a law that does not suit conditions in this country.  It was never contemplated by the people who are concerned, was never enforced by the Government, and, of course, it never was obeyed as it could not be. I say nothing at all as to the cost.  If my friend is able to make a case that this dishorning causes unnecessary cruelty, then I will not argue as regards the cost, though I believe the cost would be prohibitive.  But I do not put my argument on that ground.  The ground upon which I put it is this: <Col N="2196" /> that nobody has ever been able to prove that administering an anæsthetic to an animal is not more injurious to the animal than cutting off the horn at the proper time.</P>

It is well to point out that the law has been in force in England.</P>

      <P>I would like to know what is the object of Senator Counihan in bringing in this Bill.  I regret that such a Bill should ever have been brought into this House.  It is a retrograde measure.  The test of the civilisation of a country is how they treat the animals that are here for their use and over which they have control. This is a horrible form of cruelty, and it was put an end to in this country because the courts had decided that it was not cruel.  It was because of that that this Act of 1919 was passed, the purpose of it being to put an end to that cruelty and to overrule the absurd and cruel decisions of the courts.  We are all in favour of dishorning, but the question of whether cattle ought to be dishorned or not is not before the House.  It is the mode of dishorning an animal that we are now concerned with, and I ask are we to go back to the cruel mode in force 14 or 15 years ago?  I am afraid that to some extent, perhaps to a large extent, this is a money Bill.  It is because it is going to cost the owner of the cattle something that this has been introduced.  It is a shameful thing that that kind of argument should be introduced into this House.</P>

This particular way of dishorning cattle is on the Statute Book, but I suggest it is a paper law and that nobody attends to it.  Occasionally an officious Guard with a spleen, perhaps, against some farmer, finds him doing this operation, brings him before the court and has him fined.</P>

I agree it is a painful operation, <Col N="2198" /> but it can be performed in a very short time.  I believe that the aftereffects of an operation without an anæsthetic are no worse than when it is performed with an anæsthetic.  I understand that at the Model Farm a case occurred where an anæsthetic was administered to bullocks, and that when it was over the bullocks went wild through the yard and damaged themselves against the walls. The result was that when a second batch of cattle had to be operated upon they were not given an anæsthetic.</P>

      <P>I do not claim to have any special knowledge of this matter, but this afternoon this House, by almost unanimous consent, approved the principle of a Bill which proposes that when animals are being slaughtered at least the most humane methods will be adopted for that purpose.  Immediately the House had come to that decision, Senator Counihan comes along with a Bill proposing to remove from the statute book an Act for the prevention of cruelty to animals on the lines indicated.  I hope the House will not make itself ridiculous by, in one breath, giving a Second Reading to a Bill for the protection of animals, and in the next breath giving a Second Reading to another Bill to remove from the statute book an Act that was put there for the purpose of preventing the infliction of suffering on dumb animals. It is nonsense for Senator Wilson to ask: Why do you not bring in a Bill to make it compulsory on a dentist to give an anæsthetic when taking out a tooth in the case of a human being? A human being is a free agent in the matter and can decide for himself whether he will have an anæsthetic or not.  Unfortunately the dumb beast <Col N="2199" /> has no choice.  If the custom prevails, as Senator Counihan and Senator Wilson said, then let this House not stultify itself by removing from the statute book an Act to prevent undue suffering being inflicted upon dumb animals.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I was not present during the whole of this debate, but while I have been here I have heard some of the most extraordinary statements in connection with this matter.  Some speakers mentioned the fact that it was ridiculous to have a law on the statute book which was not enforced.  I would like to ask what would be the situation here if every law in the statute book were enforced. I am afraid if the law, as it at present exists, were enforced to the letter, there would be very few people here at all.  Speaking for myself, I say that if it were possible to enforce the law that was in existence a few years ago I would not be here.  If the law at present in force were carried out to the letter many who are here at present would not be here.  There was a difference of opinion in the debate on the last Bill about the amount of suffering endured by animals.  People operating the business of dishorning cattle and who have been accustomed to it, such as Senator Counihan, really look upon it as a trivial matter.  I have been enquiring into the business, and comparing it with various other operations, and, as far as I can find out, the operation of giving a lady a permanent wave causes an enormous lot of suffering.  I do not say it is quite as bad as the operation of dishorning cattle, but it is something that needs attention.  I am serious upon this matter, and have heard a good deal about it&mdash;</P>

Having regard to the discussion that took place on the previous Bill, I think it is rather unfortunate that the two Bills&mdash;the one we are now discussing and the previous Bill&mdash;came on on the same day, <Col N="2200" /> because it is hard for some people to swallow statements they made an hour or so ago, while it would not be so hard for them to swallow statements they made a week ago.  If some painless way of performing the operation of dishorning cattle could be found it would be a good idea.  Perhaps, somebody who knows more about anæsthetics, local and otherwise, could suggest a local anæsthetic which would not be very costly.  But there is one thing I want to emphasise: If the law is altered as requested by this measure, you will be really taking the power out of the hands of the authorities to deal with people carrying out cruel operations. My personal opinion is, and I am talking from experience, that dishorning of cattle, if properly done, with proper weapons, is not really a very serious matter.  I am also aware that there are several ways of dishorning cattle.  There is one particular way something like this: The cattle are driven into a pen, or a shed, and packed tightly together.  A man gets in over the cattle and walks round on the backs of the animals with something like a shears for clipping the horns.</P>

If you take the power out of the hands of the authorities which they have at present, and if a case of dishorning in that fashion, comes to the notice of the Guards, they cannot make anyone amenable to the law.  If you take away that power from the authorities it will be open to certain people to use that cranch or other instrument of torture.

      <P>I am against this Bill. There is really no analogy at all between taking out a tooth and dishorning cattle.  The human being can speak; cattle cannot.  I remember some years ago bringing one of my boys, about four years old, to a dentist.  A local anæsthetic was applied, and when the tooth was extracted the boy looked up at the dentist and said &ldquo;I never want to see your face again.&rdquo;  About the same time I saw a beast dishorned.  The animal was tied down with ropes and a man came along with a shears.  Some people might say that the operation was sharp and swift and that there was not much pain.  In this case it would be much swifter if the instrument had been sharper.  But the man lopped at the horns until he got them off one by one.  I have no doubt that the animal suffered considerable pain. When released half an hour after it ran madly down the street.  I did not know at the time that an anæsthetic should have been applied.  If I had known I would have reported the case. It is only now I know that an anæsthetic should have been applied, and I think we should leave the law on this matter as it is.</P>

I advocated the dishorning of calves of from five to ten days old. We had the greatest possible success, and made these animals nice pollies and got first prizes for many of them at the cattle shows.  Personally, I would say, speaking as a member of the trade and with the experience of a lifetime, that I wish all the cattle in Ireland were pollies from the <Col N="2202" /> point of view of the comfort they have when being fed.  You can feed any amount of pollies with the greatest satisfaction and comfort to themselves, but you cannot feed horned cattle with the same convenience. I think that every farmer now polls his calves at the age I have mentioned, but there is an objection in a good many parts of Ireland where people rear young heifers for breeding purposes and they do not want them polled.  Consequently, I do not think it should be compulsory in such a case where people feel that it is against their interests to have them polled.  For all ordinary cattle, however, I do say, in extenuation of the dishorning being considered cruel in a sense, that it has been a long time in practice, and that there has been a good deal of trade attached to the polled cattle going to Scotland where they are more or less always welcome and where there is an extra demand for them.  I have known of cattle being dishorned by a saw and the operation does not take very long, perhaps at the extreme it would be about five minutes.  What I do say, in extenuation of the certain amount of cruelty which may be attached to it, is that the comfort of the animal afterwards during its two-and-a-half or three years of life or perhaps longer more or less counteracts it, and also there is a certain amount of profit in it.  I do not go so far as to say that there is not a certain amount of pain attached to it, but in extenuation of that, I say that the length of time the operation takes is so short and the satisfaction and comfort to the cattle afterwards is so great that it more than compensates for the small amount of pain inflicted.</P>

      <P>I would like to call your attention to the fact, Senator, that the Bill is not concerned with the advantages of dishorning at all, but as to whether this operation should be performed with or without an anæsthetic.</P>

      <P>I only wanted to explain how the views of the people are influenced.  I do not go so far as to say for a moment that there is not a <Col N="2203" /> certain amount of pain attached, but I do say that the dishorning of the cattle makes for their comfort afterwards.</P>

      <P>I do not know much about this subject except what I have heard during the discussion, but I was impressed a good deal by what Senator Counihan said in his opening speech, which he began by saying that the Minister for Agriculture had given some hearty support to his proposition. This is a repeal Bill, and ostensibly it is being promoted because the law which exists is not being carried out. It is said that it cannot be carried out and will never be carried out and that, in fact, no harm is being done by its being on the Statute Book, except for one or two cases in the year which, presumably, are cases where positive cruelty has been shown to the satisfaction of the prosecuting authority at any rate.  They say that little harm is being done by the existence of this statute, as the promoters of this Bill assert.  The fact that it is a Bill to repeal, and simply to repeal without any consideration of what the corollaries or other effects of simple repeal may be, suggests to me that it is inherently a case where the Minister ought to initiate any motion for repeal and that it should not come forward in this way without any formal approval or support by the Minister or any assertion by him that this is sufficient.  I think that the movers of this Bill ought to withdraw it, and to make their case to the Minister with an urge that he should, if he is so strongly in favour of this action as Senator Counihan suggests, initiate a proposal to repeal this enactment.  Until that were done I think I would oppose the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>All I want to say is that if the House, having passed the Slaughter of Animals Bill, now, hot on its feet passes this Bill, they will make themselves the subject of every comedian and cartoonist in the country, and rightly so.  One Bill is in favour of the humane treatment of animals, and the other proposes to return to barbarity.  All the advantages of dishorning can be obtained by <Col N="2204" /> applying a caustic to the horns of the animal when it is a calf.  Anyone who is keen on dishorning can do that. Senator O'Connor has told us that he dishorns all his cattle before they are a month old.  There is no reason why Senator Counihan or anybody else cannot do that.  If they object to that, it is not too much to ask them to use an anæsthetic.  Senator Wilson says that the law is not being observed at all, that it is a fraud, and, presumably, their tender citizen conscience revolts at the idea of a law being on the Statute Book which is not being observed.  Hence, in this Bill we are asked to remove what is an anomaly. We have had Senator Comyn posing twice to-day as a cattle expert.  If I were a friend of his I would advise him to keep his role of legal expert, judging by the examples of the treatment of brute creation which he gave here to-day.  I do hope that the House will not make a laughing-stock of itself by passing this Bill.</P>

      <P>I shall reply to the last speaker first.  He is very fond, on all occasions, of using the word &ldquo;barbarity&rdquo; and such like expressions to Senators who disagree with him.  He speaks of barbarity because cattle are dishorned.  I contend that the opinions of the people who say there is no cruelty in dishorning are quite as much entitled to be taken as the opinions of Senator O'Farrell. Eminent judges have contended that there is no cruelty when the operation is performed by a competent person under favourable conditions. There are several cases of judges giving that opinion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a law which was passed in 1919.  It was passed in the Imperial Parliament of Great Britain and passed at a time when we had no Irish representatives in the British Parliament.  We all know the influence Senator Brown, Senator O'Farrell, and Senator Mrs. Costello would have in influencing legislators, if there was no one in this House who understood anything about an Act that had been passed.  It was &ldquo;put <Col N="2205" /> up&rdquo; to them by Senator O'Farrell in such terms as &ldquo;barbarity,&rdquo;&ldquo;brutality&rdquo; and &ldquo;cruelty,&rdquo; while anyone who understood the position knows that it would be more cruel to leave the cattle with horns.  I have been asked why not leave very well alone.  I say that there are 20,000 farmers performing 200,000 illegal operations on cattle every year.  I was asked, as a representative of the cattle trade, when a prosecution was taken, to try to have it quashed.  I could not do so; the law must take its course.  Senator Johnson says that there must be cruelty.</P>
      <P>If a member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals walks into any farmer's place and finds him dishorning cattle he can bring that man before a district justice, who has no option but to fine him for breaking the law.  Cruelty need not be proved if the owner was found dishorning the cattle without using an anæsthetic.  These are the facts.  I have not heard very much about the cruelty of hunting a fox, which is much more cruel; I have not heard anything about the cruelty of hunting a stag, which is much more cruel; I have not heard anything about chasing a hare, which is a great deal more cruel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Brown says that this is a Money Bill.  It is.  I pointed out on the Second Reading that if a farmer with two cattle had to pay 2/6 or 3/- for an anæsthetic, as well as the fee of a veterinary surgeon to administer it, he would lose the price of his cattle.  We see where money can be chucked around in all directions to satisfy the whims of a few people who consider there is cruelty in a practice of which <Col N="2206" /> they know nothing.  There is not cruelty.  Senator O'Farrell has stated that the Seanad will make itself ridiculous if it passes this Bill, after agreeing to the principle of the Slaughter of Animals Bill.  I agree with the principle of the Slaughter of Animals Bill when it is referred to a committee of this House, and I hope that that committee will bring forward a commonsense and an agreed measure when they are finished with it.  Senator O'Farrell need not accuse the supporters of this Bill of being in favour of barbarous and cruel practices.  I have done more to prevent cruelty to animals than any other member of this House.</P>

At meetings of the cattle trade I have advocated the prevention of cruelty to animals, especially at fairs and markets and in course of transit, yet I am accused of bringing forward a barbarous measure. I say this is a commonsense measure to repeal an Act which 20,000 farmers are breaking every year.  I thought the members of the Seanad would have more commonsense.</P>
