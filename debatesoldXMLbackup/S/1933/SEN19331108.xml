    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>When the Bill was before the Seanad in Committee an amendment was inserted deleting certain sections of the Bill and inserting others in their place.  Since that amendment was carried certain discussions have taken place with those responsible for it, and I think now they are satisfied that it was a certain misunderstanding that prompted them to put down that amendment and have it carried here.  Apart from that misunderstanding I do not think that it was sufficiently stressed at the time that certain very substantial difficulties would arise if that amendment were carried, in so far as it provided that the expenses of the Act were to be borne out of a fund to be established, according to the amendment.  That would necessitate that certain calculations would have to be made as to the proportion of the salaries of particular officers payable out of the Fund under this Act and that under the Unemployment Insurance Act.  Certain portion of the pensions of these officers would also have to be paid out of the one fund and the other so that the passage of that amendment would probably involve increased expenditure because it would be necessary to set up under each measure an independent organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Partly through my own fault the amendment, designed to put the Bill back in its original form, does not appear on the Order Paper.  As I am anxious to get the Bill passed into law without delay so that we can set up the very elaborate preliminary machinery that has to be established <Col N="1790" /> before it can be brought into effect, I suggest that my amendment might now be dealt with without notice or, alternatively, that the matter be taken on a date between now and next Wednesday when the Dáil meets, so that if all parties are agreed we would be able to give early effect to this measure.</P>

      <P>I am personally aware of the conversations that have taken place between Senator Jameson and the Ministry with reference to his amendment, and I am personally aware that he is now satisfied with the explanation, and the additional information he has received, and that, as far as he is concerned, he would be quite willing that his amendment should be withdrawn and that the section, as it came to the Seanad in the Bill from the Dáil, should be reinserted.  The only question is whether that can be done now or done on a day between this and next Wednesday when the Dáil meets.  I am sure the Seanad would be very sorry to delay this Bill a moment longer than is necessary.  I know that our Standing Orders are very strict.  I suggest if it is convenient to the House that we might meet on Tuesday next instead of on Wednesday and do what is necessary in the way of amendment and then pass the remaining stages of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I recommend the House to adopt that course.  We could take it now but that certain Senators went away believing that this important amendment would not be dealt with as it was not on the Paper.

      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3) of the new Section 25 inserted in Committee to add at the end of paragraph (a) the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and the sum of one shilling and sixpence in the pound mentioned in paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) of this section shall be leviable upon all the said hereditaments and tenements notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any statute whatsoever save and except the said Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930 (No. 27 of 1930).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to make it perfectly clear that the amendments on the Paper are alternative ones, and if one is accepted I shall not press the other.  My object is to secure that those ratepayers who are paying the full rates shall only pay 1/6 in the pound, not 1/8 or 1/8¼ or whatever the Bill as it stands would make the Dublin Corporation pay and which they would have to collect.  I should like to have a slight correction made in this amendment with the permission of the House and that is to insert the words and figures &ldquo;Section 69 of&rdquo; before the words &ldquo;said Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930 (No. 27 of 1930).&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On the last day the Minister spoke of a long-standing feud between the Local Government Department and the local authorities and said that my amendment that day was part of that long-standing feud.  Frankly, I did not know anything about that feud, and I have made inquiries since and cannot find anything at all about it. The Local Government Department or any other Department has ample time to make its demands on the local authorities.  What I am concerned with is that I do not want any trouble to arise between the local authority and the ratepayers.  The ratepayers have to pay the piper, and if they are told <Col N="1792" /> that they have to pay ? in the pound for a certain purpose and they find, when the demand notes come along at the end of the year, that the demand is for ? in the pound, naturally they will start writing to the local authority asking what all this is about.  There is a feeling amongst ratepayers and taxpayers that when a Bill is passed by any Government we start off with a certain sum and no matter what is done that sum will go on increasing.  We are now passing a Bill in which we are asking for ? in the pound, and before the Bill is put into operation at all we all know that it will mean ? in the pound.  To my mind the correct thing in that case is either to charge ? on the assessable valuation or charge ? on the whole rateable valuation.  The demand from the Corporation under the Bill is ? in the pound on the rateable valuation, but the rateable valuation and the assessable valuation are entirely distinct things owing to the operation of the Local Government Act, 1927; the Small Dwellings Act, 1928; the Building Facilities Acts, 1925 to 1930; and the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932.  Under the 1932 Act people who are living in new houses got a Government grant and I think that they only pay one-third of the rates for seven years.  Let us say that the valuation is £21.  It is very unfair only to demand off the man in the new house seven one-and-eight-pences for the purposes of this Bill and from his neighbour 21 one-and-eightpences. I hope this unemployment problem is not going to go on for ever.  It is a special case where we have to make provision for unemployment and I think everybody should bear his fair share of it.  The purpose of my amendment is to bring in the people who get remission of rates under all these different Acts.  I wanted it done in another way on the last day but the Minister would not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister on the last day said that if a local authority wanted to give remission of rates or if they did not collect the rates it was their own fault. In Dublin they certainly collect the rates.  As a matter of fact, although a lot of people complain about the collection of the rates, I understand that <Col N="1793" /> the Dublin collection this year is very much better than last year.  I do not think there can be any complaint as to the way in which the Dublin ratepayers pay the rates.  As to local authorities giving remission of rates on new buildings, it is mandatory on them.  Under one Act it is on a sliding scale&mdash;one-twentieth of the rates the first year, two-twentieths the second year, and so on until they will be paying the full rates at the end of 20 years.  Under another Act they only pay one-third of the rates for seven years.  Under another Act the landlord of a small dwelling if he pays the rates before a certain date must get a reduction of 10 per cent. from the Corporation.  We all know, of course, that it is the tenant who pays the rates, although he may pay through the landlord.  There are many ways in which the old ratepayers in Dublin have suffered.  I do not want to mention Rathmines and Pembroke or the other added areas.  To my mind this is an excepted purpose rate and they will have to pay the same as everybody else.  At the same time there are many ways in which the old ratepayers are suffering. Under this Bill, as well as asking the old ratepayers of Dublin to pay ? in the pound, you are asking them to pay another 2d. for the persons who are not paying full rates.  I have considered this matter carefully and I prefer my first amendment and I would urge the Minister to accept it.  I think it is fair and reasonable in a case like this that we should spread the burden evenly over everybody, because the people in the new houses should bear the responsibility for unemployment as well as the people in the old houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I second.  The whole object of the amendment is to do away with what seems to me&mdash;and I hope will seem to the House&mdash;to be a real injustice.  This rate of ? is not a local rate at all.  It is not a rate for local purposes.  It is a rate for national purposes, and there is no reason why certain hereditaments in particular urban districts should be excused from paying, although they were very properly excused from paying more than a fraction, or perhaps none at all, of the municipal rate for certain reasons for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1794" /> Probably the most important objection to the section as it stands arises in the case of Rathmines and Pembroke. I do not agree with Senator Staines about these areas being obliged to pay the ?.  Even though the amendment is not passed, they would have to pay.  The reason that they would have to pay this ? rate is that it is assessable and collectable as portion of the municipal rate, and they are only free from paying municipal rate.  That is what they are free from paying, and if this is made to deal with the municipal rate they will be freed only from the year beginning the 1st April, 1935.  That is, practically for two years they will be excused from paying a rate which is not for their benefit at all, but is really for a national purpose. As to the other cases referred to by Senator Staines, it seems to be absolutely unfair that the owners or occupiers of hereditaments which have been put up within the last few years, should be excused from paying this special rate, while their neighbours have to pay it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The case made for the levying of this charge upon all holders of assessable property is quite good and sound.  The proposition is a good one, because this is not a matter which should be dealt with simply in the category of ordinary rates, for sewerage and general municipal purposes.  I do not think it is going to be accomplished by this amendment or by any of the amendments suggested.  It would require a complete re-casting of the Bill in regard to finances.  It is a mistake to refer to Rathmines and Pembroke areas as being by any chance exempted. I looked up this matter for my own satisfaction, and I find that under the 1930 Act it is clearly laid down that this new legislation would not exempt Rathmines and Pembroke from this charge.  I am fortified in that opinion by an authority on local government affairs.  If this amendment is inserted it comes under what is a definition section.  I do not know what the Minister has to say, but it seems to me that the object Senator Staines is aiming at would not be achieved by the amendment, and would require considerable other alterations.  I should <Col N="1795" /> point out that the provisions of the Bill, as amended by the Seanad, are not that there shall be 1/6 in the £ put upon the rates of any ratepayers, but that a sum equal to what would be raised by that rate is to be paid by the Corporation, which is a very different thing.  They can make up their total amount of rates in the regular way, but they are not asked to put on to the ratepayers' assessments a particular figure of ? in the £ for this particular purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>They have to pay to the Government a sum equal to what ? in the pound will raise, and they will be relieved of a portion of the present poor rate.  I hope not the whole, but I am sure they are going to be relieved in that way.  It is quite clear that they are not going to have to pay in the way of poor rate as large a sum as they are paying now, and that there would be relief in that respect.  Senator Brown dissents.  I would like to know on what grounds.  Is he hopeful that poor rate assistance will be maintained at the present level?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw Senator Staines' amendment I found it very difficult to understand what he was trying to achieve.  He has, to some extent, made his intentions clear in his speech to-day, although the confusion was rather accentuated by what Senator Brown said.  As Senator Johnson has stated, this amendment achieves nothing.  Its insertion in the Bill will only disimprove its appearance without altering the legal position in any way.  The Bill provides that there shall be paid from the County Borough <Col N="1796" /> of Dublin a sum equal to the amount of a rate of ? in the pound on the rateable value at the beginning of the immediately preceding financial year. There is nothing <i>sacrosanct</i> about ?. What is required from the City of Dublin and each of the other boroughs is a fixed sum.  The rate they will have to levy in one year or another has to produce that fixed sum.  It may vary and it will vary, but the amount required for the purposes of the Bill is a sum equal to the amount of ? in the pound on the rateable value at the beginning of the immediately preceding year. Senator Staines obviously wants to alter that to ensure that an actual rate of ? will be leviable upon each tenement and hereditament.  The amount which shall be paid by each county borough for the purposes of this Bill will vary from year to year.  The rate will not vary.  It will be fixed at ? and will be payable irrespective of the amount the rate will produce.  It is obvious, apart from other considerations, that it would be undesirable to have a variable amount payable.  The Bill was framed on the basis of a fixed revenue from certain sources and variable expenditure from the Central Fund.  A fixed revenue was required from the Unemployment Insurance Fund, the county boroughs and the urban districts.  It would make very little difference to the country, as a whole, if the amount payable from the county boroughs and urban areas varied, but it would make a lot of difference in the financial administration of the Bill.  However, there is another consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the amendment, in the form in which it has been moved, achieves nothing because it proposes to add an addendum to the sub-section and makes reference to &ldquo;such hereditaments and tenements.&rdquo; These are hereditaments and tenements rateable to the municipal rate and, as the municipal rate is itself leviable, subject to reductions, variations and remissions, provided by the Local Government and the Housing Acts, no change is in fact achieved.  I would like the Seanad, and particularly Senators on one side of the House, to take into account what is proposed.  In the first place I may say that the full <Col N="1797" /> ? is payable in respect of the added urban areas under the 1930 Act.  The Act of 1930 exempts from the limitation imposed on rates leviable in these areas for the purposes mentioned &ldquo;any charge levied to defray expenses incurred or to meet demands made under any Act passed by the Oireachtas after the 31st March, 1930.&rdquo;  As Senator Johnson pointed out, the reduction in the rate in the added urban areas of the Act of 1930 does not come into this question at all.  The ? is leviable on the added urban areas as upon the old city.  Senator Staines, however, mentioned the case of reductions in valuation or remission of rates granted under certain Housing Acts in order to encourage the building of houses.  People did build houses on the strength of that encouragement, and bought houses at prices which were fixed, taking into account the fact that these reductions and remissions in rates for different periods were available; and to come in now and change the law in that respect would be very similar to a definite breach of contract with these people.  I think that would be a very serious principle for this House to adopt without clearly knowing where it is going.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Bill is concerned, it is essential, in our opinion, that there should be a fixed sum payable for the purposes of the Bill from the county boroughs and the urban areas.  The Bill, as it stands, provides for that fixed sum, and the change which Senator Staines obviously intends to make would make that sum a variable sum, and an indeterminate one, changing from year to year in accordance with the changes in the valuation of the area concerned, or the enactment of legislation dealing with the remission of rates, or other changes made by the local authority or by an Act of the Oireachtas.  That is the essential thing, in our opinion; but, apart from that, the other arguments which I have mentioned hold weight also.  The amendment, as it stands, does not achieve anything.  In fact, the amendments are contradictory amendments, and the purpose of the first one, even if it were properly framed, would be nullified by the second amendment <Col N="1798" /> if carried.  It has been supported by Senator Brown, I think, on a misunderstanding obviously, and I suggest to the Senators that the matter be reconsidered.  From the point of view of the Minister responsible for the Bill, I would oppose any amendment which meant that a variable instead of a fixed sum was to be payable, and from the point of view of other considerations, I think that members of the Seanad should oppose these amendments in any case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I understand the point of view of the Minister, and I confess inability to express a definite opinion as to how far this amendment will achieve what I think Senator Staines had in mind.  If, however, I understand correctly what the Senator had in mind, and certainly what I myself favour, I hold that it would not involve any change in the fixed sum that the Minister desires.  The ? would be chargeable on the City of Dublin on the total rateable value. That would remain whether what this amendment aims at achieving were inserted in the Bill or not.  What, I think, Senator Staines requires, and what I myself would support, is that the Corporation should be in a position, in so far as whatever charge has got to be on the ratepayers is concerned, whether it be a less sum than 1/6 or a larger sum, to see that that charge can be paid by everybody on the full amount of their rateable value.  I do not want to take from them any concessions they got under previous Acts, but I am unable to see that this is in any way a breach of faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Oireachtas introduces a new charge, which is a national charge, to meet a national emergency I think it should be paid on the valuation. What I would like to provide&mdash;I am not quite clear that this amendment achieves it&mdash;would be that if, for the sake of argument, I have a house valued at, say, £50 and I am only paying on one-third of that I should continue paying on one-third, but on the extra ¼, ?, ? or ?, or whatever it is, I should pay on the £50. That would not create a variable amount.  The State would get the <Col N="1799" /> same sum, but the Corporation, in collecting that, would collect it on the sum on which it was being charged to the State, and it would not involve an extra charge on other persons.  I have always been in favour of special concessions being made in order to encourage building, but I think that that consideration does not apply here.  It is a tax imposed by the State and I think it should be paid on the valuation.  I am still puzzled as to how the Minister thinks it would cause a variable sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I be permitted to point out that if Senator Staines' amendment is carried now the whole clause which it affects will go, and when the Minister's new amendment comes forward on the next day the whole thing will have to be considered de novo?  That is if the Minister's new amendment is carried. I think it would be much better to give the whole thing further consideration and have a meeting of three or four Senators with the Minister, if you like, so as to discuss the matter clearly.  There is a certain amount of disagreement and I am inclined to think that the Minister's viewpoint is not the viewpoint I myself would take. I think that a further discussion by a few Senators with the Minister would be very effective and useful and I suggest that Senator Staines might withdraw his amendment now and see that it was ready for next Tuesday.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that I am not responsible for housing policy.

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>My feeling is that a certain amount of money has got to be raised and that Senators Staines and Brown feel that some persons might come off more favourably than others. It is not levied for housing but for a <Col N="1800" /> national purpose and the Senator's idea is that a national charge should be charged equitably all over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The section of the Act of 1930 with regard to limitations, which I mentioned, only applies to the added urban areas.  That limitation did not apply in respect of charges levied in consequence of a demand by the Port and Docks Board or under any other Act subsequent to that Act of 1930 such as this one.  This ? is leviable on the added urban areas.  The Housing Acts provided for a definite remission of rates in some cases on a sliding scale for 20 years, and in some cases to the extent of one-third for five or seven years.  Senator Staines' amendment obviously is designed to amend these Housing Acts.  I submit that is housing policy, but that it also raises the question of a contract entered into by the State with the persons who built these houses and with the persons who bought these houses.  This is not a new charge of such a peculiar nature as would justify that breach of contract, because, as Senator Johnson pointed out, it is correct to say that, to a very large extent, this ? will be a replacement of an existing charge.  It may be that in certain of the county boroughs the total charge leviable in respect of outdoor relief will be reduced by more than the ? leviable to meet the expenses under this Bill, that the payment of unemployment assistance to every unemployed person will so reduce the charge for provision of outdoor relief for these same persons that a saving in rates will be effected.  That will, undoubtedly, be the case in some of the urban areas.  In some of the county borough areas it will probably be the case, but in others it will not. It will depend on the amount of relief which is at present being provided.  In the City of Dublin it is difficult to say what will happen because much will depend on the policy adopted by the Corporation, but it is not impossible that the effect of the passing of this measure will be to reduce the rates instead of increasing them.</P>

When we know that the amendment we are debating will do what Senator Staines wants to effect, our task will be clearer.

      <P>If the insertion of an amendment on the lines suggested by Senator Staines would make it impossible to ascertain the amount available for this fund, it would be an extremely powerful argument against it.  It would certainly influence my action, but I am not clear that it would have that effect.  It seems to me to be only a difference in the method of collection. The amount payable by the Corporation would remain the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in the interests of the production of stall-fed cattle and fat pigs, the Seanad requests the Executive Council immediately to issue a statement as to the future intentions of the Government with regard to bounties on the export of agricultural produce to Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My object in putting down this motion was to obtain from the responsible Minister a contradiction of the persistent rumours which have been going around, that no bounties will be paid on our exports of live stock and agricultural produce after 31st December next.  There is no use in the Minister making a vague statement such as was made on the occasion of the issue of the last Order&mdash;that bounties would be paid until further notice.  That sort of statement will not create any confidence <Col N="1803" /> amongst the farmers.  We all know that the bounties cannot continue to be paid at the present rate for any considerable time.  That is a cause of uncertainty amongst the farmers.  To remove that uncertainty, the Minister should make a definite statement that the bounties will be paid at the present rate until a fixed and definite date.  I suggest that the Minister should state that the bounties will be paid at the present rate until 1st May, 1934.  We should know where we will be up to that time.  This statement should be made in the interest of stall-fed cattle-production and it should be made immediately or it will be too late.  It is also necessary in the interest of the production of fat pigs, in the interest of agriculture generally and with a view to keeping agricultural labourers in their employment.</P>
    <P>The farmers are going out of production. For the past couple of years, the more they produced the more they lost.  They are not going to continue to do that.  They would be very chary about producing anything if they thought they were not going to receive the bounties which are being paid at present.  If there is no stall-feeding, I should like to know what is to be done with our oats, with our surplus barley and our other tillage crops.  The Minister has promised to pay 10/6 per barrel next summer to registered corn merchants, who pay 9/- per barrel for the best white oats.  He is to pay that next summer, but, if there is no stall-feeding, and if oats are not going to be fed to live stock, what is the Minister going to do with the oats?  Oats have been sold at 5/- per barrel, and less, during the present season.  Does the House realise that it would take the whole of 20 acres of oats to pay one agricultural labourer for a year? The Minister's policy aims at the production of oats, wheat and barley. How are farmers going to continue to produce oats if they are only going to get that price, or if, in a short time, we are to have no market for them?</P>
    <P>With regard to the bounty on pigs, the Government's policy has muddled <Col N="1804" /> matters to such an extent that I am afraid our pig trade is doomed.  The farmers are now thrown on the mercy of a few bacon merchants.  There is no competition.  Competition is completely wiped out, and farmers are not going to continue producing under existing conditions.</P>
    <P>Since I tabled this motion a new Order has been issued by the Government with reference to bounties.  They now propose to pay a bounty of 20/- a head on calves six months old.  The previous duty on such animals was 25/- a head.  The Government's fresh proposal is, from a national point of view and from the point of view of preserving our live stock, as mad a proposal as they have made up to the present.</P>
    <P>I would like the House to give me permission to make an addendum to my motion to the effect that the Seanad objects to the payment of a bounty on young stock intended for export, and they recommend that a bounty be paid to the rearers of calves who keep them until they are 15 months old.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not against the payment of bounties to farmers.  Every farmer, irrespective of the class of farming with which he is concerned, excepting the farmer who sells milk in the towns, requires all the assistance and the bounties he can get.  In my opinion, if the Government's present policy is continued the country will be denuded of young stock.  When the Minister was introducing the Cereals Bill and the Dairy Produce (Stabilisation) Bill, his principal contention was that those Bills would help to keep the producers of live stock and would tend to preserve our live stock trade in the bad period during which we were passing. We passed those Bills on the assumption that they would help live stock production.  We agreed to pay £6 a cow for every cow in a creamery district.  Now we are to give £1 for the calf that cow produces and which is intended for export to England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1805" /> In other years it was argued that we were selling our raw material to England, and that the cattle we were sending out in an unfinished state should be kept in this country and fattened.  The Minister is endeavouring to reverse that policy to the extent of encouraging the export of stock, but in my opinion his policy will result in denuding the country of practically the whole of its valuable stock.  That is a very serious position.</P>
    <P>I believe it is the deliberate aim of the Government to kill the cattle trade of this country.  No member of the Executive Council can be so very stupid as not to realise the effect of the Government's present policy in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second this motion which really sets out to allay in the minds of the farmers a suspicion following upon news circulated in the country that bounties will cease entirely at the end of the year.  In my opinion farmers would be wise to consider the present situation between this country and England as a normal situation, a situation that must continue during the lifetime of the present Government.  It would be as well for farmers to assume that we are working under normal circumstances, that our agricultural products will be tariffed and, as against that, we will retain the £5,000,000 a year.  It would be as well that farmers should recognise that as the normal position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From June of last year up to the present time the men who had cattle purchased before tariffs were introduced have suffered very severely.  From now onwards the small man, the producer, is going to suffer.  So far he has not suffered anything in comparison with farmers or graziers who held considerable stocks of cattle that were purchased before tariffs were imposed in England and that were sold subsequently subject to a tariff.  These men are now in the market to buy and they will buy subject to the tariffs that will be enforced when they are selling and, naturally, they will buy so low that the producer, the small man, will have a bitter realisation of what the economic dispute amounts to.  The fact <Col N="1806" /> of the matter is that the people producing the cattle will get no return for their labour.  Suck calves are selling in the Dublin market at 7/6 to 10/-. The whole incidence of the tariffs in England is operating against the cattle breeders in this country.</P>
    <P>The present position is that a beast of 18 months going to England is tariffed to the extent of £2 10s.  If the beast is two years old it is tariffed to the extent of £4, and if it is sold after that period it is tariffed at £6. Put yourselves in the position of a man who goes to the markets and buys an animal against the exporter to England.  If that beast gets over the frontier there is a tariff of £2 10s., but of course that case is subject to a bounty.  Take the case of a farmer who buys that animal and keeps it for four months.  If that animal is sent to England it is subject to a tariff of £4, and if the farmer does not finish the animal within six months the amount increases to £6.  How could the industry carry on under such conditions? It could not possibly hope to do so.</P>
    <P>Cattle must be bought subject to a £6 tariff in the very beginning; otherwise there is no profit for the feeder. Senators can understand, in a position of that sort, what effect this suspicion that these bounties are going to be removed will have on people going into the cattle market to purchase cattle. Unfortunately, our big industry in this country is the live stock industry. Exporters of cattle pay a tariff of £6 on a beast and they get back a bounty of 35/-.  If I were a shirt-maker and I were sending my shirts to Great Britain I would pay a tariff on them but I would get back the whole tariff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Senator A Senator">
      <NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  But because I am a farmer I pay £6 on a beast and I get back only 35/-, losing £4 5s. That is the position.  The whole tariff on a manufactured article from this country which is exported to Great Britain is refunded from the Treasury here.  The producer gets a refund of the duty on that article.  The amount of the refund in the case of cattle <Col N="1807" /> varies from 15/- in the case of young cattle to 35/- in the case of fattened animals.  I put it to the Minister for Agriculture that that particular incidence in the tariff on cattle to Great Britain will kill the cattle-feeding industry.  If these men who fatten cattle in this country are to be on the safe side they will buy their cattle from the small farmers at such a price that the original producers will get a sum that will be unremunerative.  If the buyer or feeder in this country keeps the young cattle for six months he pays the difference between £2 10s. and £4, and if he keeps them for more than that period he loses the difference between £2 10s. and £6.  How can such an industry go on?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That means marketing cattle with the calf teeth.  I have some experience of this baby beef as well as others.  You go into the market and you buy calves.  You are subject then to a duty or a tariff of £2 10s. on these calves.  You will want to be very smart if you are to get them out of the country before you will have to pay a duty of £4.  You will have to be smart in order to get them out with the calf teeth.  The position is that cattle feeders are hit and they are not going to buy them in the future but at such a price as would not pay the producer to rear the animals.  I have seen quite recently three suck calves bought for 25/-.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is so.  On calves that cost 25/- he would be paid a bounty of £3.  The result of such a state of things will be that you will have an export trade in young cattle and people in this country will not feed cattle.  In the view of some people that is perhaps a good thing.  At any rate I would be very sorry to see the country without cattle in it.  There has been a cattle population in this country all the time of round about 4,000,000. These 4,000,000 cattle were bringing into the country a revenue of <Col N="1808" /> £12,000,000 or £13,000,000 a year.  As a farmer I would be very sorry to see that particular class of trade abolished. I look upon the land annuities question as settled and I put it to the Minister now that he might, perhaps, advance towards a settlement in another direction.  I was very sorry to see the other day that contracts amounting to £1,700,000 were given to the Germans.  If I were Minister for Agriculture I would endeavour to have that contract placed in Great Britain and in return endeavour to get into England £1,700,000 worth of cattle free of tariff in consideration of our giving Great Britain that contract.  There are a whole lot of tariffs against the British that we could remit.  Even if we could get £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 a year remitted or £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 a year of our cattle exports to Britain let in without tariffs it would take something off this incubus on the Irish farmer.  The question of making a trade deal in the existing circumstances should be considered as normal.  I fail to see how anybody could have any objection to that.  It would be no surrender; it would be good business for this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish very strongly to support this motion.  Unfortunately it affects the county which I represent and which the Minister for Agriculture at present quite misrepresents. It affects Wexford more than any other county in the Free State or than any other county in Ireland.  We were the largest tillage county in Ireland and we were also the largest fattening county.  Naturally one thing depends on the other.  How, in the name of commonsense, is a tillage policy to be carried out when the cattle fattening trade is at the same time being killed?  How that is to be done passes the comprehension of any reasonable person.  Practically every farmer, small as well as large, in Wexford fattens and finishes his own cattle.  Few people in our county sell off their young stock.  A great deal of young stock passes from the Saorstát small farmers' hands into the hands of the big farmers of Wexford.  They finish and fatten these young stock. When I speak of big farmers in <Col N="1809" /> Wexford I mean farmers holding from 100 to 200 acres.  In Wexford we have no people to whom that ridiculous term &ldquo;rancher&rdquo; can be applied at all.  Under present conditions what is to become of tillage?  What is to become of the oats and green crop and the hay and straw produced on the land if we cannot fatten our cattle?</P>
      <P>I can endorse what Senators Counihan and Wilson have said as to the anxiety in the minds of the people at the present time about what is going to happen in the near future. A whole series of blunders is being bolstered up by these bounties but it is only robbing Peter to pay Paul. The whole thing is a hopeless mess of confusion and bungling.  The farmers do not know where they are.  I wish to deny a statement made here when another motion by Senator Counihan was under discussion some little time ago.  That statement was made by Senator Connolly.  I speak of him as Senator Connolly because I do not remember at the moment what he is Minister of.  He might be called the quick-change Minister.  He is one thing one day and another thing another day.  I cannot tell what he is at present.  He is such a success in one Ministry that he has to be passed on to another in order to make a success of that.  He made a statement here the last day that this outcry against the policy of the Government only comes from the large farmers. That statement is absolutely wrong. We have a very large number of United Ireland Clubs in County Wexford and the vast majority of the members of these clubs, which I visit very often, are small farmers. What we call a small farmer in Wexford is a man with 20 or 30 acres of land.  I suppose in the North of Ireland it is only a man with five or ten acres who would be called a small farmer.  A man with 100 or 200 acres of land in Wexford is called a large farmer.</P>

But it is no laughing matter.  It is a matter affecting the life and death of the people of this country.  I need not say very much more to impress the importance as well as the danger of the present situation.  Evidently the Government has got into that state that it is in such a hole that it can neither move backwards nor forwards, having bungled all along the line. They have got into that state, and they can only continue bolstering up the blunders as long as they are allowed. I hope the Seanad will pass this motion and let the people see, at any rate, that there are a few here who will not allow this tragedy to continue hidden, but that they will bring it forward and have it ventilated until something is done, if it can be done, to save the situation, which has now gone so far that it seems almost irretrievable.  I wish to support the motion, and I hope the Seanad will also support it.</P>

      <P>Senator Wilson began his statement with the suggestion that we were to consider the present position of our trade with England as stabilised, and that we must continue in a state of hostility with England for evermore.  He then gave a balanced statement of how much we had lost.  I do not know what would have been said at the beginning of the Great War if somebody had got up and said that they were to consider the position in 1914 as stabilised for the rest of the century.

      <P>My opinion is that this quarrel with England will be settled at some time&mdash;I do not know exactly when it may be; it may be settled in a few days or a few months, or maybe later still.  I should like the Seanad to consider what will happen to the cattle trade when that settlement is reached.  Once the question of the annuities is settled and the war with England is over, the farmers will no longer have any claim to bounties, no more than I or any other business man would have a claim to a bounty on anything we export.  We must look at what is likely to happen following the settlement of the war and the abolition of the bounties.  How does the Senator suppose his cattle trade will then continue?  If it is to continue at a loss when all those things are settled, the farmers will have no complaint because nobody will be at fault once these questions are settled.  I wonder how the Senator is going to reconcile that position with his argument? He began on a false foundation and built up on that false foundation, but the whole argument tumbles down once it is explained.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go any further.</P>

      <P>The Irish Government and those who had hoped for a change from a different English Government are, like Senator Moore, under the impression that there will never be any change either.  If the present Government exists long enough, this country will financially cease to exist.  It will not be very long before that result is brought about. One does not like, or it is hardly worth while, to speak so often about the results of the present policy with regard to the agricultural industry of this country.  That policy is ruinous to the agricultural industry, and every effort made to do what one Senator has referred to here&mdash;to bolster up mistakes which are being made by the Minister and those who support him in his policy&mdash;is calculated to ruin the agricultural trade without any doubt whatever.  One does not like always to be talking about the economic war and the destitution and the misery it is bringing about and has brought about in this country already.  The people in the cities do not realise how things are in the country.  There are people who are living in hope of something being done to remedy the existing state of affairs, and there are people who do not know what it is to have ready money in their hands&mdash;both large and small <Col N="1813" /> farmers whose profits from what they sell are so small that they are hardly able to buy the necessaries of life without speaking at all of paying for what are described as overhead charges.</P>
      <P>It is time, as Senator Miss Browne said, that the position ceased to be a hidden one.  It is nothing less than a hidden position because there is no outcry made against the present circumstances, but it will come for certain like an avalanche with the failure of this country to carry on financially.  Certain people are not able to pay rates in the country at present and those who are anxious to bolster up the present Government policy have to resort to the unfair and untrue statement that the failure to pay rates in many cases is due to a conspiracy.  There are very few people who will run the risk of not paying rates and of getting into trouble as a result if they are able to pay but there will be plenty of trouble about it because so many people are unable to pay.</P>

If they know people who are able to pay, surely it is just as easy for us to know those who are not?  I earnestly hope that I am mistaken in my estimate of those who are unable to pay rates and those who are able to pay them, but when they do pay them, how many of them will be able to pay annuities?  It is only when this Government finds that neither rates nor annuities can be paid that they will realise the position.  That time will not be long coming.  It has come to some extent this year.  It will come to a greater extent in the next year.</P>

    <P>I assure you that I do not want to achieve a reputation as a prophet in so prophesying.  I can, however, state it as a certainty, a simple mathematical calculation.  It takes two and two to make four, but when one two is lost and you have only another two remaining, <Col N="1814" /> you have no two and two to make four.  That is the position, at the present time, in the live stock industry in this country.  How, in the name of common sense, could any man, from a logical point of view alone, even if he had no knowledge of the farming industry, think that if the farming industry is barely able to carry on even in the best of times it could be successfully carried on under present conditions?  Judged purely from the financial point of view it has never been a wonderful industry.  Whatever advantages it possessed were other than enabling a person to get rich quickly.  Some people think that it has an advantage from the point of view of rearing a family, the members of which have to go out into other walks of life afterwards to earn a livelihood.  There will always, however, be some who will remain to carry on the industry.  Without such people this country cannot get on.  It cannot get on while the farming industry is being killed.</P>
    <P>It is idle to expect people to be able to carry on the agricultural industry under the conditions now prevailing and to pay the demands, let them be great or small, that will be made upon them.  There is a difficulty in eking out a livelihood without having to pay charges such as rates, taxes or annuities.  One man may, perhaps, through the accident of his domestic circumstances, be able to carry on more cheaply than another.  He will last longer than his neighbour under present conditions.  A man who has to carry the average burden and to rear a family will go down very quickly, but the man who is laden for one reason or another with heavier burdens, and who has more to contend with than the average farmer, that man is failing this year.  That is a man who will not be able to pay his rates this year no matter what supporters of the Government may say about his belonging to a conspiracy to refuse to pay rates.  I can assure this House that if the refusal to pay annuities or rates were depending on a conspiracy to keep it alive, it would not have a very long life.  The tendency of farmers in this country is to pay whatever call is made upon them for <Col N="1815" /> such charges as rates or annuities, if it were only for the purpose of not endangering their title to their holdings which all these farmers love.  The farmer loves the holding in which he has lived, in which he was probably born and where his ancestors before him lived.  He does not like to risk the title to that holding, and no conspiracy can be made sufficiently water-tight to prevent his paying his rates and annuities.  Many, however, are being prevented this year and there will be more next year and the following year by the fact that they are not able to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the motion of Senator Counihan and his statements with regard to the agricultural position in the country generally. It is undeniable that conditions are very bad at the moment.  The state of affairs in which we now find ourselves has been looming on the horizon for a considerable time but things are going steadily from bad to worse.  The losses which the agricultural industry has sustained were at first more or less confined to people who had fat cattle for sale, cattle that were ten cwt. to 12 cwt. live weight.  Now these losses are being felt by the people from whom stores were bought, the small farmers. They are now suffering and have to bear their own share of the bad times. I say with all respect to the present Government that they should very seriously consider the position before it is too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Garahan has pointed out, the time when insolvency will face us is coming a good deal more quickly than people imagine.  From my own knowledge of the country and the circumstances prevailing, I can say the conditions are considerably worse than any Government would care to admit or acknowledge.  At the commencement of these troubles when Mr. Thomas imposed his tariffs, as a set-off against the retention of the annuities, his action was looked upon as something that might be of advantage to the country's interests but now these hopes have been dispelled.  The thing has remained on too long.  It is now a certainty that in the losses incurred <Col N="1816" /> by the farmers, they have paid their annuities more than four times over. Nobody can deny that now.  I am personally aware of that fact, knowing the prices that cattle are making and the prices that people have paid for them.  It is deplorable to think that in this matter the Government should be so blind.</P>
    <P>There has been a tendency amongst many people who hold views different from those held by the general body of the farmers, to sneer at people, to whom they refer as graziers, as to their ability to pay their annuities and their rates.  It is said that these people can pay at any time they like and that there is more or less a conspiracy to prevent their paying.  I say with all due respect to these people that the last thing the general body of farmers would do would be to repudiate anything they owed.  That much must be said to their credit. They were always looked upon as being honourable men.  A motion somewhat similar to this was brought forward as a very urgent matter in the last session, but I had an idea from the arguments made in favour of the maintenance of the present position, that the Senator and everybody else who had spoken on this subject, were only wasting their sweetness on the desert air.  It is only a question of time, however, and if the present position continues that time will not be long coming, until the country is plunged into bankruptcy. That stage has practically arrived at present.  If this thing proceeds much further I warn the Government that it will possibly end in rebellion. That is a step that I would be very sorry to prophesy.  The sensible people who are entrusted with the Government should not allow such a condition to exist or come to pass in this holy Ireland of ours.</P>
    <P>These bounties are leading to a certain amount of confusion.  Farmers are in a state of anxiety and do not know whether they can continue farming or not.  I know personally that there are a great many farmers who are most anxious to have a definite settlement made.  They are anxious to know how long the Government are going to carry <Col N="1817" /> on their present policy.  They do not want to dismiss their labourers, but if something is not done to remedy the present position many farmers will not be in a position to keep men in employment.  The farmers are in this position that they do not want to let their land go out of cultivation, and yet when they grow crops they cannot turn them into cash.  Their position is a pretty hopeless one at the present time.  In the case of men who stall-feed cattle, they do not know whether it is worth their while to continue doing that, because they have no assurance that when the cattle are finished they will be able to get anything worth while for them.  I would be very glad if we could have from the Minister an assurance that the Government will take steps to let the farmers of the country know where exactly they stand and help to put them on their feet again.</P>
    <P>The argument is very often used that we are no worse off than the people in other countries.  I am not so sure that that is true.  I remember hearing a story of black '47.  A farmer who dug out his potatoes early and saw that they were black ran across his fields to tell his neighbour about the terrible calamity that had happened.  But when he went into his neighbour's field he found that his neighbour's potatoes were also black.  That man went home more or less consoled that there were other people as badly off as himself. That, I suggest, is a poor way of looking at things.  It is poor consolation for the farmers of this country to tell them that the farmers in other countries are as badly off as they are.  In conclusion, I submit that it is a matter of the greatest possible urgency to have the present position remedied.  The Government should give some clear idea to the farmers as to the prospects that are before them if they are to continue farming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I read this motion that has been put forward by Senator Counihan I thought it was quite reasonable that such information should be asked for from the Government.  I came here in a reasonable state of mind to answer any reasonable questions that might be <Col N="1818" /> put to me.  But, to my surprise, when I arrived I heard from Senator Counihan and the members of his Party speeches that I had heard at least a dozen times in the Seanad during the last 12 months or more.  The speeches to-day, and over that period have been all in the very same strain.  Senator Counihan knows quite well that if he wanted to get an answer to his question with regard to our policy on bounties he could very easily have got it.  If he asked for the information I would have given it to him, and if I was not able to do that then I would have told him the reason why.  But it is quite evident that Senator Counihan did not come here looking for information. He came here with the intention of making a propagandist speech, and in that he has been followed by other members of his Party.  We heard from the Senator again to-day about the economic war, and the disaster that is coming.  I remember coming here about this time last year and of being told that the disaster would be here before last Christmas.  When I came here some time after Christmas I was told that it would be with us in the spring, and then it was postponed until the autumn.  We have been hearing during all that time about the disaster that was to follow from the economic war.  We have it for certain now, that it will take place in six months time. Senator O'Connor told us that if it continues very much longer there is going to be a rebellion.  So far as a rebellion is concerned, I think we have dealt with that.  There might have been a rebellion on the part of some of the followers of the people opposite, if we had not taken the situation in hand in time.  But we did, and there will be no rebellion as far as we can prevent it.  I want to tell that to the followers of Senator Counihan and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also heard that there will be no settlement of this economic war as long as the present Government remains in power.  I do not know whether there will or not.  I hope there will be a settlement, and one that will be satisfactory to this country.  But I want to say this definitely, that if Senator Counihan and his friends had <Col N="1819" /> their way there would be no settlement as long as this Government is in power, because they have done everything possible to prevent a settlement by pointing out the imaginary weaknesses of the people of this country, and encouraging the British Government to hold out in the hope that they may bring us to our knees.  They have done that for political reasons, for the advantage of their own Party, in the hope that this Government may be defeated at some future time and that the Party to which Senator Counihan belongs may come back into office again.  I am afraid it will not.  I hope, too, they will not get their wish in this matter. In fact I am confident that they will not.  We have been told also that there has not been a sufficient outcry about the condition of the people: that the position is hidden and that there is not a sufficient outcry.  Senator Counihan and his friends can congratulate themselves anyway that as far as they are concerned there has been a sufficient outcry&mdash;that is as far as they have been able to do it.  They have done their best to rouse the country about the ills of the economic war.  They have gone around organising these new clubs, telling them that, of course, it was illegal not to pay their rates, but that everyone knows quite well that they cannot pay their rates and that it was a shame that when people cannot pay the Government should come down and make them pay.  In other words, without committing an illegality, they have gone as far as they possibly could go to tell the people not to pay their rates.  We were told to-day that while the people may be able to pay a little at the present time, in six months time they will not be able to pay at all. I have heard these statements over and over again in the Seanad.  The same speech fits every motion that Senator Counihan puts down on the Order Paper.  It does not matter what the motion is the same speech fits it.  In view of that I will content myself in future, whenever the Senator puts down a motion, by reading up some of the old debates and remaining at home. What does Senator Counihan and the members of his Party want with regard <Col N="1820" /> to the economic war?  Do they want us to give in?  No, of course not.  In public they will not admit that they want us to give in and pay the five millions a year over to England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not.  Although it may perhaps be some disappointment to some Senators, we are not paying. The British Government have failed to get the five millions from us, although they have done their best to get them.  It may be a very unpalatable fact to some Senators who are more friendly to the British side than they are to the Irish side to be told that the British Government have failed to get the five millions, and I believe they will continue to fail to get them.  There may be some Senators, apart from the mover of the motion, who would genuinely like to know what our position is with regard to the bounties.  I came here prepared to tell the Seanad what our position is, and in spite of the way this motion has been dealt with I propose to tell the Seanad, though I would like to repeat that that was not the object Senator Counihan had in putting down the motion.  We have announced the payment of bounties from time to time, and in making the announcement we have generally said that they will be payable &ldquo;until further notice.&rdquo;  We have stated that because there are various considerations which might influence us either to alter a bounty up or down or withdraw it altogether.  I want to tell the House what those considerations are, and then let Senators make up their minds for themselves.  These bounties will remain until 31st March unless there is a change in the condition of the foreign market.  If, for instance, there is free trade again between this country and England the bounties will be withdrawn in all probability.  That is the first condition on which the bounties will be withdrawn in the meantime.  The second condition is, if there is a substantial improvement in prices which would justify their withdrawal&mdash;an improvement which, for instance, might take place in the case of pigs and bacon. <Col N="1821" /> We were advised by the bacon curers when we were advancing the bounty on the last occasion that, in all probability, prices would improve between this and the 31st March to such an extent that we could again reduce the bounty.  But we have no intention of reducing the bounty unless prices improve considerably above what they are at present.  Then there is one other contingency, and that is the case of shortage in the home market.  For instance, we withdrew the bounty on butter to keep it at home for our own market.  We might possibly have to do the same in the case of other commodities later.  There is no intention to do that at the present time, and these are the only exceptions that I can think of.  With these exceptions the others remain in force until the 31st of March.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At least as high as they are at present, so that the farmer feeding his cattle and feeding his pigs may take this for granted, that we will not reduce the bounty until prices improve or until the conditions I have mentioned are covered.  There are a few other things that I want to say.  One of these applies to grass seeds.  Quite recently we put a tariff on grass seeds coming in.  There is not sufficient produced, so there will be no necessity to export grass seed and no necessity for a bounty.  If there was production for which there was not sufficient home market and that we were protecting the home market, we might withdraw the bounty but the price would not be lessened.  There is also a case brought to my attention by one of the daily papers, and that is in connection with the bounty we are granting to horse breeding.  My attention was drawn to the fact that it was of little or no use to blood-stock breeders. I am having that case investigated. The Government have no intention of paying £40,000 unless some good is going to come from the expenditure of that money.  If, on investigation, we find that the statement I refer to has <Col N="1822" /> no foundation, then the bounty will be withdrawn or changed to suit the circumstances but it will not be done without proper investigation.</P>
      <P>One thing more about the bounty. In some cases our bounties were paid not on an <i>ad valorem</i> basis, but on a quantity basis.  In some cases we found during the last 12 months that we were paying bounties on a quantitative basis, where the tariffs on goods going into Great Britain were on an <i>ad valorem</i> basis, and where the bounty at times exceeded the tariff.  I might take a certain period during the last seven or eight months this year where the bounty payable on eggs was much higher than the tariff charged upon eggs.  There was also a period when the bounty paid on bacon exceeded the tariff on bacon going into Great Britain.  I just mention that in reply to some of the statements made here that the producers in this country are paying the full extent of the tariff into Great Britain.  The tariffs into Great Britain are calculated to produce something like three and a half millions a year.  Against that I say that the bounties payable on this side amounted to something more than two millions a year.  At times the bounties do not compensate for the tariffs payable on the other side.</P>

      <P>The ordinary citizen is paying his share of all the bounties &mdash;I do not think there is any doubt <Col N="1823" /> about that.  I would like to point out to Senator Counihan that it is useless to ask the Government for a statement with regard to the bounties.  I think he put it in regard to exports.  If the Senator would look back about two or three months, if he put his question, say, in September, and if he asked as to the intentions of the Government, the answer he might get would not have the slightest thing to do with what happened in the last two months, because I do not suppose that the Government then had any intention of doing things that they have had to do since.  It is very important, of course, for the farmer to know what he is to get for his pig and his cow and everything of that sort, but I do not think that it is any use asking the Government as to their intentions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>What are they worth? Just take the question of agricultural produce, and consider the matter of the bounties.  It must be remembered that these bounties are to be extracted from people most of whom have no connection with agriculture.  It is no use in talking about bounties paid to people who export goods.  The people in this country are paying bounties on things that they themselves consume at the present moment.  There is no question about that.  You must take these things into consideration when you look at the position of the ordinary citizen. Let us take the case of wheat.  The Government promised 23/- a barrel to the farmers who sold millable wheat. If we had been buying millable wheat in this country at its market value in other countries, I do not think it would be more than 15/- a barrel.  When the Government found themselves faced with this fact they got the millers to give 17/6 for millable wheat, and they paid about 5/6 to complete the budget. The millers must get that out of the man who sells the flour, and the man who sells the flour and bakes it must get that out of the man who eats the bread.  We have to find the whole of that from our own citizens.  If we had <Col N="1824" /> not this kind of thing we would be buying wheat, and there would be so much more wheat in the country.  We have to realise that in order to encourage this extra growth of wheat at home we are paying an enormous price for it.  Because flour and wheat are kept out we have to pay a big price for that produced in the country, and that price has to come out of the bread of the people who are the consumers.</P>
      <P>Then we have the question of oats that we have heard about.  I believe that if the Government had really been studying agricultural interests well they would have known that a certain acreage would have produced all the oats that could have been consumed in this country and they should have done their best not to have more oats produced than the country could consume, because they knew perfectly well that we could not export the oats.  If they had done that we would have, roughly speaking, sufficient oats, and there might have been a decent price for it. If there was not too much oats grown there would not have been this terrible lot of oats offering for anything they can get for it.  Apparently they did not know themselves until they saw the oat crop they had to deal with.  Now we have a surplus of oats which will be lying idle until the middle of next year. Senator Counihan quoted something about 10/6, to be given next June for good white oats for which the buyers are to pay 9/- now.  I have not heard it stated that there is to be any sampling of these oats next June.  All I have heard is that the man who pays 9/- for this oats and puts it into his loft will get 10/6 for it from the Government next June.  Those of us who have experience of oats buying know that unless a very great deal of money is spent upon turning the oats, putting it into a perfect loft, and everything else, it will be no use for human food, or even cattle food, next June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is subject to all these conditions, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not heard of those conditions.  At any rate, it will not be a good bargain, as far as I <Col N="1825" /> know the cost of lofting oats from now until next June, to get 10/6 for it after they paid 9/- for it.  Then we have to consider the situation next year.  There will be a whole pile of oats.  There was a lot of oats this year, and we had great difficulty in keeping these oats out of the deliveries this year.  Next year there will be tens of thousands of barrels of oats lying there, and there is no information that the Government will tell the farmers that they will have a quota for growing oats next year. We are just piling up trouble for ourselves if that state of affairs goes on. I mention this to show that last September the Government did not know the oats situation which was in front of them.  It is a brand new thing coming on top of us.</P>
      <P>We have just heard about the horses.  The position in reference to horses is, of course, about the biggest tragedy in the whole situation.  We had a great reputation for breeding good stock.  As far as I can see from the figures, our exports of stock have gone down by a couple of millions, the reason being that the best of the sires and mares are going out of the country.  I have no doubt that the Minister will look into the matter and try if he can to restore that trade.  It is very hard, however, to get a thing back when you have lost it.  There has been no proposition yet put before the country to show that anything that has been done by the Government is going to restore high-class horse breeding in this country.  That, again, only came up the other day because, I suppose, the horse breeders and the people who are paying tens of thousands for young yearlings did not make enough of noise and, therefore, nobody listened to them, and that part of the business is gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this new thing about young cattle, I am only pointing out to Senator Counihan that I do not think anything that the Minister can say to-day will have anything whatever to do with what will happen during the next few months as regards any bounty.  The Minister is quite straight.  He has to alter his hand as he sees the situation he has to deal with.  The whole system of bounties to <Col N="1826" /> meet the situation as regards the duties that are being clapped on our produce on the other side, coupled with the determination to try to force the people here to consume everything that we produce and keep everything else out of the country, puts an immense tax on our people not only in the bounties paid upon exports but the high prices that everybody in this country has to pay for everything that comes into the country that is guarded by a heavy import duty.  When we come to balance things up and see what the Free State citizen has to pay as against the ordinary British citizen and see how much worse off we are, then we will begin to appreciate what is going on.  I doubt if there was any use in asking the Minister to say what he will do in regard to bounties and duties and things of that sort for the next six months because I do not believe that he could give an answer at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister for being so kind as to give the information I asked for.  Although he may have given it with a rather bad grace, still I think it will be a welcome announcement for many stall-feeders and farmers.  The Minister asked if any Senator would say that we had paid £5,000,000.  I say that it would be very much better if this country continued paying the £5,000,000.  We would not be in the plight we are in if the stoppage of the land annuities had not occurred.  There is no necessity, however, to pay £5,000,000.  If the Executive Council would act in a reasonable common-sense way there could be a settlement of this in the morning.  Senator Moore anticipates that there will be a settlement. He said that it would be very wrong to say that the bounties will continue to be paid suppose there is a settlement and we get back our markets.  The President, in a recent speech, said that the farmers might as well look for the moon as the British market for agricultural produce and live stock in future.  That is a different statement from that of Senator Moore. The statement made by Senator Moore has been going round the country since <Col N="1827" /> the start of this dispute.  The supporters of the Government and prominent Fianna Fáil members have been stating month after month that this would be settled in a very short time&mdash;that it would be settled next month or the month afterwards.  Now we hear the honest people coming out with the statement that we might as well look for the moon as the British market. The Minister seemed to have great satisfaction in stating that the British Government had not received the five millions which we owe them.  He admitted that we are paying three and a half millions in duties.  If he adds to that the amount paid in bounties he will find that it is more than five millions.  It is not five millions that the country has lost, but 50 millions. The Minister complained of the Seanad, and particularly myself, raising questions about duties and bounties in connection with the economic war.  I consider I would not be doing my duty if <Col N="1828" /> I did not bring before the Seanad and the country the position farmers and the cattle trade are in to-day, owing to the economic war.  I am here as the representative of the live-stock trade and of the farming industry, and while I am here I will do my duty, whether it pleases Fianna Fáil Ministers or not.</P>
