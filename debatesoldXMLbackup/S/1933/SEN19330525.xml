      <P>I move amendment No. 31:&mdash;</P>
      <P>31.  New section.  Before Section 10 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>10.  No person while employed in the road services department of the company shall be deemed to be a railway employee within the meaning of the provisions of Part IV of the Principal Act: provided, however, that rates of pay, hours of duty, and other conditions of service of employees engaged in such road services as are not provided for under Section 12 of the Road Transport Act, 1932, and Section 16 of the Road Transport Act, 1933, shall be regulated in accordance with agreements made or to be from time to time made between accredited representatives of the majority of such employees of the one part and the company of the other part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this new section will be that no person while employed in the road services department of the company shall be deemed to be a railway employee within the meaning of the provisions of Part IV of the Principal Act &ldquo;provided, however, that rates of pay, hours of duty, and other conditions of service of employees engaged in such road services as are not provided for under Section 12 of the Road Transport Act, 1932, and Section 16 of the Road Transport Act, 1933, shall be regulated in accordance with agreements made or to be from time to time made between accredited representatives of the majority of such employees of the one part and the company of the other part.&rdquo;  I understand in principle the Government is sympathetic to this amendment.  It simply <Col N="1323" /> means to say that as far as the conditions of service, hours of duty, and other matters of that kind are concerned the road employees shall not be deemed to be railway employees. They shall make their own arrangements through their own accredited representatives and they will be distinct in regard to conditions of service from railway employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is much more in this amendment than the Senator suggested and I hope that the Minister is not going to accept the amendment in any measurable distance of the form in which it is presented. It will be remembered that the section referred to, Part IV of the Principal Act, which deals with employees of railway companies, defined railway employees clearly enough and it provides that the future relations between the company and employees are to be matters for arrangement between the members of the unions on the one part and the companies on the other.  Section 8 of the Bill before us makes provision for the transfer of people who are at present engaged in railway services to road transport services and this proposal practically says that the railway company may get out of their obligations under the Railway Act of 1924 by transferring their employees to the road transport services.  Beyond that, there is a reference to the Road Transport Act of 1933, which is not an Act of course, and I have rather a notion, judging by the motion that was passed yesterday and the probable dispute between the two Houses, that the Road Transport Act will not be required at all, that this Bill will be held up for 18 months in consequence of the dispute between the two Houses, and that therefore the Road Transport Bill will not become an Act and the whole matter will be left as it is.  We cannot refer to the Road Transport Act, 1933, in this Bill until we know that the Road Transport Bill is actually going to be passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the question of &ldquo;the accredited representatives of the majority of such employees.&rdquo;  There is a good deal behind that phrase.  It is a departure entirely from the spirit <Col N="1324" /> of the Railways Act, which has definitely recognised the trades union representatives of employees.  We know the kind of movement that is afoot to secure that the majority of such employees shall be organised in companies' unions.  And the &ldquo;accredited representatives of the majority of such employees&rdquo; may well become another term for the directors of that road transport company.  The whole thing is fishy, and I would urge that it be not passed in its present form.  I hope that the Minister will at least require, so far as he can influence this House, that it should be altered very materially before it becomes embodied in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the course outlined by Senator Johnson, provided the whole principle is accepted.  I am not wedded to this particular form of words.  But I think the Senator is making far too much of a debating point when he says that this Bill might be held up for 18 months. I have been in this House for 12 years, and I only know of one Bill that has been held up for 18 months.  I think it is absurd to suggest that this Bill will be held up for 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Sir John Keane in thinking that what Senator Johnson said about holding up the Bill is wrong.  We do not want to hold up Bills at all.  We only held up one Bill in all those years, and I think we were justified in holding up that Bill.  But while saying that I want to say that I must oppose Senator Sir John Keane's amendment on these grounds: When I came to Dublin, 30 years ago, there were quite a number of good old firms in the city which treated their employees decently.  They have been disappearing one by one. Some of them have gone bankrupt, or become insolvent, others have been taken over by other people.  One of these good old firms was John Wallis and Company; and, because the railway directors have made a mess of the railways&mdash;for that is the plain way of putting it&mdash;they had to buy up John Wallis and Company, Dooley's of Cork and a whole lot of others, in order to get rid of the competition.  They took <Col N="1325" /> over John Wallis and Son, the I.O.C. and certain other firms on certain terms.  The position is not clear to anybody at the moment.  We all feel that the railway company owns John Wallis and Sons, and the I.O.C., but suppose they came into court, the question might arise there as to who owns them, whether it is John Wallis and Sons, the Great Southern Railway or the I.O.C., or whether they are separate independent firms.</P>
      <P>We look at this matter this way: John Wallis and Son was, as I said, one of the good old firms.  When a man went into John Wallis and Sons, so long as he did what he was asked to do, he was as secure as if he were in Government employment, except that he was not entitled to a pension.  As long as men did their work in that firm they were not dismissed.  There were men there for over 30 and 25 years, and the firm was especially decent to their employees in this way: If a man of long service got knocked out, towards the end of his labour, he would get a small pension; he was not entitled to it, but it was given as a sort of gratuity.  The Great Southern Railway bought this firm out, for their own ends, of course, and the position is not clear about the status of the employees, nor as to who owns the firm, whether it is the Great Southern Railway or whether it is an independent firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an amendment proposed by the leader of the Labour Party in the Dáil to make the position clear, and to give these men the status of railway servants, but that amendment was defeated.  We still want to make the position of these men clear.  We want to tell these men whether they are or are not railway servants.  We want to know what are they.  The railway took this firm over.  They had to do it because of their own mismanagement of the railways, and now they ask this House to say that these men have no rights.  Considering that John Wallis &amp; Sons paid pensions to some of their employees, which of course they were not legally bound to do, I think the railway company, considering we are handing them over a monopoly of the carrying service in this State, <Col N="1326" /> should be decent and withdraw this amendment and even if the position of these men is not clear let them leave it at that.</P>
    <P>It was sought in the Dáil to make the position of these men clear by saying that they were railway servants. That was not done.  We ask the House whatever else it does not to agree at any rate to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a good deal in regard to the reorganisation of the transport services, the question of the capital involved and the consideration that had been given to everything, except to human elements concerned in the transport services.  As Senator Staines has said, one of the firms gobbled up by the railway company was known as a decent firm.  There are men in John Wallis &amp; Sons, as Senator Staines has pointed out, who have given service for over thirty-five years.  If John Wallis &amp; Sons had been allowed to continue as an independent firm these men would receive small pensions when past their labour.  Their conditions of service were equal if not better than railway servants.  We are asked, in this amendment, to say that in no circumstances whatever are the employees of John Wallis &amp; Sons to be deemed to have the same rights as railway servants.  The railway company cannot have it both ways.  If John Wallis &amp; Sons is bought out, in the interests of the railway company, the persons who made John Wallis &amp; Sons&mdash;and surely the employees had a good deal to do with the building up of the business&mdash;ought to be considered. But it appears the employees are not to be recognised.  If a machine goes wrong there is the engineer to set it right.  If a horse gets ill the veterinary surgeon is called in, but if anything happens to the human being that is a matter for the poor law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to Senator Sir John Keane that he ought to withdraw this amendment. He is raising a matter here that is very contentious, and in the last paragraph of his amendment he is endeavouring to undo what some of us have spent a lifetime trying to do, that is, to try to arrange that conditions of service shall be regulated and <Col N="1327" /> carried on by trade unions' representatives on one side and employers on the other.  This amendment is designed specifically to cut out the representatives of the trade unions in any dispute between the employers, such as the Great Southern Railways Company or any other transport company, and the employees concerned. From my experience, that is a very foolish thing to do.  People who have experience of carrying on negotiations on a large scale on behalf of employers in any large industry have found that the best way to bring about agreement is not by getting little groups in a particular concern and asking them to negotiate, but by getting the trade unions concerned, engaged in the industry, to carry on these negotiations.  I suggest that in all the circumstances this amendment ought to be withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak in favour of this amendment.  Road transport is going to take the place, very largely, of railway transport in various parts of this country.  One of the reasons why the railways are in their present collapsed condition is uneconomic wages&mdash;that is, wages that are higher than the industry can bear over a long period of years, and conditions of service that are too expensive and not fitted for this country.  If that state of affairs is passed on to the road transport it will not only be bad for the transport service but for the public, because these charges are passed on to the public and have been passed on to them for years and years past.  Rates have been very much higher than it is desirable they should be, and the reason for that is that working expenses were so great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that it would be a great mistake, in the national interest, if railway conditions, which have arisen from circumstances into which I do not propose to go now, were to be passed on to the road transport as if road transport, for some particular reason or other, could bear more uneconomic conditions and more onerous conditions <Col N="1328" /> than any other form of transport in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of Senator Johnson's remarks, I think it is advisable that we should consider the remaining sections of this Bill in Committee here without regard to the circumstances that may arise in the event of dispute between the two Houses concerning any part of it, and that we should endeavour to get them into the shape that is considered best from all points of view.  As regards this amendment, I am sure that no one here will dispute the wisdom of getting clarity in so far as it affects the position of the railway company with regard to its employees.  Under the Act of 1924, the company&mdash;the G.S.R. Company&mdash;was required by law to regulate the wages and conditions of service of railway employees by agreement with the trade unions' representatives of these employees.  I do not think, however, that it will meet the present position to leave it exactly like that because a railway employee, according to the definition of that Act, is not merely anybody employed by the railway company.  There is a Schedule to the Act setting out the various grades of employees to which that part of the Act relates, and it is necessary to have it clear that the obligation upon the company to regulate the wages and conditions of work by agreement with the trades unions' representatives of the employees will extend not merely to those who are classified in the Schedule but also to other employees of grades not contemplated in the Act of 1924 but who will be in the company's service in consequence of the changes that may be effected following the passage of the Road Transport Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contemplate introducing an amendment upon the Report Stage which will be almost similar in words to the section of the 1924 Act affecting railway employees and which will require that wages and conditions of service between the company and its road service employees will be regulated by agreements to be made between the company and the trades unions' representatives of the employees.  That will <Col N="1329" /> clear up ambiguity, I think.  Certain ambiguity might arise if it is left as it stands because, included in the 1924 Act, there are clerks who are merely described as clerks (male and female), and a cartage staff described as carters, road motor drivers and working foremen. The position of these people would not be clear if the Act were not amended so as to provide that the wages and conditions of road service employees of all kinds, whether clerical workers or omnibus drivers and so on, are to be fixed by agreement the same as the others.  It does not really matter whether the conditions of service of the employees of John Wallis and Sons or of the Irish Omnibus Company are satisfactory at the present time.  I am aware that, in the agreement which was made on the occasion when the firm of John Wallis &amp; Sons was taken over by the Great Southern Railway Company, it was stated that the terms of employment and conditions of employment would be not less favourable to the employees than those they had enjoyed previously.  As far as I am aware, the rates of wages and conditions of employment in both the firm of John Wallis and Sons and that of the I.O.C. are determined by trade union agreements.  My object merely is to ensure that that will continue and that the company will be required to regulate, by agreement with the trades unions representative of the employees, the conditions of employment of the railway workers under the 1924 Act and, under this Act, the rates of wages and conditions of employment of these road transport workers.  I think it will be agreed that the agreements that might be made and that have been made for railway workers could not be automatically applied to road transport workers because they are in a different class.  In some cases, they might think themselves entitled to better treatment than railway workers, and in other cases, where the work was less onerous, it might be thought that they were not entitled to so much.  It is, obviously, a matter for negotiation and agreement. It is with that object that I propose to introduce an amendment relating to road workers in almost the same words as those in the section <Col N="1330" /> relating to railway workers in Part IV of the Act of 1924.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 32:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 12 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>12&mdash;(1)  Notwithstanding anything in the Principal Act, but subject to the provisions of this section, a railway company may, if it thinks fit, make such charges for the carriage of the merchandise of any trader, or for the carriage of any part of his merchandise, as may be agreed between the company and that trader:</P>
      <P>Provided that any such agreed charge, including the conditions attaching thereto, shall require the approval of the Minister.</P>
      <P>(2) In this section, a charge so agreed as aforesaid, including the conditions attaching thereto, is referred to as &ldquo;an agreed charge.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>(3) The Minister may approve an agreed charge either for such period as he thinks fit or without restriction of time.</P>
      <P>(4)  On any application under this section, the Minister shall have regard to all considerations which appear to him to be relevant, and, in particular, to the following considerations, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) the effect which the making of the agreed charge is likely to have, or has had, on the net revenue of the company; and</P>
      <P>(ii) whether the making of the agreed charge is necessary to enable the company to secure or retain the traffic to which the agreement relates.</P>
      <P>(5) A railway company shall, in respect of an agreed charge which is for the time being approved by the Minister, be exempt from the operation of&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) so much of Section 90 of the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, <Col N="1331" /> 1845, and of any section of a local and personal or private Act, as relates to the obligation of a railway company to make equal charges to all persons under like circumstances; and</P>
    <P>(ii)  so much of Section 2 of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1854, and of any section of a local and personal or private Act as relates to the obligation of a railway company to accord no undue preference to any person, and Section 27 of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1888, which relates to complaints with respect to undue preference.</P>
    <P>(6) The provisions of Section 48 of the Principal Act (which relates to the publication of schedules of standard charges, etc.) shall not apply in relation to agreed charges.</P>
    <P>(7)  An agreed charge which is for the time being approved by the Minister shall not be deemed to be an exceptional rate for the purposes of the provisions of Part III of the Principal Act, which relate to the modification, revision and review of charges.</P>
    <P>(8)  In this section the expression &ldquo;merchandise&rdquo; has the same meaning as in the Principal Act and the expression &ldquo;undue preference&rdquo; has the same meaning as in the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1888.</P>
    <P>This amendment is a long one, but the principle of it is fairly simple.  It is to give the company freedom of negotiation with traders in regard to rates.  As I understand the matter at present, if exceptional rates, that is, rates outside the standard rates, are to be given, the consent of the Railway Tribunal has to be obtained.  I understand, further, that any exceptional rates so permitted have to be given to every trader offering similar goods for transport, irrespective of quantity. Any business person must concede that those conditions are extraordinarily embarrassing.  There is no need to mention names, but I can picture a big firm coming to the railway company and saying: &ldquo;Unless you give me a flat tonnage rate on my commodities I have resources to move those goods in <Col N="1332" /> another way.  I have my own transport service, and I can move them on the road, outside the railway altogether,&rdquo; or it may even have its own shipping service and say: &ldquo;I can move them by water.&rdquo;  It does seem only reasonable, as a business proposition, that the railway company should go and negotiate the best terms they can under the circumstances with those who are offering transport, while those who are in a position to get more favourable rates, owing to the quantity of goods they have to offer, or owing to the competition which within their own resources they can provide, should be in the position of the railway company to meet the company and make the best deal they can.  To my mind, freedom of negotiation of that kind is implicit in any form of business.  If you were to place hampering conditions on any concern you would make it almost impossible for it to carry on. There can be no hard and fast rate that should be applied to big and small alike.  It should be within the power of the company to deal with circumstances as they find them&mdash;to give concessions where, without those concessions, they could not get the business at all.  That is, in effect, the object of the amendment.  There are other members of the House who know the technique of this matter better than I do.  I hope they will speak and supplement perhaps what I have omitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that this amendment is going quite the right way of dealing with this matter.  If this amendment were embodied in the Act it might improve the existing situation. I speak on this with some diffidence, being conscious of the fact that I am not so up-to-date in matters of this kind as I used to be.  The whole gist of this centres round the issue of undue preference.  It is well known that undue preference can be a very bad thing.  It could have the effect, for instance, of driving a trader out of business because another is being offered undue facilities for one reason or another, not altogether legitimate. There has always been control for that reason in these islands in this matter of undue preference.  The authority for control in this country for some years <Col N="1333" /> has been the Railway Tribunal.  I have no personal knowledge how that sort of business is dealt with by the present Railway Tribunal, as it did not come within my experience.  As the authority to control this matter of undue preference and prevent it, it seems to me that such a tribunal is, or ought to be, a better authority than the Minister.  For one reason it has got an element of permanence and a certain amount of technical experience. I am inclined to think that a better way would be to alter the machinery of the Tribunal in such a way as may be found necessary to avoid the present delays which, I understand from the amendment, are excessive.</P>
      <P>What constitutes undue preference is a distinct thing.  It is a matter that would require to be dealt with by a person of long experience and a certain amount of technical knowledge. Years ago it used not to be held that it was necessary to give every man exactly the same chance between certain points, because if one man had, say, 10,000 tons to move, you naturally gave him a lower rate than the man with only 100 tons to move.  I do not know how that is dealt with now.  On principle, I think it would be better if matters of this sort were dealt with not by a Minister, because Ministers change, but by a more or less permanent authority which would have experience and understand better the technique of the thing.  For that reason I am not very confident as to whether this amendment is the right way of attacking the matter.  I am sure that the Minister has considered this, and when I have heard his views I will be in a better position to know whether I can support the amendment or not.</P>

      <P>I do not know what view the Minister takes of this amendment, but I do not think Senator Sir John Keane's speech has justified it in the general terms in which it is expressed.  When I first read it I saw that if it were adopted it would lead to very much dissatisfaction.  It is an amendment which can be justified only on the assumption that the railway company, if they did not make a special <Col N="1334" /> bargain, would lose the business altogether. In its main aspects it is an amendment which tends to favour the big concerns.  I do not know whether the Minister considers that is good policy or not, but if the railway company are allowed to favour big concerns to the prejudice of small concerns, this amendment, if adopted, will cause a great amount of trouble.  I think Senator Bagwell's suggestion the better one.  I think that there should be some form of independent control by a continuous authority which would be unaffected by any considerations except the justice of the case.  I do not suggest that the Minister for the time being would be affected by any other considerations, but the Tribunal &mdash;I have some little experience of the disputes which have arisen&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question of rate-cutting, I am entirely on the side of the railways.  I do know that there has been uneconomic transport service in this country, and that it has been responsible for landing the railways and everybody else concerned in the mess in which they find themselves at present.  The railway company, I think, must share some responsibility for that. We know that under the 1924 Act there was a provision in the case of the carrying of merchandise, requiring the railway companies to have a fixed charge.  Under exceptional circumstances they were entitled, I think, to have a lesser charge than that fixed. They had to go before the Railway Tribunal if they wanted to lower their charges.  We know, unfortunately, that the procedure laid down for doing that enabled the competitors of the railway companies&mdash;some of these competing concerns were owned by the railway companies themselves&mdash;to steal traffic from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a notorious fact that it was <Col N="1335" /> some of these subsidiary companies owned by the railway companies that did most damage to the railways from the point of view of loss of traffic. While I think there ought to be a certain amount of freedom given to the railways, I think it ought not to be such as to enable them to embark afresh on the transport war that has been going on here for the past few years.  I am prepared to give them as many facilities as possible, but I think it is expecting too much to give them the facilities asked for in this amendment. I should like to see something in the nature of exceptional circumstances attaching to it and I should like to see the Railway Tribunal retained as the body to which the railway company should go for the purpose of asking for these reduced charges.  I am wholeheartedly with the railways, because I know they have suffered because of this unfair competition that is going on against them, and some effort ought to be made to strengthen their position, but I do not think I would be prepared to give the railways full facilities to cut their own throats as they have done before.</P>

      <P>On the Railway Act of 1931, an amendment on similar lines to this was proposed and, on that occasion, I spoke and voted against that amendment.  I could to-day put up very strong reasons for rejecting the amendment proposed by Senator Sir John Keane.  I could quote instances which I think would convince the House that we should not accept the amendment, but, considering the position of the railway company and considering the time they have gone through&mdash;and their directors and officials say at present that unless they have a free hand they cannot carry on&mdash;I am prepared to give the railway a free hand and to withdraw all restrictions from them in relation to competition with road transport.  Even then I am afraid we will not be able to save the railways, but for these reasons I support the amendment on behalf of the cattle trade, although I should like to see it, <Col N="1336" /> as Senator Bagwell said, more specifically defined.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear from Senator Sir John Keane some argument in favour of the abolition of the Railway Tribunal, because that is what is involved in the first two or three sub-sections of this new section. The new charges are to be made by the company if it thinks fit with the approval of the Minister.  The Railways Act of 1924 makes provision for exceptional rates, subject to the approval of the Railway Tribunal. Now it would appear that the Railway Tribunal is to be abolished and the Minister substituted for this purpose. I wonder would the Senator explain why he desires that change to take place, because it seems to be rather inconsistent with his general attitude?</P>

      <P>If the Senator is looking for consistency in politics&mdash; from any quarter&mdash;I am afraid he will be disappointed.  The reason why the Minister is preferable to the Railway Tribunal is because he is, I understand, more expeditious, and there is not the same expense or formality to be gone through.  There are two points involved in the amendment, first, the question of the Tribunal or the Minister and, secondly, and more important, the question of the flat rate.  My information is that, as the law stands at present, the flat rate is illegal.  If the company quoted a firm a certain rate per ton for 100 miles, another person can come in and claim that rate for five miles.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I am not sufficiently expert in this matter, but I understand that the flat rate at present is illegal.  I may not be quite clear as to the technique of the flat rate, but I understand that it is illegal, and that it is by reason of their inability to grant a flat rate that the companies are handicapped and that they are seeking to grant flat rates.  I might say, if it is any guide to the House, that under the English Transport Bill the power to grant flat rates, subject to the approval, as <Col N="1337" /> Senator Johnson will be glad to hear, of the Tribunal, but not of the Minister, is being given for the first time.  For the first time, the principle of the flat rate is now made legal, subject to the approval of the Tribunal, and what we are seeking here is that the principle of the flat rate should now be sanctioned by law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Senator Sir John Keane is quite right in his explanation.  The railway company, as I understand it, have sufficient powers to grant flat rates to anybody or to any place, but the condition is that anyone applying for the same rate on the same conditions must get it.  They can give flat rates, and can give rates 40 per cent. below the rates fixed by the Tribunal, but if they give rates 40 per cent. below they will have to apply to the Tribunal for permission within six months.  What the railway company want, and what this amendment seeks to give them, is permission to give preferential rates, and there is a great difference between preferential rates and flat rates.  As I said, objection can be taken to it, but the amendment states clearly that it is preferential rates they are seeking.</P>

      <P>I think that Senator Counihan is beginning to find out what this amendment is about.  I was rather surprised to hear him suggest that the Cattle Traders' Association were favourable to the introduction of the flat rate for cattle, and it is quite clear that that is what the amendment is designed to provide for.  The railway company at present has power to give exceptional rates in certain cases, with the sanction of the Railway Tribunal, but this amendment is designed to enable it to charge, in certain circumstances, flat rates, and to enable them to charge these rates in circumstances which exempt them from the obligation to make equal charges to all persons in like circumstances and from the obligation to accord no undue preference to any person and from the obligation of publishing the charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1338" /> I think this is by far the most revolutionary proposal in relation to transport introduced here yet, not excluding anything in the Railways Bill relating to capital or anything else.  This amendment is clearly founded on a section of the Road and Rail Traffic Bill which was recently introduced in the British Parliament. Whether that Bill is likely to become law in the form in which it was introduced is a matter concerning which I have no knowledge, but, judging by the opposition which has been developing to this particular section in it, I think that it is most unlikely and, yet, that section in the British Road and Rail Traffic Bill is far less objectionable than this because it, at least, provides the victimised trader with an opportunity of making his objection and having his objection heard.  There is no such provision in this amendment at all.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear the things Senator Sir John Keane said about the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I thank him for the complimentary references.  They are not necessary, however, because this amendment is designed practically to make the railway company the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It is designed practically to give the railway company power to determine what industries are to exist, what industries are to go out, where the industries are to be located, what traders are to be allowed to carry on trade and what traders are to be made bankrupt and, generally, to regulate the whole economic life of the country at their own sweet will and discretion and without publicity.  They are to be given absolute discretion to give one rate to one trader, another to his competitor and a third to somebody else.</P>
    <P>If this amendment is carried they can regulate their charges in any way they will in accordance with agreements made between them and individual traders or manufacturers.  There is, of course, the provision that the Minister must approve of each charge, but under the circumstances that is a safeguard which is of very little value.  The first thing to notice, <Col N="1339" /> however, is that this amendment is entirely contrary, not merely to the principles of the Railways Bill and the Road Transport Bill, but to the whole traditional transport policy in this country and in Great Britain. Heretofore, transport policy has been based entirely on the principle that preferential treatment must not be given by a transport organisation to any one firm or individual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Minister's pardon, but I should like to correct the statement he has just made about preferences.  There has always been a system of preferences in operation, and there must be.  The principle of reduction in respect of quantities is universal.  What is not allowable is undue preference, if I might with great respect make that correction of the Minister's statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle upon which transport legislation has been based heretofore is that, under similar conditions, all persons should be treated alike by railway companies and other transport organisations which are in the same position, so far as the law is concerned, as railway companies.  So far as the Great Southern Railways Company is concerned, those principles were made effective by a system of standard charges and standard classification. So far as the other companies are concerned, they were made effective by the obligation that rests upon them under various statutes to have maximum charges and classifications of various kinds.  Under this Bill, we are taking steps to bring the system of standard charges, so far as it affects the Great Southern Railways, up to date and to make it really effective.  It has not been effective heretofore because of the number of exceptional charges granted by the railway company after application to the Railway Tribunal.  I do not know if the British Parliament is going to reverse the principles upon which its transport legislation was heretofore framed.  I think that is unlikely but, if they are going to move in that direction, that is no reason why we <Col N="1340" /> should do the same.  The British Rail and Road Traffic Act has a number of very satisfactory features.  It is particularly gratifying to us to note that they have followed our lead in quite a number of the innovations introduced in our Road Transport Bill now under consideration.  In so far as they have done so, they seem to be going along the right lines but when they depart from that lead, they are wandering on to dangerous ground. This is one of the things in respect of which they have gone outside the bounds of reasonableness and it is quite likely that the opposition which has developed to this section in Great Britain will be more than sufficient to defeat it.  The acceptance of this amendment would mean the recasting not alone of the entire Railways Bill but of the Road Transport Bill, which is also founded on the principle that, under similar circumstances, similar facilities and conditions will be given to everybody.  If we depart from that principle and give the railway company power to grant preferential treatment, to enter into separate agreements with certain firms which will not be applied to and will not be known to other firms, we enter upon an entirely new line which will involve the recasting of our entire legislation on this matter.  I do not think that we should do that.  I think that there is a case to be made for permitting the railway company to charge a flat rate for certain commodities, subject to that flat rate being available to everybody who wants to transport these commodities and subject to the necessary safeguards of the public interest in that respect.  I am considering the possibility of framing an amendment for the Report Stage which will provide for that.  That is not a very simple thing to do since the interests of other transport organisations, such as the canal company, must also be preserved.  Like the railway company, they are at present debarred from entering into flat rate arrangements such as the railway company is now seeking power to make.  The possibility of permitting the railway company to quote rates for the carriage of goods by rail and road combined <Col N="1341" /> where the portion of the rate attributable to the rail service might be less than the standard rate is also being considered.  If found feasible, we may have an amendment on Report Stage to deal with that matter also.</P>
      <P>To the general principle of this amendment, I think there must be, particularly on the part of those who regard it as their duty to protect commercial interests, very vigorous opposition. To give the railway company the powers proposed in this amendment would be to create an almost intolerable position for a large number of the business people of this country. They might find themselves in a position in which they would be competing with others who had entered into an agreement with the railway company for such favourable transport terms that they would be given practically a monopoly of the market. That could easily happen.  A Senator talked about some firm saying to the railway company: &ldquo;We shall not give you our transport unless you give us a flat rate per ton, irrespective of distance.  If you do not enter into an arrangement to give us that flat rate, we shall arrange to transport our goods by means other than rail.&rdquo;  What is much more likely to happen is that a firm would say to the railway company: &ldquo;Give us a flat rate that you will give to nobody else and, in these circumstances, we shall send our goods by rail.&rdquo;  What is asked by this amendment is power for the railway company to enter into such an arrangement. The possible results of that arrangement are so very obvious that I am surprised that anybody familiar with the circumstances of business firms would support the suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also to bear in mind that, in the first place, we are proposing in these two Bills to place the railway company in what will be tantamount to a monopoly position and, secondly, that the safeguards which would exist if other means of transport were available to those prejudiced in their interests by the railway company will be removed.  It is to this monopoly organisation these very wide powers of discrimination are to be given under this amendment.  I do not <Col N="1342" /> think that we can contemplate that. I think that this amendment should be vigorously resisted and whatever difficulties it is hoped to meet met in some other way.  I think that we must preserve the principle of having exceptional rates sanctioned by the Railway Tribunal, which is a court, rather than by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or some body who has not got the same status as a court.  At the same time, if we authorise the railway company to charge a flat rate, we must ensure that that flat rate will be available to everybody who desires to transport the commodities to which it applies.  In giving that power to the railway company we should take whatever steps are necessary to ensure, firstly, that nobody is going to be prejudiced by possession of the power and, secondly, that the position of other transport organisations vis-a-vis the railway company will not be seriously impaired.</P>

What the amendment seeks to do is to place the railway company in the same position as their competitors, the lorry owners. At present, there is no law to prevent the lorry owners from quoting preferential rates for the carriage of goods.  The aim of this amendment is to place the railway company in the same position as their competitors now occupy.

I understand there are <Col N="1343" /> certain commodities &mdash; and one special commodity in which the Government is interested &mdash; which will perhaps lend themselves to special flat rate treatment. I ask the Minister to consider the effects of an arrangement where one firm says: &ldquo;We will give you several thousand ton miles of a commodity.&rdquo; A rate is quoted, but when another firm comes along with an infinitesimal ton mileage of the same commodity they pay at the same rate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The railways of this country want the best advice it is possible to get, if they are to carry on.  It is a bad policy, as we know, to change horses midstream. In this case it seems to me that the <Col N="1344" /> proposal is to change horses when the river is in flood.  The railways may be compared to a river with tributaries and a skilful pilot is needed to guide them through troubled waters.  I want to ask the Minister, or any member of the Government, if they know of any man who was more fully qualified to fill the position he held than the pilot they want to drop overboard. Let us consider who this pilot is.  He happens to be a Tipperary man, who came to Dublin in his teens, and joined the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway as a clerk.  This gentleman wound up his railway career as the general manager of the greatest railway in the world.  The Minister spoke yesterday about the economies, amounting to over £1,000,000, that had been effected under the Railways Act of 1924.  It would be interesting to know who was responsible for most of these economies.  I think I know.  Possibly I know the gentleman in question better than the majority of Senators.  I am aware that on all occasions he was willing and anxious to help this country.  I am satisfied that since he occupied the present position&mdash;a position that was in many ways unpleasant for him&mdash;he did so simply because he thought he would be of some use to this country. I have personal experience of his kindness. In 1920-21-22, when things were very bad here, and when large numbers were unemployed, as a member of Lord St. David's Committee this gentleman got £24,000 for the Dublin Port and Docks Board for development work. As a result 500 men were employed for a considerable time.  If this gentleman is removed from the position, personally I shall be glad, because it will give him an opportunity of being free from worry, and of enjoying his remaining years, but, on the other hand, I shall be very sorry in the interests of the railways.</P>

      <P>I opposed the principle enshrined in the Railways (Directorate) Act of 1924, that principle being that we were giving a certain outside company power to nominate a director on the new board of the Great Southern Railways.  Notwithstanding what Senator Moran has said, if the shareholders of the Great Southern <Col N="1345" /> Railways Company think that the person concerned is a suitable and proper person to look after their interests, there is nothing to prevent them electing him.  What we object to is the principle, that any outside company should have the right to nominate a director on the principal transport service in this country.  The gentleman concerned is known to all here, having been a former member of this House.  He can still render the services that Senator Moran thinks he is capable of rendering to the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways, and there is nothing to prevent them at the next election returning him at the head of the poll.  What we say is that we are not going to agree to the continuance of an Act of Parliament that was, in the first instance, wrong and the principle of which was vicious.  The proper course is to repeal the Act of 1924, and accordingly the House should resist this amendment.  If the gentleman's services are so valuable the railway shareholders have the opportunity of electing him to look after their interests.</P>

      <P>When the Railways (Directorate) Act was before the Seanad I opposed it more strenuously than I opposed any other measure brought before this House.  I said then, and I say now, that the only real vital interest a man nominated by any cross-Channel railway company could have here, was the maintenance, and the increase, where possible, of through rates.  Anybody who has any experience of the export business to England knows that that has been a standing grievance.  The idea of putting a director nominated by a cross-Channel company on a railway here, and to do so by Act of Parliament passed here, is sheer lunacy, if we are to have regard to the interests of this country.  After all, the railways are being given a monopoly of rendering services to the community, and to carry out vital services, and if nothing else was done beyond repealing the Railways (Directorate) Act this Bill would be worth supporting.  I am very pleased that it is being ended.  If there were any question of money involved, in my view it would be better to pay that money. 3<Col N="1346" /> Whether that money is due or not, I do not know.

      <P>I cannot see any reason why the G.S.R. Company should not cut adrift from the influence of other railway companies.  They have a monopoly in this country, so far as railways are concerned.  We have had rather sad experiences of the influence of British railway companies.  Whenever we had reason to make complaints to the Great Southern Railways and asked to have some grievances rectified we were referred to a combined British and Irish Railway Conference. The G.S.R., apparently, were not their own masters at that conference.  A decision was arrived at by the majority of the representatives at that conference. I may say that the bulk of the representatives were British&mdash;foreign. For that reason I object to any outside influence guiding the destinies of the Great Southern Railways.</P>
      <P>On another occasion when we were trying to get a shipping company established, when we were charged exorbitant rates by the existing shipping combine, I put up a proposal on behalf of the cattle trade to the Great Southern Railways Company.  The then Chairman thought there was a good deal in the idea.  He was very much enamoured with it and at his request I committed my ideas to writing.  The proposal was considered by the directors.  The director of the L.M.S. Company thought it might in some way injure the traffic with which he was concerned and the proposal was turned down.  I do not think there is much hope of development of the Great Southern Railways Company until it is prepared to stand on its own legs and get rid of all except national influence.</P>

There are further advantages, I am informed, representing about £20,000 a year that also form part of the arrangement.  I do not think it is fair to suggest that the presence of a nominee of an interlocking company, a company which continues to carry on transport and provides an outlet for our exports, a company with which good relations are essential to our well-being, is necessarily malign so far as this country is concerned.  I should have thought the object of that company and their nominee would be to encourage all the trade they could.  The more trade the better for everybody.  I think that these aspersions on outside influence are rather discreditable to the other directors.  After all, is it likely that one person out of ten, or whatever is the number, is going to have that great power of harm over the home company, that power of bad influence and that power of over-riding the majority of the board?  I think the whole thing is fantastic and it is based on an unwarrantable suspicion.</P>

    <P>I ask the House to look upon this matter purely as a businesslike arrangement.  If it is not businesslike, have done with it; if it is businesslike, continue it.  Let us break down these barriers of national prejudice.  You cannot deal with trade in watertight compartments or merely in terms of States or national entities.  I am not in favour of having a representative of an outside company on a home company unless there is something adequate given in return.  I am informed that if this Act is repealed the Great Southern Railway Company becomes <Col N="1348" /> liable for the payment of a substantial sum and will suffer the loss of substantial advantages.  Whether that liability will be enforced is another matter.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say.</P>

      <P>Looking at this matter from the point of view Senator Sir John Keane suggests, that is, as a purely business matter, and not knowing very much about the details of the business arrangement between the London, Midland and Scottish and the Great Southern Railway, I ask myself why should it be the London, Midland and Scottish and not the Great Western Railway of England?  A considerable portion of this country is as well served, so far as cross-Channel trade is concerned, by the Great Western Railway of England as by the London, Midland and Scottish.  If a nominee of the London, Midland and Scottish on the directorate of the Great Southern Railway is as influential as the mover of this proposal represents, then I think it may well be that the interests of this country may be placed in a position second to that of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.  It may be quite right for Senator Sir John Keane to say that the directorate are not children and are not going to be overridden by one member who happens to be the nominee of the London, Midland and Scottish; but according to Senator Moran, that person is emphatically the effective element in the directorate.</P>

      <P>By merit, yes, but nevertheless his merit is great enough to affect the general policy of the company. Even by merit he overrides the demerit of the rest of the directorate. The fact that that person who possesses great merit and, therefore, great power, is a nominee of the London Midland and Scottish, inevitably will tend to ensure that traffic will go via the London, Midland and Scottish rather than via the Great Western Railway of England.  As a matter of pure business I think that the question to be asked is: which will serve the interests of this country better, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway <Col N="1349" /> or the Great Western Railway of England? They at least should be put on level terms.  But they are not with this Act on the Statute Book.  The London, Midland and Scottish representative is a man of great merit.  He has by his very merit such immense power as the nominee of the London, Midland and Scottish that therefore he can influence the policy of the Great Southern Railways in the direction of the London, Midland and Scottish, and away from the Great Western Railway of England. There is no business level term there and no equality there.  That in itself is sufficient condemnation of this Act remaining on the Statute Book at present.  What the cost of the removing by this Act may be I do not know but it would have to be a very high cost indeed to warrant the continuation of that policy.</P>

It would be a revelation to Senator Sir John Keane to know what, and if he had that experience I am perfectly sure, knowing him as I do, that he would not stand behind this amendment.  I will just give one slight example of this and the matter of through rates. Condensed milk was made in Limerick and the company that made that had a very high reputation for one particular kind, which was handled by an organisation in London known as The Pool.  When it went out of business and discontinued supplying there was a prospect of a series of factories being set going again.  The Pool decided that they would get a supply of condensed milk from Italy, and to sell it under the price at which the Irish article was sold in London. When the relative distance from Italy to London and Limerick to London is considered, and the number of countries and railways it had to pass through, one is surprised to be told that the rate on that condensed milk from Italy to London was slightly <Col N="1350" /> cheaper than the rate from Limerick to London.  That is only one example I wish to suggest to the House.  As I said before, when that Railways (Directorate) Bill was introduced, the London, Midland and Scottish could have no interest in this country beyond the maintenance of through rates. While I cast no aspersion on the character of the London, Midland and Scottish nominee on the Great Southern Railway, I must say that I am satisfied he is only there in one interest, and that is in the interest of the London, Midland and Scottish Company.</P>

      <P>I oppose this amendment on principle.  I do not think that any monetary consideration should influence us so as to allow a representative of a foreign company to influence the policy of a railway company in this country.  No matter how excellent the man may be, and, indeed, I agree that the representative of the British company is a man of great experience and great ability, I would oppose the arrangement.  The more ability that representative has the more likely he will be to influence the policy of our railway directorate in the interests of the company which he is employed to represent.  Senator Johnson has made the point that if the London, Midland and Scottish Railway is to have an influence on our railways why should not the Great Western?</P>

      <P>Would we sell the control of transport of this country to any foreign country for its own advantage on the payment of £100,000? Surely we would not.  Therefore, I am against that Act and against the amendment.  I am against it on principle, and I ask Senator Sir John Keane this question&mdash;what about reciprocity &mdash; would the London, Midland and Scottish accept from us a representative of our railways on their board so as to influence the policy of that great railway in giving any favour to Ireland?  I wonder what <Col N="1351" /> would Senator Sir John Keane say to that?  I observe he is silent now.  He sees, of course, that what is good enough for Ireland cannot be thought of in relation to the sister island.  I repeat I am opposed to this on principle.  No money consideration would induce me, for one, to vote in favour of allowing the policy of our railways to be directed in the interests of any foreign combination no matter what it was.  I ask Senator Sir John Keane again to put it to the test of reciprocity.  Are we to get an influence in the control of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in the interests of Ireland?</P>

      <P>I can go a long way with Senator Moran in respect for the individual concerned in this matter.  I have a long experience of him and, personally, I have a great admiration for his ability, but that is not going to influence me in connection with the amendment nor with the company he represents on the Great Southern Railways.  Senator Sir John Keane told us of the very great concern for the development of this country and the trade of this country that that company has.  I give one instance as to that concern.  At one time, the mails were carried by the City of Dublin Steamship Company, an Irish company.  The London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company came along and took over this work and cut out the City of Dublin Company.  At that time there was an understanding and agreement that at least 50 per cent. of the employees on these mail boats would be Irishmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The London, Midland and Scottish took it over, and what is the position to-day?  You can count on the fingers of your two hands the number of Irishmen employed on these ships.  So much for the talk about that influence. In the nomination we have certainly a very able nominee put on the Board of the Great Southern Railways, but I am not convinced at all that his company is very much concerned with Irish development, and with that example before me that I have given I am certainly going to vote against <Col N="1352" /> this amendment here.  I know a number of the men who are employed on these steamers.  I know what their conditions were formerly and what they are to-day.  Their conditions are very much worsened since they were taken over by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company.  Their job has been made more difficult.  The men who have their homes here are for all practical purposes domiciled in Holyhead.  I could recite many more instances of their alleged interest in Irish affairs on these lines, but I do not want to take up the time of the House.  I have given, perhaps, enough instances, and I am going to vote against the amendment and the principle in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say here, as I said in the Dáil, that the decision to repeal the Railways (Directorate) Act, 1924, was taken without regard to the personality of the London, Midland and Scottish director on the Great Southern Railways Board.  The same decision would have been taken no matter who that nominee was.  For the particular individual in question, I myself have considerable admiration. I have great respect for his administrative and combative abilities. But they do not come into this question at all.  The question is whether we are to have on the Board of the Great Southern Railways a person nominated by a non-Saorstát railway.  I do not think we can possibly judge this question fairly without having an outline of the history of the events which led up to the present position.  It is clear that a number of those who have spoken in this discussion have been misled about the present position by failing to refer to the history of the events which produced it.  Over 30 years ago the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway made an agreement with the London and North Western Railway Company, which since became the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The line was built from Waterford to New Ross&mdash;the New Ross and <Col N="1353" /> Waterford extension line.  The building of that line was of very considerable advantage to the London, Midland and Scottish Company.  It secured that the traffic which might otherwise have gone by the Great Western railway system in Great Britain was secured for the London, Midland and Scottish Company.  At that time the Great Southern and Western Railway Company had an arrangement by which all unconsigned traffic entrusted to them went via the Great Western system.  I do not know whether that arrangement persists.  In any event, I do not believe it is necessary now, as the London, Midland and Scottish Company and the Great Western Company have a pooling arrangement by which they divide between them the proceeds of any through rates.  That, of course, to a large extent offsets Senator Johnson's consideration.  That pooling arrangement was only recently arrived at.  So long as it exists, I suppose it doesn't make much difference whether the traffic passes via the London, Midland and Scottish or the Great Western.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  The agreement made at the time involved a loan of £100,000 by the London, Midland and Scottish Company to the Dublin South-Eastern Company for the construction of the line.  That loan was given on these conditions: The Irish company, as it was called in the agreement, could repay the loan only if interest upon it had been paid for five years previously.  The English company could require repayment of the loan on six month's notice.  I am aware that another interpretation of the agreement is possible and certain people have put another interpretation upon it.  But when anyone examines it, bearing in mind that persons do not draw up an agreement except for the purpose of conveying a definite idea, and not for the purpose of tying themselves up in legal knots, and that in all these documents the commonsense interpretation is usually the proper legal interpretation, it seems <Col N="1354" /> to me that the interpretation I have given is obviously the correct one.  On the other hand, the Irish company agreed to procure the election to its Board of one of its own shareholders nominated by the London, Midland and Scottish Company.  I want that particular point emphasised.  There was no agreement on the part of the Irish company to put upon its Board a person nominated by the London, Midland and Scottish Company.  The Irish company agreed to procure the election of a duly qualified person, satisfactory to them, who was nominated by the London, Midland and Scottish Company at that time.  The working between the Dublin and South-Eastern Company and the London, Midland and Scottish Company was very close at that time and very beneficial to both, particularly to the London, Midland and Scottish Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That arrangement persisted until 1924, when the amalgamation of railways in the Saorstát was effected.  By the amalgamation all the railways in the Saorstát were amalgamated into one company and the liabilities and assets of the separate concerns became liabilities and assets of the new amalgamated company.  What was the position of the agreement when that amalgamation was effected? The liability to repay the £100,000 to the London, Midland and Scottish Company on six months' notice from that company, or on the initiative of the Irish company if interest had been paid for five years previously, was transferred, and that liability became a liability of the Great Southern Railways Company.  On the other hand, the Great Southern Railways Company could not carry out the other part of the agreement.  It could not procure the election to the Board of the Dublin South-Eastern Company of a person duly qualified to act in that capacity, having regard to the fact that that Board had been abolished. The agreement, therefore, in 1924 would appear to have become inoperative and, no doubt, in that year the London, Midland and Scottish Company, if they so desired, could have pressed for the repayment of the <Col N="1355" /> £100,000, the amount of the original loan.  I want to emphasise that of course they could have pressed for it at any time from the date on which the loan was made.  All the agreement necessitated was the giving of six months' notice to the Irish company. They did not, however, do it since 1924.  In that year the Railways (Directorate) Act was passed.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to state authoritatively the motives which inspired the Government then in office to introduce that Act.  A careful study of the Act does not reveal the motives that were behind its introduction, or even the speeches which were delivered by Ministers in justification of it do not give a clear picture of what the position was.  Nor have I been able to find in the records of the Department any documents which would indicate the events which led up to the introduction of that Act. Certain documents are there, but they do not tell the whole story.  That Act, however, did not purport to give effect to the agreement of twenty years previously. It did not have any direct relation to that old agreement.  It was the result of certain discussions which apparently had taken place in 1924, having regard to the circumstances of 1924.  It gave to the London, Midland and Scottish Company the right to put a director upon the Board of the Great Southern Railways Company. It is clear that the right given to the London, Midland and Scottish Company to put a director upon the Board of the Great Southern Railways Company was an entirely different thing from that enjoyed by the London, Midland and Scottish Company under the old agreement, which involved the action by the Dublin South-Eastern Board to procure the election of a person duly qualified&mdash;that is, a shareholder of the Irish company approved of and nominated by the English company.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear, and should have been clear in 1924, that the agreement of 20 years previously, entered into between a minor Irish company and the English company, and involving the nomination of a <Col N="1356" /> person on the Board of the Irish company, in consideration for certain concessions given to the other company, and resulting out of the very close and intimate working that existed between them, could not be, and should not have been, advanced as a reason why the same English company should be given that right to put a director upon the Board of the company that was going to control all the railways of the Free State.  That action was taken. It was taken in spite of considerable opposition both in the Dáil and the Seanad and in other quarters, and the position in that respect has continued since then.  That position is this: the London, Midland and Scottish Company nominated its director to the Board of the Great Southern Railways Company.  That director continued to act there in whatever manner he thought fit.  The London, Midland and Scottish Company was entitled to demand a repayment of the loan of £100,000 on six months' notice any time between 1924 and this date.  The Great Southern Railways Company could have repaid that loan at any time if they had paid interest for five years previously.</P>
    <P>The agreement expired somewhere about the beginning of this year.  I do not think that makes very much difference in the position.  It had a 30 years' life which ended about the beginning of this year.  If it made any alteration in the position, it merely eliminated the necessity for giving six months' notice by the English Company in order to procure the return of the £100,000, if they wanted it.</P>
    <P>Now we are going further than the Railways Acts of 1924.  We are going to make the Great Southern Board not merely a Board that will control all the railways of the Saorstát but also all the transport of the Saorstát.  Is it seriously contended that an agreement made 30 years ago between a minor Irish railway company and an English company in the interests of that minor Irish company should be appealed to to-day in order to secure for the English company a right to put a director, one in seven, on the Board that is going to control the transport of the Saorstát &mdash; rail and road transport <Col N="1357" /> as well?  I think it is a preposterous contention and I do not know on what ground it could be defended. I should say that recently I had an opportunity of meeting the Chairman of the London, Midland and Scottish Company and I found that he was not inclined to put forward that contention or to rely upon it.  I am quite certain that any reasonable person would see the preposterous nature of an argument of that kind.  The position following the repeal of this Act, the Railways (Directorate) Act, will be the position that existed before the Act passed.  I think that is clear.</P>
    <P>The position before the Act was passed was that a liability had been transferred from the Dublin South-Eastern Company to the Amalgamated Company, the Great Southern Railways Company.  Certain obligations under the agreement had also been transferred but these obligations could not be given effect to.  It was a case then for discussion between the Great Southern Railways Company and the London, Midland and Scottish Company as to the position of both under that agreement and that is the position to-day.  I understand these discussions are about to take place.  What the results of these discussions will be or what arrangement may be made between the two companies is a matter for them, not a matter for us.  One thing clear is this that we do not propose to force on the Great Southern Railways Company a director nominated by the London, Midland and Scottish Company or even to confer that right on the London, Midland and Scottish Company at the request of the Great Southern Railways Company in the changed circumstances now existing, merely because the Dublin South Eastern Company some 30 years ago thought fit to make this agreement. One cannot say whether if there had been an Irish Government in existence at that time the Dublin South-Eastern Company would have been permitted to make that agreement but it is quite clear that the agreement they made was something altogether different to the Railways (Directorate) Act.  It was something which they were entitled to make in law, binding them to do certain <Col N="1358" /> things which they were free in law to do, and something which the Great Southern Railways Company is quite free to do in law if it so wishes.</P>
    <P>If the owners of the Great Southern Railways Company think fit to enter into an arrangement by which they will bind themselves to elect anybody on their board, provided that person is qualified in every respect to be a member of the Board, there is nothing in any statute to prevent them doing so. Before the Great Southern Railways Company might consider availing of its position in that regard I think it should satisfy itself that it is getting some concession and that it is the right thing to do.  I am told that not alone is there a sum of £100,000 involved but that the Great Southern Railways Company derives an advantage estimated at £20,000 because of the agreement with the London, Midland and Scottish.  I have asked in the Dáil, I have asked the Great Southern Railways and the Chairman of the London, Midland and Scottish how that sum was arrived at, what were the items that formed it, and I have never been able to get a clear answer. I do not believe it and until there is proof to the contrary I shall continue to disbelieve that the Great Southern Railways Company is getting any advantage of the kind out of the agreement.  I think if there are to be any discussions between the Great Southern Railways Company and the London, Midland and Scottish Company arising out of the agreement, that the Great Southern Railways Company should be satisfied that it is really getting an advantage of that kind before it accepts the word of an English company for it, even if the English company are prepared to assert it in the absence of proof.</P>
    <P>The position is that the agreement in so far as the transfer of liability to the Great Southern Railway Company is concerned still exists and in that connection discussions will have to take place and are about to take place between the two companies concerned. It is not a matter for us.  I would remind Senators that the Chairman of the Great Southern Board at the recent meeting of the Company stated <Col N="1359" /> that his Company did not ask to have a L.M.S. director placed on their Board, but were compelled to take one.  Any arrangement to be entered into in future should be entered into freely by the Great Southern Railways Company and not made obligatory on them by Act of Parliament.  I do not think it is right that we should have on the Board of a company to which we are entrusting practically a monopoly of transport in the Saorstát, one director in seven nominated by a foreign company whose chief concern will be the welfare of that foreign company. Our Board should be one actuated with the sole purpose of making its own undertaking a success and if there is to be any arrangement between this company and companies in Great Britain or elsewhere, this arrangement can be effected, probably to the mutual advantage of both parties, without giving any measure of control in respect of transport affairs here to any outside company.</P>

He said that in future the company, if it wishes, can make arrangements with the London, Midland and Scottish or any other railway company in regard to its directorate. That might be taken as an invitation to the London, Midland and Scottish Company to make terms whereby they <Col N="1360" /> would get the actual control of the policy of the Great Southern Railways in this country.  That is a possibility that I certainly do not think should go out as a hint or as a line of policy that would prove acceptable to this country. It is well that I think it should not be allowed to pass without notice. I think it might very well be taken as an indication of a line of policy which they might take to overcome the repeal of this Directorate Act.  I am sure the Minister did not intend to hint to the company that they might evade the purposes of this section by doing that. I should not like it to be thought as a possible line of policy which would prove of advantage to this country.</P>

The London, Midland and Scottish Company has now no legal or moral right to rely upon that agreement.  I must say that I think Senator Johnson has expressed the general feeling in this country when he indicates that no encouragement should be given to the Great Southern Railways Company to make any agreement to elect a nominee of the London, Midland and Scottish on the Board of the Irish railways.</P>

I would like to think that if the Great Southern Railway proposed to enter into such an agreement they would do so having full regard to the important concession they were giving, and to the value they were getting in exchange as well as the policy of the Government.  My contention, which I pressed at some length, was that on the one hand the Great Southern are not getting out of the pre-existing arrangement any great advantage and, on the other hand, I <Col N="1361" /> would be surprised if the London, Midland and Scottish attach the slightest importance to having a director on the Great Southern Board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got a good deal, here, of what we do not get anywhere else outside this House, that is free legal opinion. Interesting as it may be, it is not very convincing.  There is no doubt, I admit, as to the legal liability of the Great Southern Company in the event of their nominee having to be withdrawn by the London, Midland and Scottish.  Senator Comyn does not believe that there is any legal liability. I think the Minister is doubtful whether there is any legal liability, but the company is advised that there is. Under these circumstances is it not only reasonable for the Government to indemnify the company against any claim that may be made in the courts? The Minister could help me very much in this matter if he told me all he knew.  He admitted having conversation with the chairman of the London, Midland and Scottish, and I can hardly believe that this whole matter was not discussed.  The question of a director was discussed and I can hardly believe that the other question, with the corresponding question of liability, was not also discussed.  If the Minister can tell me that he has even reason to believe that the London, Midland and Scottish would not sue for any breach <Col N="1362" /> of agreement arising, out of this Directorate Act, I think I should be satisfied, and the company would be satisfied. In the absence of any such specific assurance from the Minister, I think it is only fair, considering that we are here passing all this legislation as relief for the railway companies, to help them to keep on their feet, that the State should indemnify the company from any claim that may be made against it in the courts.</P>
    <P>With regard to the concessions, the Minister doubts they have any value. I am unable to say what value they have.  But I have the list of them, and the Minister has seen that list. The company was in a position to keep accounts, as to what they were worth, and the amendment says that the Railway Tribunal shall ascertain the amount of the loss sustained in any year by the company as a consequence of the repeal effected, and then the State would be asked to make good that amount.  That is all I need say.</P>

      <P>I want to put this case to the Seanad as if the worst possible interpretation could be put upon the agreement.  Let us assume the company is going to lose £100,000; that as a result of this Bill, when it becomes an Act, and also as a result of the Railway Act of 1924, the Great Southern Railways has to pay £100,000 to the London, Midland and Scottish. Is that any reason why the State should pay the money?  If a company made a bad agreement thirty years ago, why should the taxpayers have to pay for it?</P>

      <P>If, at any time between 1903 and 1923, the Dublin South Eastern Railway decided to issue debenture stock or in some other way undertook to meet the loan by the London, Midland and Scottish, the liability of the company, in respect of the new loan, would be transferred to the Great Southern, and would be its liability to-day.  I want to know why this loan, if there was a loan, should be made good by the taxpayers?  Until that case is met I do not think it necessary to argue it any further.  But I say this much further.  Let us assume <Col N="1363" /> the position is not as clear as that, and that there is doubt whether the money is due, or whether the London, Midland and Scottish ought to be repaid that money.  I suggest to the Seanad that the one way of making certain that the Great Southern Railway Company will fight its corner properly, and will not give away its concessions is to make them defend their own hand, and not by giving them a promise to indemnify them in any loss they may incur.  If there is to be a discussion it is for the Great Southern Railway Company to make sure that if they give any concessions they must get payment in return; that they must get the best of the bargain, and that the company will not pay a halfpenny unless it owes the money, and consequently, cannot get out of paying it.  I suggest seriously that to accept this amendment is really to invite the Great Southern Railway not to bother its head about the matter but to give the London, Midland and Scottish just what it asks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister agreed with Senator Comyn that the London, Midland and Scottish have no right to recover this money, then the Minister would be quite right in his attitude.  But the Minister seems to say that they may have a right to recover the money and that the only way to make a better fight is to make the Great Southern Railways fight for their own skin and not pay.  I would like, before entering into a scrap, to get a guarantee that if I do my best, and use every legal remedy to avoid paying, then, that if I should lose in spite of doing my best, the State will pay my costs.  That is all this amendment of Senator Sir John Keane means.  I think it is rather hard not to trust the railway company to defend the suit.  I believe they will do so to the best of their ability.  But if they do their best they should be given a guarantee that if the action taken against them succeeds, they should not be compelled to pay the money.  If there is any justice in the law, which, I suppose, Senator Comyn will admit, they will have a verdict against them of <Col N="1364" /> a lawful nature, and they will only be paying a legal liability for which they became liable because of this Act.  If that state of affairs arises, I do think that the State which puts that liability on them ought to stand behind them and pay them.  This is a measure not for the railway company alone.  This measure is also put forward because we all believe that we should keep that railway company, and that the time has not arrived to scrap it.  Knowing that, the State should recognise that it has some liability, and I think that Senator Sir John Keane's amendment meets the case.  I think that the Minister ought to consider seriously whether he could not in some way or another get some sort of understanding on the matter.  He may call the tune as much as he likes, and see how much the railway company ought to pay, but if the company is beaten in an action I think the State should bear the loss, where the loss has been due entirely to the action of the State.</P>

      <P>Even if the £100,000 has to be paid, I still maintain that it is not due to the action of the State. It appears that it was due to be paid at six months' notice, at any time from which the notice was given, and whatever doubt there was about that was obviously removed by the fact that the agreement itself terminated in January of this year.  The agreement was for 30 years, and after January of this year the liability of the company to pay whatever that liability may have been, became a liability to pay on demand.  That was the position, and that will continue to be the position, whether this Act is repealed or not.  The London, Midland and Scottish Company may not insist on repayment.  But if they are going to insist upon whatever legal claim they may have now, there is no reason to assume that they would not follow precisely the same course if this Bill had never been introduced.  This is shown as a liability on the accounts of the company and if they have to meet it it is not in consequence of any action we are taking.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, can that be quite right? <Col N="1365" /> They have never meddled so far, as long as they had a director on the Board, and judging from past experience, if he was left there, there would be no question of the London, Midland and Scottish Company taking any proceedings whatever.  It is because of his removal that one can see the London, Midland and Scottish Company taking action, and the director is removed by an Act of the State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot argue the legal position.  I am only arguing that the taking away of their right to have a director on the Board will tend to make the London, Midland and Scottish Company take action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help feeling that in this discussion there is more of legal subtlety or legal sophistry than of plain commonsense.  My point is that by the repeal of this Railways (Directorate) Act there is a definite breach of contract which enables the company to sue for and demand the payment of this £100,000, and, if the Great Southern Company refuses to pay, to take whatever steps the law allows to recover the money; and which enables it also, owing to this breach of agreement, to withdraw the concessions which the railway company value at £20,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pursuing this point, if I may, for one moment, I hold in my hand the Railways (Directorate) Act, 1924, in which the matter is stated in extraordinary terms, and I suggest in quite different terms from those of an ordinary Act of Parliament.  It begins: &ldquo;Whereas,&rdquo; and then recites the history of how that agreement was made in 1904 between the London and North-Western Railway Company and the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Company, giving them the right to nominate a director and goes on to say that by reason of certain concessions, allowances, and advantages being granted the right to nominate a director cannot be conferred on the London, <Col N="1366" /> Midland and Scottish Railway Company without the authority of Parliament and hereby gives that authority. I am sure that Senator Comyn, with his legal acumen will tear that to pieces; but as a layman it seems to me that the whole thing was interlocked in return for the £100,000 originally given, which conferred the right to nominate a director.  The right to nominate a director in return for these concessions is continued by this Act and when the State steps in and deprives one party of the right to nominate, I, as a layman, would say that there was a breach of contract. That may be a matter for the courts and all we ask is that, if the company has to foot the bill on account of the repeal of the Railways (Directorate) Act, 1924, the State should make good the loss.  I think that is only fair and equitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a matter of law I do not like to be misquoted.  What I said was that the original agreement, whereby the Irish company undertook to put on their directorate a nominee of the London and North-Western Railway Company, became impossible of performance long before 1924 and was, therefore, of no effect.  Now, that I am right is proved by the preamble which Senator Sir John Keane has quoted, because he says, referring to what had taken place in previous years that the preamble goes on to say: &ldquo;And whereas this matter cannot be done without the consent of Parliament&rdquo;&mdash;that is, without an Act of Parliament&mdash;which proves conclusively that what I said originally was quite correct.  I said nothing at all about £100,000.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Railways (Directorate) Act of 1924 and the preamble, I would just point out that, while the right is conferred by the Act, that is to say the new company&mdash;the Great Southern Railways Company&mdash;is empowered by the Act to perform certain things, the agreement entered into between that company and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company was not in reference to the £100,000 at all; it was in reference to certain concessions, allowances and advantages, including special proportions in division of receipts and so <Col N="1367" /> on; but it had no reference to a loan of £100,000.</P>

      <P>I was merely supporting what Senator Johnson had said: that the agreement referred to in the preamble of the Railways (Directorate) Act, 1924 is an agreement made in 1924 between the Great Southern Railways and the London, Midland and Scottish: an agreement which has relation to these &ldquo;concessions, allowances and advantages&rdquo; stated to have been given before 1924 to the old Dublin and South-Eastern Railway Company and to be continued under the agreement for the benefit of the Great Southern Railways.  I do not know if, in 1924, those responsible took it for granted that &ldquo;concessions, allowances and advantages&rdquo; were in fact being given, or if anybody has taken the trouble to ascertain whether the &ldquo;concessions, allowances and advantages&rdquo; were in such a form that the change in circumstances between 1924 and 1933 has wiped them out.  I do know that when I endeavoured to ascertain what the concessions were and how this figure of £20,000 was arrived at, I could not get any satisfactory explanation.  Certain lists of figures were given me which did not seem capable of bearing examination as representing concessions to the extent of £20,000.  I suggest, again, in this matter that if the Great Southern Railways are enjoying concessions to the extent of £20,000 a year they should be able to say how without asking the London, Midland and Scottish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in view of the fact that it is the declared policy of the Government to depend to an increasing extent on home production and home markets, the Seanad requests the Executive Council to institute a public inquiry as to the form of agriculture that is best calculated to ensure the prosperity of that industry in the altered circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must apologise to the House for the circumstances which make it necessary for members to hear so much of my voice, but I think the House will agree that it is better to get this motion dealt with now.  As the House is probably aware, I am not one of those who believe in regulation, but, on the other hand, I am not a doctrinaire, and, when circumstances alter, I am quite prepared to accommodate myself to circumstances and it is on account of altered circumstances that this motion stands on the Paper.  Hitherto, speaking very generally, agriculture has been left to develop spontaneously, according to the experience of those engaged in the industry, according to natural conditions, according to what some would say is a rather undesirable motive of profit and cupidity but there it is.  That has been the way in which the bulk of this vast industry of this country has been built up without any direct method, by what we might call the ordinary force of private enterprise, people seeking a living and seeking profit.  I claim that that system has stood the storm well. While the whole world was economically depressed up to a short time ago, this country was comparatively fortunate. The people were not rich, but there was no very great measure of distress.  The bulk of our population, living and depending upon the land, <Col N="1373" /> got a livelihood somehow.  They escaped the starvation and hardship which came more directly and acutely on those living in populous centres. Under these circumstances, we reached a position, where, according to the official statistics, 33 per cent. of our produce was consumed by our own agricultural population and 18 per cent. was consumed by our non-agricultural population.  I ask you to bear in mind, in view of the increasing desire for greater home consumption, that only 18 per cent. of our output was consumed by our nonagricultural population.  Forty-nine per cent of our output was exported. This represents a large amount of capital development, traditional experience and the accumulated wisdom of the ordinary, plain people struggling to live and to progress.  In the year 1932, there came a very distinct break with the past.  Suddenly&mdash; almost without any warning&mdash;there came a steep drop in the volume of our export of agricultural goods.  In 1931, we exported roughly £31,000,000 worth of agricultural produce and, in 1932, that figure was reduced to about £22,000,000&mdash;a drop of nearly one-third.  I need hardly say that that one-third is by no means represented by the fall in prices.  It is largely due to a decrease in the volume of exports.  The full effect of this drop has been mitigated to a certain extent by State aid&mdash;by bounties, price regulation, as in the case of butter, and other reliefs.  The full measure of that decrease has been, to a certain extent, deferred.  I estimate the losses due to this unfortunate change in circumstances&mdash;some people call it the economic war, but I do not want to get on to controversial ground &mdash; at the very conservative figures: capital loss in stock, £10,000,000; annual loss of income, about £7,500,000.  Of course, such an estimate must be, to a certain extent, guesswork, but I do suggest that my estimate is conservative.  These are losses which, owing to the change, the farmers had to bear and which they are bearing now with great difficulty and with great hardship.  I think that it is only right that we, in our responsible positions, and students <Col N="1374" /> of politics should have serious regard to this situation and not be satisfied with the old policy of letting things develop on natural lines.  This whole break has come about by direct intervention and is the outcome of regulation and definite State action.  If it was the natural outcome of economic depression and there was no definite human agency involved, no definite State agency responsible, I should say: &ldquo;Let things go on as they are.&rdquo;  But there is an artificial element in the situation and it has to be regarded as such.  In examining the question as to what is to be done, we have to bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>Obviously the first thing to be done is to get back to the position in which we were a year ago, when we were not penalised in our chief export market, when we had bargaining power equal to that of other competing countries, when we enjoyed goodwill and when we had every prospect of getting preferential treatment.  That, I submit, is the first thing to do&mdash;to secure, what is generally termed, the recovery of our markets.  But I rather doubt that that will be sufficient.  Our chief customer, Great Britain, is being driven more and more along the same lines as we are going&mdash;along the lines of self-sufficiency.  The very fact that these unfortunate circumstances have excluded our produce from that market has whetted the appetite of agriculturists in that country for a maintenance, in spirit if not in form, of the present conditions.  Whether we like it or not, agricultural policy in Great Britain has changed and, to an increasing extent, the policy of self-sufficiency that we are following here is likely to be followed there.  I suggest that agriculture will be protected there in an increasing measure to the detriment of our export trade. Moreover&mdash;this is unfortunate, because it is within our own power to remedy it&mdash;we are losing daily the advantage of bargaining with our best customer. While we, owing to our unfortunate conduct, have to stand aside, we see import quotas of agricultural produce being granted to the sister-Dominions, to Denmark, to the Argentine and, I think, also to some Scandinavian <Col N="1375" /> countries.  That is exceptionally unfortunate, but it is a factor in the situation that we cannot ignore. Continuing our line of thought, what is to be done?  I suggest that this matter must be examined dispassionately, apart from political prejudice, and apart from the short view.  It is a big national question, not a Party question.  Here is our main industry really in great peril.  Unfortunately the tendency is to look at it from the sectarian point of view.  Senator Comyn said that the day of the bullock, of grass, of the man and the dog are gone.  That is not a statesmanlike view.  It is very nice to say that the bullock, the dog, and the man closing a gate, means disservice to the State.</P>

      <P>That was more or less the spirit of what the Senator said.  Senator Johnson, with a much more consistent point of view, takes the line that production should be regarded in the light of service.  There is no question of the pocket.  People should be made, in his view, to produce if it is for the good of the community.  How that is to be I do not know.  I suggest that is not the point of view from which to examine the question.  Again, there are the industrialists who say that if a market for home manufactures is built up population will follow, and that the population will have the power of consuming the surplus.  That sounds very nice.  But, again, we cannot take generalisation.  Matters want close examination to see at what speed that consummation will be reached, or to see if ever there is any possible form of growth of industrial population likely to provide a market for our exportable surplus.  This matter should not be examined or settled piecemeal.  I suggest that much of the present policy is merely palliative, <Col N="1376" /> following the lines of least resistance, staving off the emergency, with no real thought of what is going to happen next year, or even within a few months.  All this policy of bounties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Senator's very interesting speech, but I suggest that he accepted the position as regards the home market and home production being the policy of the Government, and that that precludes him from arguing on the economic war or the economic policy pursued subsequent to it.

      <P>That in view of the fact that it is the declared policy of the Government to depend to an increasing extent on home production and home markets.</P>
      <P>The Senator invited an inquiry to show whether that home market and home production can do better&mdash;<i>qua</i> home production, <i>qua</i> home market.

      <P>I am afraid my mind is not sufficiently metaphysical to appreciate these differences.  What I was trying to lead up to was what our line of policy should be for the future, in view of the altered circumstances.  I am suggesting that industry cannot be satisfied by bounties and price regulations, that they are merely palliatives, following the line of least resistance, taking out of one pocket and putting into another.  The only permanent line must be to assist producers.  I emphasise that because our circumstances are different to other countries. We have no great resources in industrial wealth.  If, as in England, agriculture was a minor industry here, and if our industrial wealth was very great, we might easily&mdash;as we are doing in the Gaeltacht&mdash;draw upon the wealth of the general community to <Col N="1377" /> subsidise the minor industry.  It is the reverse here.  Agriculture is the major and the predominant industry, and you cannot preserve it by feeding it merely on its own fat.  Agriculture cannot be spoon-fed, as I suggest the Gaeltacht is.  The Budget shows the writing on the wall, and gives cause for very considerable anxiety in that respect. The problem needs calm and deliberate study.  We should examine to what extent exports can replace imports.  I have done so very generally.  I do not think it can be done, merely by the cursory examination I have given it. On the face of it the problem looks very formidable.  We exported produce value for £30,000,000 in 1931.  If we were, practically, to substitute all possible imports with home-grown produce, at the most, I can only see that represented by £10,000,000 out of the £30,000,000.  Conceivably if we imported no wheat whatever, no maize, no fruit and no vegetables, that might represent £10,000,000 out of the exportable surplus, but there still remains an exportable surplus value for £20,000,000.  What is to be done with that?  That, I suggest, is a problem for serious consideration.  It is no answer to suggest that production should be decreased, or that produce value for £20,000,000 should not be produced at all.  I am afraid that would merely mean what some people have prophesied under the new policy, a lower standard of living, and a general fall in the volume of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we should examine the possibility of increasing consuming power. No doubt if our agricultural and industrial policies are a great success, and if wealth grows, purchasing power accumulates to a certain extent, but I suggest to a very small extent, and only at a very distant time will that factor go very far towards satisfying the difficulty of dealing with exportable surplus.  Then we have to examine whether, under the new circumstances, the present form of agriculture practised is the correct one, whether stock raising should possibly not give way, and be replaced by more intensive forms of agriculture and horticulture, and to see to what extent the gap <Col N="1378" /> could be made good by the development of forestry and the replacement of foreign imported fuel by peat.  I am merely outlining the magnitude and the difficulty of the problem, and I am suggesting that it is not one which can be dealt with in terms of political shibboleths, party cries, mere hand to mouth palliatives, or easy artifices of that kind.  It is a very big problem, and, on the face of it, to me it is insoluble, except along the disastrous lines of a slackening of the volume of production, and a lower standard of living.  But I do not wish to take that despairing view, and I suggest that the whole problem is one of national importance, which should be examined scientifically and fully by competent people.  It should not be examined from the party or from the political point of view, or by politicians.  We should get&mdash;I do not like the word&mdash; some independent people, accustomed to economic study, accustomed to handling statistics, with a general knowledge of what is possible in agriculture, to see whether one form of agriculture could conceivably replace another.  In fact it involves the whole future of agriculture in our national economy.</P>
    <P>I framed the motion on very general lines.  I would like to suggest that somebody outside this country should be called in to examine this problem. We have had ample precedent for that.  The reason I make that suggestion is that I am afraid anybody we would call upon in this country would be suspect in some quarter or other. In the case of our electrical industry, when we wished for a big development we called in foreigners, received their opinions and acted on their advice.  I do not say that we should necessarily act on their advice in what is now before us; but we should at least get the best opinions we can. I feel strongly that some inquiry on the lines suggested is overdue.  I would never have moved this motion if normal conditions continued, if markets were more or less free, if trade flowed in its old accustomed channels and if those engaged in the industry were allowed to develop naturally on the basis of their traditional <Col N="1379" /> practice and experience.  Everything has been altered.  Some of the changes may be only temporary, but they have had a devastating effect. There are other changes which I fear are permanent and will sooner or later force upon us altered methods.  The whole problem can only be approached after full and careful inquiry, and it is for that reason that I move this motion.</P>

      <P>We all know the reason for the altered conditions of farming.  We all know that nothing can be done to ensure the prosperity of farming in this country while these altered conditions remain.  What can we learn from a public inquiry that we do not already know?  For those reasons I oppose the motion now proposed. What can be produced in this country that we are not already producing in abundance?  We produce five times as many cattle as we require in the home market; we produce three times as many sheep, and the same applies to horses, pigs, poultry, eggs and practically all classes of agricultural produce.  We had a market for surplus produce at our door and in that market we had a ten per cent. preference.  We threw all that away and we are now exporting with practically 100 per cent. of a tariff on most of our produce.  When we call attention to those facts we are called traitors and are told we are playing England's game.  I say it is the Government and the Government's supporters who are playing England's game.  It is the Government and their supporters who are traitors to this country, because they have taxed the country out of existence in order to produce cheap food for Britain and to produce, at the same time, some revenue.  By their methods they have helped to put the British farmer on his feet to build up his industry to the detriment of our own farmers.</P>

      <P>In 1931 we exported £30,000,000 worth of produce.  On a big percentage of that £30,000,000 worth of produce we had a ten per cent. preference.  I am sure that if the Government went the proper way about it at the Ottawa Conference we would have a ten per cent. preference on the whole of the produce exported. If we take a ten per cent. preference on the whole of the produce it would mean £3,000,000, and that represents the whole of the land annuities. Instead of that, we are paying on the majority of our exports a tariff of practically 100 per cent.  The country is going out of production.  We cannot produce for export under the present tariffs.  The best grazing land in the country, at least a big percentage of it, is lying derelict.  Senator Comyn attributes that to causes other than the depression in the cattle trade.  His case was that there is a conspiracy amongst the Meath graziers not to buy cattle, and to let the small farmers who produce the stores suffer the loss. The Senator mentioned being at a fair <Col N="1381" /> in Kilfenora, and he heard Meath graziers saying there: &ldquo;We cannot buy because this tariff is on.&rdquo;  Senator Comyn said he bought some cattle at the fair.  I can assure him that if he sells them now it will be easy to count the profit.  All this tends to show the foolish statements that are being made by irresponsible people who claim to represent the farming industry and the cattle trade in this country.  I have never been in Kilfenora, although I have been at most fairs in Ireland.</P>

I agree with Senator Counihan in that. I also agree with Senator Sir John Keane that, as this subject has been broached at all, it ought to be considered calmly, dispassionately, and that fair play, if possible, should be given to every person in this country. But I deny that the question for solution is the question set down in Senator Sir John Keane's motion.  The question for solution in this country is how best to provide for the people of this country.  What are you going to do with the 20,000 or 30,000 young people who are growing up?  What are you going to do with these young people, the surplus that is not exportable at the present moment?  Senator Sir John Keane said that in times past agriculture had been allow to pursue its normal course.  I deny that agriculture in this country was ever allowed to pursue its normal course.

These lands were cleared of the people living on them without the consent of the people.  That was the first part of the conquest.  The conquest that was thought most desirable was the conquest of the rich lands of the country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Take another part of the question.  When industrialism started in England it became desirable to produce agricultural commodities here for the English market.  In the district between Ballinasloe and the Clare border the whole country was cleared in the last century in order to create large farms.  Was that done with the consent of the unfortunate people living on the land?  What is the problem before us?  The problem is to proceed as best we can for the good of the people of this country on the fairest terms that are possible. How is that to be done?  How is employment to be secured?  I do think it is by the policy which the Minister has sponsored, the policy of more cultivation of the soil.  I think that a greater cultivation of the soil can be secured by smaller farms and by the purchase of these large tracts of land and the settling of the people upon them.  That is a problem which I would not be inclined to leave to any specialist, foreign or domestic, or to any statisticians.  I say that because it is a problem which, if not solved on fair and reasonable terms to everybody, the people of Ireland will solve for themselves.  I have great distrust of these statisticians.  I do accept for the purpose of my own argument the statistics given by Senator Sir John Keane, but, speaking generally, I think statistics are very misleading, and particularly statistics quoted by a professor.  I think it is within the knowledge of everybody that a certain professor stated that the agricultural population of Limerick is greater per acre than the agricultural population of Wexford, <i>ergo</i>, dairying provides for more people than tillage. Now these are statistics, and that is the conclusion that is drawn from these statistics, but the professor evidently did not know or certainly did not advert to the fact that an acre of land in Limerick, even in <Col N="1384" /> grass, is able to produce five times as much as an acre of land in Wexford.</P>

We have an increasing population.  The outlet which we had in former times for that population is no longer available.  The people are here in growing numbers, growing not <Col N="1385" /> in arithmetical progression but in geometrical progression.  What is to be done?  Are they to get employment? I should say that everybody will agree that they are, if possible. In the years immediately in front of us how is that employment to be secured?  My solution, and I am sure it is the solution of every man who looks at this dispassionately, is that the great source of employment is the soil of Ireland&mdash;by tillage on the farms as they are at present constituted and by creating small farms, on every one of which there will be some tillage.</P>

      <P>If we can deal with what we have as a surplus at present, seeing the markets that are available, it will be quite easy for us to deal with the increased surplus, if we have it. The Senator admits that, under this system of small farming, we shall have an increased and an increasing surplus, because we shall have more tillage, and we shall have employment for our people.  I would invite Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Counihan to consider that problem fairly and dispassionately and without any party spirit, and see how a change can be brought about on fair terms to everybody. One thing I should like to say in conclusion is that I, for one, am not in favour of disturbing any vested tenant right where that right existed, and I am certain that that is not, and never will be, the policy of this <Col N="1386" /> country.  Where the tenant right existed, I think it ought to be respected, and I am sure it will be.  I might, however, remind Senator Counihan that that tenant right never did exist in the large grazing tracts, which are now practically useless to this country and its people.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the motion for an inquiry as to how far the system of agriculture can be altered and should be altered in the present circumstances.  I have not the slightest doubt that an independent inquiry would reveal that this system has been evolved in the brains of muddle-headed theorists who know very little about it, who have no practical knowledge of agriculture, and who have rushed this devastating policy on the country with very little consideration as to the results for the unfortunate people.  For that reason, I should like to see an inquiry.  If people who have experience, and who know something of economics, above all practical intelligent farmers, can be brought before a tribunal and their evidence published, I believe it would have a very good effect.  A large number of people, who do not study statistics or economics, were induced to back up the Government who set out this very rosy programme before them without giving them any indication of what the results of that policy might be.</P>
      <P>Senator Comyn made some extraordinary statements.  Of course his history is altogether wrong with regard to the land question.  In the great confiscation that took place in the past only the large landholder was dealt with.  The Cromwellian confiscation is the principal one and in that only the great landholder was disturbed.  The tiller of the soil was not disturbed.  He is wrong altogether in his history as to the origin of the land question in Ireland. He is also wrong in backing up the idea that if you sweep the cattle off the land and only produce food for the people you are going to promote tillage.  He is wrong about Wexford and Limerick, as I can prove very easily.  I can justly claim that the farmers of Wexford are the best tillage farmers in Ireland.</P>

Wexford, as a matter of fact, has almost every kind of land that you could imagine.  I myself possess a heavy clay soil which takes a great deal of hard labour to cultivate.  The district of New Ross possesses a shingly soil which is easily cultivated.  Senator O'Hanlon can tell us about that. Around Enniscorthy there is land of an entirely different kind.</P>

      <P>I want to give one instance to refute Senator Comyn's contention that merely growing food for the whole population will provide more tillage.  I shall take a concrete example of a neighbour of mine who employs six labourers.  He lays down so much land under oats.  The people cannot eat all the oats.  Everybody who has tilled land knows that in the rotation where you have grown oats you must grow green crops to clean the land.  Are the people going to eat these hundreds of acres of turnips and mangels?</P>

      <P>If you are tilling land you must have some turnips after corn in proper rotation.  Senator Comyn knows nothing about tillage or the proper rotation of crops.  Take this neighbour of mine who keeps six labourers and works very hard on the farm himself, as well as two brothers. This is an actual, and not an imaginary example.  His system was to grow all the food for his household, as far as possible, and to grow a very great deal <Col N="1388" /> for cattle.  It is not a very large farm, but he stall-fed a large number of cattle this year.  The cattle that would have sold for £22 per head last year realised £12 per head this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If the export of cattle is prohibited and if that man has to depend on the home market, he cannot produce half or quarter the number of cattle.  What is he going to do?  He is going to go out of tillage. That means that so much land is going out of tillage and that so many more men will be unemployed.  As a matter of fact, that man is reducing his staff. Instead of keeping six men he is keeping now only three, because his export market has been cut off.  The thing is all wrong from beginning to end. It was begun at the wrong end.  That is one concrete example of what will happen if you cut off the export market.  An inquiry will prove these things.  We can gather statistics such as these concrete examples and prove to the people that it is impossible, even with a population three times greater than we have now, to till the land and give employment, without an export market.  The land of Ireland can never be tilled to any extent if we are to depend on the home market. You cannot grow wheat without growing green crops.  You must have a proper rotation.  Otherwise how are you going to clean your land?  To a practical farmer the thing is childish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more cattle you have the more tillage you must have, but of necessity there must always be a considerable amount of land in grass.  Grass is the best of foods.  No farmer, let him be the best that ever was born, can produce food which is as good as grazing for animals.  You cannot carry on a system where you have all tillage. Even if you had a population of 8,000,000 you must have a great deal of land under grass in Ireland.  There is a considerable amount of land which any economist would think it a sin to till because by tilling it he would not produce food as good as that provided by the grass on it.  There is other land <Col N="1389" /> which it would be better to till.  Much of the land of Wexford is tillage land and will not produce grass.  The people in these areas could carry on tillage, but I protest that by doing away with the cattle trade, by seeking to confine the cattle trade to the home market and cutting off the export market, you are going to reduce tillage in the country. I could give many examples where that has happened as a result of the Government policy.  That is why I support the demand for an inquiry because I am perfectly certain that what I am saying now could be proved at that inquiry, and that that inquiry would result in having these facts put before the people.  These facts would come to the knowledge of a great many people through this inquiry who do not think about them at all now.</P>
    <P>At the last fair in Wexford, in the Minister's own constituency &mdash; this is touching on the economic war, I suppose, but it is interesting&mdash;the number of cattle sold there involved a loss to the pockets of the farmers in that one corner of £6,000.  That is at one fair alone.  If there was never an economic war there would not be a market in this country for that number of cattle, proportionately I mean.  There could not be a home market in this country for that number of cattle.  I am taking that one instance to illustrate my point.  The loss on the number of cattle sold from that one corner of the County Wexford calculated at a loss of £6 per head &mdash; they were all of the class which would be liable to the £6 tariff&mdash; was £6,000.  If you have not an export market, economic war or no war, the price for cattle must be very low.  The home market would never pay a price higher than what we are getting even with the economic war, and perhaps not so much, as the home market could not absorb all our cattle.  I support the motion because I should like to have the matter inquired into and would like to have statistics about it. I should like to have it proved.  It is all theory at present.  The theories of muddle-headed people are being inflicted on the country to our terrible loss.  Even if the economic war were ended to-morrow, there would not be <Col N="1390" /> a market in this country for all the cattle produced here.  I repeat that even if you had a population of 8,000,000 you would not have that market.  The inquiry suggested is an entirely different thing to that suggested in the motion we had last week.  There is no comparison at all between them.  I could go on, but the discussion is so strictly limited that we cannot very well go into the effects of the policy of the Government. All we can ask is how a home market is going to increase tillage in the country and increase the population. It cannot be done.  If an inquiry can show more clearly than the few words we can say here that it cannot be done, I should welcome the inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word or two in commendation of the way in which Senator Sir John Keane introduced his motion.  In the main, I am inclined to support his point of view. I think his motion is mistaken in so far as it asks for a public inquiry and I think it would have been better if his proposal had enlarged the field of inquiry to include industry in general. The Senator has given his opinion that in the circumstances something in the nature of a planned agricultural economy is necessary.  I have been of opinion for a long time that not only a planned agricultural policy to effect a preconceived purpose is necessary but a planned industrial policy also.  I do not think that a public inquiry of the kind Senator Miss Browne has indicated is going to produce the practical results that I conceive Senator Sir John Keane is aiming at.  I appreciate that he is not endeavouring to make a case for or against the Government's present policy.  He recognised that changes have taken place in the world irrespective of the changed fiscal relations between England and Ireland and that these changed circumstances make it obligatory in the interests of the country that there should be an inquiry into our agricultural economy.  That is a sound argument and deserves consideration. Senator Comyn derided statistics and he has some justification for deriding statistics as they are carelessly used.  I would like him to <Col N="1391" /> ask himself in the calm of the evening how is the Government of this country to carry on, and have any policy at all, unless it has some statistics to guide it?</P>
      <P>Both Senator Sir John Keane, and Senator Miss Browne, who supported his motion, seemed in the argument to suggest that if we can only get back to the position that existed before June of last year and the situation that prevailed at that time, then things would be right for agriculture. No less an authority on agriculture than Deputy Mulcahy, with all the authority of an ex-Minister, is reported as having said on Sunday last: &ldquo;The Minister for Industry and Commerce declared last week the Government policy would not be satisfied unless they supported as many people on Irish land as they did in Denmark, but those who know most about it in the Minister's own Department have already told us that the policy of the Irish farmer supports on every 1,000 acres of land 61 permanent workers for every 56 that the Dane is able to support on his.  Meanwhile, the policy which enables us to support that population, such as it is, is being scrapped.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy went on to denounce the Government's policy.  But Deputy Mulcahy was quoting statistics, and the inference he drew was that the Irish farmer had evolved a policy that was the best that could be operated in this country.  He quoted statistics prepared in the Department of Agriculture at one end, and the statistics branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce at the other.  I want to suggest that it would have been better, more honest, and, certainly, a better guide if he had gone a little further into the Department of Agriculture statistics.  When he gives these figures for the Free State and Denmark he was quoting from the Agricultural Returns Statistics Volume, published a few years ago. That, by the way, gives the figures for 1912 and compared them with those of Denmark for 1923.  If he had really made enquiries and taken the figures for 1926, which were available, and compared these figures with <Col N="1392" /> Denmark in 1932, he would have found that a 1,000 acres of land in this country maintained 55 persons against 56 in Denmark.  That is to say, that there was a decline from 1912 to 1926 in the number of permanent workers maintained in the land in Ireland from 61 to 55, but that is by the way.  The point is that these very statistics, that Deputy Mulcahy was quoting, showed that the total number of workers per 1,000 acres &mdash; crops and pastures &mdash; on small farms in the Saorstát of from one to 15 acres was 180, compared with 127 in Denmark.  On farms of 15 to 20 acres the figures were 100 in the Saorstát against 80 in Denmark.  On farms of from 30 to 50 acres, 69 persons in the Saorstát against 67 in Denmark; on farms from 100 to 200, the numbers in the Saorstát 30, as against 45 in Denmark, showing that the small farms in this country are bearing a very much higher number of persons per 1,000 acres, and a very much larger proportion than the small farms in Denmark are asked to bear. But the larger farms in Denmark bear a very much higher proportion of persons than in this country.  For instance, on farms of from 100 to 200 acres 45 persons per 1,000 acres are employed in Denmark and in the Saorstát only 30.  Farms of from 200 to 500 acres carry 34 persons in Denmark as against 19 in the Saorstát. The inference from that is that the methods of agriculture in Denmark, which the Deputy was endeavouring to suggest, show a far smaller number of persons per 1,000 acres than the methods of agriculture operating in this country; but the methods of agriculture operating in this country led to over-crowding on the poorer, and to under-crowding on the better lands in this country relative to the comparative conditions in Denmark.</P>
    <P>He might also have got other statistics kept by the same Department that show that the percentage of output per worker in Denmark was £196 as against £96 in the Saorstát.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not finished on that point but I think it is appropriate <Col N="1393" /> to the subject.  What seems to be the aim is the production of commodities consumed at home on a larger degree than at present.  Senator Sir John Keane clearly and frankly recognises that quite apart from present contentions &mdash; to use a mild word &mdash; between Great Britain and Ireland, affecting agricultural produce, a change has taken place in world economy and possibly, I do not know how far he went, but I shall limit it to that word possibly, even if everything between the two countries was settled amicably it would still be impossible to get back to the position which existed say ten years ago.  I think it is necessary to draw attention to the fact that as between 1929-30 and 1931-32 before the present difficulties arose, there was a drop in the agricultural output of this country from £55,000,000 to £42,000,000.  That was not a decline in volume but a decline in values.  The value of the export agricultural produce was a declining one, and a rapidly declining one, quite apart from any change in the ordinary relations.  I wonder does anybody think to-day that it can be said, confidently, that the price position in the world has reached its lowest level, and that it is inevitably bound to improve.  I doubt it.  We may say there are possibilities, first, after the World Economic Conference has concluded, that the situation in Britain, and in this country, will gradually revert to the position that existed before 1929, before the big slump in values began.  That is one position: that things will revert to the state that existed in 1929.  The second is the probable one, that Britain may follow a policy such as Senator Sir John Keane suggested and recast her agricultural economy.  That is to say, she will have, of settled policy, changed her attitude towards agriculture and will endeavour to make Britain herself very much more self-dependent than she has even been before.  I suggest that that second outcome is a much more likely one even though the World Economic Conference achieves the greatest success of the most optimistic.  If that is the case, it is inevitably going to have a very big effect upon the economy of <Col N="1394" /> mately, no matter what happens, cannot get back to the position that Senator Miss Browne would so heartily desire, and that is the position of this country prior to 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is so, then there surely is a case made for an inquiry into the best form of agriculture and, as I would suggest, the best way to ensure the maximum output, and the best way of disposing of that output.  I for one believe, that we must get down to the roots of things in considering problems of this kind, and recognise the effort that the agriculturists make, while acting under the stimulus, superficially, of a market and a price for their produce in that market, are ultimately aiming at the production of foodstuffs for the maintenance of man.  Agriculture in this country ought to have as a definite, conscious object, the production of foodstuffs for the maintenance of the people in this country.  Undoubtedly, as everybody, with even the slightest and most cursory knowledge of agricultural conditions knows, agriculture in this country will produce far more than the people of this country are likely to consume for a very long time, and it is inevitable that there will have to be an export trade.  I make a present of the fact to Senator Miss Browne and others that that export trade, probably, will have to be in the main to Great Britain, but I suggest that the Minister has a right to consider this subject in the light that, having in mind all the circumstances, and having in mind everything that happened since 1916, the present situation as between Britain and Ireland will be a permanent one; that is to say, that there is never again going to be the same freedom of access to the British market that there has been in the past.  I think the Government policy should be founded upon a recognition of that as a probability.  I think that at the moment, up to now, they have recognised that that was a probability, but I think that the country's economy ought to begin with the conception that it is a probability. It may not eventuate that way.  It may be that we shall be able to find an outlet for a considerable proportion of our agricultural produce in the British <Col N="1395" /> this country, and the position ulti-market. If so, so much the better.  All the advantage will be with us if we begin with the assumption that there is not going to be any outlet in that direction.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that it is no use simply speaking of this as a problem of the organisation of agriculture.  It is immediately bound up with the organisation of industry in general. In fact, there is no sharp, defined line that may be drawn between the agricultural economy of this country, the industrial economy of the country, the politics of the country, and the general cultural development of the country.  That is all one big problem, and it cannot be cut into pieces or divided sharply, one part from another.  Therefore, I would say that the inquiry could not be confined rightly to the mere technique of agriculture, but has to have regard to the general purpose of agriculture and the general conception of national policy in all other respects.</P>
    <P>The fall in prices in Great Britain, and the fall in prices in the Free State was very steep indeed in 1929.  It has fallen still further since 1929; but if we got back to 1932 or if we got back to 1931 or even to 1929, does anybody claim or suggest that that would mean prosperity for Irish agriculture? Calamity had come to the country then and if there had been no difference of opinion on land annuities or on any other controversial subject with Great Britain, and if there had been no barrier against the import of Irish produce into the British market, a motion such as this would have been equally necessary.  An inquiry and a plan would have been necessary and a complete recasting of the agricultural economy of the country would have been desirable.  One can show, I think, very vividly, if one is not so much disposed to flout statistics as Senator Comyn is, that the position of the Irish agriculturist &mdash; of the farmer &mdash; in this country has been a deplorable one, so far as at least one half of the agricultural population is concerned, for quite a number of years.  I cannot, for myself, justify the maintenance in <Col N="1396" /> the cities of so large a proportion of people who are living at a much higher standard than so large a proportion of the agriculturists are capable of living. I think it is due to the agriculturists that there should be an inquiry into their position.  It is due to the agriculturists that, if the organised community, represented by the Oireachtas or by the Executive Council for the time being, requires that agriculture should produce live stock or grain crops or whatever it may be, they should receive a definite guarantee of a payment for their services to the community in the production of those goods.</P>
    <P>I said, I think, that the present Government policy is destined to fail unless it takes in hand the organisation of agriculture and the direction, by inducement, encouragement and guarantee, that agriculturists should follow in the pursuit of their calling.</P>
    <P>I do not believe if you leave to the free play of markets, the mere chance of an improvement in the price of pigs or a decline in the price of butter &mdash; the chance of fluctuations in the price of cattle and so on &mdash; that you are going to get the best output of agricultural produce.  I say that there ought to be a planned economy with a definite objective.  The State should say to the agriculturalists: &ldquo;We require so much of this, so much of that and so much of the other and we will pay you for it.&rdquo;  The State should take into its own responsibility the organisation of the export of such surplus as is necessary to be exported.  I think the Government will find, before it can bring its own present policy to successful fruition, that it will be bound to follow that direction.  It will be bound to undertake the export marketing of whatever surplus is available for export.  It will be bound, I suggest, to have some control of the kind of import that will be received in exchange for those exports, and to consciously plan, guide and direct the export and import trade of the country.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I believe that an inquiry, such as Senator Sir John Keane indicates is necessary, should be undertaken.  As I said I do not think a public inquiry would be of any value, but I do think it is essential, if the <Col N="1397" /> Government is to move forward with a definite, clearly understood objective that it should have a conscious plan to work out by the aid of the ablest economists, publicists, thinkers, statisticians and statesmen that it can get.  It is no use going along without a plan, with one section thinking in one direction and another section thinking in another direction.  For these reasons, and a good many more which I am not going to weary the House with, I would ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to the proposal for an inquiry into the form of agriculture that is best calculated to ensure the prosperity of that industry in the altered circumstances, and that the Government would couple with that best form of agriculture the best method for the disposal of the produce of the agriculturists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion there is a very sensible idea behind the motion moved by Senator Sir John Keane.  It is desirable, I think, that we should have something in the nature of an inquiry as to how those engaged in agriculture and the live-stock industry can be relieved from their present deplorable condition.  It is not necessary, I think, at this stage to discuss how the personnel of the committee making that inquiry should be constituted.  That would be a matter for the Government.  The intention behind the motion is good, and I do not think anybody could object to it.  In my opinion the Senator's proposal is a wise one.  I listened with a good deal of interest and, I confess, with a certain amount of amusement to some of the arguments put forward in the course of this debate, especially to the statistics that were given about the classes of stock reared and the form of agriculture pursued in certain parts of the country.  We heard a good deal to-day, too, about the history of the country.  An Irish poet has written:</P>
      <P>A time there was, ere England's griefs began,</P>
      <P>When every rood of ground maintain'd its man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> Princes and lords may flourish or may fade,</P>
    <P>A breath can make them, as a breath has made;</P>
    <P>But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,</P>
    <P>When once destroy'd, can never be supplied.</P>
    <P>I remember the time when the farmers of the country were subject to capricious eviction and when there was very little interest taken in the question of tenant right.  I remember well the way that situation was dealt with in South Tipperary, my native county.  I would be sorry to see a recurrence of what took place then. My friend, Senator Comyn, made a statement this evening which amused me a great deal.  He was speaking of tillage in his native County of Clare, which I know very well.  In my opinion you would not get ten acres of suitable tillage land in the whole of that county.  Between Lisdoonvarna and Ennis the land would grow little else than hazel nuts.  During the Great War people were compelled to till some of the rich lands of the country.  In my part people were obliged to till 20 acres of good rich land that is entirely unsuitable for tillage. It is only suitable for grazing and finishing cattle.  The people who were compelled to till these 20 acres of rich land suffered at least a loss of £200.  The corn grown on it had to be raked up and cut with a grass machine.  I think it is absurd to be telling people, who know their business, what they should do with their land.</P>
    <P>I think a good many who talk about increasing tillage and increasing the wealth of the country have very little practical knowledge of agriculture. I know some people who have nice bits of land attached to their homes and when their neighbours volunteered to plough it for them they refused the offer, preferring to keep a couple of calves on it.  So far as I can see, tillage is not going to be made fashionable nor do I think it is going to prove the El Dorado that some people imagine.  If the wealth of this country is to be restored, then, in my <Col N="1399" /> opinion, the way to do that is to give us back our home markets that we have been deprived of in the last year. That is the only hope I see of restoring agriculture and the live-stock industry to the position they were in a year or two ago.  If something is not done in that direction, then in my opinion the present situation will end in bankruptcy and rebellion, and that, perhaps, in a shorter time than some people imagine.  I might mention a matter that I have personal knowledge of.  We do business for a man who lived in this country.  On Saturday last we shipped 100 cattle for him to England. We had a wire to say that the cattle arrived all right, but that the tariff payable on the cattle on the other side was £564.  Senators can imagine what that meant to a man who wished to carry on trade with Ireland; 68 of the cattle were three year olds and on these a tariff of £6 per head had to be paid.  The others were two-year-olds and on these a tariff of £4 a head had to be paid.</P>
    <P>How can any man be expected to carry on trade with this country when you have a tariff of £564 in respect of 100 head of cattle?  I have a great deal of sympathy with Senator Sir John Keane's motion and I am sure that the Minister has every desire to promote the prosperity of the industry with which it seeks to deal.  He should, especially, be sympathetic to the views expressed by the lady Senator, Miss Browne, who represents his native county.  Every statement she makes is entitled to the fullest respect, coming, as it does, from an intelligent tillage farmer.  I should be glad to see a tribute paid to her industry and intelligence and, also, to the farmers of her county.  My sons know the county and they speak in the highest terms of it. It is hopeless to try to visualise what is going to be the position when you have men selling cattle £6 per head below what they normally got for them. The only thing that I can see is the eventual bankruptcy of the county councils.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that, for once, I was in agreement with Senator Sir John Keane, and I probably would have been were it not for one word in his motion&mdash;the word &ldquo;public.&rdquo;  The idea of a public inquiry into anything <Col N="1401" /> of this nature is absolutely ridiculous, in my opinion.  I did not hear Senator Sir John Keane's argument in support of his motion, and missed part of Miss Browne's speech in support of it, but, in regard to the part I did hear, all I can say is that, if Sir John Keane had not any more able support for his motion than Miss Browne, I am sorry for him.  The idea of holding a public inquiry is absurd.  As I understand, a public inquiry involves a sort of general invitation to everybody interested in the subject from all over the country to meet in Dublin.  It would appear to me that the people in the country are more interested in the agricultural industry than are the members of the Seanad, if we are to judge by the attendance here to-night. If any such invitation were issued, the only suitable place for the holding of this proposed inquiry would be the Phoenix Park.  Senator Miss Browne said that it was absolutely impossible for us in this country to consume the cattle produced here.  As I heard somebody criticising Senator Michael Comyn, I shall not mention any figures but if Senator Miss Browne will look up the statistics and find out the amount of beef, and meat generally, used by the people of England, Canada and various other countries, she will be convinced that we, with our increasing population, would have no trouble whatever in consuming the amount of beef produced here at present.  Senator Miss Browne laughs.  At present, I suppose she is eating only about the same amount of beef that she has eaten for a number of years.  It is probable that she has not felt the depression that we hear so much about.  I am sure she will agree with me when I say that, within the last 12 months, a number of people in this country have eaten meat once a day for the first time in their lives.  There is no reason why, under proper conditions and under a proper form of government, the people here should not eat more meat than they have been eating.  I do not for a moment suggest that we should not have any exports of beef from the country.  I believe we should have exports and I believe we <Col N="1402" /> should export a good many other things.  But I do say that we could increase our consumption of meat, regardless of what Senator Miss Browne says.</P>
      <P>I regard this motion as an attempt to placate a certain section of the people and that section could be very nicely described as &ldquo;die-hards&rdquo; or irreconcilables&mdash;people who refuse to be convinced that anything good can come from a Fianna Fáil Government. The present policy of the Government has brought about, as the motion admits, altered conditions.  If the motion had been brought on after we had had a year's trial of that changed policy, there might be some justification for it.  But the fact is that we have not got over one entire period yet and the results, so far as we have gone, indicate that that policy is going to be a success.  Underlying the speeches we have heard in support of this motion is the idea of embarrassing the Government.  Senator O'Connor comes out with that well-known slogan: &ldquo;Give us back our markets.&rdquo; Now, that kind of thing is being shouted at every cross-road in the country by a certain Party and the fact that it is associated with this motion convinces me in the belief I have already expressed, that this is an attempt to show that section in the country that something is being done for them in the Seanad, that some people are fighting their battles up here and doing their best to embarrass the Government.  If the people supporting this motion believe that by keeping this kind of thing going in the Seanad, in the Dáil, or anywhere else, they can embarrass the Government to such a pitch as to bring about the change of policy, I believe they are making a great mistake.  There can be no compromise on the attitude taken up by the Government, that the people of this country have the right to manage their own affairs in their own way.  The present policy of the Government was accepted by the people in two elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can assure Senator Quirke that I have no intention of trying to embarrass the Government. I should like to tell Senator Johnson that whether the statistics he quoted are his own or Deputy Mulcahy's they are no use to me.  I do not believe in statistics.  I know Ireland. I have travelled it from one end to the other.  I have lived in many parts of it.  The policy of the Government is to get us back to the land.  We were dealing with a Railway Bill to-day. We were putting the railways on wheels, as Senator Comyn said.  To get back to the land, we cannot use the railways because they are using imported coal.  Incidentally, the railways might try the Arigna stuff.  I think that is quite good.  The policy is to get us back to the land&mdash;to the 20 acre farm, which is to support a man, his wife and family.  That is a good policy if it works.  But Senator Comyn reminded us about the people between Ballinasloe and, I think, Ennistymon, who were removed without their consent.  I put it to Senator Comyn that if we are to remove the people from the cities back to the land, it will not be done with the consent of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty is to know, if we all clear back to the land, will we get the consent of the owners.  We will not.  Having farms of 20, 50, 100 or 200 acres&mdash;I do not think there are many with 300 acres&mdash;how many people will be able to work on the land?  Take the people in Dublin, wholesalers, retailers, middlemen, agents, shop assistants, and even cattle salesmen, how many of them would be able to work a 20 acre farm and to rear a family on it?  The same applies to carters, drovers, professional men and Senators.</P>

      <P>And golfers.  I will not include Deputies because someone must carry on the Government.  Suppose we all went back to these farms where would it end?  In my opinion it would end where we began about 300 years ago, with everyone living on 20 acre farms on which the people were then able to feed families.  In those days there were no such things as railways, pictures, motor cars and all the other things that everybody wants nowadays. The housing problem in Dublin is a very serious one.  People are taken out of tenements and at public expense &mdash;because grants have to be given and money borrowed&mdash;put into houses in Cabra, Marino and elsewhere, As soon as the tenements are vacant people come up from Tullamore or from Athlone and occupy them.  How is that to be stopped?  Some Senators mentioned dairying in the Golden Vale and compared it with wheat growing in Wexford.  The Seanad and the Department of Agriculture should leave these things to the farmers.  In the Golden Vale in Tipperary and Limerick it pays to produce milk and in Wexford it pays to produce wheat.</P>

      <P>In some parts of Wexford black oats pays better than white oats, but in the West of Ireland the people would not look at black oats.  These matters are best left to the people concerned.  The cattle business may be all right for Meath but it is wrong for the rest of the country.  I think Senator Sir John Keane's motion is in the right direction, and that we should have an inquiry so that the farmers would be told what sort of tillage suited the different localities.  Where farmers are accustomed to tillage it would be silly, even for the Department of Agriculture, to tell them whether they should grow wheat, black or white oats.</P>

      <P>I did not think this debate would be so extended, but would be confined, more or less, to dealing with the necessity for an inquiry.  I listened practically to the same debate previously. On three or four previous occasions I heard Senator Counihan make the same speech.  He made it on the Cereals Bill and also on the motion for the establishment of the pig tribunal.  In future I will know what the Senator is going to say no matter what is to be discussed.  Senator Miss Browne also made the same speech that she made previously, the only difference being that she took the opposite side to that taken by Senator Counihan.  Senator Miss Browne said that this motion is different to the one dealing with the setting up of the pig tribunal, and that this was the sort of inquiry that was necessary, while the other one was not necessary.  Why the same speech should be used to justify the two matters I cannot say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to Senator Johnson, and I agree practically with everything he said, including his conclusions, that we should deal with the marketing and export of our products and with our imports.  I agree with Senator Johnson that if a proper inquiry could be held into these questions it would be very useful.  When I saw this <Col N="1406" /> motion on the Order Paper I thought it was a reasonable one to come before the Seanad, because it is put in a very reasonable way and does not understate or overstate the policy of the Government.  It is true that it is the declared policy of the Government to depend to an increasing extent on home production and on home markets.  That was put fairly.  But when we have speakers departing from that, and taking it for granted that we do not want to have anything to do with the British, or with any other markets; that we are going to eat all the cattle in the country, it is hardly to be expected that anyone would pursue such an argument or try to answer it, as has been done here more than once.  Consequently I do not intend to go into it again.  If we have taken a certain line of policy that does not mean that we have said to Great Britain: &ldquo;We cannot have anything more to do with you, either buying or selling&rdquo;.  As Senator Johnson very well put it Great Britain is our neighbour, and that country is naturally the country with which we would trade under normal circumstances. Apart from that, we do not think we should buy the trade at a cost of £5,000,000 a year.  Hence our attitude on the economic war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Sir John Keane stated very fairly when introducing his motion, even if there was no economic war this case would probably arise. We do not hear that the farmers in the North of Ireland are perfectly satisfied with their condition.  They have all the advantages that we are told we would have if Fianna Fáil were put out of power, and if another Government came in.  Very often I have seen resolutions which were passed by farmers' committees, and at meetings of Farmers' Unions in the North of Ireland, protesting against the treatment they are getting from their own Government; also protesting against low prices, and pointing out that it was impossible for them to pay land annuities.  Evidently the farmers there are not as well off as they would like to be.  The same thing applies to many other countries.  Looking at it from that point of view, whether <Col N="1407" /> the economic war ever occurred or not, or whether it will be ever settled or not, the problem remains.  I think therefore there is a very good deal to be said for putting down this motion.  The real difficulty arises when you come to the details of it.</P>
    <P>The Seanad requests the Executive Council to institute a public inquiry as to the form of agriculture that is best calculated to ensure the prosperity of that industry in the altered circumstances.</P>
    <P>That is the problem most people are up against; to ensure the prosperity of the agricultural industry.  That problem is very acute in the United States, which is a powerful and a fairly self-contained country, where they have their home markets, and are not dependent, to any great extent, on exports.  Agriculture there is in a very depressed condition.  I do not think there is any European country in which agriculture can be said to be prosperous.  The problem we have to face is somewhat the same as every other country in the world has to face at the present time.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Sir John Keane that it would be absolutely hopeless to get a committee of inquiry formed from the different political parties, because we would never get any nearer a solution than we have got this evening.  Representatives of the different parties would state their political views, and, in quite a dogmatic way, would lay down the cause of the whole thing, without suggesting any remedy except the old parrot cry: &ldquo;Give us back our markets&rdquo;.  I am glad, at any rate, that it has not been suggested as a remedy, to select a committee from the Dáil or the Seanad or from the different political parties.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane believes that a committee formed of people from within the State would hardly be successful.  I do not know if they would.  No suggestion have been made by people who claim to be outside politics, if there are any such.  I do not believe there are, because almost everybody votes at elections <Col N="1408" /> and in that case they all must know something about politics.  There are people supposed to be non-political&mdash; people who do not support the Government sometimes say they are non-political-and to have something more of the economic mind.  They have not come forward with any useful remedies.  I am very doubtful if they could give us any remedy, even if they were put on a public inquiry.  Senator Sir John Keane suggests we should go outside the country in order to get the personnel of the commission of inquiry.  Much the same conditions exist everywhere.  If people were to come to me from France, Germany, Great Britain, America or elsewhere and suggest they were suitable people for this inquiry I would naturally ask them why they did not solve the difficulties in their own lands first. The real difficulty is to get people likely to offer a solution.</P>
    <P>I do not see any objection to the passing of a resolution requesting the Executive Council to consider this matter.  I am sure the Executive Council would have no objection; but if I were to tell my colleagues there that I had listened to a debate in the Seanad and I was of the opinion that we should consider this matter they would ask me what I proposed.  What could I propose?  If I say a committee must be set up, they will ask me what persons I would appoint on that committee and what suggestions in that respect were made by the Seanad.  I am afraid I would have to remark that if they read the Official Debates they would find much the same type of discussion as goes on here on everything else that arises.  I would not have anything useful to offer in the way of a suggestion.  Until the Senator is in a position to make more definite recommendations to the Executive Council, I do not think they could consider the matter.  If he is able to say to the Executive Council. &ldquo;Here are two, three or five men&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenClarke" hpid="Mrs. Clarke Mrs. Clarke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Clarke</NameTxt>
      <P>Or women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or women who would be quite competent to examine this matter and offer useful suggestions&rdquo;, and if he were to set out other matters <Col N="1409" /> in more detail, I am quite sure the Executive Council would be very glad to consider his proposals.  Passing a resolution like this without giving some indication of how the problem can definitely be faced is not going to lead us any further.  I am quite sure that if, within the last 12 months, the Executive Council were told that there was an expert in America, Germany or elsewhere who could solve our agricultural problem they would immediately ask his advice; but they do not know of such a person.</P>
      <P>We have been accused by Senator Miss Browne of entering on this thing without thinking of the subject in any but a haphazard way.  We are really continuing the policy we were following for the last 25 years, back to the old Sinn Fein times, when it was always held to be the country's best course to produce all we could to meet our own needs.  Wherever we see a commodity such as fruit, beet, tobacco, wheat or anything else that we can produce in this country, we ascertain if it can be produced here in a reasonably economic way and, if it can be, we try to get down to the production of that article in order that we may employ our own people.  We have tried to get more people employed on the land.</P>
      <P>We have found from statistics&mdash;and grave doubts were placed on the value of statistics here this evening&mdash;that if you want more intense production the only way is to have smaller farms.  It has been shown that big farms over 50 acres in extent do not produce as much as the small farms under 50 acres.  In addition to protecting tillage crops, such as wheat, beet and other things that we were importing up to this, we have also tried to get to the division of the land so that there may be more intensive production amongst the small farmers.  That is the general policy that we and most other countries have been pursuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture in most countries is depressed.  No country will take a chance at the present moment on opening its doors by removing tariffs on agricultural produce and allowing other countries to dump their stuff. Every country appears to be agreed <Col N="1410" /> that the best policy to pursue is to have protection for agricultural produce. The fact that we are to an increasing extent depending on our home market and on more home production is a source of satisfaction to us.  That is the same policy that is adopted by other countries.</P>
    <P>I have no very pronounced view as to whether this motion should be accepted.  I think it would be much more useful if it were framed in a more detailed way and if there were some indication given to the Executive Council as to who are the people who could give advice.  I think the only point that matters is whether there are people who would be useful on such an inquiry.  If we knew that there are such people available we would have no hesitation in asking them to inquire into the condition of the agricultural industry here and advise us how best to shape our policy for the future.</P>
    <P>There is one particular point to which I would like to refer.  As Senator Quirke said, we have taken a certain stand in this matter.  We are perfectly certain that we have taken a just stand on behalf of the Irish people.  As long as we are the Government we are going to remain where we are as regards our stand against England on this financial question. We have taken responsibility for it and were not afraid to go back to the people after they had got a taste of what it meant and to say to them: &ldquo;We have done this.  You know what this economic war means and we are before you again&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

If I have given any indication that I would favour a public inquiry it is not because we want to remove this responsibility from our shoulders, but I want to show that we are not so conceited as to think that others would not know more about it than we would.</P>

      <P>As regards the last part of the Minister's remarks, I only <Col N="1411" /> make this comment that there is a big difference between a taste and a surfeit.  The people did get a taste of this before but now they have got a surfeit.  This motion only comes from me as a reasoned suggestion to the Executive Council.  If they do not see the need of an inquiry that is well and good.  But feeling strongly that the problem is one of great national importance, that we are moving towards a very unbalanced condition and that the balance will not be restored by industrialism I moved my motion.  I agree to a certain extent with Senator Johnson that you cannot confine it to agriculture.  It may be mainly from the point of view of agriculture but you must have regard as well to the industrial position and to the general economic factors.  If the Executive Council do not think this motion is necessary well and good.  I was hoping that they would see the urgency of that problem and deal with it in whatever form they considered best.  I do feel strongly that it is <Col N="1412" /> disastrous to let this question drift and that there is a certain responsibility directly on the Government to undertake regulations or to be driven to make regulations as to the best way in which to deal with this question that is so important for the country. That is the reason why I am satisfied, after close examination, that there is a necessity for this motion.  However I leave myself in the hands of the House with regard to it.</P>
