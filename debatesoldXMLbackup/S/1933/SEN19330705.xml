      <P>I greatly regret to announce to the House the death on last Thursday, 29th June, of Senator the Countess of Desart and also the death of Senator Seamus Ryan on the day following.</P>

      <P>I should like to be allowed to pay a very brief tribute to the memory of Senator the Countess of Desart and to make a short reference to the loss which this House and this country have sustained by her death. She was one of the first members of this House.  She was also one of its most regular attenders.  Although she spoke but seldom, she always spoke briefly and to the point.  Those of us who were associated with her in this House knew the value of her advice and, above all, we knew the intense loyalty which she had to this House. The work which she did for this country has, I think, been recognised by all classes of its citizens.  She was not an Irish woman by birth but, when she adopted this country through her marriage, she became absolutely loyal to its welfare.  She was, I believe, a member of the old Unionist Party in Ireland but on the advent of the Treaty and the change of affairs which followed here, she accepted the new conditions with absolute loyalty.  She continued her work here and I happen to know that she was critical of those who were fearful and wanted to leave. If there is one word which can be applied to Lady Desart, it is the word I have mentioned twice already&mdash;&ldquo;loyal.&rdquo;  Whatever she took up, she was loyal to it.  She was loyal to Ireland, loyal to this House and loyal to her opinions.  I am satisfied that we have lost in her one of our most valuable members and that this country <Col N="2058" /> has lost one of its most loyal and valuable citizens.</P>

      <P>I thoroughly agree with everything that Senator Douglas has said in reference to the deceased Senator, the Countess of Desart.  With equal force can the same spirit of loyalty towards his fellow man and his country be claimed for the late Senator Ryan.  He was not favoured at the commencement of his career with the blessings which wealth sometimes brings, as was the Countess of Desart, but from a small beginning he worked himself up, doing wonderful work for this city and for this country.  I do not know of any man of our generation whose place it would be harder to fill. In joining with Senator Douglas in the remarks he has made in reference to the late Countess of Desart, I am sure, in return, he will join with me in my feeble attempt to portray some of the qualities of the late Senator Ryan.</P>

      <P>I desire to associate myself sorrowfully with the remarks which have been made by Senators in reference to our two deceased members. Senator the Countess of Desart had been a valuable member of this House from its origin.  In its deliberations, she took a useful and earnest part and, outside this House, she accomplished much practical work for the country.  I am sure that every member of this House regrets deeply the death of Senator the Countess of Desart.  Senator Ryan's association with this House was more brief than that of the other deceased Senator. Nevertheless, in his short term here, we all learned to respect him and, because of his admirable human traits, many of us learned almost to love him. I shall ask the Clerk to convey to the relatives of the deceased Senators an expression of our sincere sympathy. Senators will signalise their assent by standing in their places.</P>

      <P>A matter of different import now arises.  The Commissioners of Public Works desire to borrow the carpets in the Seanad anteroom and in the Clerk's room in connection with a State reception on Wednesday, 26th inst., in Dublin Castle, to the British Medical Association.  The Seanad will almost certainly be meeting on that day and, to convenience the Government as far as possible, I should like the House to agree that we should adjourn not later than 6 p.m. on that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of Item No. 7 on the Order Paper not being reached to-night and the Constitution (Amendment No. 19) Bill being taken to-morrow, it should be borne in mind that the Franchise Bill requires very careful and possibly lengthy consideration. It would be undesirable if the Franchise Bill were to be taken either at a late hour to-morrow night after <Col N="2060" /> the Constitution (Amendment) Bill has been disposed of or on Friday morning when there may be a comparatively meagre attendance.  I suggest that if we do not deal with the Franchise Bill to-night, we should adjourn it until next week.  It is a measure of serious importance and requires adequate consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the view of Senator Milroy.  To my mind, this Bill for the extension of the franchise is one of the most important measures that have come before the House during my term here. It is a Bill that affects every individual in this House and it should receive ample consideration.  Every member should have a fair opportunity of having his say on the Bill.  As Senators know, a Bill taken late on Thursday evening does not get the consideration necessary.  Surely a Bill taken on Friday will not get due consideration, especially when the Order Paper is changed and one Bill taken in place of another.  To my mind, the Franchise Bill is more important than the Bill for the amendment of the Constitution.  I hope the House will agree that ample time be given to discuss this very important measure. If it is not taken in its proper turn to-morrow, it should be allowed to stand over until next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I became a member of the Seanad, it has been the practice to facilitate the Government in regard to the order of business.  I do not think that there was very much difficulty in doing that in the past.  I am quite sure that the point made by Senator Milroy can be met and that no difficulty will arise if he will use his influence to secure that those with whom he is usually associated be present to-morrow night or on Friday.  I do not think that there will be any difficulty in having a House sufficient to carry on the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of trying to withhold facilities from the Government.  It is a question of the importance of this Bill.  Senator Johnson over-estimates my influence with any section of this House.  I am <Col N="2061" /> afraid I should find it difficult to persuade even a member of the Labour Party to be present if there was any other business to prevent him from coming here.  We know from experience what the attendance is like on Fridays.  I think it is only reasonable to ask for an adjournment in the case of this Bill if it cannot be taken in its proper order.  There is no great urgency in having the Bill passed within a week or two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>A difficulty has arisen by reason of the fact that we met on only one day last week.  I think that it is reasonable that this Bill which, I believe, the country regards as of first-class importance, should receive adequate consideration in this House. Senator Milroy is, I think, right in suggesting that the Bill would not be likely to receive proper discussion on a Friday morning.  If we do not reach the Bill this evening, I think that the House should agree that it be taken as first business next Wednesday.</P>

    <P>As the House is aware I moved an amendment on the Committee Stage asking that powers should be given to the Minister with regard to hours and conditions of employment in the proposed cement factories.  After considerable <Col N="2063" /> discussion I agreed to withdraw the amendment, on the understanding that the Minister would be prepared to go some distance to meet the object I had in mind.

      <P>I am informed that this amendment is not necessary. I submitted it to the legal advisers of the Department, and they consider that, in all the circumstances, it is not necessary: that the decision is as I stated last week that, in fact, no court will impose a penalty upon the holder of a licence to manufacture cement if the licensee can show the court that the circumstances which gave rise to the alleged breach of conditions were outside his control.</P>

      <P>14.&mdash;(1) The wages paid by the holder of a cement manufacture licence to persons employed by him for the purposes of the business authorised by such licence shall not be less than would be payable if such business were carried on under a contract between the Minister and such holder containing a fair wage clause similar to that for the time being contained in contracts made by Ministers and Government Departments.</P>

    <P>(2) If any person who is the <Col N="2064" /> holder of a cement manufacture licence acts in contravention of this section, such person shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Committee Stage I promised the House that I would endeavour to meet the point of view expressed by Senator Farren and his colleagues.  I informed the House that I thought we could go so far as to accept the fair wages clause because I find that in the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act and in the Beet Subsidy Act there is a similar clause. I have no doubt whatever that in actual fact the trade unions will be adequate to maintain a proper and a reasonable standard of wages in these cement factories, if, and when, they are established.  In view of the fact that the principle has, to some extent, been accepted already, and as we are not interfering in any way, but simply giving a kind of general benediction to the fair wages clause, I would ask the House to meet Senator Farren by accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view the value of the amendment is almost wholly in this, that it maintains in such Bills the idea of fixing certain minimum wages and conditions. Having that in view, it is desirable that the House should accept the amendment in this form, which is acceptable to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the amendment which was passed by the Seanad on the proposition of Senator Douglas and Senator Brown regarding the question of a standard specification for cement manufactured in or imported into the Free State, I would like to make a statement.  In the first place, I should say that I thoroughly appreciate the position that has been taken up by the engineering profession, and by Senator Sir John Griffith in particular, that they are very anxious that this question of the specification should be fixed in a satisfactory manner, and <Col N="2065" /> that, if at all possible, it should be laid down in the Bill now before the House. Architects, engineers and importers of cement are, of course, most familiar with what is generally known as the British standard specification, and I may therefore say, in order to make it quite clear, that it is the intention to secure that the cement manufactured in the Saorstát shall be of a standard not lower, and if possible, after a full and competent examination, even of a higher standard than the British standard.</P>
      <P>The intention is to set up a committee consisting of representatives of the engineering profession and of other persons with a competent technical knowledge to consider the drawing up of a standard specification for the Saorstát. The question will be regarded as one purely for those with the technical qualifications necessary to advise on the question, and the Minister proposes to accept the advice of such a committee.  In this way the engineering profession may feel assured that nothing will be left undone to secure a proper specification for the cement to be manufactured in the Saorstát.</P>
      <P>Such a committee will require some time for its deliberations, but as at least a year would be required for the erection of the factories, there would be time enough to have a suitable specification drawn up before the factories actually began operations. So far as the issue of cement manufacture licences is concerned, it has already been indicated to such companies as are putting in applications that it will be a condition of the licences that the cement to be manufactured must be of a proper standard and a standard not less than the British standard, which happens to be the one most familiar to engineers and architects.  In this way, I think, the situation will be absolutely safeguarded and some assurance felt that cement manufactured in the Saorstát is of a proper specification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reconsidered, in view of the remarks made on the amendment moved by Senator Douglas and Senator Brown, that part of the amendment relating to the fixing of a standard by regulation for cement imported under <Col N="2066" /> an import licence, and I am driven to the conclusion that for the short period before the Saorstát factories are operating it would only be an embarrassment to merchants and to the building trades generally if any attempt were made to bring such a provision into effect.  It is proposed to issue licences in such a way during the intervening period as will maintain the conditions existing in the cement business during recent years.  Nothing but embarrassment would be caused during this comparatively short period by bringing in a new provision which would interfere with the normal course of trade to this extent.</P>
    <P>When the new factories are operating it is intended that they will meet the full requirements of the country in ordinary Portland cement.  The only cement imported will be various varieties of special types of cements which may not normally be made in the Saorstát.  Any attempt to draw up specifications for these various grades of special cements would only cause endless embarrassment to traders and builders without any corresponding advantage.  In view of the assurances I have already given in relation to the specification of the cement to be manufactured in the Saorstát, I hope I shall not be pressed in relation to fixing a standard specification for imported cement.</P>
    <P>The position, as the amendment stands, is that the Department of Industry and Commerce will be bound to make an order prescribing the standard specification, covering not alone the manufacture but also the importation of cement during the intervening period, between the passage of the Bill into law and the setting up of the factories.  I would be prepared to accept the amendment if the House could see its way to delete all the references to import licences and to the importation of cement.  I cannot see that it is really essential that the Seanad should press this matter of insisting on a standard specification for imported cement during the intervening period.  As I explained, I think the position is fully met by the fact that the Minister will lay down conditions in the import licence.  As regards the <Col N="2067" /> manufacture of cement, I stated that, in fact, we have powers to see that the specification is maintained, and in view of the insistence of the Seanad, I would be prepared to ask the Dáil to accept an amendment, if the Seanad could see its way to meet me by deleting the portion referring to the import of cement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is my duty to point out to the Seanad that no intimation of the line of action that has been taken was made to me.  Had it been intimated to me I would have pointed out to the Minister that his course of action is quite impossible. We passed an amendment and it is for the Dáil to deal with it.  The only other course open to us was to have an amendment brought forward on the Report Stage to get the other amendment deleted.  The Minister did nothing of the sort.  He springs on the House a long litany of the grievances of importers, which he had already, I think, inflicted upon us sufficiently on the Committee Stage.  To my mind another long litany of the dangers to importers could not be allowed.  The Minister now desires to ask the House to undo, without any notice, what it did on the last day.  It imposed upon importers the necessity of bringing in a standard grade of cement.  I wish to point out that we have no power to do any such thing.  May I also point out to the Minister that if he desires such a thing, if he had consulted me, I would have recommended a course to be adopted in order to secure what he requires.  Nothing can be done in the matter now, except to adjourn the Report Stage and bring in another amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>If necessary I will be prepared, in view of the Minister's remark, to move that the Report Stage be adjourned.  I do not think the House wishes to take any advantage of any misunderstanding.  As one whose name was connected with the amendment we had on the Committee Stage, which I prefer, I have to admit that during the week I had further inquiries made.  I asked certain persons if they could give any evidence <Col N="2068" /> that there was any quantity of bad cement being brought in.  I have not got that evidence.  I am also pretty well satisfied that there are very genuine difficulties which will have to be got over if imported cement is going to be kept to a standard.  If we were going to have cement imported for ten years these difficulties would be worth the trouble, but if you are only going to have Portland cement imported for the next year or for a less period, until the factory is started here, when no more Portland cement will be imported, I am inclined to say that the Government should hesitate about going to the expense of making provision for testing by the Customs authorities during that period.  While I would prefer the amendment we had on the Committee Stage, I would be prepared to agree to the deletion of that portion of it dealing with imported cement, after the further knowledge I have, and on being satisfied that the Government would agree to the other portion.  It means that there will be consultation and that <i>bona fide</i> Irish standard of Portland cement will apply to the cement manufactured here and to what is imported. I am prepared to move that the Report Stage be adjourned until next week, in order to enable the Minister to put down the requisite amendment.  I expected there would be an amendment here to-day.</P>

The Minister has agreed to put into the Bill a provision to the effect that the standard specification shall not be lower in the case of cement to be manufactured in the proposed factories than what is known as the British standard.  In the meantime, with regard to imported cement, <Col N="2069" /> efforts will be made to meet that particular point when licences are being issued.  I think the Minister has gone a good part of the road to meet us, and under these circumstances I think we should endeavour to facilitate the Minister as much as we can in the matter.  Personally I do not think that there is any necessity for postponing the Report Stage of this measure for another week.</P>

I think there would be a danger in that and inferences might be drawn that would not be justified.  There will be power given to the Minister to attach conditions regarding imports and so on, but inasmuch as we are making a specific enactment that a standard specification in respect to manufactured cement will be set up, I submit there should be a similar requirement in regard to imported cement, whatever be the date of the beginning of the condition.</P>

The position was that following a discussion last week representatives of the Department of Industry and Commerce discussed the matter with Senators who were interested and I think that these Senators&mdash;Senator Griffith did, at any rate&mdash;expressed the view that it might be possible to meet our position by deleting the words referring to import licences.  I was under the impression when I came here to-day that I might be able to get the House to agree to that amendment. However, if the Cathaoirleach wishes, he can postpone it to a later stage. The amendment itself would be quite simple.  It would be simply to delete the words in the new section &ldquo;or any import licence under Part V thereof&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;or imported into.&rdquo;  If the Cathaoirleach were willing, I think we could deal with the matter now if the House were agreeable.  On the other hand, I have no objection to postponing the matter.  I was under the impression that we could get agreement on it and that we could settle it. here and now.</P>

Unless the Minister makes some arrangements the cement imported will be of inferior quality, because there are as yet no cement factories in the country. We do not want to have indifferent cement brought into the country. If some unfortunate person down the country builds a house with bad <Col N="2072" /> cement, which is brought in within the next year, it will give him something to think about afterwards.

    <P>(b)  in case such person has five or more completed years of qualifying service, a sum calculated on the basis of one-sixth of his annual remuneration for every completed year of qualifying service together with a sum (not exceeding in any case ten-sixths of his annual remuneration) calculated on the basis of one-sixth of his annual remuneration for every two completed years of qualifying service.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purposes of this section the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  each of the following persons shall be the holder of a qualifying post under an approved society, that is to say:&mdash;</P>

    <P>(iii)  if such person resumed his position as the holder of a qualifying post under such approved society within a reasonable time after the expiration of the period of such temporary absence and the delay in such resumption was due to wounds or illness attributable to such service, internment, or imprisonment, or to no vacancy being available in such society, no interval of time shall be deemed to have elapsed between such expiration and such resumption;</P>

    <P>(c)  such person, if engaged part-time only on such work for such society, proves to the satisfaction of the provisional committee that the remuneration paid to him by such other person or <Col N="2076" /> body in respect of such work was his principal means of livelihood,</P>
    <P>such person shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed in respect of every period during which he was engaged on such work for such society to have been the holder of a qualifying post under such society, but in calculating under sub-section (3) of this section his average annual remuneration as the holder of a qualifying post under such society no payments, other than payments in respect of such work for such society, shall be taken into account.</P>

    <P>(b)  such person accepts such offer, and</P>
    <P>(c)  such person is dismissed (otherwise than for misconduct or illness) by the Unified Society within five years after the said date of transfer, such person may apply to the Minister for a declaration that he is entitled to compensation under this section and thereupon the Minister may, if he thinks it reasonable in all the circumstances of the case so to do, declare such person entitled to compensation under this section and upon such declaration being made such person shall, notwithstanding paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) of this section, be entitled to be paid by the Unified Society compensation under this section.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where a person entitled to compensation under this section is offered and accepts temporary employment by the Unified Society, <Col N="2077" /> he shall not be entitled to be paid such compensation until he has ceased to be employed by the Unified Society.</P>
    <P>(7)  Where compensation has been paid under this section to a person who, immediately before the date of transfer in respect of an approved society, was the holder of a qualifying post under such society and such person within three years from the said date of transfer is offered and accepts permanent employment with the Unified Society, such person shall repay to the Unified Society, either, as the Minister shall determine, the whole of such compensation or such part thereof as the Minister may fix.</P>
    <P>(8)  Any moneys payable by a person to the Unified Society under the immediately preceding sub-section shall be a debt due by such person to the Unified Society and may be recoverable as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 22, sub-section (1) After the word &ldquo;society&rdquo; in line 12 to insert the words &ldquo;in the same area if the person so insists.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with Section 22, which refers to the gratuities to be given to former secretaries and certain former employees of approved societies. Under the section certain employees are entitled to compensation, but if they have been offered permanent employment by the Unified Society and do not take that employment, they are not entitled to compensation.  For instance, a man working in Limerick can be offered employment in Dublin; a man working in Cork can be offered employment in Dublin, or a man in Dublin can be offered employment in Cork.  I am not speaking for one area more than another.  The object of my <Col N="2078" /> amendment is to insert after the word &ldquo;society&rdquo; the words &ldquo;in the same area if the person so insists.&rdquo;  I think that if an officer wants to remain in the same area as that in which he formerly worked he should get employment there.  As the Bill stands if such officers do not take up the employment offered to them they are not entitled to compensation.  It should not be in the power of the Minister to transfer a man from Cork to Dublin or vice versa.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Senator should think again before pressing this amendment.  I imagine the effect would be to preclude such a person from being taken over.  If there was any likelihood of that person insisting on retaining his employment in one particular area, then the Unified Society would probably say: &ldquo;Well, we are not going to take that risk and we shall not give him any chance of being taken over.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We had this identical amendment before the Select Committee which discussed this Bill and it was unanimously negatived.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept this amendment for a variety of reasons.  Some of the reasons have been stated by Senators who spoke in opposition to the amendment.  An additional reason is that it would tie the hands of the provisional committee which will have the work imposed upon them of organising the new staff.  First of all, under the Bill as passed by the Dáil we are bound to offer employment or to make a reasonable offer of alternative employment to the official whom we propose to take over.  There are at present quite a large number of secretaries and treasurers of societies and other senior officers scattered all <Col N="2079" /> over the country.  There are, let us say, sixty secretaries all over the country and there will be only one secretary of the Unified Society.  We could not offer that secretaryship to any secretary in any part of Ireland except to the one individual who will be selected for the position.  We would have to offer him some other post which will, from the point of view of salary, be as near an approach as is possible and as we think reasonable to the post he held in the approved society of which he was an official.  Any further restriction of this kind will make it more difficult for us to select officials from the country for, say, headquarters posts.  It will make it more difficult to promote people.</P>
      <P>If we know that there is a good man in Cork, Galway or Mayo&mdash;I do not know whether there is any really first-class man in Cork, Galway or those other places connected with approved societies but let us say that there did happen to be such a man&mdash; and we wanted him at headquarters because he had a reputation of being a really first-class man, if this amendment were passed and if he stood on his rights and insisted on remaining in Cork, we would be deprived of a good official and that official would probably be deprived of compensation. That is what it would mean.</P>
      <P>As Senator Dowdall has said, there are rules and regulations governing the Civil Service by which civil servants are obliged, under the terms of their employment, to go wherever the Government of the day think they will serve best, and this body will be practically a Civil Service body.  We think that any official who is taken into the new Unified Society ought to be allowed to serve anywhere he is wanted.  We are, as I said earlier, obliged, under the terms of the Bill as it stands, to offer reasonable employment&mdash;reasonable in reference to their present position &mdash; to officials of approved societies who are taken over, and any restriction of the kind suggested would make it more difficult for us to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I proposed an amendment on these lines at the Select <Col N="2080" /> Committee and, as Senator Dowdall has said, it was turned down.  I got very little support for it, but the amendment does not require that a secretary in Galway should be made secretary of the Unified Society.  It sets out that where an official is to be offered employment, it should be employment in the place in which he has already been working.  Many of these employees have wives and families and it would be very difficult to expect them to break up their homes for a position in another district. In view, however, of the feeling of the House and the opposition which a similar amendment met at the Special Committee, I would ask Senator Staines to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 22, sub-section (3).  To delete in line 50 the word &ldquo;continuously.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As this sub-section stands, it cuts out compensation for any period of service before the period of unemployment, no matter how short that period of unemployment may have been.  An employee may have worked for 18 years for an insurance society and, then, through some particular circumstance, may have become unemployed for a month or so and, subsequently, may have secured a second appointment.  In such a case, no compensation will be payable in respect of the 18 years' service, but only in respect of the two or three years during which he held the new appointment.  There are, I think, very few people affected by the amendment, but, as they are so few, I think the Minister should accept it.  It is hard on the few who are affected that they should lose their previous service because they were unemployed for a short period.</P>

      <P>Senator Staines has told the House that he is informed that there are some cases.  If that is the case, this, obviously, is going to effect an injustice.  We can only argue this in a more or less hypothetical way in the absence of specific cases but, on the exact reading of this sub-section, there must be continuous employment. If there is a break of only a week, it would be sufficient to disqualify an applicant for compensation.  If the desire of the Minister, as I am sure it is, is to do justice in such a case, obviously the retention of this word &ldquo;continuously&rdquo; will prevent him from doing so.  Until there is a case shown, until there is some evidence that the word &ldquo;continuously&rdquo; serves a useful purpose or is really necessary, I see no case for resisting the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Staines misunderstands me.  What I say is that in all cases where compensation is allowed, the rule is that the service to qualify for compensation must be continuous service.  The service may be broken.  If it is broken through no fault of the person concerned, Senator Staines would have a case, but if it is broken through his fault, then, I think, continuous service ought to be insisted on because I can imagine a case&mdash;I do not know the facts&mdash;in which a man might be employed by an approved society and, for some reason involving his own conduct, he might have been put out of employment and then through his own or his friends' request and relying on the good nature of people, he might have got back.  In such a case as that, when it comes to a question of compensation, would you give him compensation based on the service that he had given before he was dismissed?</P>

      <P>This is also an amendment which, I am afraid, I could not accept.  We had a discussion in the Dáil on this same matter, on, I <Col N="2083" /> think, an exactly similar amendment and cases were cited in which people might have been out of employment, temporarily but for a considerable time, through illness and cases were also mentioned of men who had served in armies or navies or who might have been out of employment for a time through labour troubles.  We put in paragraphs (c) and (d) in this sub-section specifically to cover this class of case but we objected to the deletion of the word &ldquo;continuously&rdquo; because it would leave us open to having claims made against the Unified Society for compensation to people who had actually been dismissed from an approved society and who, for some reason or another, had been taken into another approved society after a lapse of one, two, three or five years.  We do not think that such people ought to be entitled to, or ought to receive, compensation for the earlier period of employment under the approved society.  The underlying principle of compensation here is compensation for the post the person is losing.  If a person held another post at a period a long time anterior and if there was a lapse of time between his occupancy of that post and his occupancy of his present post, we do not think there is any obligation on the Unified Society to give compensation for the earlier employment.  It is where there is continuous employment broken, as Senator Comyn said, through no fault of the person concerned, that the obligation which we accept rests on the Unified Society to give compensation. There are cases, I believe, known to national health insurance officials in which persons have lost their employment with an approved society through their own fault and who are now employed by another society but it is my opinion, having gone into the matter with officials, that these persons are not entitled to compensation for the earlier period of their employment with an approved society.  We are compensating them for loss of a specific office and we believe that that is all we are morally bound to do.</P>

      <P>Section 22, sub-section (3).  After the word &ldquo;service&rdquo; in line 56 to insert the words &ldquo;in any of the following organisations, that is to say, Oglaigh na hEireann (Irish Republican Army), the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Citizen Army, Fianna Eireann, the Hibernian Rifles and Cumann na mBan during the Rising of April and May, 1916, or&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This amendment is proposed to meet a point that was made in the Dáil: that certain people who were perhaps out of employment in an approved society as a result of 1916 and who were members of the various organisations set out would not ordinarily have been covered by the Bill as it stood.  The intention of the amendment is to cover such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principle of the amendment.  I do not know why &ldquo;Irish Republican Army&rdquo; is put in.  The Irish phrase &ldquo;Oglaigh na h-Eireann&rdquo; means in English, to my mind, &ldquo;Soldiers of Ireland.&rdquo; Oglaigh na hEireann in 1916 included the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Citizen Army, Fianna Eireann, the Hibernian Rifles and Cumann na mBan.  There was no such thing as an Irish Republican Army in 1916.  Why then put it in here?  The thing is unnecessary. There was no such thing in 1916, and so far as I can see, the only purpose of it is to cover up people whose imagination has developed so much&mdash;I mean that a section of their brain has developed so much in comparison to other sections of it&mdash;that they believe they were in the Post Office in 1916.  In 1916, not more than <Col N="2085" /> 90 men marched into the Post Office, but I have met tens of thousands of people since who, according to themselves, were in the Post Office in 1916. I would like to know, therefore, why &ldquo;Irish Republican Army&rdquo; is put into the amendment?  That army did not exist at that time.  It is put in here simply to cover up such people as I have mentioned: to let them come along and claim that they were in the Irish Republican Army.  As I have said, that army did not exist in 1916. It came into being when Dáil Eireann took over Oglaigh na h-Eireann, and that included all the other organisations mentioned here.  When Dáil Eireann took over all these organisations we got for the first time the &ldquo;Irish Republican Army,&rdquo; and that, as well as I remember, was about the year 1919.  But the Irish Republican Army was certainly not in existence in 1916.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Staines is under some sort of misapprehension. We have here in the amendment the phrase &ldquo;Oglaigh na h-Eireann,&rdquo; and in brackets &ldquo;Irish Republican Army.&rdquo; That is to say, that the two phrases mean the same thing.  I hope that any gentleman who by force of saying that he was in the Post Office in 1916 is going to believe it now&mdash;that sometimes happens&mdash;will not be allowed to get the benefit of the section, but surely whether such persons say that or not, will they not be required to prove that they were concerned in &ldquo;the rising of April and May, 1916&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>We were anxious, first of all, to cover the points that were <Col N="2086" /> up in the Dáil.  I think it was Deputy Norton who first raised this point about 1916.  He called my attention to the fact that these people might not have been covered, and we were anxious to cover everybody.  Of course if we said Irish Republican Brotherhood, Senator Staines might be better pleased.  He probably would tell us that that would be a more accurate description.  But these are the draftsman's words.  If we said Irish Republican Brotherhood, Senator Staines perhaps might be able to enlighten us on that end of it, because I think he is an authority on the matter.  At any rate we are anxious to cover everybody and to make it as widespread as we can, so that people who for good patriotic motives were out of their employment during that period, perhaps were imprisoned or were on the run or out of their offices, might not be deprived of compensation.</P>

      <P>Section 22, sub-section (3).  To delete lines 29-39 inclusive, page 9, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;the remuneration for the last calendar year before the date of termination of service.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill as it stands decrees that for compensation purposes the average remuneration for the five years ended 30th June, 1932, shall be the basis of the calculation.  For an employee to be dismissed in 1934/5/6 and to be compensated on a salary as far back as 1927 is most unjust, especially to younger people whose salaries were steadily growing.  The income that will be lost will not be the income of 1927-1932, but the salary at the date of dismissal.  I think it is only fair that the same principle should apply in this Bill as in other measures dealing with compensation passed by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.  It is really seeking to incorporate in the Bill a principle that has been enshrined in every other Bill that I know of in which compensation for loss of employment <Col N="2087" /> is involved.  When you are depriving a man of his employment, what you are really taking from him is the salary that he was enjoying in the last year of his employment: not the average salary going back over a number of years.  A man, say, starts with a salary of £100 a year.  In five years his salary, because of increments of £10 a year that he has received, has gone up to £150 a year.  Why should you take the average then?  Is it not his last year's salary that you are depriving him of as well as the prospective enjoyment of that salary for the future, or perhaps a higher salary?  Now if it was good and proper to introduce the principle suggested in the amendment in the Railways Act of 1924, in the Railways Act of this year, and I think also in the Electricity Supply Act and, so far as I know, in the Local Government Act, it does seem extraordinary that a different and less favourable principle, as far as these men are concerned, should be introduced into this Bill.  In my opinion this is an eminently reasonable amendment.  It seeks to extend equity of treatment to people deprived of their employment, and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to question all that Senator O'Farrell has said in regard to the Railways Acts, but so far as my recollection goes this is the principle of compensation which has been adopted in the Local Government Code from the year 1898 coming down through the years 1924 and 1925 to the present time.  So far as I recollect the basis of compensation was always the average, and I think the average was three years.  Therefore, I think that Senator O'Farrell is wrong in supposing that a new principle is being introduced here.  I think the only respect in which it is new is in extending the term from three to five.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I cannot accept this amendment moved by Senator Staines.  There is this difference between this Bill and some of the others mentioned by Senator <Col N="2088" /> O'Farrell: that in this case the money to provide compensation for the disemployed officials has to come out of the Administration Fund, and that is a limited sum.  Already we have, through accepting amendments in the Dáil, and one that was put up by the Select Committee of the Seanad and that we propose to accept here, bitten into the Administration Fund for compensation purposes much more heavily than was originally intended.  As a matter of fact the officials upon whose shoulders will devolve the work of managing this fund are very worried that I have seen fit to go as far as I have done in accepting propositions that have been put up here and in the Dáil for an improvement in the compensation to be awarded to officials.  I do not know whether what is asked in this amendment would amount to a great deal or not, but I believe that I have more than reached the limit with regard to the inroads that I can make on the Administration Fund.  Therefore, I do not think that I can accept the amendment.</P>

    <P>(a)  each of the following persons shall be the holder of a qualifying post under an approved society, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  a part-time officer of such society;</P>
    <P>(ii)  a part-time employee of such society whose earnings from such society were not his principal means of livelihood;</P>

    <P>(b)  such person accepts such offer, and</P>
    <P>(c)  such person is dismissed (otherwise than for misconduct or illness) by the Unified Society within five years after the said date of transfer,</P>
    <P>such person may apply to the Minister for a declaration that he is entitled to compensation under this section and thereupon the Minister may, if he thinks it reasonable in all the circumstances of the case so to do, declare such person entitled to compensation under this section and upon such declaration being made such person shall, notwithstanding paragraph <Col N="2092" /> (d)  of sub-section (1) of this section, be entitled to be paid by the Unified Society compensation under this section.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where a person entitled to compensation under this section is offered and accepts temporary employment by the Unified Society, he shall not be entitled to be paid such compensation until he has ceased to be employed by the Unified Society.</P>

      <P>The Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act, 1933 made certain amendments on the Constitution, and the purpose of this Bill is to make in the electoral law certain necessary amendments and repeals without which the electoral law would be inconsistent with the Constitution as now amended.  With regard to the deposit of £100 made by a candidate as part of his nomination at a Dáil election, if he is elected he has proved definitely that he was a <i>bona fide</i> candidate, and in such a case the deposit will be returned as soon as practicable after the result of the <Col N="2095" /> election is declared.  As there is no longer an oath prescribed by the Constitution, taking the oath is not a condition precedent to a candidate taking his seat in the House, and the reservation to that effect is now removed from the Electoral Act.  It is not necessary to make any further provisions in the electoral law as regards taking a seat in the House, since each House of the Oireachtas has power under Article 20 of the Constitution to make its own Standing Orders.  For the orderly transaction of business each member must comply with Standing Orders, and taking a seat in the House is part of the ordinary business.  The proposed alteration in the terms of Sections 51 and 57 of the Electoral Act, 1923, is merely declaratory of the powers of the House, and the Committee on Procedure will no doubt consider whether the existing Standing Orders require any alteration. Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested by Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Johnson that this sweepstake has become, for all practical purposes, a State lottery and, consequently, that the Government and the Minister have responsibilities in relation to it which they had not under the earlier sweepstake legislation.  In that connection, I should like to draw the attention of the House to Section 10 (3) where it is laid down that it is an offence to issue any statement or document even remotely suggesting that this is a State lottery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators are well aware, though they are not quite prepared to admit it, that there has been specific exemption from the operation of the Lotteries Acts to enable the Committee of the Associated Hospitals to avail of this particular method of raising money to take the voluntary hospitals out of their financial difficulties.  No other person or group of persons than the Committee of the Associated Hospitals can promote a sweepstake.  The money must be devoted to the purposes set out, for the benefit of the hospitals, and for no other purpose, and the only function of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in relation to the money is to see that it is devoted to the purpose for which it is intended.  The promoting committee entered into an agreement with the Hospitals Trust to carry out the sweepstakes, and in order to do so certain expenses had to be incurred.  I stated when this matter was last under discussion in the Seanad that it is in the direct interest of the Committee of the Associated Hospitals to secure that a sweepstake will be run with the minimum expense.  The less money expended on commissions and on salaries the more money will be available for the voluntary hospitals.  As everybody knows, the Committee of the Associated Hospitals consists of men of high standing.  Surely they will not be a consenting party to anything in the nature of abuse of the opportunities of giving a little extra commission to certain people, if that is the suggestion.  It is in their own immediate interest to ensure that the expenses will be cut down to the minimum.  The <Col N="2098" /> Bill provides in Section 6 that the maximum amount of commission must be incorporated in the scheme submitted to the Minister for his approval. If the Minister is satisfied that the maximum amount of commission is a reasonable amount he will sanction the scheme.  If he is not satisfied, or if he thinks the amount of commission unreasonable, he will refuse to sanction the scheme.  Consequently, the scheme will be modified, or, if the Committee of the Associated Hospitals fail to secure such modification as would satisfy the Minister, the scheme would not go on and there would be no sweepstake.</P>

The scheme is prepared under specified conditions, and Senator Johnson asks that it be laid on the Table of both Houses.  That is in the amendment in black and white.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing that has been said seems to me to touch the conclusive arguments that have been made in favour of the amendment.  The Minister denies that there is any approach to a State lottery.  If Senators refer to Section 24 they will see that it gives the Minister power to take the moneys obtained by the fund and to apply them to any hospital, even a public hospital run by a board of health. That is very near.  Even that point does not affect the case for the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case for it is a simple one.  There is a departure from the Lotteries Acts.  As the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, a committee proposes to run a sweepstake and the law requires that the committee shall submit its proposals to the Minister.  The Act indicates that these proposals shall conform to a certain set of conditions which are laid down in the clauses laid down in paragraphs (a) to (k) of the section.  The Minister approves of that scheme whether as originally proposed or amended.  Once he approves nothing more is heard of it.  But the same Act directs that auditors shall be appointed and that their report regarding the finances of every lottery shall be made to members of the Oireachtas.  It seems to me to have been the obvious requirement that a scheme, which is approved by the Minister, upon which the auditors are going to make a report must be made known to the members of the Oireachtas to whom the auditors' report has to be sent.  If that is not done then there is a gap in the scheme which ought to be filled.  We are told that this will mean divulging information which ought not to be divulged. We were told that it would broadcast all over the world what is done with this and with that, as well as the <Col N="2101" /> machinery for distribution.  I deny that absolutely.  All that is required is that the maximum amount proposed to be allowed for commission shall be included in the scheme; not the details of the distribution, not the machinery of the Hospitals' Trust or of the agents, but simply the maximum amount of the commission.  If that is not done what is the use of putting it forward in the conditions, that the price intended to be charged in each sweepstake shall be stated in the scheme?  What is the use of giving us a report after the sweep is over, indicating that so much money has been received and that a certain percentage has been paid?  All that is useless unless the scheme itself, which is the basis of the whole transaction, is presented.  It is like asking auditors to make a report upon something about which they have not got the foundation upon which to work before them.  Without that in the scheme the auditors' report is almost useless.</P>

      <P>Section 13, sub-section (1).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;such audit shall state the total number of counterfoils placed in the drum.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Every Senator is aware of the object of this amendment.  It is not so wide as a previous amendment, which was rejected.  There is further evidence that information of this kind is needed or, at least, there is further evidence of great misapprehension on the part of members of the House, and even members of the public, as to the actual position.  In the debate last week Senator Foran, according to the Parliamentary Debates, used these words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If Senator Johnson knew a little more about gambling he would know that every £5 subscribed represents 12 tickets&mdash;and here follow the significant words&mdash;in the drum.  Every man in the street knows that.  It is a simple calculation that any person can make to satisfy himself.  Each book represents £5.  There are 12 tickets in each book.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>From that one was led to believe that to find out the number of tickets in the drum one had only to divide the money by five and multiply by 12.  Does Senator Foran hold that that is the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that he is entirely wrong. To what extent he is wrong I do not know, but that he is wrong is common knowledge.  Books in quantity can be bought at less than £5.  If it were only 1/- less than £5 his calculation would be upset.  We know that they are sold at less than £5 per book, but how much less we do not know.  One hears of <Col N="2103" /> books being sold at £4 10s. 0d. each. There are two points of view to be considered.  The first is that of the hospitals.  The Minister says that our only responsibility should be for the welfare of the hospitals.  He suggests that the welfare of the hospitals is met by getting as much money as possible into the total receipts regardless of the interests of subscribers.  By subscribers I mean gamblers&mdash;people who pay their money for tickets.  The Hospitals' Committee discharge their duty by getting all the money they can, and it is not up to them in any way to have any regard for the backers or the odds that are involved.  I consider this House is in a different position.  This House has a certain responsibility to subscribers and for the scheme as a whole.  We ought not to be satisfied until we have information which will disclose in one way or another the amount of the secret commissions.  It is with the sole object of ascertaining this information for the public and protecting the interests of the subscribers as a whole, that I move this amendment.</P>

      <P>That considerable sums are certainly paid in commissions everybody knows.  I myself know people who received commissions but the mere fact that there are rumours about tickets being sold for smaller sums of money does not prove anything. I have no reason to suppose that the sums actually received per book of 12 tickets is less than £5.  I think it is quite conceivable that the commissions which are paid come from some other fund&mdash;from the expenses fund.  Anyway there is no proof that they do not. The fact that Senator Sir John Keane hears stories and rumours proves nothing.  I have heard rumours some of which I know are totally unfounded.

That is the whole point.  It is because the matter is so obscure that I think the House has a right to some definite assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary.  The Senator suggests that no commissions are given by way of deduction although in the scheme as submitted to the Minister, that item is specially provided for.  Is the House to assume that although the item is specially provided for in the scheme it has not any practical reality?  Suppose the commissions do not take the form of deductions, are we to assume that when a man sells books in quantity he sends in £5 per book and receives a direct payment as reward?  I personally know for a fact that is not the method employed.</P>

      <P>I think I shall be able to cut the debate short by giving Senator Sir John Keane the assurance he asks <Col N="2105" /> for&mdash;that there is no deduction from the £5 per book of tickets.  There are two free tickets in each book, but there are no further deductions.  The payment of commissions is a separate transaction altogether, and is a payment in cash.  This matter, having been debated in a more or less disorderly way on a previous occasion, gave me an opportunity of taking it up with the auditors, and I have received from the auditors a written communication which gives the assurance that Senator Sir John Keane asks for.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to intervene in the debate, but this particular question has been discussed for several years and people all over the world have some little doubt about this scheme.  I agree that Senator Sir John Keane is perfectly right in his contention.  There seems in this House to be a definite desire to conceal what appears to be an extremely important item.  If anybody goes to Galway races and has a bet, say, in the Galway Plate, he will find that even the &ldquo;old firm&rdquo; will have the odds up on the board.  I cannot see why in a matter like this we, who have a certain responsibility to the man who contributes by purchasing a 10/- ticket towards our hospitals, should not tell him exactly what the odds are against him.</P>

After all is said and done, where is the money to come from?  From the tickets sold, undoubtedly.  It is clear that when these tickets are received every individual subscriber is furnished with a receipt.  Do the Senators who want this information suggest that some of these tickets have been destroyed, and have not been put into the drum?</P>

      <P>I do not see why there should be any doubt that when 12 tickets are received with £5 cash these 12 tickets go into the drum.  It <Col N="2107" /> is quite possible, as the Senator suggests, that a book of tickets may be sold for £4 10/- but the 10/- that is paid in that way will undoubtedly be deducted from the general expenses and it has nothing whatever to do with the number of tickets which go into the drum.  I think that the discussion in this House is calculated somehow to cast doubt on the validity of this scheme.  I should not like to suggest that the opposition to this measure is dictated by a puritanical spirit, the same spirit that opposes all gambling and which looks upon sweeps as a gambling performance, but it is a serious matter for anybody to suggest that this business is not carried out above board and in a thoroughly upright way.  The firm of chartered accountants who have charge of the audit are well known.  Their fame has very widely extended.  Is it suggested for a moment that they would vouch for these accounts if there was any doubt whatever in their minds in regard to the validity of the work or if there was any suggestion that the correct number of tickets, corresponding to each unit of £5, were not put into the drum?  I think the whole argument advanced in support of the amendment is ludicrous and has not been substantiated in any way.  It should not go forth as the opinion of this House that we desire to probe into matters as between a reputable firm of auditors and the Sweep Committee. I do not think we should have any feelings of conscious doubt as to the rectitude and the thoroughness in which this scheme is carried out.  An immense success has attended these sweeps so far.  I am quite sure that the House can say, not that they have any doubts, but that it is the consensus of opinion here that the sweep could not be carried out in a more upright and honourable fashion than it has been by the Sweepstakes Committee.</P>

In spite of their opposition <Col N="2108" /> the sweep has been a great success all over the world.  The only object in bringing these matters up and casting doubt on the working of the sweep, is to break down as far as possible the success of the lottery which is bringing so much money to Ireland.

      <P>It seems to me that if Senator Sir John Keane is so anxious to get an answer to this question, the matter boils itself down to this.  We know that sweep tickets are sold all over the world and there is scarcely one country in which it is legal to sell them and the disclosure of the information that he wants means eventually the names, addresses and the amount of commission received by the people selling the tickets in the countries where it is illegal to sell them and that will finish the sweep.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section I want to keep strictly in order and, therefore, I want to speak on the audit.  I do so because there appears to be a very great difference of opinion in the House as to what are the facts regarding the audit and what it is, in fact, that the auditor is auditing.  There appears to be a very great difference of opinion and quite a sincere misunderstanding and I think it is due to the House and to every member of it that they should know exactly what is the position.  As I read it&mdash;if I am wrong, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will correct me&mdash;the audit that is provided for, in Section 13, is the audit of the receipts and disbursements of money in relation to such sweepstake that come within the purview of the Commission and these moneys are defined by Section 2 which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>When calculating for the purposes of this Act the amount of the moneys received from the sale of tickets in a sweepstake, the value of tickets issued free of charge by way of reward to a seller of tickets shall be excluded from the calculation, and there shall be deducted from the nominal selling price of all other tickets all commissions, prizes, and other remuneration given in relation to the selling of such tickets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me, and I know that my reading of this matter is different from that of those who have spoken, that what the auditor is required to audit is the amount of money that is placed to the credit of the Hospitals Commission <Col N="2110" /> by the people who organise the sweep, and not, as some people seem to think, the amount of money that comes into the possession of the organisers of the sweep.  There is a distinct difference between members of the Seanad on that point, and it is a matter of fact that ought to be made clear.  Is it an audit of the moneys that come into the offices of the people who organise the sweep, or is it an audit of the moneys that come into the coffers of the Hospitals Commission, the original promoters of the sweep? I think it is the latter only, and if I am not correct, I think there would be a great relief in some people's minds, and we should be quite sure, then, that the audit is the audit of all the moneys received by anybody for the sale of tickets.  If that is true, then, for my part, I have nothing more to say.  If it is not correct, we should be told quite clearly that the audit is an audit of the moneys that come into the Hospitals Commission in accordance with the scheme that the Minister has sanctioned.  There is a big difference, and it is very important, in view of the responsibilities the Oireachtas is taking on itself, and has taken on itself hitherto, in regard to this whole business, that this matter should be made clear once and for all.</P>

I do not know whether the Minister will deny that but that is actually what is done.  On the other side, you get all the open expenses&mdash;all the machinery we see in Dublin, the girls, the clothes and the receipts to sellers.

      <P>I do not know whether I shall be able to add to the confusion or whether I shall be able to make things clearer than they are.  The audited statement circulated to the public relates to the amount of money available after certain deductions by way of commission, etc., have been made, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no check or no audit of the commissions and other payments that are not included in that statement. In connection with this&mdash;and this is a rather serious matter, inasmuch as it is liable to be misunderstood outside the House; if we cannot clarify the position here, damage might be done, unwittingly, let us say, to the future financial success of these sweepstakes&mdash;I will read for the enlightenment of Senator Sir John Keane in particular, a statement from the auditors on this matter.  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As auditors of the Sweepstakes, we have to state that, in the provisions of every scheme which has been submitted to and approved by the Minister for Justice, for Sweepstakes under the Public Charitable (Hospitals) Acts, 1930 to 1932, there has been a clause limiting the amount to be allowed by way of commission or remuneration in relation to the sale of tickets to distributing organisers outside the Irish Free State. No commission is payable on tickets sold in the Irish Free State.  To satisfy ourselves as auditors that this provision of the scheme is strictly complied with, it has throughout been necessary to record in the books of Hospitals Trust Limited the gross number of tickets sold, the gross amount of proceeds from the sale of <Col N="2114" /> tickets, and the commission allowed by way of remuneration to distributing organisers.  A complete record has also been kept of the free ticket allotment so that at any time we are in a position to certify from the books of Hospitals' Trust Limited not only the gross amount of the proceeds from the sale of tickets, but also (a) the deduction for free ticket allotment, and (b) the amount payable by way of commission.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is hardly necessary for us to state that in each Sweepstake conducted up to the present the amount paid by way of commission has been well within the limit provided by the respective scheme, while the maximum amount of free tickets has never been reached in view of the very large sale of individual tickets at the local receiving offices of Hospitals' Trust Limited.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>May I make a suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary on this section?  This section affords as good an opportunity as any other to do so.  This section deals with the National Hospital Trustees and the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  The Parliamentary Secretary has just read out the name &ldquo;Hospitals' Trust Limited.&rdquo; Now Hospitals' Trust Limited is not the same as the Hospital Trustees, and their possessions are not the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  These terms deal with entirely different things but, being very nearly alike, they are liable to cause <Col N="2115" /> confusion.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should consider whether it would not be desirable to make some change in the terminology of this fund which is now known as &ldquo;The Hospitals' Trust Fund&rdquo; in view of the title that is given to the organisers&mdash;Hospitals' Trust Limited.</P>

      <P>I have two amendments down to this section, and I think the House might consider them together.  I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Amendment 6.  Section 23, sub-section (1).  After the words &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; in line 21 to insert the words &ldquo;or any organisation established in Saorstát Eireann for the provision of a pension fund for aged or infirm nurses.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendment 7.  Section 23, sub-section (2).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of this section, but not further or otherwise, the word &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; shall mean a nurse registered by the General Nursing Council or a midwife certified by the Central Midwives Board, who shall have been engaged for not less than 20 years in nursing or <Col N="2116" /> in attendance on maternity patients in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>In the definition section &ldquo;the expression &lsquo;nursing organisation&rsquo; means an institution or organisation in Saorstát Eireann which has for its sole or principal object the nursing of, and providing of nurses for, poor persons suffering from physical diseases, injuries, or deformities or poor women in child birth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That deals with nurses who are really ministering to the poor, but the purpose of my amendments is to enable those engaged in general nursing to apply for a grant out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  Those engaged in general nursing pay a substantial fee for their training.  It is something like £50, and they have to spend a number of years in training.  During their course of training they have to pass a certain number of examinations as to their proficiency.  After that, if they are not retained on the staff of the hospital, they become members of what is called a co-operative nursing association. The Minister, on the Second Reading of the Bill, rather surprised me by saying that these nurses are well paid. I have made inquiries since.  I find that their remuneration, when engaged in private nursing, is about two guineas a week, while for night cases the fee is about 2½ guineas a week. Having regard to the fact that they are not in continuous employment&mdash;I doubt very much if many of them are engaged for more than 30 weeks out of the 52&mdash;their remuneration, I suggest, comes to very little more than £1 or 25/- a week.  That is a miserable remuneration for ladies engaged in very useful and important work.  For those who have to continue at nursing until they become old and infirm, that is to say after 20 years' professional work, their chances of making provision for the future are very small indeed.</P>
    <P>We know, of course, that there is a sort of psychology in nursing: that sick people very naturally prefer to have younger people around them. Those who become old in the service, though ordinarily they would not be regarded as old&mdash;they may have <Col N="2117" /> reached the age of 40 or 45 years of age&mdash;have very little chance or anything like continuous employment as nurses.  Nursing is a very racking occupation, particularly for those engaged in night nursing.  It is important for the hospitals, as well as for the general health of the community, that an adequate staff of trained nurses should always be available. This Bill gives an opportunity for making such provision.  In the case of a very bad epidemic a sufficient number of nurses may not be available if something is not done now to safeguard the future of nurses.  My amendment only gives permission to an organisation, such as that referred to, to apply to the Hospitals' Trust Fund for a grant which will be utilised to provide pensions for those who have been engaged for not less than 20 years in public nursing.  I desire to say that it is the intention of any scheme put forward for that purpose to make it, as far as possible, a contributory one.  Fortunately, a considerable number of those engaged in nursing get married.  The circumstances of others may be so affluent that they may not care to continue nursing.  If a contributory scheme be decided on the contributions to be made would be small, but with whatever sum may be granted by the Hospitals' Trust a fund would be made available for those who had given 20 years' service in public nursing and could not get employment.  Under the proposed scheme provision will be made for those who, after 20 years' service, are no longer able to get employment.  I think the amendment is a very fair one, and I hope the Minister and the House will consider it favourably.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  The nurses in this country are perhaps the most important body of people in it.  They give help when it is badly wanted, and they are shockingly badly paid.  I think it is a disgrace that they should be paid such small sums.  Our Irish nurses are very competent people.  I would say that they know their work much better than people in other lines <Col N="2118" /> know theirs, and I think they ought to be helped in every possible way.  I think that after giving 20 years' service as nurses they ought not to be left stranded.</P>

      <P>After the very exhaustive and capable statement that we have had from Senator Dowdall in support of the nurses, I am not going to burden the House with a speech.  I endorse all that the Senator has said.  There is just one point I would like to make, and it is this: there is not the least hesitation on the part of the hospital authorities to put up elaborate housing accommodation for the nurses and provide the most up-to-date equipment for those requiring to use the hospitals.  As Senator Dowdall has pointed out, nurses are not able to continue at their work or, at least, to find fairly regular employment at it after they reach the age of 40 or 45.  Therefore, in view of the fact that elaborate provision can be made not only for the accommodation of nurses in hospitals but for the equipment of the hospitals and of hospital staffs, I think the nurses themselves should be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>I have very great pleasure in supporting the amendment put forward by Senator Dowdall.  Provision has been made for the hospitals out of the sweeps. These nurses give the best part of their lives in the service of the hospitals. Their training period sometimes extends as long as five years.  At the end of it, if they are not kept on the hospital staff they may go out and do private nursing.  The fees they receive while nursing private cases may be sufficient for the time being, but it has to be remembered that they are frequently idle for very long periods.  As a matter of fact, nurses are only engaged for about half the year. Possibly in the winter time they may get a little more employment than in the summer.  In that way the amount of money they receive over the whole year is so small that it is quite impossible for them to make provision out of it for their old age.  As Senator Dowdall has pointed out, a nurse's <Col N="2119" /> life is short.  When she comes to the age of 40 or 45 years, as a rule she gets very little private work to do. Doctors would rather have younger nurses.  Because of that nurses are very often left in straitened circumstances, if they are not in a position to make other provision for themselves. In England they have the very large organisation: a federated superannuation scheme for nurses.  There are 411 participating institutions in it. Of these, 136 are in London and 275 in the provinces and in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.  We have no similar organisation here. The sweepstakes give us an opportunity of at least making a beginning in that direction.  If a certain amount was set aside for pension purposes a scheme could be formulated and made contributory.  I have very great pleasure in supporting Senator Dowdall's amendment.</P>

I think that it is right that some woman who understands the very hard life nurses lead should support this amendment.  I have great pleasure in doing so.

      <P>I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary when he next speaks will indicate that he has completely changed his mind, because I cannot imagine how he could withstand the barrage of opinion against him today. I should like to answer some of <Col N="2120" /> the arguments put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary.  On the last day on which this matter was discussed, the Parliamentary Secretary, being a medical man himself, asked: &ldquo;If you have pensions for nurses, why not have pensions for doctors?&rdquo;  The answer to that is perfectly obvious.  A patient requires an old doctor but a young nurse and a patient is wise in that.  A doctor's effectual life as a professional man continues until he drops in his traces and the older he is the more likely he is to have paying patients. That is one answer.  The second answer is that we are asking for a provision not for future nurses but for the nurses who have given their service in the past 20 years.  The Parliamentary Secretary says their salaries should have been better, that they should be well paid. The fact is that they have not been well paid for the past 20 years and that they have no resources now.  That is the position with which we are dealing.</P>
      <P>The second objection took the form of asking: why not give the money to people on the streets who have no money?  I regard this hospital money, as Senator Sir John Keane regards it, as a <i>donum Dei</i>&mdash;a gift of God&mdash;for the sick people.  With a liberal hand you have given money to provide wards for the sick people, and to provide all sorts of arrangements for their curative treatment.  The nurse is the most essential person connected with the cure of sick people.  Why should not the nurses get some consideration&mdash; especially those nurses who are now about 50 years of age?  As my friend Senator O'Neill says, the nurses in Dublin 30 years ago got the munificent salary of £8 a year.  Their salaries have been very poor during the past 20 years.  They have been unable to make any provision for themselves.  An infirm nurse of 45 years of age has no chance of getting employment in the nursing of another infirm person.  I think that every argument put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary, including the argument of the medical man, has been fully answered.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should change his opinion in view of the considered and, I hope, unanimous opinion of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of this amendment.  My only doubt is whether it goes sufficiently far.  The Section states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Governing Body of any hospital or nursing organisation in Saorstát Eireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Senator's amendment comes in there and reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or any organisation established in Saorstát Eireann for the provision of a pension fund for aged or infirm nurses.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They can supply other grants out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund and, if Senator Dowdall's amendment is accepted, it will empower an existing organisation for pensioning nurses to get grants from this fund.  But I should like that grants should be made to nursing institutions which are in existence already, not for granting pensions to nurses but for nursing.  Take the great body of district nurses who have been doing wonderful work for the poor all these years.  Up to last year, they were supported entirely by private contributions. A pension fund of about £14,000 or £15,000 has been established by private contributions.  We hope to reach £20,000.  But that £20,000 will only provide a miserable pension of about £30 a year to nurses who have spent all their lives in the service of the poor.  That institution&mdash;the Queen's Institute of District Nursing&mdash; got a grant of £10,000 from the Hospitals Fund but with the condition that it should be spent on the provision of nurses for new districts, where they are very badly wanted.  That was a very proper provision and condition to make.  But the more new districts you establish, the more money you require for pensions for the nurses.  And the pension should be more than £30 a year.  It should be at least £50.  By raising the amount to that figure, you will get a very much higher class of person into this noble institution for the nursing of the poor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Not unanimous, because I am sure a number of Senators will be impressed with what I have to say. But there is a degree of unanimity in the House that is rarely found.  I am sorry I do not find myself in agreement with the majority of the Seanad because my experiences in this House have been rather happy.  I think I have had happier relations with members of this House than most of the people who have been associated with legislation here.  It looks as if this were going to be the first big clash.  I need scarcely say that I am in entire sympathy with the sentiment behind this amendment.  I should like to see adequate pensions provided for nurses who have to give up work through incapacity, or infirmity, or old age.  I should like to see their remuneration, prospects in life, hours of duty, status and conditions generally improved. But there are difficulties in the way. What do these amendments propose to do?  They do not set up a fund or pension scheme, nor do they indicate the nature of the scheme to be subsidised or what organisation is to be responsible for the administration of this new pensions fund. We do not know whether certain nurses will be expected to contribute and certain other nurses will be exempt or whether it will be a sort of benevolent fund, out of which ex-gratia payments will be made from time to time.  These are important points and they would require to be cleared up before we could undertake <Col N="2123" /> to make the Hospitals' Fund available for financing such a scheme.  To the mind of the ordinary member of this House, especially a member associated with local administration.  &ldquo;superannuation&rdquo; or &ldquo;pension&rdquo; means something very definite.  It has a twofold object.  In the first place, it is an inducement to continue service and, in the second place, it enables an employer to dispense with the services of a person on account of old age or infirmity or reduced efficiency.  In that way superannuations bear a certain relation to earning capacity.  These amendments would virtually shift from the hospitals, the local authorities and other bodies responsibility for the superannuation of a certain class of their officers and place it on the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  That may not be the intention of the movers of the amendment, but in practice that would be the result.  Once it was admitted that it was the Minister's business to finance a superannuation scheme out of sweepstake money, it would be regarded as the concern of nobody else.  The Minister would either have to make adequate provision for the superannuation of these people or they would have to go without it.  I can see the local authorities shaking off any responsibility they might be considered to have in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering these amendments, we must examine the position of nurses in the public service at the present time. We have nurses and midwives who hold office under local authorities.  Most of these are whole-time pensionable officers. Some of them&mdash;for example, the mental hospital nurses, male and female, numbering about 2,000&mdash; have a special pension scheme in operation already.  I presume they would be included in any scheme financed as a result of the acceptance of this amendment. They contribute to their pension fund.  The amount of the contribution is deducted from their pay.  We have, then, the nurses in the public charitable hospitals.  Some, but not all, of the public charitable hospitals have superannuation schemes in operation. Nurses in the service of nursing associations, the largest of which is <Col N="2124" /> the Jubilee Nurses' Institute, have a pension scheme of their own.  Lastly, we should have to provide for nurses working either in co-operation or singly.  It would appear to me that, so far as the nurses in the service of the local authorities are concerned, at any rate, no pension scheme is necessary. It will, undoubtedly, be argued, as Senator Comyn has argued, that these people are paid inadequate salaries and that, as a consequence, the retiring allowances by way of pension are inadequate.</P>
    <P>While I repeat that the remedy for that is not the subsidising of their pensions out of the Hospitals' Fund, or out of any other fund, but in creating public opinion that will insist on these people being paid adequate salaries&mdash; whatever adequate salaries are considered to be.  If we go about it in the other way, and if we subsidise the retiring allowances of nurses in the employment of local authorities out of another fund, what must be the result? The inevitable result will be that it would pay a nurse better to get out of the public service, and to take the pension she is entitled to by law, plus the additional pension provided out of this fund.  In spite of the arguments put forward by members of this House, whose sincerity is not in question at all, I submit that the acceptance of the amendment it utterly impossible at present, and that it would be impossible to operate it.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir Edward Bigger mentioned that a pension scheme was in operation in Gt. Britain and Northern Ireland.  I am aware that a federated superannuation scheme for nurses in hospitals was set on foot some five years ago in Great Britain, and that it has attracted considerable support. Already more than half of the voluntary hospitals are participating in it. Senator Sir Edward Bigger did not tell the House that under that scheme the hospitals pay a contribution of 10 per cent. and the nurses 5 per cent. of their salaries and emoluments.  There is no apparent reason why the voluntary hospitals in this country should not set up a similar organisation, and why they should not contribute on somewhat the same basis as in Great <Col N="2125" /> Britain and Northern Ireland towards a pension scheme.  Indirectly it would be financed out of the Hospitals' Fund, in this way, that if they were contributing towards such pension fund, the overhead charges and cost of maintenance would be correspondingly increased.  These matters are taken into consideration in the minutest detail when the allocation is being decided, or when the amount of an endowment is being fixed.  In that indirect way, if they increase overhead charges, either by paying increased salaries to nurses, or by contributing to a pensions fund, they could, to an extent, at any rate, be recouped later.  I do not know if I can say anything more to convince members of this House that the amendment is impracticable.  It is very desirable that increased pensions or superannuation allowances should be provided for nurses.  Nobody would be better satisfied if such a scheme were in operation than I would be, but I must repeat that this is not the best method of doing it and that there are difficulties in the way that, to me, appear to be insurmountable.</P>
    <P>A question was raised by Senator Brown regarding the Jubilee nurses. As the Senator stated we have already contributed towards the Jubilee Nursing Institution and contributed very liberally, but the money has been earmarked for the opening up of new districts.  We have never been asked to contribute towards the pensions fund of Jubilee nurses.  The Jubilee Nursing Organisation being an institution which has for its sole or principal object the nursing of and the provision of nurses for poor persons, we could contribute towards a pension fund for such nurses.  They give their entire services to the poor.</P>

      <P>If a nursing institution gives the greater portion of its services to the poor we can contribute towards a pension fund.  Here we are asked to contribute to a pension fund for all nurses, just because they are <Col N="2126" /> nurses.  Nurses are paid; they may be paid inadequately.  Coming back to the doctors again&mdash;I do not see Senator Comyn here now&mdash;I would remind the House that doctors give their services entirely free.  Many doctors, to their credit, give their services free in the Dublin hospitals and in some Cork and Galway hospitals. The services of the most eminent men in the medical profession are at the disposal of the poor, absolutely free of charge.  Some of these men are not men with money. Regardless of what anyone may say, some of these men are poor, and many of them die in poverty.</P>

      <P>I say in all seriousness that if the principle were to be adopted at all, doctors who are in destitution, and who give their whole lives to the services of the people, would be equally entitled to have portion of the fund earmarked for a pensions fund.  I question if the same argument could not apply with equal force to wardsmaids and to lay people, who have no professional qualifications at all, but who have devoted their whole lives to the service of the sick poor in public institutions and voluntary hospitals.  If a contributory or other scheme is set up, to which an allocation could be made, and if a definite scheme were in operation, if we could see exactly where it was leading, the question might be seriously considered.  If such a scheme comes to operate in this country there is nothing to prevent future legislation dealing with it.  This is not the last piece of legislation of this kind that will come before this House.  An amending Bill could be brought in, and the matter could be met in that way. As things stand at present, I do not think the amendment could be accepted.  I hope the House will not force it.</P>

    <P>(5)  Whenever the Minister makes under this section a grant out of the Hospitals Trust Fund, he shall specify the purposes for which such grant is to be expended and may attach to the receipt of such grant such conditions (whether to be performed before or after such receipt) as he thinks proper for securing the due expenditure of such grant on the purposes specified by the Minister or for securing or attaining any other object.</P>
    <P>(7)  A grant made by the Minister under this section for the benefit of any existing or proposed hospital or nursing organisation may be made for all or any of the following purposes, that is to say:&mdash;</P>

      <P>Section 24, sub-section (5).  To add at the end of the sub-section the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The provisions of this sub-section shall not apply to any scheme for the superannuation or benefit of nurses in sickness or old age such as is specified in sub-section (1) of the preceding section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (5) the Minister takes precautions to see that any grant made is properly expended.  I think it would scarcely be practicable for the Minister to supervise the administration of a grant to individual nurses.  I am not at all insistent on the amendment but I should like, having regard to what has already passed, to have it referred to the Report Stage and we shall then see if it is necessary to move it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we decide upon that, I think that the Senator would be very ill-advised to ask for the non-application of this sub-section to the proposal because the case that was made was that this was a permissive amendment and that it would be left with the Minister to decide the application of it, and the vetoing of any faulty scheme or otherwise.  If this sub-section is not to be applied to the scheme in question, then that argument should not have been used.  I think it is essential that the Minister should be able to specify the purpose.  He may attach a condition that the new <Col N="2132" /> pensions fund shall not be applicable to those in receipt of pension from poor law hospitals but that it should apply only to those who are not otherwise provided for.  I think it is essential that the Minister should have power to make conditions in this way just as in any other scheme.</P>

      <P>I have no strong view on this matter.  I put it down because I thought the difficulties of administration would be too onerous.  Let us take the case of a nurse who becomes entitled to a pension, big or small, from a poor law institution, say £30 a year.  I think the Minister once it is granted takes no further interest in the way of direction or regulation with regard to the expenditure of the £30 a year.  That is simply paid over to the nurse.  If Senator Johnson thinks that the provision of any fund that may be applied for nurses' pensions should be subject to control of the Minister, I have no objection whatever but I would ask the Senator to think it over between now and the Report Stage.  If he opposes it then I shall not force it. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 24, sub-section (7).  Before paragraph (f) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(f)  the establishment of an institution for the treatment of patients by radium and X-ray therapy, the purchase of the necessary equipment for such institution and the endowment of such institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed institution or hospital is intended for the use of patients suffering from cancer where they can be treated by radium and X-rays. When cancer is not treated, there is a long trying illness with ever-increasing pain and suffering before death occurs.  There is no reason why patients suffering from cancer should not be treated; there is every hope of cure when the disease is treated early and before it has spread.  There are only two effective methods of treatment.  One is treatment by surgical means which aims at <Col N="2133" /> the removal of the growth together with a certain amount of the surrounding tissues.  The second is treatment by radium which acts through the rays from the radium.  These rays destroy the cancer cell.  There is no mutilation of the part affected and if it is an organ, such as the tongue, it can pursue its functions after treatment.  Radium is, I think, the only substance in the world that gives off invisible rays which have this effect on cancer cells.  It is for that reason that I say that we should have an institution in the Free State where we could not only treat cases by this method but where we could train medical men in the use of radium. Medical men throughout the country could send cases to the central institution to receive this treatment.</P>
    <P>I might repeat what I said on Second Reading of this Bill, that nine persons die from cancer every day in the Free State, and that it is estimated that there are between 5,000 and 6,000 persons suffering from cancer in the State.  The vast majority of these have no hope of receiving the benefit of radium treatment.  I think it is criminal to allow all those who are suffering from cancer without hope or cure, or relief from their suffering, to continue to do so, when we have it in our power to make the necessary provision to relieve them.  I should like to quote from an appeal made by a hospital started some years ago for the treatment of cancer by radium.  This was an appeal for funds to establish an X-ray department in connection with the hospital in order to supplement the radium treatment given there.  The appeal says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The value of radium treatment for cancer is now definitely established.... A large proportion of cases can be cured if treated during the early stages of the disease. Even in the advanced cases, those in which no surgeon could attempt operation, cures have been shown to result from treatment by radium and great alleviation of suffering in most of the cases.  It should be available for all.  After seven years' work at the clinic the results are very encouraging.  To date, 94 per <Col N="2134" /> cent. of the early operable cases of cancer and 79 per cent. of the borderline cases are living and with very few exceptions are free from all signs and symptoms of cancer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope that the Seanad will see its way to adopt the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Senator to show, for my guidance, why this new proposal is necessary in view of the definition of &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; in the Bill.  In the Bill we are told that the word &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; means an institution or organisation which affords medical, surgical or dental treatment to human beings and includes any institution or organisation for the prevention, treatment or cure of human beings.  We are told that it also includes institutions or organisations for carrying on medical research, but does not include any institution or organisation conducted by persons for their private profit. The only assumption I can make as a reason for this amendment, is that no organisation at present exists to cover the purposes desired by the Senator, and that this new proposal conceives of such an organisation, for the establishment of which the Minister is to provide funds.  I wonder is that necessary? Is it necessary that this amendment should be inserted to enable the Minister to provide funds, or is the proposal not already covered by the definition of &ldquo;hospital&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>What is aimed at is a new institution, a central institution situated in Dublin to which patients can be sent from all parts of the Free State.  It is not desirable that it should be attached to any hospital because we want the whole medical profession to be interested in it.  We desire that they should have full confidence in it.  I am aiming really at what is being done on the Continent and in America.  In most cases they call it a &ldquo;radio-therapeutic clinic&rdquo;; sometimes they call it an &ldquo;institute&rdquo; and sometimes a &ldquo;centre.&rdquo;  They very seldom use the word &ldquo;hospital.&rdquo;  I see no reason why we should not use the word &ldquo;hospital.&rdquo;  We do not use the words &ldquo;cancer hospital&rdquo; for a very obvious reason&mdash;simply because in <Col N="2135" /> many of these cases the patients do not believe they are suffering from cancer.  That is the time we want to get them under treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point. The point is that the object the Senator is seeking to serve seems to be included in the last three lines of the definition of the word &ldquo;hospital&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;and also includes institutions and organisations for carrying on medical research.&rdquo; Then there is the proviso: &ldquo;which does not include any institution or organisation conducted by persons for their private profit.&rdquo;  Is it to get over the last two lines that the Senator wishes to have this new amendment inserted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardBigger" hpid="Sir E. Coey Bigger Sir E. Coey Bigger">
      <NameTxt>Sir E. Coey Bigger</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of this amendment.  I quite anticipated what Senator Johnson would say and what I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will say, that there is power already under sub-section (7) of Section 24 to make a grant to the proposed hospital, which would include an institution for the treatment of patients by means of radium and X-ray.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is quite likely that the Minister and the trustees could do what Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger wants under this Bill without any amendment, but the value of the amendment is that it draws a kind of statutory attention to the fact that this is one of the most important things wanted in this country where we have none of it.  This is practically the only civilised country that has not got a separate institution&mdash;in England, there are several separate institutions&mdash;for the treatment, not only of cancer, but every other disease by these means.  If it is to be set up otherwise than for private profit, why not?  It will be all the better, because anybody can go there without private profit to anybody.  I quite admit that it is possible that this can be done without this amendment, but I do think that it is a very good amendment to <Col N="2136" /> put into the Bill for the purpose of calling attention to the absolute necessity for that kind of institution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">

      <P>I should like strongly to support this amendment.  In this country at the present time&mdash;I am speaking as a layman now&mdash;we are very backward in research work.  We want more research work into mental diseases and we want research work into cancer and other diseases.  As a rule, we leave this to other countries to do for us.  We leave it to Vienna and other places where there are big hospitals but, considering that all this money is coming into this country for hospitals at present, I think it is time that we began to stand on our own legs, so to speak.  Instead of other countries doing this research work for us, we should be doing it for them. We have doctors in this city and we have hospitals in this city of which any country in the world might well be proud, and there is no reason why they should not be encouraged to do this work instead of letting other nations do it for us.  You have in Grangegorman Mental Hospital a research department&mdash;I do not know the correct term for it&mdash;which has been lying idle for years.  The stuff is all there but there is no money to get the doctors to do the research work, which is absolutely essential.  Insanity is increasing in this country and, unfortunately, there is no disease increasing more rapidly than cancer.  I have not got statistics.  Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger has given some to the House, but I know, amongst my acquaintances, that there is no disease increasing to such an alarming extent as cancer, and I think that, under the circumstances, the amendment should be supported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker appears to have wandered into a new field. The question at issue is not the establishment of a research institution. We have already inserted in the Bill a section enabling the Minister to make allocations for financing research. This amendment sets out that, above and before all things, we shall set up a radium institute&mdash;for all practical purposes, that is what it means&mdash;for <Col N="2137" /> the radium and X-ray treatment of cancer in particular and, presumably, skin diseases and so on.  That may be very desirable and, very probably, when the question comes to be examined in detail, it will be found to be desirable, but we are setting up a Hospitals' Commission for the specific purpose of advising the Minister as to how far the existing institutions provide adequate and up-to-date scientific treatment for the destitute poor and, before we can commit ourselves to the principle of setting up a central institute, to which, presumably, all cancer cases would be sent, it is necessary to investigate the field of treatment and equipment in the existing institutions and to see how far we can secure the co-operation of these voluntary institutions if we are to set up a Central Institution in the future.  If we set up such an institution to-morrow, and the existing hospitals said: &ldquo;We will continue to treat cancer.  We have adequate facilities here and we will continue to treat our own cancer cases and we will not send them to your Central Institution,&rdquo; we would not have got very far.  If we cannot get the full co-operation of the voluntary institutions, we can get nowhere in relation to this.  As I said, it will, very probably, be found that we will get that co-operation and the desirability of setting up such an institution will be admitted.  I am sure that the Hospitals' Commission will eventually report to us to that effect, but we have ample scope in the Bill at the present time to set up and to finance such an institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has been made that there is greater urgency in relation to this particular matter than in relation to many other matters, but if we were to specify specialised treatment for cancer by setting up a radium institute, other people might say, if not with equal justice, at any rate, with a certain amount of reason, that there are other pressing problems of public health, and other diseases that are not adequately treated or provided for and for the treatment of which we have not proper equipment and that that should be set out in the Bill.  In fact if you follow this line to its logical <Col N="2138" /> conclusion, you could set out in the Bill every institution that the Minister proposes to set up as a result of the report following the investigation by the Hospitals' Commission and I think that would lead us to a very absurd position.</P>
    <P>I discussed all this matter with Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger and a number of other medical men from the City of Dublin.  We had a long and interesting discussion on the subject. I outlined my views and intentions and I pointed out some of the difficulties and stated that I would personally interest myself to the extent of asking the Hospitals' Commission to give this particular branch of medical science their early attention, with a view to giving the Minister a report for his guidance on the existing equipment and institutions at the earliest possible date.  They appeared to me to be perfectly satisfied.  Even Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger appeared to be, if not perfectly satisfied, at least moderately well satisfied, and I am rather surprised to-day if he intends to force this amendment through the House. Possibly, he can secure a majority for it but I think it is unreasonable and I think that the objective the Senator has in view will be achieved probably in a shorter space of time in the manner which I indicated to him and the other representatives of the medical profession and which I have now indicated to the House.</P>

It was composed of very eminent medical men and included two of our experts, one the principal expert in radium and another an expert in X-rays, and there were also other men who are deeply interested, one being a prominent surgeon.  The Parliamentary Secretary received them very well and I think he gave them a good deal of encouragement. What I wanted and the object of my amendment was to ensure that there would be no delay and after the Parliamentary Secretary's expression of his opinion that there would be less delay by leaving the matter to him and his announcement that he will recomment <Col N="2139" /> the Hospitals' Commission to go into this matter at the earliest possible date, with the leave of the House, I withdraw my amendment.</P>

    <P>(6)  If, after the making of a grant out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund under this section to any grantee and before payment of such grant or before the making of any particular payment in respect of such grant, the Minister is satisfied that any condition attached under the foregoing sub-section to the receipt of such grant has not been complied with by such grantee, the Minister may certify to the National Hospital Trustees that such condition has not been complied with and upon the Minister so certifying, the National Hospital Trustees shall not make, and such grantee shall cease to be entitled to, any such payment of or in respect of such grant or to any future payment in respect thereof unless and until the Minister otherwise directs.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. Its purpose is to prevent Government interference with a grant which was more or less a windfall: the sweeps money which came to relieve the hospitals of an overdraft.  If the internal administration of the hospitals is to be made contingent on the amount of money they get it will be a very <Col N="2143" /> serious interference on the part of the Government with a system which has hitherto survived on public charity.  It would be empowering the Government to hold a pistol to the heads of hospital authorities and saying: &ldquo;If you do not allow us to arrange your staffs and see after the administration of the hospital you will get no money.&rdquo;  Already a Commission has been set up to deal with that, and I do not think the Government should be further empowered to interfere.  The purpose of this amendment is to have it set down definitely that there will not be any further interference with the recommendations of the Hospitals Sweeps Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will probably say that this amendment is unnecessary because the Bill practically says: &ldquo;If you do not take a grant there will not be any interference, but if you do take a grant then we can attach conditions.&rdquo;  It is under Section 17, I think, that the real danger arises.  The object of the amendment that I asked the leave of the House to withdraw earlier this evening and that I intend to move to Section 17 on the Report Stage was intended to deal with that.  Under Section 17 of the Bill it shall be the duty of the Hospitals' Commission, on their own motion,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to inquire into, examine, and survey generally the hospital and nursing facilities existing in Saorstát Eireann and to collect, record and digest information in relation to such facilities, the needs of the people for such facilities, and the adjustment of such facilities to such needs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now that applies to all hospitals.  It is a very welcome thing because every well conducted, decent hospital will invite inspection of that kind and be perfectly willing to give all the information possible.  But the section goes on to say that it shall also be the duty of the Hospitals' Commission:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;to investigate and report to the Minister on every matter relating to hospital or nursing facilities in Saorstát Eireann which is referred to <Col N="2144" /> them by the Minister for such investigation and report; and</P>
    <P>(c)  at the request of the Minister, to make and submit to the Minister schemes for the improvement and co-ordination of hospital or nursing or both hospital and nursing facilities in the whole or any particular part of Saorstát Eireann;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under that particular sub-section the Hospitals' Commission can make a scheme which may involve, and probably will involve, hospitals which are not taking any grant under the Hospitals Bill.  In that way they may have power to interfere with the internal administration of these hospitals. That is the real danger in the Bill, and it is to that danger that I intend to move an amendment on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I am not able to speak with any knowledge of the working of hospitals, but it seems to me that the effect of this amendment would be to destroy the Bill almost wholly.  The Minister is taking powers to give grants to hospitals under certain conditions. If the purpose of the amendment is to deny the Minister power &ldquo;to interfere with or in any way to affect the executive, administrative or financial management or control or the internal policy and affairs of any hospital&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>But this amendment deals with hospitals that take a grant. The Senator a moment ago was not arguing, not formally at least, his own amendment that he withdrew earlier, but in his argument for the amendment which he withdrew inferentially, I think, proved the unwisdom of Senator Staines's proposal.  I think the effect of the amendment would be practically to destroy the Bill.</P>

      <P>I find it rather difficult to follow Senator Johnson's argument that the effect of the acceptance of the amendment would be to destroy the Bill.  I take it that the purpose of the sweepstakes was to raise funds&mdash;not to secure the reform of hospital administration&mdash;to relieve the hospitals of charges which they could not defray <Col N="2145" /> out of the source of income they had at that time at their disposal.  So far as I can recollect, there was never, in connection with any of the previous Bills dealing with this matter, any suggestion that the internal administration of the hospitals should be interfered with.  If there had been, I doubt whether there would be a general acceptance of the scheme that has now been working for some years. The purpose of these sweeps was to provide funds to relieve the hospitals of heavy burdens which could not otherwise be raised.  Senator Johnson has prophesied that the effect of the amendment would be to destroy the Bill.  I confess that I cannot see how it would do anything of the kind. The Senator has not put forward the slightest bit of argument to show that what he has indicated is at all likely to come to pass.  I think the amendment is a reasonable one, and unless the Parliamentary Secretary can put forward fairly sound arguments against it, I think the House ought to insist on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>An amendment in almost identical terms to the one now before the Seanad was discussed in considerable detail in the Dáil.  I felt bound to oppose the principle of the amendment in the Dáil, and I feel bound to oppose the principle of it here.  Now the power conferred on the Minister</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to make a grant out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund for any of the purposes of this section shall not include or be deemed to include any power or authority to interfere with or in any way to affect the executive, administrative or financial management or control or the internal policy and affairs of any hospital or nursing organisation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that amendment is accepted by the House, and it becomes incorporated in the Bill, it can be interpreted in such a way as to make it impossible for the Minister to attach any conditions whatever to a grant.  It is so comprehensive that there is no condition that might be attached to a grant, allocation or endowment that could not be interpreted as cutting across &ldquo;the executive, administrative or financial <Col N="2146" /> management or control,&rdquo; and if it did not come under any one of these headings, it would be caught under &ldquo;the internal policy and affairs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I inquired in the Dáil from some Deputies who were advocating the acceptance of an amendment in identical terms if they could give me any enlightenment as to what was meant by &ldquo;internal policy.&rdquo;  A very eminent member of that House confessed that he did not know: that it might mean anything. What does &ldquo;internal policy&rdquo; mean? Senator Bigger, Senator brown and other Senators have expressed anxiety to have a central radium institution set up in this country for the treatment of cancer.  If that institution is to be a success, we must have the co-operation of the existing institutions, in which the treatment of cancer is undertaken, to agree to send their cancer cases in future to our central institution. It might be considered desirable and advisable&mdash;it might indeed be necessary&mdash;to make it a condition of a grant in the case of such institutions &mdash;I merely give this by way of illustration as one of the things that might be necessary&mdash;that they would send their cancer cases to the central radium institution that we set up, an institution specially equipped for the special treatment of cancer cases. If we were to attach such a condition and if this amendment were incorporated in the Bill, then these institutions could say to us: &ldquo;That is an infringement of our internal policy, it is an infringement of our administrative control or, at any rate it is an incursion into our affairs and we cannot agree to it.&rdquo; There is no question about it but that the proposed new section could be relied upon to make it impossible for the Minister to attach any conditions.</P>
    <P>Let us consider another aspect of it; another possible condition that it might be considered advisable to attach to a grant.  Let us take the case of a children's hospital.  Would the medical members of this House agree with me that it would be an advisable thing to attach a condition <Col N="2147" /> to an allocation to a children's hospital that the milk supplied to it should be tubercular free?  It is an actual fact that, in very recent times in this city, the milk supplied to a children's hospital was not tubercular free.  It strikes me that it might be desirable to have power to attach such a condition to a grant. Senators may disagree with me, but I put that forward as a possible condition that it might be desirable to attach in the interests of the children.</P>
    <P>Again, in the legislation that is being repealed by this Bill there was a provision that in the year before the passage of the Sweepstakes Act, 25 per cent. of the beds in the participating hospitals should have been available for the poor, free of charge.  That condition is not in the present Bill.  Why?  For two reasons.  In the first place, it was found impossible of operation.  Legislation was brought in here specifically excluding certain institutions from this condition of making 25 per cent. of the beds free.  We did not include it in our legislation for the further reason that we are not, at this stage, in a position to say that 25 per cent. of free beds in any particular institution will satisfy the needs of the community in so far as the poorer sections are concerned.  We have first to get the survey that we are setting out to get through the instrumentality of the Hospitals Commission as to the existing provision.  In the case of a particular hospital, catering for a particular class of disease, it may be found necessary that it should provide 25 per cent., 30 per cent., or 40 per cent. of its beds free and it will have to be endowed accordingly.  Another hospital catering for a different class of disease will not require the same percentage.  We have not the figures before us at the moment to guide us as to what particular percentage of free beds may be necessary in any particular institution.  When we have carried out our survey, and when the Minister comes to make allocations in future, a condition will be attached to each allocation and to the endowment that a certain percentage of the beds provided in these institutions that are <Col N="2148" /> equipped out of the Hospital Fund will be available free to the poor.  If we do not preserve that right to the Minister, to attach such a condition, there is no safeguard whatever for the poor in the future.</P>
    <P>People have said to me: &ldquo;You can trust the voluntary hospitals; they have done good work for the poor in the past.&rdquo;  I admit all that.  They have done excellent work for the poor in the past, but this is essentially a business proposition.  We are handing over large sums to secure that certain treatment will be available to the poor.  It is our bounden duty to ensure that, as a result of the expenditure or investment of these moneys, the results desired will be available to the poor and that they will not be dependent on the good-will of anybody in the future.  People say: &ldquo;The voluntary hospitals have built up wonderful institutions; they have given a wonderful service to the poor and you ought to trust them.&rdquo;  To that, I reply: &ldquo;Why if it was unnecessary to safeguard the poor for the future, was there a clause put in providing that 25 per cent. of the beds should be free?&rdquo;  If it was necessary then, it is necessary now.  If this amendment were accepted, and the Minister, in making an allocation, said: &ldquo;We require 40 per cent. of your beds free if this extension and equipment is provided without additional cost to you and if we assure you that the future maintenance of these beds will not be a charge on your institution,&rdquo; it could well happen that the management committee of such an institution would say to the Minister that that condition was an interference with their executive, administrative or financial management or control, or that it was against their internal policy, and that they could not comply with it.  Or they might take the money first and go to court and ask for an interpretation of this clause afterwards.  If it was found that the Minister had imposed a condition which had no statutory authority, they could hold the money and make any provision they liked for the poor.  These are the reasons I am opposed to this amendment. Regardless of what attitude the <Col N="2149" /> Seanad may adopt, I am satisfied that they are sound and convincing reasons. If we are to safeguard the principle of this Bill, if we are to achieve the objective which every member of this House, I am sure, would like to see achieved&mdash;that is, to make the best treatment that medical science can provide available to the sick poor free of charge and available to people who can only pay a moderate sum per week&mdash;it is necessary that the House should reject this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Parliamentary Secretary has been very far from convincing on this question.  I am not in very close touch with the administration of the hospitals and I am not aware if any conditions up to the present have been imposed in connection with grants made.  The Parliamentary Secretary has hinged his whole argument upon what might happen if, upon the allocation of a grant to some hospital, a certain quota of free beds was insisted upon as a condition.  I am not at all certain that that would be considered by any intelligent person as an interference with the executive, administrative or financial management or control of a hospital. Only in a very far-fetched way would it be so regarded.  If this amendment is rejected, whoever has the allocation of grants can not only insist upon a certain number of free beds but can also interfere with the autonomy of these hospitals in much wider and bigger ways.  There may be some precautions which the Parliamentary Secretary is in duty bound to provide, but there is obviously a limit to which interference in the internal administration of these institutions should go. Between these two views there is room for some arrangement by which what is aimed at in the amendment can be secured while the very mild interference which the Parliamentary Secretary suggested he aimed at can also be secured.  Merely to reject this amendment is to leave the way open for an absolute dictatorship in the affairs of the hospitals.  I think that that is not desirable.  If the Parliamentary Secretary insists upon resistance to this amendment, he should only obtain the acquiescence of the Seanad <Col N="2150" /> by a promise that, on Report Stage, some arrangement will be devised which will secure both what the amendments aim at and what the Parliamentary Secretary wishes to safeguard.</P>

      <P>I think that it is well to state to the Seanad that beyond and above the very convincing case the Parliamentary Secretary has made, there is a further aspect of this amendment which should be adverted to.  The Minister referred to in the Bill is also the Minister for Local Government and Public Health&mdash;the Minister who has power to make grants to local government institutions.  I can imagine the quandary in which the Minister would find himself if he were precluded from making a grant to one of these poor law institutions if he attempted to interfere with their executive, administrative or financial management or control. That is one of the effects of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the amendment, which can be modified to meet the view of the Parliamentary Secretary.  The general principle is a very good one.  Take the other side of the picture&mdash;the side the amendment is trying to frustrate.  The Government could go into any hospital and say: &ldquo;We do not like so and so as your chairman; we do not like that doddering old doctor&rdquo;&mdash;and out they go.  We want to prevent that.  We want to prevent these institutions which grew from charitable institutions during the years from being refuges for Government nominees.  That is putting it, perhaps, too plainly and too bluntly.  I do not suggest, of course, that the Government has such ill intentions, but we cannot trust a Government which empowered itself to take a quarter of the money subscribed to the sweepstakes for charitable institutions.  We cannot trust a Government capable of doing that to keep its finger out of the internal administration of the hospitals. The Parliamentary Secretary made a very good but a specious argument about a cancer institution which might be set up here.  Some hospitals, he said, might say to parents: &ldquo;You <Col N="2151" /> cannot go to this institution; it did not get a grant.&rdquo;  But what about the patients?  Do you think that you could block them from going to any hospitals where they thought they would get cured?  If this beneficent substance&mdash; radium&mdash;was a cure for cancer&mdash;I have never yet known of a cure by that means&mdash;nothing would prevent the people from going to a radium institute if it were set up.  What we want is to keep the Government's finger out of the pie.</P>
      <P>There is a certain sentiment behind this work.  Take the case of nurses. They have work to do which is more disgusting than that of any housemaid in the country.  They do it owing to the idea that they are raised slightly higher in the social scale than the ordinary housemaid.  At 60 or 70 years, they are left to end their days in the kitchen of a hospital as senior sister or they go into private work and are thrown on the scrap heap at 40 or 50. Why do they do this?  Because of this idea&mdash;service in the cause of charity. That runs through the most underpaid profession in Ireland.  And in Ireland nurses are paid worse than in most civilised countries.  In a hospital in Liverpool nurses are paid from the day they enter.  That ideal of service for nothing continues right through the staffs and boards that administer these hospitals.  You will read the names of men in big positions in the business world who give a great portion of their time to the internal administration of the hospitals.  These people may not be <i>personae gratae</i> with the Government, and we may have crude interference with the personnel of the committees of the hospitals on the part of a Government which did not keep its fingers off a quarter of the sums subscribed for the hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment does not mean that the poor should be shut out from any service that is going.  It merely means that the door should not be left open to possible victimisation.  The internal administration of hospitals may be wasteful but there is already a Hospitals' Commission which considers that in awarding the grants.  The Hospitals' Commission prevents enterprise <Col N="2152" /> on the part of hospitals if it does not think the enterprise is advisable. You cannot enlarge a hospital without the consent of this Commission and it is somewhat sinister to see resistance to this amendment which is merely an effort to keep the internal administration of the hospitals out of Government control.  A condition for the allocation of a grant could easily be made contingent on a change of personnel.  It really comes down to a question of saving the personnel of these hospitals. We know already that if you want to apply for a position in a country dispensary you have to pay £1 for the right to present yourself to the Appointments Commission.  That is an instance of a tax which is utterly unjustifiable.</P>
    <P>I may have exaggerated, but the amendment is perfectly capable, as Senator Milroy said, of being adjusted. If the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with Senator Johnson, that the amendment would stultify the whole Bill, that is a matter for adjustment.  It is a question of defining what is &ldquo;internal administration&rdquo; of a hospital and not allowing the tempting appointments that hospitals might be considered to offer to be made a condition of the award of money.  Though men are paid for attending hospitals, and though some of the hospitals have far too great a proportion of unfree beds, these hospitals up to a few years ago grew and were administered by men who were paid nothing.  We want these men who were never rewarded to be saved from possible victimisation.  Originally, as we know, the sweep legislation was permitted to go through to save the banks in respect of the overdrafts of the hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>The point we should remember is that the sweepstakes were originally established to help poor patients, and not the hospitals. If the Government are to have the right to interfere there is no protection whatever for the very poor.  Upon whom is there greater responsibility for looking after the poor than upon the Government?  The Government are administering the funds and it is their duty to see that the poor get a <Col N="2153" /> fair deal.  Apparently some Senators will not trust the present Government to have any control or any power whatever, yet in the original Act it was felt necessary to ensure that for the poor there should be a percentage of free beds.  That lapsed because it could not be enforced.  It was not suitable to many of the hospitals and, as I am in touch with the very poor, I know that it is more difficult now than ever for poor persons to get into hospitals.  Are we going to allow that state of affairs to continue?  It will continue unless we authorise someone in authority to see that the poor get a fair deal.  At present the very poor attending the dispensaries of most of the charitable hospitals have to pay a contribution.  That is a big sacrifice on the part of the very poor.  Are we ever going to have that charged?  However much money the hospitals get the poor will have to put their hands in their pockets for contributions.  Who will they appeal to unless we give this power to the Government?  Interference in hospital management is no new thing, because local authorities that make a contribution to some hospitals in this country insist on being represented on the boards. That is an established fact.  Why should we lay it down here that the Government of the country has no right whatever to interfere on behalf of poor patients?  Those who want to do that are sacrosanct.  They are above the Government.  If we pass this amendment no one has any right to say that the poor must get a fair deal, because the Government will be cut out and the hospital authorities will dominate the situation.  The amendment is unnecessary and unjustified.</P>

      <P>I am afraid Senator Foran is wrong in his argument.  This money is subscribed for the hospitals and it is not Government money.  The Government has no control, except over 25 per cent. which they are taking for income tax which was not taken before.  If the Government wants to run a sweep I venture to suggest it would not be a success.  The sweeps are a success because they are run for the hospitals.  The Parliamentary <Col N="2154" /> Secretary's argument was not convincing. He stated that he could not make an order dealing with certified milk. The public health authorities can do that if the Minister likes to make such an order.  I suggest to the Minister that there is no use making an order that the hospitals are to use only certified milk while the children outside the hospitals have to use any milk they can get.  Most of the milk sold in Dublin is wholesome, because the public health authorities see to it, but a very small proportion of it is certified milk.  It is only lately in Swords and other places that tubercular free herds have been established.  While Dublin was supplying certified milk to babies and to infants, a township, which has now been taken into Greater Dublin, was supplying milk that was not certified.</P>

I have never been refused a bed by any hospital for any patient I sent there, whether they were paying patients or not.  As I have sent in a good many poor patients I can <Col N="2155" /> say that of every hospital in Dublin except one.  The one exception is an hospital to which I was never asked to send a patient.  If a patient wanted to go to that hospital I am sure the story would be the same.  It is unfair to suggest that the hospitals in Dublin have not looked after the poor.

      <P>I think it is humanly impossible to draft an amendment covering the points Senators have in mind, that cannot be interpreted to interfere with the purposes of the Bill. As I assured members of the Dáil, there is no intention whatever to interfere in the ordinary management or administrative affairs of voluntary hospitals.  We can only concern ourselves with the dangers to the present Bill.  Members of various Parties have from time to time expressed themselves in similar terms, as having no doubt that the voluntary hospitals had nothing to fear from the present Minister or Parliamentary Secretary, as far as internal policy was concerned. I believe that would represent the feeling of the vast majority of this House, that they have no genuine fear that we are going to interfere in the ordinary day-to-day management of hospitals.  Senator Gogarty was not a bit convincing, and I do not think he meant to convince.  Certainly he did not appear to be convincing.  He did his best to make a case, but he was afraid of the uphill fight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a good deal of discussion about this matter.  If it is not disposed of now we will have all this discussion over again at a later stage, and all to no purpose. I think the principle at stake should be disposed of now.  The amendment cuts across the entire principles and intentions of the Bill.  Everyone who has given any thought to the subject admits that there is a considerable amount of overlapping in voluntary institutions at the present time.  Practically every voluntary institution in the Saorstát has set out to equip <Col N="2157" /> itself to deal with every possible form of human disease.  That may be a slight exaggeration, but only slight. Obviously we must have duplication of effort there.  We cannot have every voluntary hospital filled with the most up-to-date equipment for the treatment of human disease.  It cannot be done.  We must have co-ordination if we are to get anywhere. How are we to get co-ordination? If the Minister has not power to say when making an allocation to an hospital that certain institutions are earmarked for the treatment of certain diseases and are equipped for the treatment of certain diseases&mdash; and I have in mind the Radium Institute&mdash;if the hospitals say that they are going to start equipping themselves to treat every form of human disease, and that they are going to continue doing so, the Minister will get nowhere.  If he is not in a position to attach conditions to the making of a grant there is going to be no co-ordination. Instead of getting a co-ordinated system and reasonable hospital facilities for the poor, as a result of the financial opportunity offered, we will produce a condition of absolute chaos in hospital service.  The members of this House know that, yet they insist on an amendment in these terms, or in a modified form. An amendment cannot be drafted that will not be used by recalcitrant hospitals that do not want to co-operate.  There is not a shadow of doubt about it.  Yet the House will not trust the present Ministry not to put any Communist policy into operation, if that is what is <Col N="2158" /> deep down in the minds of some Senators.</P>

If there are any powers in that Bill that can be abused by a future administration, the fact that these powers are in the Bill will not make the administration abuse them, but if there is a future administration that thinks it has not sufficient control over the voluntary hospitals, it will take the necessary legislative steps to secure that power.  It is no protection, so far as any future administration may be concerned, to put a clause into the Bill which you consider may be of a protective nature.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (7) of this section, the various purposes for which grants will be made are set out.  As they are set out in detail, I think the courts might hold that any exclusion should act in a positive manner.  There is no mention of research amongst these purposes, but I think it is the intention of the Government that grants should be made for research.  Yet research is not included in the sub-heads.  I suggest that that matter should be considered before the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 25 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>25.&mdash;(1)  The Minister may at any time, at the request of any person controlling or about to establish a lending library for supplying books for the use of patients or inmates in hospitals, make a grant (to be known and in this section referred to as a hospital library grant) to such person out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund, of such amount as the Minister shall think proper, for the purpose of defraying all or any of the expenses of such lending library.</P>
      <P>(2)  A hospital library grant may, as the Minister shall in each case think proper, be in the form of a sum to be paid out of the capital of the Hospitals' Trust Fund or in the form of payments to be made annually, for such period as the Minister shall direct, out of the income of the Hospitals' Trust Fund and the National Hospital Trustees shall, if so directed by the Minister, set aside a portion of the capital of the Hospitals' Trust Fund and invest such portion for the purpose of securing any hospital library grant made in the form of payments to be made annually.</P>
      <P>(3)  Whenever the Minister determines to make under this section a hospital library grant, he shall direct the National Hospital Trustees to pay such grant out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund and thereupon the said Trustees shall pay the amount of such grant out of the said fund to such person and at such time or in instalments at such times as the Minister directs.</P>
      <P>(4)  Whenever the Minister makes under this section a hospital library grant, he shall specify the purposes for which such hospital library grant is to be expended and may attach to the receipt of such hospital library grant such conditions (whether to be performed before or after such receipt) as he thinks proper for securing the due expenditure of such hospital library grant on the purposes specified by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  If, after the making of a hospital library grant under this section to any person and before payment of such hospital library grant or before the making of any particular payment in respect thereof, the Minister is satisfied that any condition attached under the foregoing sub-section to the receipt of such hospital library grant has not been complied <Col N="2161" /> with by the person to whom such grant was made, the Minister may certify to the National Hospital Trustees that such condition has not been complied with and, upon the Minister so certifying, the National Hospital Trustees shall not make, and the person to whom such grant was made shall cease to be entitled to, any such payment of or in respect of such hospital library grant or to any future payment in respect thereof unless and until the Minister otherwise directs.</P>
    <P>I need not labour the point of this amendment.  There is no definite source to supply patients in hospitals with books or magazines except haphazard gifts of old magazines and books. Some hospitals also provide books of a certain character which I think do not promote joyful convalescence.  If there was a central distributing library these poorer hospitals which have no books for their patients and the richer hospitals which provide books of a certain character could alike make use of this library.  Books would be made available for every hospital from this circulating library.  Such libraries already exist in England, America and in Denmark.  There is another important aspect of this proposal.  The suggestion of a central library from which all hospitals would draw their supplies might make later on for centralisation in other directions.  It is quite beside the point to suggest a central laundry for the hospitals because every hospital overlaps in its laundry but it is a just argument that <Col N="2162" /> the establishment of this central library might be a precedent for centralisation in other matters.  I know that the Minister is anxious to centralise certain services of the hospitals.  I need not labour the point that a great need exists to provide books for the patients in all hospitals.  In cases such as surgical tuberculosis, you may have children lying up for over six months and at present these children have no place to look to for books which would assist them to bear the tedium of long convalescence.  The establishment of this library might lead towards the centralisation of other more or less detached services such as I have mentioned.  I am proposing that the Minister be given an unequivocal power in this matter.  There is a certain section in the Bill which puts it within his power to earmark funds for certain purposes but lest any over-assiduous accountant might surcharge the Committee, I think it is no harm to have it definitely set down that the Minister be empowered to set up a central distributing library and maintain it.</P>
