    <Title>Public Business. - Seeds and Fertilisers (Supply) Bill, 1933&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly) Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to representations received from various parts of the country that there was a shortage of seeds for spring sowing, it was decided in the early part of 1932 to enable county councils to promote schemes for the supply of seeds to necessitous farmers seeking such facilities.  Arrangements were also made on similar lines for the supply of fertilisers.  These arrangements were validated by the Seeds and Fertilisers Supply Act, 1932.  In the course of the debates in the Dáil suggestions were made that legislation of a permanent character might be advisable.  On further consideration of these suggestions, while it is admitted that in times of agricultural emergency it would be desirable to have legislative machinery available, it is doubtful if it would be wise to establish such supplies on credit as a permanent feature of the legislation of the country.  The absence of permanent legislation would not hinder in any way emergencies being met by special legislation as was done last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" /> A condition of affairs similar to that existing in the spring of last year arose this year; and it was decided to authorise county councils to frame schemes on the same lines as those of last year.  The present Bill is being introduced to validate this action.</P>
    <P>The adoption of schemes is not compulsory, but left to the discretion of each county council, having regard to local circumstances.  The method of supply is the same as last year.  The councils which decided to provide supplies advertised the arrangements, which were to invite applications from persons in need, mentioning the names of the merchants who would supply the seeds and fertilisers.  The applicants were required to give an undertaking to repay the full cost, including administrative expenses, either on harvesting or by the 31st December next.</P>
    <P>Where applications were deemed satisfactory the councils ordered the supplies from the merchants for delivery to the applicants, and the councils then arranged to pay the merchants, the cost to be recovered later from the recipients.  To provide for the possibility of failure on the part of any recipient to make repayment in full by December next provision is being made to assess such persons with the cost with their rates for next year.</P>
    <P>The Bill is practically identical with the Act of last year but, as some councils may have been deterred through fear of ultimate loss from carrying out schemes, it was decided to indemnify councils generally to the extent of one-half of any such loss within a limit of £25,000, allocated county by county as shown in the Schedule to the Bill.  This allocation was determined on the basis of the rural population.</P>
    <P>The State guarantee is conditional upon recipients furnishing two sureties for repayment, who are not themselves recipients of supplies, and recoupment of a moiety of any loss ultimately ascertained will be dependent on it being shown to the satisfaction of my Department that such loss is in fact irrecoverable after all steps necessary to secure recovery have been taken.  In view of these precautions to obviate loss, and to the fact that recipients who do not repay by the 31st December will be <Col N="843" /> charged the full cost in their rates for next year, it is not anticipated that the State guarantee will be called upon to any great extent.</P>
    <P>Information so far available shows that schemes are in progress in 14 counties&mdash;the other 13 councils did not consider them necessary. It may be of interest for the House to know the result of last year's scheme.  Number of county councils who carried out schemes, 20; total cost, £21,174; number of recipients, 8,400; cash repayments, £4,500; balance being recovered by rate assessments this year, £16,674.  The proportion of cash recovery was disappointing and this is a further reason against the introduction of permanent legislation for such schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose, at this stage, to cover all the ground that was covered when this amendment was passed in the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I think that what has happened since has strengthened the position with regard to the amendment which this House inserted in the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill.  We were told, when the Bill was going through, that the amount that the Government were to save by cutting the salaries of the Gárda Síochána would be in the neighbourhood of £33,000 and that, owing to the dreadful state in which the finances of the country were, it was essential that we must get this Bill through in its entirety; that we could not afford to lose one penny of the amount of money which the Government sought to get by the passing of the Bill.  But an extraordinary development has taken place since then.  Recruiting has been opened for the Gárda Síochána, and I understand from the statements in the Press that the cost of the additional number to be recruited into the Gárda will be about £75,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does seem an extraordinary state of affairs if you are going to economise at one end and put on additional expenses at the other end which far outweigh the economies that are sought to be effected by the Bill.  But, apart from that, the principle for which I argued on this amendment still holds good.  I am not quarrelling with the decision of the Government to augment the police force at all.  If the Government think it necessary to do that I think they are entitled to do it, and personally I think with regard to some of the people who are now being recruited into the Gárda Síochána that it is about time that employment was found for them because of their services to the country in the past.  I am not at all quarrelling with the employment of these people.  What I do say is this&mdash;I object on principle to the cutting of the salaries of the Gárda.  I think the country is strong enough, big enough, and well able to bear the expenses of an efficient police force. We have got an efficient police force and we ought to pay them a decent salary.  For that reason, I ask the <Col N="846" /> House not to agree to the decision of the Dáil, but to insist on the amendment that was agreed to in this House and to take out of the Bill the proposed cut in the salaries of the members of the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Farren that we should not agree with the Dáil; in other words, that we should agree with our own amendment. In view of the things that have happened since our last meeting it would seem that it is a waste of time for anybody to say anything for the boys in blue.  The Government tell us this cut is temporary, a temporary economy, <i>mar dh'eadh!</i>  Recollect that at the very time they ask us to pass this temporary cut they are putting in force the Public Safety Act.  The Government gave a display of force in the streets of Dublin on Saturday and Sunday last in order to try to terrorise the law-abiding citizens of this country.  While they are doing that, they allow men to congregate at the crossroads on the approaches to the City.</P>
      <P>I can give the House one instance, the Cabra Crossroads, where practically 140 men congregated on last Saturday evening, a few hundred yards from my own home.  These men, with murder in their hearts and Dublin cobblestones in their hands, waited to waylay the passengers that were supposed to be coming into Dublin on the buses.  Where were the Guards while these men were so acting? They were lining the streets of Dublin to let people of the city see what a display of force this Government could make in putting into operation the Public Safety Act that they pretended they so much abhorred. We have the collection of weapons from all the law-abiding people in this country, from the people who were licensed to carry these arms. Naturally, when these weapons were collected we expected that the unlicensed ones would be collected too.  What incentive do the Gárdaí get to collect these weapons?  They are already living on a starvation wage and they are getting another cut of a half-crown a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are imposing this <Col N="847" /> cut in order to save £33,000 a year. But that same Government is about organising a new force which will cost an additional £80,000 a year. This new body is to be attached to the Guards as a new C.I.D.&mdash;call them any name you like.  But they are to cost £80,000 and by this Bill the Government is to save £33,000 by the cut in the pay of the men who stood by this State from its inception up to the present.</P>
    <P>I feel keenly about this cut because I am the man through whom the Executive Council of the day agreed to pay these men £3 10s. per week as a basic wage.  The men have been cut since.  I did not agree with that cut. They are being cut now.  I do not agree with that either.  But there is a much more important thing.  As well as fighting for decent pay for these men at the time they were first established, I also fought that they would be sent out to the country as an unarmed police force.  What do we find to-day?  We find these men being sent through the streets of Dublin armed by the Government with Webley and Thompson guns.  Anybody in this Chamber can look out on Leinster Lawn and see the Cenotaph to Griffith, Collins and O'Higgins, and on last Sunday anybody looking on here could see Gárda Síochána armed with Webley and Thompson guns in charge of Leinster Lawn.  Surely a force armed with Webley and Thompson guns cannot be described as an unarmed police force.  I want that force to be unarmed and as far as I can I am going to insist that it will be unarmed.</P>
    <P>On Friday last the Government sent three armoured cars and the &ldquo;hooded terror&rdquo; into the Civic Guard Depot in the Phoenix Park.  They did that after they had been told by the Army that it was not a job for the Army.  They asked the Civic Guards to supply men to man these armoured cars.  They did not get these men on Friday or Saturday.  They were able to man one of them on Sunday and that armoured car manned with armed Civic Guards went through the streets of Dublin on Sunday last.  That is not the service <Col N="848" /> for which the men of the Gárda Síochána were recruited.  The Dáil is not at present sitting but the Seanad is.  We would like to know the names of the Gárda who manned that armoured car on Sunday.  We would like to know from the Government what authority they have to try to convert an unarmed force into an armed force and thereby try to prevent the citizens of this State from laying a wreath on the graves of Griffith, Collins and O'Higgins?</P>
    <P>They are the men who established this State.  They are the men who made it possible for either the Dáil or Seanad to meet here.  People might forget this, but I do not.  We had the British Government before their time and it was these men who made it possible for us to govern our own State in our own way.  This is the way we are doing it.  The Government mobilise the Civic Guards, a force that was formed at the instance of these men, a force that I helped to establish, and put them out there on the streets to prevent the people of this State, the law-abiding people, from laying a wreath on the Cenotaph, from paying any respect to the memory of the men who established this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator will read the proclamation he will understand what I mean.  Had the proclamation been differently worded, had we been allowed to honour the memory of these men, I would not object.  Their proclamation definitely forbade any law-abiding citizen laying a wreath on the Cenotaph or on the graves of these men in Glasnevin.  There were men there with guns in their holsters, they were in Glasnevin to prevent us doing that.  The three armoured cars and the hooded terror that I told you about are all equipped with Vickers machine guns.  I am sure the Senators who interrupted me knows what a Vickers machine gun means but, for the information of the Senators who do not <Col N="849" /> know much about guns, I will give them some information.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tell you that a Vickers machine gun is a gun that sprays bullets all over the streets.  It sprays the streets as effectively with bullets as a corporation watering car would spray it with water.  If there are people there the machine gun will spray the streets of Dublin as effectively with blood as any corporation car could do it with water.  In the British Army, as Senator Robinson knows, there are four of these Vickers guns to every battalion.  We had one of them on the streets of Dublin last Sunday and evidently the Government are very sorry that we did not start laying wreaths in honour of the men who lived, worked and died for this country.</P>
      <P>I very seldom quote the <i>Irish Independent,</i> but I am going to quote it to-day.  I will quote from the issue of Tuesday, August 15th.  You have there a photograph&mdash;and a photograph does not lie.  It is a photograph of the grave of Arthur Griffith in Glasnevin cemetery&mdash;Arthur Griffith the founder of Sinn Féin and the first President of Saorstát Eireann, the 11th anniversary of whose death occurred on Sunday.  The tombstone, a broken pillar, was erected by his widow.  The tombstone, a broken pillar, is there over Arthur Griffith's grave.  He lived and worked for Ireland.  He died in my brother's arms of a broken heart&mdash;broken for Ireland.  That broken pillar over Arthur Griffith's grave is symbolic of the broken heart of which he died, broken by the action of a certain section of a very ungrateful nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were not allowed to lay a wreath on his grave last Sunday.  An attempt is now being made to cut the pay of the Civic Guards.  I hope this House will have the manliness to hold up this cut.  While the Government prevented us laying a wreath on Griffith's grave last Sunday they allowed other people to wait for buses coming in. They allowed a stained glass window in a church at Dún Laoghaire, valued <Col N="850" /> at £50, to be smashed and the donation boxes to be rifled.  Has anybody been brought to justice for these things?  There cannot be because the Guards were too busy watching the graves of Griffith, Collins and O'Higgins and the Cenotaph in Leinster Lawn.</P>
    <P>When I think of the fight the men of 1916 made, when I think of less than 1,000 men, taking the whole lot of them, the fellows who marched into it and the fellows who came in afterwards&mdash;when I think of 1,000 men beating 20,000 British soldiers and when I perceive the respect there is for the memory of men like Michael Collins to-day, it makes me feel sad.  Honest to God, I have sympathy for the poor unfortunate boys, the Notts and Derbys, the boys with six weeks' training who were sent over to fight us.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot in connection with previous stages of this Bill about what Mr. Blythe and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney intended to do.  I admit they did think of cutting the pay of the Guards.  They decided at one time, however, that it would not be just and they did not do it.  The General Election came on afterwards.  I suppose we will have one within the next couple of months and it would be well for the people to take stock of the promises made to them at the last election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Do these promises allude to the Guards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, every one of them.  I am very careful.  I do not want to break the rules of the House at all.  I will now quote from the <i>Anglo-Celt</i> of January 9th, 1932. Speaking at Scotshouse, Monaghan, Dr. Ward said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Speaking of how economy might be brought about&mdash;there was a sum paid yearly for a police force which could be considerably reduced.  There could be economy there, and when Fianna Fáil got into power they would see there was.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that for years before that speech was made recruiting for the Civic Guards had been stopped.  That was very unfair to the Guards because <Col N="851" /> their duties were increasing.  With the exception of one small lot taken in shortly before that speech was made, there has been no recruiting for the Guards during the last five or six years.</P>
    <P>The way the cost is going to be reduced is worth considering.  We are to save £33,000 by reason of this cut in the pay of the Guards.  I say that is simply a sop to the farmers.  The farmers are probably losing as many millions owing to the economic war.  I do not want to bring the economic war into it.  We are saving £33,000, but we are spending £80,000 on a new force which is being tacked on to the Guards.  That new force is mobolised from South Dublin.  I know what they are.  I remember one morning in 1922 when 40 of them waited on the wall at Dickson's nursery at Blackrock to shoot Joe Ring and myself.  Of course they would have done a wonderful thing if they had shot down Joe Ring and myself, especially after we had got the British Army out of the country, but it was not until after the British Army had gone that 40 of them came to shoot us.  They are mobolised&mdash;the word is &ldquo;mobilised.&rdquo;  The usual way the Guards were obtained was that they were recruited.  There used to be applicants as a result of advertisements in the papers.  It has not been found necessary to recruit, in that way, for about 11 years because there are thousands of men all over the country who have letters from the late Commissioner saying that whenever recruiting would be again started an advertisement to that effect would be published in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the <i>Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Press.</i>  But now instead of calling up those men, if recruits were necessary, a certain crowd in Dublin has been mobilised. They were ordered to leave their employment and come into the new corps.  This was done on the weekend preceding the bank holiday.  God knows the number of people in this city who have good business on hand is very limited.  If they ever have a good day it is the Saturday prior to the bank holiday; yet, that was the <Col N="852" /> very day selected to take these men out of employment and bring them into this new force.</P>
    <P>According to the <i>Irish Independent</i> of June 22nd, 1932, Dr. O'Dowd, speaking at Carrick-on-Shannon, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have too many Civic Guards in the country.  He would advocate the reduction of the Guards and a lesser force would not impair the efficiency of the Gárda Síochána.  It would do them no harm to do a little more work than they were doing at present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They got more work on Saturday and Sunday last, but I pity the rural districts from which these men were taken and were thereby left without protection.</P>
    <P>Dr. Ward, speaking at Monaghan, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent,</i> February 2nd, 1932, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Civic Guards who were inclined to be violent partisans in this election might remember that they would be a factor for consideration when the new Government came to the consideration of economies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Economically apparently is the only way the present Government can hit the Guards, except by the dismissal of General O'Duffy and Superintendent Neligan.  I defy any person to prove that the Civic Guards were ever partisans at elections.  They have not been, and here they have simply been true to type as policemen.  As a matter of fact, in the Dáil the other day a report of General O'Duffy was published referring to General Mulcahy and Mr. Blythe, which I think proves that General O'Duffy was a policeman all the time.  I think whoever quoted that in the Dáil did a bad day's work for the present Government.  My idea of the present police force in this country, and I know it as well as anybody, is that they have no politics.</P>
    <P>President de Valera, speaking on the 16th February, 1932, is reported in the <i>Irish Independent,</i> to have said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No one will think that we do not need a police force, but we will reduce the present numbers and, therefore, reduce the cost as soon as possible.  We must do that with <Col N="853" /> justice to the Guards, and the way to do it is to stop recruiting.  The young men,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;would be better employed in industries that a Fianna Fáil Government would foster.  We are going to cut down expenditure,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;but we are not going to begin with the small salaries.  We say the small salaries are well used to maintain homes and families, and so long as they are we are not going to interfere with them, but we are going to begin with the big salaries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the Guard who has £3 a week is going to be cut half a crown. That man cannot make more than £150 a year, but still he is to be cut this half a crown a week.  A recruit coming in, if he comes in through the front door, would not be entitled to more than 50/- a week and, yet, he is to be cut half a crown.  Other recruits evidently can come in at £3 10s without any cut.</P>
    <P>Mr. Geoghegan, speaking at Geevagh, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of February 29th, 1932, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It had been said by propagandists that Fianna Fáil would disband a large section of the police force. Fianna Fáil had no such intention. It was mindful of the excellent men in the blue uniform of the Civic Guards.  The uniformed force, so far as he had heard, were excellent policemen and there was no intention of interfering with them.  But there were more police than the country could afford and recruiting would have to stop for a few years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I certainly say that Mr. Geoghegan, when Minister for Justice, was always decent to the Guards and I admired him for it.  There was no necessity for further recruiting for the Guards until a fire broke out in Leinster House the other night.  I was chairman of the Dublin Corporation Waterworks Committee which looks after the Fire Brigade, and for many years we were warning traders about the danger of keeping packing cases and paper material in their basements.  I cannot, for the life of me, see why in Leinster House shavings were allowed to accumulate in the basement.  I do not suggest that the Government <Col N="854" /> started that fire in order to begin recruiting for the Guards.  But I think it is bad policy to suggest that because there was a fire in Leinster House you must start guarding buildings. I know all about guarding buildings, grain and corn stores, power houses and buildings belonging to the Port and Docks Board.  If you start guarding one kind of building you must guard the lot, and it is going to cost too much money and you will have to look for a Vote for this expenditure. It was suggested in some papers that some T.D. threw away a cigarette and that that caused the fire, but, as a matter of fact, T.D.s and Senators are not allowed down to the basement. Boilermen and Guards can go there. Most people smoke cigarettes nowadays and probably a cigarette end carelessly thrown away caused the fire, but that is no reason why the country should be saddled with £80,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am contending that it was purely an accident.  I pointed out already that we had been warning traders from the Corporation about the danger of fires in their basements. Mr. Lemass, speaking at Navan, December 19th, 1931, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In case that delay on Mr. Blythe's part is due to unwillingness or inability to find avenues for economy he would suggest some and draw his attention to the fact that we are spending £1,750,000 every year in maintaining what is called a national army.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In that connection I would like to point out that the actual cost of the Army for that year was £1,173,000.  For this year the estimate is £1,253,000 so that the estimate, at least, is higher than the actual cost for that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Irish people should take the attitude that the most that can be afforded for the expenditure on that service was £1,000,000 a year.  If they took that attitude and put into office a Government determined upon it, it would result in an immediate saving of £750,000, almost the whole of the Budgetary deficiency.  If <Col N="855" /> that was done there would be no necessity for cutting the wages of postmen, the salaries of teachers.  It was possible to maintain the efficiency of Government here, without decreasing its efficiency, by £2,000,000 a year less if it is decided that the taxpayers' money must be expended for the taxpayers' benefit and not for the purpose of political patronage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So far as political patronage is concerned I would ask Senators to consider the way the Civic Guard has been recruited since its inception and the way it is recruited at the present time, from one small part of County Dublin. Then we have Mr. de Valera speaking at Ennis, according to the <i>Clare Champion</i> of December 26, 1931, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Oath was the principal cause of the expenditure of £1,500,000 on an Army which was maintained expressly for the purpose of keeping down a section of the people who, being denied an opportunity of representation in the National Assembly, are thrown back on force.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Oath is gone, the Seanad is going but the Army is still there.  Again, Mr. de Valera speaking at Ennis, according to the <i>Clare Champion</i> of December 26, 1931, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Army was there for the purpose of keeping down Republicans, Sinn Féiners, and anybody else who did not agree with the policy of the present Government. By removing the cause of dissatisfaction among the people the cost of the Army could be reduced by £500,000.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The police, a lot of whose work was of a political character at present, could also be reduced and another £500,000 saved.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of saving £500,000 we are <Col N="856" /> saving £33,000 and we are making the police force discontented.  Then, on the other hand, we are going to spend £80,000 a year on a new political police force.  I would ask the House to stand by its previous decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that when we are discussing effects that we should not forget causes.  There is an old Chinese saying which says: &ldquo;There is no use spitting on a herring after the sea is dried up.&rdquo;  The Government has got itself into such a knot that the country's income of £17,000,000 a year has dried up, and they think that a cut of £33,000 here and another similar cut there, which form a trifling part of the country's former income, is going to rehabilitate them.  The thing to do is to cut the hopeless knot of their economic incapacity.  The most dispensable Minister for Industrial Collapse, Senator Connolly, had, I should think, judging by what he said before he came into his position of wielding mischief, envisaged this, and the President here in answer to me went very nearly as close to saying anything definite as he ever has done in his whole history or in his whole career when he said that it would not be a bad thing if the country were trapped into losing its cattle trade. He did not, however, tell the farmers that.  The trap is here now, and the Government are not trying to get out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This cut of £33,000 is made more ludicrous by the latest addition of £80,000 for the President's new secret police force.  It may be overwork, it may be over-phantasy, but he has got into such a state of &ldquo;groundless apprehensions&rdquo; that he proposes to expend treble the amount on the new police force which it is suggested he will save by this cut.  The last people in the country who should have their salaries cut are the Guards.  They represent the physical backbone of the country.  Their training in the Depôt has developed the best material amongst the Irish race and has enabled us to uphold our name in the field of athleticism.  They are the most outstanding body of men we have in this country.  They are trained in civility <Col N="857" /> and courtesy.  Their physical condition and intelligence are things that should be preserved as the men of old preserved their athletes in the Prytaneum. I do not suggest that there has been any victimisation in removing one man here and another man there, but it is a monstrous thing to put forward this proposal for a cut in the Guards' pay on the ground of economy in view of what we know is happening at present. First of all, there is not going to be better service amongst men who are to be underpaid when largely overworked.  Not a little of that overwork comes from the nervous collapse of the President himself.  It is a disgraceful thing to see men forbidden to pay the little tribute that was customary each year since the lamentable deaths of Griffith, Collins and O'Higgins.  It is monstrous to make that forbidden to those who had this very natural, and in this country particularly pious, desire of paying respect to dead heroes.  It is pitiable the Guards should be made the instruments of the extraordinary hallucinations by which the President is obsessed. He may want fresh air.  Now he has got himself into a position something like the old Sultan of Turkey.  The Janissaries are in the palace and he is cooped up with 300 boys around him.  I say that the Guards are the last who should have their salaries cut, and the President is the last who should propose such a cut.  He may yet require them to get him out.</P>
    <P>The amount which it is proposed to save by this cut is only a tithe of the amount the taxpayers are asked to pay in otherways.  There was to be £1,000,000 collected recently in order to repay a debt about which there was no urgency so that there might be a rake off of £100,000 for a certain newspaper. That is three times the amount which it is suggested will be saved by this cut.  It is far better to let the paper want than the police.  It is the greater part of the Republic I admit.  They asked for a Republic and they got a paper.  Let the economies begin at home.  Let the President take a little more fresh air, go for a little drive here and there in <Col N="858" /> the evening on the boulevards which are being built all over the country to disguise the industrial collapse or the commercial ineptitude of the dispensable Minister for Fisheries of red herrings, Senator Connolly.  That may give the President sufficient energy to get over the groundless misapprehensions which seem to have seized him and the fears that there may be cornflowers thrown at him. I hope the Seanad will have the guts to stand firmly by the Guards and that they will not be misled by this nonsense or talk about economies when £17,000,000 is deliberately, as part of a plan to trap the farmers into the immense loss, thrown to the wind.  We were told that it is too humiliating to deal with our best customer.  It is a nice state of affairs when prosperity gets mixed up with parochial politics. The one thing the Guards have&mdash;and it is the thing for which one envies them&mdash;is their detachment from party politics and petty parochial patriotism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I voted in favour of the cut in the pay of the Civic Guards on the last occasion when it was before the Seanad.  I believed at the time that the Government were justified in making the cut.  There is nobody in this House has greater respect for the Guards than I have and I believe that they are the last people whose pay should be cut.  I know, however, the economic position of the country.  I know it, perhaps, better than the Minister, because I move about amongst the farmers and I know that we are leading towards chaos.  At that time I thought that every person was entitled to do what he could to bring about a reduction in expenditure. For that reason I voted for the cut in the pay of the Civic Guards as well as the cuts in the pay of the other services.  Since then the Government have felt it necessary to spend £80,000 or £100,000 on the Broy Harriers.  If they can afford to spend £80,000 or £100,000 on the Broy Harriers the £30,000 which they are going to save by the cut in the pay of the Guards is very little, and I cannot see my way now to support that cut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a protest against the action of the <Col N="859" /> Government I intend to vote to-day against the cut in the pay of the Guards.  I do not see how any man can get up and say to-day that there is a necessity to make this cut.  The Guards are not exceptionally well paid. When the Government have £100,000 to fling away on the Broy Harriers we cannot very well ask the Guards to take the 2/6 a week less.  I should like to ask what is the pay of the Broy Harriers and if they are going to be paid £1 per week more than the ordinary Guards who have served this country very well for several years.  As far as I can see, and I know the position of affairs in the country as well as anybody else, there is no necessity for any of these.  The Guards are well able to do the work.  If the Government thought there was any fear of an attack on Leinster House or any public buildings we have an Army on which we are spending over £1,000,000 per year.  These men could fill up their spare time at that work, if 30 or 40 or 50 of them were required here instead of having them at the Curragh and Fermoy and Finner Camp.</P>

I claim that there is no necessity for any addition to the Civic Guards at the present time and that if public buildings are to be guarded it can be done without any expenditure by the Army. We are paying an Army to maintain peace and order in the country and I say they are well able to do it.  Then I understand that this new force is being recruited altogether from Dublin. Why do the country districts not get a look in?  We have a lot of able-bodied men in Monaghan who would be glad to get £3 10s. a week for sitting around Leinster House.

There is a large number of men there anxious to get employment and they will take employment in the Civic Guards or any other decent employment they will get.  Our proportion of the 400 recruited would be 20 or 25 and we should get that number.  I protest against the Government recruiting these men from Dublin.</P>

      <P>There is an aspect arising out of the debate which is more or less new to me.  I understand that the Government in an emergency have seen fit to recruit by an exceptional process additional people to supplement the Guards.  I think we should have a statement of policy on this matter.  If additional Guards are wanted we should know why the ordinary normal methods of recruitment have not been followed.  It seems very serious that we should have the Guards, so to speak, divided into two classes, men who come in by the ordinary process of recruiting and men who have been taken on in an emergency on a special basis.  The Minister should give us a frank statement as to the intentions and the policy pursued on that matter because it is a very serious matter altogether outside the question of the cut.  Will the Minister further say why, as economy is so urgent, the <Col N="861" /> Army was not sufficient to supply any additional force necessary if the foundations of the State were threatened? We are spending over £1,000,000 per year on the Army and we understood the Army was there to reinforce the civil power.  If economy is necessary, and it is necessary to cut the pay of the civil power, why cannot the Army be used for the purpose for which armies have been used in the past&mdash;to support the civil power in cases of emergency?  I hope the Minister will rise superior to the rather political or Party aspect and give us a statesmanlike account of the policy that the Government are pursuing in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I might give a bit of history in comparison with what Senator Colonel Moore said.  I happened to hear from the British Cabinet their reason for allowing an Army in the Free State.  The reason that was given for it was that the police force, the ordinary civil guardians of the peace, did require an armed force lying behind them to supplement them when they were not able to deal with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that I heard the British Prime Minister himself state that one of the main reasons why an Army was allowed in the Free State and why it was agreed to when the Treaty was made was that it would be a supplementary force to the unarmed ordinary police force.  If that does not justify the statement that the Army should be used when such a necessity arises, I do not know what can justify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdmundJDuggan" hpid="Mr. Duggan Mr. Duggan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duggan</NameTxt>
      <P>My friend, Senator Colonel Moore, was an officer in a regular army and I happened to be an officer in what might be called an irregular army.  I know that one of the reasons why an army is needed is to supplement peace forces.  I also know that in the area in which I live an incident took place, which was referred to by Senator Staines, in which a common burglar broke a stained glass window worth £50 in order to get a few pounds.  That happened when there were no Civic Guards around to catch him for the reason that they were all engaged in this particular display organised by the Minister's Government.  I do not know for what reason they were mobilised for this display except, as my friend, the Senator, said, that it was due to nervous collapse.  Now, when they want to save £33,000 on the pay of the Civic Guards they can afford to pay a Guard to collect a firearm from me for which I can account, which is Government property, and <Col N="863" /> which was given to me for my protection. I do not think the Minister would suggest for a moment that I wanted that firearm to assassinate anybody.  It was needed for my personal protection.  They sent twice to me for that weapon and then took practically every Civic Guard out of the township in which I live and had them around Merrion Square and its vicinity doing nothing while burglars could do things of the type I have described.  They talk about economy and about saving £33,000 while they spend £80,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain Senators claim to know more about such matters than I do, but I should like to say something in this connection for the reason that I was Minister for Home Affairs at the time when Senator Staines was the first Commissioner of the Civic Guards and when that body was being set up. A commission was set up at the time because the R.I.C. were being disbanded and one of the first things to be considered was whether the new police force would be an armed or an unarmed force.  It was decided that they should be an unarmed force and that was done in spite of the fact that there was a civil war in this country at the time.  Now we are faced with the proposition of paying £80,000 per annum on an armed force and this is being done at a time when we are supposed to be unable to pay our debts and when we want to raise a loan and so on.  How is this new force being recruited?  When I was Minister for Home Affairs and when the first Commissioner of the Guards was Senator Staines, whose successor was General O'Duffy, who has recently been dismissed, the Guards were recruited according to a regular method.  I am reliably informed that the men being brought into this new force are simply men who were opposed to the State in 1922 and that the Government is availing of this opportunity to pay these men and provide them with arms.  There is no doubt about that, and it is a very serious thing.  I would suggest to the Minister, in view of the fact that the feeling of the House is against him, that he <Col N="864" /> should do the generous thing and take the feeling of the House on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that the feeling of the House is against the Minister in this matter, but a certain amount of feeling has been aroused in regard to matters which, with great respect, I think are not relevant to this debate.  A month or two ago it became obvious that owing to the condition of the producing classes in this country, namely, the farmers, certain reductions in the expenditure on public services would have to be made.  Three classes of public servants were selected for these reductions to begin with.  I believe that they will not be the only reductions, but three classes were selected to begin with, namely, the school teachers, the civil servants and the police force.  Nobody will deny that the value of salaries, measured in commodities, has greatly appreciated in the last 12 months or two years, or that salaries are worth more from that point of view than they were 12 months or two years ago.  The extraordinary thing that is happening is that in the cities, where the people are mostly people receiving salaries, they are well off and have plenty of money to spend and to go to the seaside for their holidays, while the producing classes, the farmers, are very badly off.  Let Senators consider that. Let them consider the general question and I think they will come to the conclusion that a school teacher, even with the reduction in his salary, is able to purchase more of the necessaries of life and even of the luxuries of life than he was able to purchase 12 months or two years ago when he had a larger salary.  If the country is passing through a period in which sacrifices are needed from the people, I admit that sacrifices ought to be general.  The people who are suffering most at the present time are the farmers and the farm labourers&mdash;the farmers whose incomes are tremendously reduced and the farm labourers whose employment is being taken away.  I ask Senators to consider that class and I would be very grateful to <Col N="865" /> Senator Miss Browne if she would not draw me away into an argument on the economic war.  We all agree with a great deal of what Senator Staines has said.  The police are a fine body of men but so are the farmers of Ireland who pay the police a fine body of men.</P>

      <P>Senator Miss Browne is very fond of the Army.  Girls are always fond of military men.  Senator Miss Browne wants the Army out on all occasions, but the Army ought not to be required to do police work.  The maintenance of order in the streets of Dublin is police work, and experience has shown us that the police were fully competent to discharge that duty.  I came down around Leinster House on that day.  I found the police here most amiable and thoroughly delighted that they had no serious work to do on that <Col N="867" /> occasion.  Now what complaint is made against the Government? Senator Staines started this, and to what he said my friend, Senator Duggan, said &ldquo;ditto.&rdquo;  What happened? A church was broken into, a poor box in it was rifled, and there was no policeman to arrest the thief who committed that depredation.  I would advise Senator Duggan to keep his mind perfectly at ease on that matter. The police will find that person.  They do not usually find the rifler of a poor box within 24 hours, but they will find him within a week or a fortnight.  The police are ready to do their duty and I hope they will find the gentleman who rifled the poor box in the church at Dun Laoghaire.</P>

      <P>I say nothing about hair shirts, blue shirts, white shirts or black shirts, because I am sure there are a lot of people in this country who have no shirts.  There are farmers and farm labourers who, if this thing goes on and if this expenditure is to be kept up, will have no shirts at all.  I think members of this House have not considered this question with the same calmness, deliberation and good sense that they have shown on other occasions of importance.  Senators ought to consider calmly whether, in the matter of general taxation and general economy, it is right to reduce salaries in view of the condition of the people who are to pay them.  I would like Senators to vote on that question without paying any regard at all to the other matters which have been introduced and which will come up for discussion in the proper time.  I am always delighted to hear my friend, <Col N="868" /> Senator Duggan, and also to hear my friend, Senator Gogarty, but then Senator Gogarty is always at his best when the subject for discussion is not of very grave importance.</P>

      <P>Senator Gogarty is always good but, as I have said, he is always at his best when the subject under discussion is of trifling importance and when wit can be used to the fullest advantage, but here Senators are presented with a very grave question for consideration.  I ask Senators to consider it seriously.  I was surprised to find my friend, Senator O'Rourke, not merely changing his tone but changing his mind.  I thought that he was a man of solid intelligence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>But to-day he comes along and he changes his mind because 300 or 400 men had been recruited to ensure the public safety.  There was a necessity for that.  If there was no necessity for it, or no appearance of a necessity for it, I am sure the Government would not have gone to that expense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask Senators to say that the Government would not go to unnecessary expense unless they thought there was some necessity for it and I hope the necessity has passed. In fact I am inclined to think it has passed to a great extent.  It surprised me that Senator O'Rourke should change his mind on a grave matter of public expenditure simply because he does not like the Bray Harriers or the Broy Harriers, or whatever he called them.  The Senator has changed his mind once.  I would ask him whether he would not consider changing it again, of going back to his original opinion and saying that these reductions in the salaries of these three classes of public servants were inevitable and necessary.  It was a necessity which I, certainly, was sorry the Government were forced to.  I would rather not reduce salaries but I think it was absolutely necessary.  We do not like to do it.  I would ask Senators <Col N="869" /> to vote on the measure in that spirit: that we do not like to do it but that we have to do it, and not to be led away by party considerations, or by acrimony or bitterness of one kind or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much if a single vote will be changed here to-day by the strange appearance of Senator Comyn in the role of devil's advocate. However, I do not think that that particular role could be placed in more experienced hands: of a man who has defended and advocated more frequently lost causes.  I have to preface my remarks by an apology to the House for making a rather unseemly interjection during the course of Senator Colonel Moore's speech.  My reason for that was that the Senator stated something that was not a fact and which I wanted to contradict. The Senator said that everybody knew that a military parade had been arranged for last Sunday.  I interjected the remark that everybody did not know anything of the kind, and I want to repeat and to emphasise that no military parade was arranged for last Sunday.  A body of unarmed men, who had through the mouth of their leader expressed themselves as prepared to abide by all the laws of the constituted authority of this country, had arranged to make an act of reverence to the memory of certain founders of this State.  That was declared by the constituted authority to be a menace to this State.  I hope the Minister will be able to inform this House and the country how an act of reverence to the founders of this State by a disciplined body of men who had declared, through <Col N="870" /> their authoritative mouthpiece, their readiness to support the constituted authority of the State&mdash;I want the Minister to tell the House how, by any stretch of imagination, that can be construed into a menace to the authority of the State.  This debate has given rise to certain rather unexpected considerations.  Owing to the rather unique position the Seanad occupies at present, as being the only sitting House of the Oireachtas, it is, perhaps, just as well that the occasion should have been availed of to ventilate opinion about recent happenings. I think that those considerations are quite relevant and that it is as well the matter should be dealt with fully&mdash;that certain apprehensions aroused in the country should be allayed, if possible, by the Minister when he comes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One very vital matter has been touched upon, but so many other matters have been introduced, that it is possible that matter may be somewhat obscured.  This matter is of the most outstanding and vital importance&mdash;the nature, constitution and method of recruiting the new body of police.  I think that we should have from the Minister some definite, authoritative statement, as representing the decision of the Executive Council, regarding the departure from the constitutional method of recruiting the police force.  We have been besought by spokesmen of the Government Party to pass this Bill in the interests of economy and to reduce the salaries of a section of the Gárda Síochána.  We are told that the Exchequer cannot afford to continue the rate of pay members of the Gárda have been receiving.  Yet, without any real justification, without one tittle of reason, a new body is recruited at a higher scale of pay than the force whose pay we are asked to reduce.  We ought to have some definite reason for that.  The Minister who is with us to-day will, I hope, leave this House without a shadow of support for his proposal, even from his own Party, unless he can give us some convincing reason for that procedure.  In my considered judgment and without having access to official secrets, I want to say that there was not the slightest ground <Col N="871" /> or the slightest basis of reason for the recruitment of this new force or for all this display of police force during the past few days.  I challenge the Minister to produce proof that that was necessary.  I assert&mdash;I challenge denial&mdash;that that parade of police force was simply a political demonstration. In this State, since its inauguration, there has never been a more sorry exhibition of the prostitution of the civil forces of the State for Party political purposes.  That is the kind of thing which should not be tolerated by any intelligent people. There are rumours that this Government proposes at an early date to take the judgment of the country on their action.  I hope they do.  I hope they take the judgment of the country upon such actions at the earliest possible moment, because if the forces that stand for law and order are going to be used as Party pawns at the instance of Party politicians, then the sooner the country pronounces judgement upon such tactics the better.  So much for that.</P>
    <P>To come to the question that is really before us, I regret that the happenings during the past week or so have necessitated the introduction of matters extraneous to the merits of the proposal for the reduction of the salaries of the Gárda Síochána.  On the merits, there is no justification for that proposal.  The remuneration of these men has been brought down to the smallest amount compatible with a mere existence.  There is no reason why the exigencies of the State should demand this further sacrifice.  On the merits of that issue, I voted for the amendment of the Seanad before and I intend to stand by my vote on this occasion.  I hope that the House will stand on the merits of the question and abide by the vote which it has already given, thus expressing its dissatisfaction and disapproval of the uses which the Government have been making of the police force of this country within the last few days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the question before the House was purely one of public economy I should feel disposed to vote with the Government.  It is quite <Col N="872" /> evident that it is not a question of public economy.  In giving our votes we are dealing with a bigger question than that, an issue which seems to me to be of constitutional importance.  I am not as conversant as many members of the House appear to be with what occurred within the last few days.  I do not live in Dublin and, perhaps, I do not read the debates that take place in the Dáil as conscientiously as I should.  Therefore I have not got all the information I should have if I were a member of the Dáil.  I should like to know authoritatively from the Minister when he is winding up, if it is a fact that 300 or 400 members of a civilian force have been recruited or formed into a force quite recently. What is their relationship to the Civic Guard, which has been recruited in a way that we all understand?  I should like to know whether the new force was recruited in the same way, and if not, how it was appointed?  Is it an armed or an unarmed force?  What are the terms of employment, whether temporary or permanent, and what is the rate of pay?  It is owing to the country that we should have official information on these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the remarks of Senator Bagwell.  It is somewhat unfortunate that portion of the debate took the line that it did, as much of it was of a nature that would be extremely tempting to any member of the House to follow.  I do not propose to follow it. I was never a believer in the ultimate success of physical force as such, and I do not believe that in any group or Party there is any difference when it comes to readiness to use force.  It seems a relief to consider the position the House finds itself in now owing to the Dáil having rejected the amendment which we inserted, because the majority in this House believed that a genuine blunder of first class importance had been made by cutting the pay of the Civic Guards.  The matter was debated, I think I can say entirely on the merits, with little, if any regard to Party considerations.  I voted for the amendment because I believed that the proposal was a mistake.  As I have been out of the country and only read <Col N="873" /> the newspapers within the last few days, possibly I am not as well aware as others of certain things that may have happened.  A number of us voted for the amendment believing that it was right to send it to the Dáil.  I felt that it was a matter which this House should consider very carefully before it was prepared to insist on an amendment involving a question of expenditure. The amendment has now come back, the Dáil, by a majority, having rejected our suggestion, which was made in good faith.  We have now to consider whether it is wise, proper, or desirable for us to say&mdash;not that we have changed our minds&mdash;that we are prepared not to insist on the amendment.  I was very much inclined to take that view.  As far as I am concerned anything which will affect our ultimate decision will depend, to a considerable extent on the Minister's reply.  As I have not read the newspapers recently I was not aware of certain statements that were made. The Minister's reply to the reasonable questions put to him by Senator Bagwell would, as far as I am concerned, decide my final decision.  If I voted for insistence on the amendment it would be with reluctance, because I think the House should hesitate a good deal before insisting on an amendment that involves expenditure.  But, if it be true that an additional force of a permanent character, involving an expenditure of £70,000 yearly, has been formed in the meantime, and if it be true that it was formed in circumstances quite different from those applying to the Civic Guards I should find it extremely difficult to vote for a cut in the pay of the Guards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the general statements made can be contradicted by the Minister, and that this proposal is purely of a temporary character, not affecting the position of the ordinary Guards, I think we should deal with it on the merits.  I know there is a difficulty. While we should be prepared to say that we can give away, that we have changed our minds, because we are the Second Chamber, and as the other House is responsible for the finances, it is our opinion that we are faced with a different set of circumstances <Col N="874" /> here.  I ask the Minister, without regard to the Party matters raised, but dealing with the actual facts, to tell the House exactly what has happened in relation to the Guards, and to give us an opportunity of making up our minds on the merits of the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but I feel that the Minister must now wish that he had never included the Civic Guards in this Bill at all.  If it was not for the humiliation which that would really mean, I believe they would be left out.  The Minister will probably agree with me there.  What made me intervene was a remark made by Senator Colonel Moore that the Army should not be called upon to support the civil power in a case like this.  The Senator was a British officer for many years and he knows the position better than anyone else in this House, when he speaks on such a question.  It is the second time I have heard the Senator mislead the House on this matter, which from his training he is acquainted with.  I do not want it to go out that what Senator Sir John Keane said was wrong, that military forces are called out by the Executive Council at any time to support the civil power.  The House has been told that men were brought in at a moment's notice, regardless of the normal system of recruiting and to the disadvantage of hundreds of young men all over the country whose names were on the list for employment as Civic Guards.  An appointment in the Guards is the most coveted position of honour in this country.  People were recruited at a moment's notice while military all over the place were standing idle, and were not used in the way that all civilised countries use them. I am sorry to have to say so but I think the lines taken in this debate have been unworthy.  The House has gone away from the main object&mdash;the big idea.  The Civic Guards should not be made the subject of Party politics.  That is particularly the case in a country like this, in which we have not yet arrived at a civic standard where the police have the general support of the populace in times of difficulty or distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> The facts which have been brought out have made me feel exactly like Senator Douglas, that the situation is somewhat different to what it was when the Dáil sent back this amendment. Unless the Minister can give some urgent reasons why other means should not have been taken, before an expenditure involving £70,000 was considered, at a time when the pay of the Guards was being cut, in one direction, while big receptions and garden parties were being held, as well as a reception to General Balboa, in the other direction, at a time when apparently there was economic distress, the unreality of the situation seems dreadful.  I hope the Minister will be able to clear it up and to satisfy the House.</P>

I read in a public statement of the Minister for Justice in the other House that the ordinary channels were used in the recruitment of that force. <Col N="878" /> He said the reason that force was recruited was because of the ordinary leakages or vacancies that occur in the course of a year or two.

      <P>I read myself in the Press that the Minister for Justice made that statement in the Dáil. Apart from the question of recruitment, let us get back to what the discussion is about, and that is the question of the cut in the salaries of the Gárda. The officials of the State have got security that the people on whom they are living, if you like, have not got. The producers have not got any security.  It must be remembered that Civic Guards are getting a good wage. Married men are not being reduced in their salaries.  That is a very important factor.  The married Guards are not being interfered with.  The day the Civic Guard is taken from the spade down the country he is brought up here and receives 50/- a week.</P>

I do not think there is one of them who would not at the moment be delighted to have got half of that 50/- a week, not to mind 50/- a week.</P>

      <P>The question is whether it is right or wrong to bring officials to a standard of living consistent with the means of the people who have to keep them.  The pay of the married Guards is not being cut; it is only the pay of the unmarried men.  The pay they are getting is very substantial, even when compared with the pay they got when the force was initiated, because it must be considered that the cost of living at that time was 50 per cent. higher than it is to-day.  If people will only leave out the political partisan point of view, I am sure they will satisfy themselves this cut is reasonable.  Time will prove that the Government action within the last week was the action of honest men in the best interests of peace and security here.  I believe, whoever rules in the future in this country, there is one thing at least that the present Government will get credit for and that is that they made an honest attempt to give a fair deal to everybody and to see that nobody would arrogate to himself the right to usurp the authority of the people.</P>

      <P>The kernel of this debate generally has been the steps which the Government have taken during the past few days to preserve public order.  The whole discussion has centred around the merits and demerits of that policy.  That, I suggest, is not the ground upon which this motion should be discussed.  The motion is to the effect that the Seanad do not insist upon the amendments which it inserted in the Bill and there has been no advertence whatsoever to what the effect of such an insistence would mean.  If insistence is determined upon this Bill cannot proceed further and it will not be the mere imposition of an additional £30,000 upon the backs of the taxpayers that will be at stake.</P>

      <P>I was saying that it is not a matter of £30,000 that is at stake from the taxpayers' point of view.  Rather is it a matter of almost £300,000 that is at stake and for this reason.  The Seanad has already sent back the Bill to the Dáil with an amendment.  The Dáil has considered the proposal of the Seanad on its merits and has not agreed with the Seanad in its view upon this matter and it accordingly has returned the Bill to this House.  If the Seanad now maintains its original attitude the Bill cannot proceed further until the statutory period has elapsed; that is to say, the Bill cannot become law within the present 12 months and every penny piece that has been deducted under this Bill will have to be returned to public servants.  The economies which it was hoped to secure under this Bill will have to be foregone and, instead, additional public expenditure will have to be provided for out of taxation and in no other way.  That, I submit, is the point; that is the aspect of the matter that should have been discussed in this debate and not the steps that the Government have taken to preserve public peace and order, because those steps would be taken and would continue <Col N="882" /> to be taken irrespective of the fate of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is not upon this Bill at all that the matter should have been raised.  I do suggest that if any Senator had felt it incumbent upon him to call into question the action of the Government on Saturday and Sunday last the proper course would have been to put down a motion in the Seanad condemning the action of the Government in that regard and to have had the justification or otherwise of that action discussed altogether apart from this Bill. To bring it into this debate is to confuse the issue and to confuse it, I suggest, to the grave detriment of the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>I am not anxious to avoid facing the question which Senator Sir John Keane has raised and dealing with it on its merits, but I do feel that I am being put in a very unfair position if it is said to me that I must give a satisfactory explanation at a time when it is not in the public interest to disclose all the information&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am in a rather doubtful mood as to whether or not I should allow the pistol to go off and let the Bill fall, if it were not for the fact that I am more concerned about the interests of the taxpayers than those who profess to defend those interests in this House and who talk most about Governmental expenditure and Governmental extravagance.</P>

      <P>As for example the Senator himself or the Senator who sits beside him.  I listened during Senator Gogarty's speech to an extraordinary melange of misrepresentation. I heard the Senator justify his refusal to accept the Dáil's point of view in respect of public economies on the ground that a Bill had been introduced into the Dáil and been passed the Oireachtas and been passed particularly by the Seanad without even a division upon it, to make good the promises and speeches, not merely of <Col N="883" /> this Government but its predecessor, to repay to American citizens the moneys which they had subscribed to the Irish Republican Loans Fund on the ground that it was essential that certain persons should get &ldquo;a rakeoff,&rdquo; in the choice language of the Senator.</P>

      <P>The paper cannot be dissociated from personalities.  I heard the Senator go on to state that the reason why it was necessary to reopen recruiting for the Gárda was the state of the President's nerves. The Senator is not, I believe, a neurologist, but I understand he is a surgeon.  When I heard him talking of a &ldquo;rake-off&rdquo; of ten per cent.  it reminded me of a surgeon operating upon the truth with a pick-axe.  I am sorry I have been led into that digression.  But to get back to the general policy of the Government with regard to public services, immediately we came into office we suspended recruiting to the Civic Guard.  We were anxious to reduce expenditure on that force, and, also, upon the Army. We did, in fact, in the first 12 months we were in office, substantially reduce expenditure on these services.  We were hopeful that after the result of the last general election the verdict of the people would be accepted by those who fought a civil war in order, as they said, to establish the sanctity of the people's will.  Instead of that the result of the election was scarcely declared when we found evidence which was afterwards produced in public to make us doubtful at least as to the good faith and the loyalty of some people who were then responsible for the control of the Gárda Síochána.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the answer. It was a clear and open confession that inside the Gárda there was a junta of officers&mdash;they are gone since&mdash;who were determined to make their will prevail even over that of the Executive Council.  That was the first circumstance that was disquieting, the first indication that there were certain elements in this country that were determined not to permit the people to have a stable Government, and to live in peace and security, unless they were at the head of affairs.  This uneasiness was intensified and deepened when it was found that the former Commissioner-the gentleman who was responsible for the destruction of these documents-was withholding from the Executive Council information which it had a right to have at its disposal.</P>

But I am assuming that that is the truth. That uneasiness, I was saying, was intensified when we saw an officer who was responsible for this extraordinary proceeding coming back and placing himself at the head of a force which, in a previous report to the <Col N="885" /> Executive Council, he described as a danger, as being well armed, and as containing a section of extreme-minded persons who would resort to force if needs be to secure their ends.</P>

I am certain no one would deny that if he had any personal responsibility for dealing with it he would feel, at any rate, uneasiness and alarm.  And that uneasiness and that alarm were shared not merely by the majority of the Dáil but, so far as their conduct manifested it, by the majority of the people in this country, not the less,when in the course of other statements in which he unfolded his full intentions, the late Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána indicated that his ultimate purpose was to establish a dictatorial form of Government in this country.  When that became known, the common people of this country, the workers in all the towns and cities, who had experience or at least had read of how trade unions and working-class people, aye, every grade and section in society, in other countries where that form of Government had been established, had been treated, became filled with uneasiness and alarm also, with more than uneasiness and alarm, with the deepest resentment, a resentment which was manifested on every occasion upon which the uniform which had been chosen for this Fascisti was worn in public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is true that the individuals have not appeared in great numbers but the attacks were not few.  They were general.  They were almost inevitable in the city of Dublin at any rate where-ever this blue uniform appeared, notwithstanding that every effort was made by the Gárda Síochána to prevent those attacks and to protect those who were subjected to them.  The Gárda did that on the instruction of the Government and in the discharge of their duty, in the same way as during the general election the Government had taken full steps to preserve the public peace&mdash;in the same way as in November, 1932 every effort was made to preserve here on a certain evening which during the past ten years has been an evening on which there have been public disturbances and public unrest to maintain order.  The Government, I repeat, took every step to ensure that peace and good order <Col N="887" /> would be preserved here.  Notwithstanding this the Government was powerless absolutely to prevent brawls and disturbances even where those who were the centre and the occasion of them appeared on the streets in comparatively small numbers.  I remind the Seanad of that not because I approve of these attacks&mdash;I deplore and condemn them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The explanation for many of the interruptions that come from the Opposition is the fact that members of the Opposition are disappointed that we did not have bloodshed on last Sunday.  They are disappointed and so are their friends in England who sent over a host of Press photographers.  They are disappointed because they had no pictures of a civil war.  The men who are shedding tears over the unfortunate blue shirts took damn good care that they did not wear any.  The generals walked up and down on the side walks and looked on at the disturbances.  They did not shed any tears there.  They kept them for this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was reminding the <Col N="888" /> Seanad of these incidents, incidents which will be within the full recollection of every member, not because I approve of them.  On the contrary, I very strongly reprobate and condemn them, but in order to prove that if the threatened parade of this organisation of dangerous and extreme men had taken place there was every danger of serious public disturbances, possibly eventuating in the destruction of property and loss of life.  I do not think that any person who will turn over in his mind the unpleasant incidents of the last five or six days will feel that is too strong an expression.  There would have been, I repeat, serious disturbances leading possibly to loss of life.  In those circumstances the Government, charged with the preservation of the public peace, decided to proclaim the meeting.  The fact that last Sunday, instead of being a day of turmoil and strife, was a day of comparative peace was the fullest justification that any Government would require or that the Seanad should require of any Government for its action. But in order to ensure that this peaceful condition of affairs should prevail it was essential that special powers should be availed of.  Accordingly, the Constitution (Amendment) Act, passed by the Oireachtas in 1931, had to be availed of.  In anticipation that it might be necessary to avail of that Act, the Government had to consider the forces that were at its disposal and what policy it would have to pursue if its fears eventuated in disorder.  An examination of the position disclosed that, while the strength of the Gárda Síochána was sufficient to enforce the law and maintain order in normal conditions here, nevertheless, the policy of the Government in stopping recruiting had so seriously reduced the strength of that force that it would be inadequate to deal with any abnormal position which might arise.  The question then arose as to whether it would be desirable to use the Army for the special purpose and, as a matter of general policy, it was decided that the Army, so far as it was possible, should be kept altogether apart from any civil disturbances here.  Not for the reason which Senator Staines suggested in the opening part of his speech, that there <Col N="889" /> would be any hesitation on the part of the Army, of any officer or any man in the Army, to fully uphold and support the duly constituted Government of the people in any emergency that might arise, but for this reason, that unfortunately the history of the Army is grounded in a civil war; that there is an element in the country that has not yet come to realise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Senator is anxious to withdraw that implication, to say he did not mean it, that he has not cast any reflection, and does not wish to cast any reflection upon the Army, or the Gárda Síochána, I accept it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because I think it is vital to the future of this country and this country's people that there should be no doubt in the mind of the general populace that the Government can rely implicitly, and does rely implicitly, upon the loyalty of the Army and of the Gárda Síochána.  But I say, and I say it with a great deal of diffidence, and I am sorry that the debate has made it necessary for me to refer to it at all, that the Army has a certain history which has made a certain element in this country, without any justification whatsoever, look askance at the Army, and deny to the <Col N="890" /> Army the confidence which the Government feels in the Army.  So far as the Army is concerned, we wish that every citizen will regard it, as we regard it, as a truly national army, as a sure bulwark and defence of this country against external aggression.  We wish that Army to be cherished and regarded by every element in our population as something to be proud of, as something to be honoured, and as something to be sustained and supported when the country's need requires it.  Therefore, on the ground of the highest public policy, we would refuse, unless we were driven to the last extremity, ever to bring out the Army in the streets of the capital of this country, or in any city or town in this country, against the Irish people, no matter what section of the Irish people might be involved.  That is why we thought it undesirable and inadvisable, on the grounds of the highest public interest, to involve the Army in the proceedings of last Sunday, if they possibly could be kept out of it.  I say, on general principles, that that is the soundest and the safest line for any Executive to pursue, particularly any Executive that is the successor, as we have been, to the aftermath of the civil war.  That is why, whatever may have been the practice in other countries, which have a longer tradition behind them, I think it would be exceedingly undesirable, unless, as I repeat again, in the last resort, and there is no other weapon to which recourse may be had, to utilise the Army in the preservation of internal peace in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question then arose, as we had an under-manned Gárda, weak and insufficient for any abnormal demands upon it, what were we to do?  We did exactly what our predecessors did when, in 1931, they had determined to put the Public Safety Act in operation. We recruited at once men of good character, wherever they were to be had, who would accept the duty, which members of the ordinary Gárda might not accept, of having to bear arms to defend public buildings in an emergency. I do not know whether some of the Senators who laugh remember their own speeches during this debate.  We were told how, because it was necessary to <Col N="891" /> prevent this parade of a private army on Sunday, the townships has to be denuded of Gárda, and burglaries were committed in the open daylight. Because the Government is forced to deal with a situation, which is not of its own creation, which it has tolerated almost to the point of weakness, because at last it is compelled to deal with it, are we to denude the townships and the suburbs and the surrounding towns of their proper police protection, and to leave them the prey of every robber, every burglar, every housebreaker that may feel himself at liberty then, and with licence then, simply because we would hesitate to follow the precedent that in a similar situation had been created for us by our predecessors?  There was a certain list of people who had applied for membership of the Gárda.  Those of them who had experience were taken on at once and were brought in for a limited time.  It is our intention, as soon as the emergency passes, to reduce the strength of the Gárda again and to revert to our old policy and suspend recruiting to the Gárda until such time as the force can be reorganised, upon a new basic.  It must be remembered that it is difficult for us to bring about that reorganisation in the course of 12 or 18 months. We had started on that road but now we find ourselves, as any Government may find itself, compelled temporarily by circumstances to reverse our policy, but only temporarily, I hope.  At the same time, we find ourselves with an organisation based upon the maintenance of numerous isolated units, scattered all over the country.  Barracks have been built for those scattered units and those barracks and premises must be maintained.  The organisation of the force has been based upon that decentralised dispersion.  We cannot undo that in the course of a night and I think that, when an emergency such as this arises, we have got to deal with it, limited as we are by the organisation which we have inherited.</P>
    <P>As soon as the emergency passes we will proceed with that reorganisation. I feel confident, and I am sure that <Col N="892" /> the general public feels confident also, that the emergency has passed already and that it has been made clear that the present Government will not tolerate any attempt to overthrow representative Government in this country unless those who wish to change our present system of parliamentary Government come, first of all, before the people as parliamentary candidates and secure a clear parliamentary mandate from the people for their programme.  I think, that when it has been made clear to all elements, both to those who would seek to have such a change and to those who would oppose it, that the menace which many people feared a month ago has passed and that the emergency has passed, we will be able to dispense with the recruits brought in during the past three or four weeks.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to put it to the Seanad that, in so far as anything we did in 1933 is concerned, we followed exactly and meticulously, I might say, the course pursued by our predecessors in 1931.  We were a Government called upon to deal with a sudden emergency and we had to find the people who, we were confident, would deal with that emergency.  The emergency I believe has passed and I trust that we shall be able, in due course, to dispense with the services of the supernumerary Guards. But there is no new force.  These men have been recruited to the Gárda and are being subject to Gárda discipline. They are under the control of the existing Gárda officers and are in uniform. So that, at any rate, they are not subject to the criticism which might easily have been levelled at their predecessors who were enrolled in 1931.  The people, at any rate, will know that they are officers of the State and members of the State forces.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt&mdash;possibly more fully than was advisable&mdash;with some of the statements made during this debate.  I should like to go back, however, again to what, I think, is the real measure at issue in this debate, and that is whether the Seanad, by insisting on this amendment, will hold up the Bill.  I have pointed out already that, if that course is taken, it can only mean one thing, and that is the imposition of additional taxation upon the backs of the people.  Frankly, I <Col N="893" /> admit&mdash;I have admitted it from the very beginning&mdash;that I am very anxious about the present position in that regard.  I am looking forward eagerly to the time when we shall be able to reduce the present rates of taxation but I am not, and the Government is not, going to permit a situation to arise in which at the close of the year we should face a deficit.  We believe that would be very damaging to our credit, that it would be more damaging to our credit than all the scares and ballyhooing which have taken place in the newspapers in the last five or six weeks.  I say that it would be a very serious thing for the Seanad to do anything that would endanger our credit.  We have seen the present Government come into office in circumstances of extreme difficulty.  The moment we came into office the National Loans began to fall, but after two or three months of our administration a change came about. When we came into office the purchases of Savings Certificates were falling off, but some time after we came into office a change came about there also.  People began to see that our régime was not going to be accompanied by scenes of bloodshed and turmoil, as had been so freely predicted. They began to see that we were tackling such difficulties as we had to meet manfully and courageously. The price of the National Loans began to appreciate in the market and the sales of Savings Certificates began to go up.  A couple of months ago the sales of the Savings Certificates were mounting at such a rate that we became alarmed, withdrew the old issue and substituted a new issue carrying exactly the same rate of interest as the British Savings Certificates.  We have found that the sales of these certificates show a very acceptable increase over the sales of the old certificates at the corresponding period of last year.  At any rate, so far as the mind of the small investor in this country is concerned, we have placed the credit of this State upon a level with that of the British State and our Savings Certificates can be freely sold here to yield only the same return as the British Savings Certificates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> One way or another, whether due to the policy of our predecessors or not, it has taken almost 11 years to bring about that condition of affairs.  If the Seanad insists on this amendment to-day and by such action holds up this Bill, what is the position with which we are going to be faced?  The position will be either that we have to face the situation and impose additional taxation upon the backs of the people&mdash;and does anybody think we can do that?&mdash; or else refuse to face it and run away from it and allow expenditure to go on without taking any corresponding steps to provide revenue to meet that expenditure and thus be faced with a deficit at the end of the year which, I hold, would be disastrous to our credit.  Such a situation, I think, would do irreparable damage to our credit.  For that reason, I ask the Seanad not to insist on this amendment and hold up this Bill, and I ask them to do so on the only ground on which this matter should have been discussed to-day, and that is on the ground of the effect of such a situation upon the public finances.  For that reason I ask the Seanad not to insist on this amendment and to agree with the Dáil in allowing the Bill to go through.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's statement I would like to ask a question on procedure before a vote is taken.  The Minister stated that, if by any chance the House did insist on its amendment, then the Bill must be held up.  I would like to have your view, a Chathaoirligh, on that because it seems to me that the Minister's statement does not represent the position correctly. In the case of the control of Manufacturers Act a similar circumstance arose.  Amendments came back from the Dáil.  The Seanad agreed to some and insisted on others. A compromise was arrived at.  The Dáil made a further suggestion to which we agreed.  Apart altogether from that, I do not want the statement to go forth that because this House insists on an amendment that no other arrangement can be made, and that the matter is finally disposed of until 18 months have elapsed.</P>

The Dáil can either accept the new position or insist on the old position with or without modification. If it insists on the old position then the Bill comes back to the Seanad again, but there will still be the opportunity for reaching accommodation between the two Houses.  To say that by refusing to agree with the Dáil now there is finality does not represent the position correctly.  The procedure is as I have stated.</P>

He has told us that the new Guards who have been recruited are men of experience.  I would be glad if the Minister would explain his statement.  Does he mean experience in the Civic Guards or in some other force or army?  Would he tell the House also if the new Guards are paid the same rates of wages as the ordinary civic Guard recruit is paid, and if, in the recruitment of this new force, every country has got its quota?  For instance, has the Country Monaghan got its quota?  We have a number of men there who have been on the waiting list for several years, and I claim that they are as good men as any others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the reason for bringing this Bill before the Houses of Parliament was to preserve the pension rights of civil <Col N="896" /> servants whose salaries will be affected by it, and that if the Government had not wished to preserve those pension rights to civil servants they could have, under the powers conferred on them by the Ministers and Secretaries Act, cut the salaries of civil servants without troubling the Oireachtas at all.  Therefore, if this Bill is dropped, as the Minister indicated it may be if this amendment is insisted upon, will not the Government have the right to make the cuts proposed under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, and in that way realise the sum that it is estimated the Bill in its present form will save to the Exchequer?  I think that when the Bill was in the Dáil the Minister did make a statement to the effect that the Government had power to do what I said under the Ministers and Secretaries Act.</P>

      <P>As to the terms upon which these men are being enrolled, I have no information at the moment. They have been enrolled by the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána acting under the instructions of the Minister for Justice that additional recruits were to be secured immediately.  These has been no such thing as an allocation of a quota to any particular country.  The position is that the Commissioner was entrusted with responsibility to secure suitable men at once; to bring the Civic Guard up to strength, or as near the strength as was considered desirable. My information is that nothing like 400 men have been enrolled and it is not thought that anything like 400 men will be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of procedure to be followed in connection with this Bill, it is extremely doubtful if the Government can find time to bring the Bill again before the Dáil.  Even if it could, what is there to be gained by putting the Dáil and the Seanad in the rather undignified position of bandying this Bill backwards and forwards to get agreement on it?  The position of the Government is that it feels that all public servants must bear their share of the burden, and that if one section is going to be exempted, then all sections would have an equal claim to exemption: that the Army, the national teachers and civil servants should be <Col N="897" /> put in the same privileged position as the Gárda.  They are doing the same useful work for the State, and are equally indispensable.  What is the advantage, from the point of view of public dignity or honour, of bandying this Bill backwards and forwards from the Seanad to the Dáil and back again to the Seanad?  The Dáil has expressed its view that, in all the circumstances, it cannot accept the point of view of the Seanad in this matter.  If the Seanad insists upon its original attitude, what is the use of sending the Bill back again to the Dáil to have it returned to the Seanad?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that the House is more or less doing now what it did on a previous occasion with another measure.  I pointed out the procedure that was adopted then. I did that in view of the Minister's statement that, if the amendment was insisted on, then the Government would drop the rest of the Bill.  If that course is taken, of course, it will be the Government's responsibility.  The procedure, so far as this House is concerned, has been clearly stated.</P>

      <P>I do not think we can accept the statement that whatever happens, if the amendment is insisted upon, the responsibility will be on the Government.  This is a matter in which the public finances are intimately associated, and if the decision of the House is that one section of public servants is to be exempted, then that is a matter of vital principle.  Four services were included in the Bill originally.  If it is decided that one service goes out, then of course that affects a vital principle in the Bill, and the onus will be on the Seanad if it is dropped and on the Seanad only.  If the Seanad, in opposing the Bill, indicates that it is its view to take what is a vital element out of the Bill and thereby emasculate it, then it is not the intention of the Government to proceed with it with regard to other services.</P>

Surely to goodness the Minister must know the rate of pay it was decided to give them.  It was stated in the <i>Irish Press</i>, in the <i>Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i>, that they are being paid £3 10s. a week.  I say that they cannot legally be paid £3 10s. a week.  If the period of training that a recruit has to go through were dispensed with in their case, they could be paid £3 a week, but it would require an order of the Executive Council to dispense with the period of training.  Therefore, we have the position that these untrained men are being turned out on a defenceless public at £3 10s. a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have said that the Senator dealt with the matter. The statement, if not made by the Senator, has been made by others. Since we voted on this proposal before, a charge of about £70,000 a year has been imposed by the Government. As regards the £33,000 to be <Col N="899" /> secured by the &ldquo;cut,&rdquo; many of us considered that we should not hold up the Bill inasmuch as the Government could overrule us by taking this item out of the Bill and making it a Money Bill.  Therefore, we would not be justified in entering upon a fight between the two Houses.  The Minister has told us that this £70,000&mdash;or whatever the sum is&mdash;will be merely a temporary charge.  Before we vote on this question, can the Minister give us an assurance that if, as we all hope, peace is resumed and the country is not to be in the position we have been dreading for the last two or three weeks, this temporary force will be disbanded, the Gárda force will be what it was before this disturbance arose and will be recruited according to the ordinary methods?  That is a question by which Senators' votes will be guided.  If the Minister will give us that assurance, I am certain that it will have a great deal of weight with many Senators.  If this position had not arisen, many Senators would probably have been willing to let the Government have their way.  If there is to be a permanent addition of armed members to the police force, that is a totally different question.  With that in front of us, the whole situation would require such an amount of investigation that we would probably be justified in holding up the Bill.</P>

    <P>What the Minister said left the impression on my mind that the Government were dealing with a temporary situation and that they took what they thought were the best means of dealing with that temporary situation because, as the Minister explained, they did not want to use the Army. But if that temporary situation is to be dealt with by the permanent addition of an armed force to the Guards, we ought to know that before we vote. If that is the position, it is completely different from the position which obtained when we dealt with this question before.  The Minister can help us greatly by telling us what the facts are. If we are positively assured that this is merely a temporary force to deal with a temporary situation, that these men will be disbanded when the trouble <Col N="900" /> is over and that the police force will revert to its status as an unarmed force, then we can make up our minds on the present issue.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I am not the Minister for Justice and I am not in a position to say what are the advantages of the methods of recruitment adopted.  I presume that the Commissioner of the Gárda, having satisfied himself that additional men were required, took them from those he thought best fitted for the duty, after they had been examined by the responsible authorities and after the authorities had satisfied themselves that they were suitable for the purpose for which they were required.  On the question <Col N="901" /> of permanency, the present intention is not to have a permanent armed force of this nature and, when the emergency is past, that these men will be disbanded or, perhaps, absorbed into the Army or dealt with in some other way.  It is certainly not the intention to keep them as part of the permanent forces of the State.  Beyond that, I am not in a position to say anything.  That <Col N="902" /> is the extent of my information on the matter&mdash;that it is not the intention to keep these men as part of the permanent armed forces of the State, that as soon as the emergency passes, they will be disbanded.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Seanad do not insist on amendment 2.&rdquo; An amendment made in lieu thereof by the Dáil is set out on the Order Paper.  The original amendment to Section 7 (2), in the name of Senator Douglas, which was passed here, read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, no deduction shall be made from the salary of any person in the Civil Service of the Government of Saorstát Eireann&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  who was appointed with a special agreement as to the amount of his remuneration and who satisfies the Minister that, for the purpose of accepting such appointment, he gave up any profession or occupation from which he derived an income not less than the remuneration which he agreed to accept in respect of such appointment;</P>
      <P>(b)  who was appointed subsequent to the 6th December, 1922, with a special agreement as to his remuneration and who for the purpose of accepting such appointment gave up an appointment in the service of any other country.</P>
      <P>It will be remembered by the Seanad that when that amendment was carried and when it was debated, Senator Douglas and other Senators who voted for it would have been satisfied with some alternative form.  Here is the alternative form:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of Section 3, in lieu of the proposed new sub-section inserted by the Seanad in Section 7, a new sub-section inserted as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  Where a person from whose salary a deduction is required by Part II of this Act to be made satisfies the Minister that he accepted an appointment in a civil capacity in the public service of Saorstát Eireann on an invitation made to him by or on <Col N="903" /> behalf of the Government of Saorstát Eireann after the 6th day of December, 1922, and that for the purpose of accepting such appointment he relinquished an appointment in the public service of another country, then, and in any such case, if having regard to the terms on which such person accepted such first-mentioned appointment the Minister considers that it is fair and reasonable that the remuneration or some portion of the remuneration of such person should not be treated as salary for the purposes of this Act, the Minister shall determine that (as the case may be) no part or a specified part only of the remuneration of such person shall be deemed to be salary for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    <P>I do submit that the new section drafted in pursuance of the understanding arrived at is satisfactory and ought to be accepted by the Seanad.</P>

What the section sets out is: &ldquo;This part of this Act applies to every person who, at any time during the current financial year (a) is employed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to make provision for the setting up of a company having for its special objects the acquisition, erection and operation of sugar factories and for empowering the Minister for Finance to invest in such company in accordance with the Government's policy for the extension of the sugar beet industry.  I need not remind the House of the important part that the cultivation of sugar beet plays in the agriculture of virtually every European country, nor the extensive organisation set up in <Col N="908" /> most European countries for its manufacture into sugar.  Nor need I remind the House how well suited to the cultivation of sugar beet are the soil and the agricultural methods that prevail here.  I am not an agriculturist but I understand that the sugar content of our beet is exceptional, and that the yield per acre is exceptional also almost in Europe.  The only question that would arise is whether it would be an economic proposition for us to endeavour to supply all our needs for sugar out of the produce of our own soil.  Apart altogether from the very low price at which either cane sugar or beet sugar can be delivered upon our shores there is no reason <i>a priori</i> why we, ourselves, should not manufacture and cultivate our own sugar.  The question as to the merits of this Bill depends entirely upon the economic advantage of this proposition.  The proposal under the Bill is to give the Minister power to form a company which would undertake ultimately the manufacture of our full sugar requirements.</P>
      <P>At the present moment we have in existence in Carlow a sugar factory which roughly has an output of from 20,000 to 25,000 tons per annum.  It will be convenient to discuss the Carlow factory in terms of 20,000 tons per annum output.  In addition to the supply that is manufactured here by ourselves, we have imported on the average during the past three years 83,000 tons of sugar of an average value of £831,000.  We can assume, therefore, that our total consumption of sugar, both home manufactured and imported, per year, is 100,000 tons, and is likely to be such in the immediate foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is how much would it cost us per annum to manufacture this sugar for ourselves?  I have pointed out that as matters stand the value of the sugar imported each year is over £800,000.  An investigation by an interDepartmental Committee set up by the Government during the past eight or nine months, which has very carefully examined this project, indicates that it should be possible, with a number of modern factories, enjoying management at least as skilled as that possessed by the present Carlow factory, and putting the price of <Col N="909" /> beet at aboupt 35/- per ton, with a root content of 17½ per cent. sugar, so that three cwts. of sugar would be secured per ton of beet, to manufacture sugar here at about 20/- per cwt.  The cost might rise to 21/- per cwt., but it would be between 20/- and 21/- per cwt. on the basis I have indicated to the House.  As against this, as I pointed out, we import approximately 80,000 tons of sugar at a price approximately of 10/- per cwt.  Thus it will be seen at once that if we propose to manufacture all our sugar requirement it would be necessary to protect the home manufactured sugar by the imposition of a duty of 10/- to 11/8 per cwt.  It is proposed to impose a customs duty of approximately double the present customs duty.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out in that connection that the Government would still require to derive a very substantial revenue of the order of £700,000 or £800,000 from sugar and that consequently, since all our sugar would be home-manufactured, the revenue would be derived mainly from the excise duty.  The customs duty over and above that would have to be of such a margin that we could consistently keep out foreign competition.  At first sight I know it will be argued: &ldquo;What is the use of making our own sugar at a cost of 20/- per cwt. when we can import at least as good an article at a price of 10/- per cwt.&rdquo;?  In that connection it has to be remembered that the whole of this 20/- per cwt. will be spent here. That is to say, if the total cost of producing here at home 80,000 tons which we now import were put at £1,600,000, the whole of that £1,600,000&mdash;with the exception of the amount which we might have to pay for foreign fuel, and the sum represented by the interest and sinking fund upon the capital cost of the machinery which we import to manufacture that sugar&mdash;would be retained in this country.  I said that at the present moment we are importing sugar which costs us £800,000, that in order to manufacture that sugar we shall probably have to erect three additional factories and that these factories together with the Carlow factory would involve us in expenditure on foreign-made plant of about £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>If we assume that the interest, the <Col N="910" /> sinking fund and the depreciation on that plant would require about 12 per cent. to meet them, we find that on account of this one million pounds we have to provide each year and send out of the country either directly or indirectly, at the outset or for a period of years, £120,000 per annum.  In addition to that it has been calculated that we should require to import £80,000 worth of fuel.  In that connection, I should like to point out that experiments have been going on at the Carlow factory for some time which indicate that it may be possible to utilise what is known as Castlecomer &ldquo;duff,&rdquo; which is Castlecomer coal refuse, for fuelling the boilers.  When the new factories are in operation these experiments might be carried to such a stage that we should be able to provide a very large part of the fuel requirements for the factories from our home resources.  However, that is in anticipation and these anticipations may not necessarily be fulfilled. Taking the worst possible aspect of the case, assuming that we should import the whole of the £80,000 worth of fuel, we should find that our outgoings would be represented by £120,000, which would cover interest, sinking fund and depreciation and the £80,000 which we should expend for fuel, making in all £200,000. We have to set off that possible outlay, the amount which would leave this country every year, against the sugar which would be manufactured here at home and which would be worth, if it were imported sugar, £800,000. The difference between these two figures, the £800,000 on the one hand which we save by manufacturing sugar at home and the £200,000 which we send out of the country, represents, I would suggest, the net economic advantage to this country of manufacturing our sugar here.  The manufacture of the whole of our sugar supplies therefore would represent a net economic gain to the community of £600,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>In addition to this there are, as members of the Seanad who are familiar with reactions of sugar beet growing on the general agricultural economy are aware, very many other important advantages.  There may be certain increases in the amount of employment given upon land in this country, certain <Col N="911" /> increases in the number of hands actually employed in the country.  If there is no very substantial increase in the number of hands, at any rate there is this, that those who have land will find their time more fully occupied in tilling it and in tilling it more remuneratively if sugar beet growing is introduced into their economy than at the present moment.  A Committee which has examined this matter has reported to the Government that it is satisfied that the introduction of the sugar beet industry into Carlow and the neighbouring counties resulted in an actual increase in tillage in most of the areas and in any event has more than counteracted the very substantial decline in tillage which might otherwise have taken place.  In addition to the employment given on the land, of course there would be a considerable amount of employment given in the various factories.  During the off-season there would be permanently employed almost 700 additional hands and during the campaign employment would be found for 2,600 hands.</P>
    <P>The importance of these considerations, I think, cannot be too greatly stressed.  First of all we would save for the community as a whole&mdash;and it is only from the point of view of the community as a whole that this proposition can be judged, not from the point of view of the individual consumer&mdash; £600,000 per annum which would go some considerable distance to redress the adverse trade balance.  We should in addition provide on the land an increased amount of remunerative employment for all the people engaged in this industry.  At the present moment the land of this country is not being fully worked, not being as fully worked as it should be and as fully worked as it must be when changes in the cattle supply to the neighbouring market more and more develop.  There would be in addition to the employment in the factories a considerable amount of employment given in limestone quarries, in the sack-making industry and in the transport industry generally.  I think that when the Seanad consider this matter fully they will have no difficulty in making up their minds that, in the circumstances <Col N="912" /> of the time, and, particularly, in view of the changes that inevitably will have to be made in our agricultural policy in view of the changed policy elsewhere, something will have to be done to provide an alternative use for our land. In that connection, I should like to say that I am advised that there is no inconsistency in trying to develop our cattle trade to its utmost limit and, at the same time, endeavouring to develop the beet sugar industry here.  I am told that the offal and refuse of the beet is a very good cattle food, and that the by-products of the manufacture of the beet itself into sugar can likewise be used.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as it stands, is divided into three parts.  The first part, I think, sufficiently explains itself.  The second part deals with the formation of the company which it is proposed to set up to carry on the business.  This new company will be registered under the Companies Act as a limited liability company and the nominal capital will be £2,000,000 divided into 2,000,000 shares of £1 each.  These shares may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, be divided into several classes and have attached thereto any preferential, deferred, qualified or special rights, privileges or conditions. Under Section 7 the Minister is empowered to acquire shares of any class provided that the amount of the shares so acquired does not exceed £500,000 nominal.  The company is also under the Bill authorised to issue debentures to an amount not exceeding the paid-up share capital, and these debentures shall be guaranteed as to principal and interest by the Minister.  A prospectus will in due course be issued in respect of such portion of the authorised share capital as the company may find necessary to offer for public subscription.  In that connection I should like to say that, if an adequate response from the public is not forthcoming, it is hoped that the new Industrial Credit Corporation will underwrite the issue and make good any deficiency.  Arising out of this, it may be said that the company will be financed largely out of public moneys and it will be essential that it should be given a monopoly of the sugar requirements of the home market in <Col N="913" /> order that it may be able to carry out its full programme.  Accordingly, it is considered desirable that the Minister should have a controlling interest in the operations of the company, and that of the number of directors, which has been fixed at seven, four, including the managing director, will be nominated by the Minister for Finance. Control of the company in this way is to be continued so long as the rate of customs duty chargeable on the imported sugar is higher than the rate of excise duty on the home-manufactured sugar; that is to say, as long as the company enjoys any measure of protection, and that, I think we must assume, it will continue to do so long as it is Governmental policy to manufacture all our sugar requirements at home.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the memorandum and articles of association of the company are subject to the approval of the Government and powers are also taken in Part III of the Bill to compulsorily acquire land, etc., and do other things necessary in order to enable the erection of the factories to be proceeded with expeditiously.  It may be thought that these powers are formidable, but it is not anticipated that any occasion will arise for putting them into effect.  They are merely included in the measure as a safeguard so as to ensure that no undue delay will occur.  It is hoped the factories will be completed in time to deal with the 1934 beet crop, and it is essential that the preliminary work in connection with the construction of the factories should commence early next month, if possible.  If any undue delay were to occur in the occupation of the lands selected as the most suitable sites, it might not be found feasible to have the factories erected in time to carry out the terms of the contracts which would necessarily have to be entered into with the growers for the provision of beet.  The company, however, I should like to say, will proceed to purchase in the ordinary way the land they require for the sites, and if they are compelled to use the power of compulsory acquisition which it is proposed to give them, it will only, I anticipate, be in isolated instances and <Col N="914" /> in relation to very small areas.  The powers which are taken in this part of the Bill, and to which I have referred, will terminate at the end of five years, at the end of which time the company will be in a position to know definitely the number of factories that will ultimately be required.  While the Government feel that, in the circumstances of the day, it will be essential that a substantial subscription should be made towards the capital of the company, it is desired, at the same time, to leave the company as free as possible to carry out the task of establishing the industry.  Once the company is formed, it is the intention of the Government that there should be as little Governmental interference with it as possible.  The directors will be left as free as possible to carry out the undertaking entrusted to them.  They will be empowered to secure the best available technical management, and I am in a position to assure the Seanad that, as soon as the Bill becomes law and the company is formed, the most highly-skilled technical manangement in Europe will probably be available for the company.  It is the intention to allow them to act in accordance with the advice of that technical management in matters pertaining to the construction and equipment of the factory and, in short, to allow the company to develop the business in the same way as a privately-owned company would be allowed.</P>
    <P>It is also the desire of the Government that this new company should acquire the Carlow factory, if the proprietors of that factory are willing to dispose of their interest in it at a fair price.  In that connection, I should like to point out that the existing contract with the Carlow factory has still three further manufacturing seasons to run.  If we cannot acquire the factory at the moment, it is not the intention of the Government to renew the contract with the Carlow factory at the end of the period.  At the same time, it is not the intention of the Government to interfere with the contract.  In any event, at the very latest in 1936 the company will be the sole manufacturers of sugar in the Irish Free State and will enjoy that monopoly which it <Col N="915" /> is felt is essential to the successful development of the industry here.  I do not know whether the members of the Seanad would like to discuss this matter further on the Second Reading.  If so, I should like, in accordance with the suggestion that has been already before the House, to have the debate adjourned at this stage, I having concluded my statement.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned until to-morrow.</P>

      <P>On the completion of the First Stage of the Pier and Harbour <Col N="916" /> Provisional Order Confirmation Bill, 1933, this afternoon the Second Stage was fixed for to-morrow.  I now understand that it is desirable that there should be a week's interval between the two stages, in order that time may be allowed for any petitions to be presented.  I take it that there is no objection to our discharging the order already made and to making a fresh order for the Second Stage to be taken on this day week.  Is that agreed?</P>
      <P>Ordered accordingly.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 17th August.</P>
