    <Title>Road Traffic Bill, 1933&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That this Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is founded on the report of the InterDepartmental Committee on the Control and Regulation of Road Traffic.  That Committee consisted of representatives of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, Department of Justice and the Department of Industry and Commerce. Their report was circulated to members of the Oireachtas in October, 1928. The Committee received very full evidence both written and oral, and the minutes of evidence will be found in the library.  A glance through the Bill will at once show that it is very detailed and comprehensive in character.  It is what most of us would like to see from time to time, a codifying measure, and has the distinct advantage that there is little or no legislation by reference.  Its very length and detailed character is some explanation of the delay in bringing the Bill to its present stage.  In November, 1931, it had, in fact, passed the Committee Stage in the Dáil, but other matters intervened, including a General Election, which resulted in a change of administration, and the Bill had to be re-examined and re-introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beyond mentioning that the Bill is divided into 11 Parts containing in all 174 Sections, together with a Schedule which repeals five Acts entirely and specified portions of 11 other Acts, it is not proposed to go into the measure in a detailed way.  It will be more helpful to give a general review of those provisions and the details can be more properly looked into on the Committee Stage.  Looking at the Schedule it will be noted that some of <Col N="1062" /> the enactments repealed are from 70 to 80 years old and that even what may be called the charter of the motorist is 30 years old.  The number of enactments mentioned in the Schedule shows how desirable it was to codify the legislation.  This has been done in the Bill before the House by discarding obsolete, or useless, matter; by retaining anything of value; by improving, where modern traffic development has shown improvements to be necessary and finally by bringing forward entirely new matter which such developments called for.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for re-classification of motor vehicles in terms which more closely indicate the type of vehicle covered by the description applied to it.  Up to this a motor car is legally known as a light locomotive. The term locomotive is now to be applied, with few exceptions, to what the average person understands to be a locomotive.  Similarly, the term light motor vehicle now adopted indicates a small car, whether a private car or a small lorry.  The requirements of each class are fully set out, and as it is not always easy to foresee developments in the construction of vehicles, power is taken to vary the classification by an Order of the Minister, but such Order is to be approved by Resolution of each House before the Order can become effective.</P>
    <P>The law with regard to driving licences is being entirely re-cast. Different age limits are laid down in respect of the driving of motor cycles, light motor vehicles, heavy motor vehicles, goods carrying and passenger carrying.  The minimum age limit under existing legislation is 14 years for the driving of a motor cycle, but we think that under modern traffic conditions that minimum age should not be less than 16 years.  We think that drivers of public passenger carrying vehicles of the bus and charabanc type should be at least 21 years of age. These ages will not, it is thought, be considered unreasonable in the light of other provisions in the Bill&mdash;for example, the removal of the speed limit in the case of the light motor <Col N="1063" /> vehicle (unless it is drawing a trailer) and the increased speed limits laid down for buses and charabancs. There may be some difference of opinion, of course, on these proposals, but they are at least a recognition of the fact that we must move with the times.  In dealing with these speed limits it must always be borne in mind that the most stringent regulation is proposed to deal with the offence of dangerous driving, including the driving of vehicles by persons under the influence of drink. If motorists in future do not feel themselves subject to speed traps they must bear in mind that they are liable to very heavy penalties, including both fine and imprisonment, if they are proved guilty of dangerous driving. We think we are justified in placing reliance on these clauses to cure the evils which exist to-day rather than reliance on mere arbitrary speed limits.  In the case of the heavy vehicle other considerations enter into the matter&mdash;for example, the greater distance such vehicles have to travel before they can be stopped. The question of road damage would also enter into consideration.  Power is being taken in the Bill to vary the speed limits which are laid down, but any Order of this kind must be approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The demand for a Bill of this kind was, I think, largely brought about by the growth of the modern bus as an agency of travel in this country and by the fact that in respect of all motor vehicles accidents happened and no compensation was payable to the injured party or to the representatives of people who were killed.  For these reasons, approximately half the Bill is devoted to legislation concerning compulsory insurance and the regulation and control of public hire vehicles.</P>
    <P>Under the head of compulsory insurance there is unlimited liability in respect of injury to persons.  We have also thought it desirable to provide for injury to property to a limited extent, and we have placed the limit under that head at £1,000.  Claims in respect of property of greater value must be <Col N="1064" /> dealt with by the owners themselves effecting the necessary insurances.  I have had definite statements from the representatives of insurance companies that they are prepared to do all in their power to carry out the provisions of the Bill in a reasonable way.  We have endeavoured to secure that claims will not be turned down by insurance companies on purely formal or technical grounds.  We propose to specify conditions that must not be inserted in policies, by way of restriction of liability.  By the special provisions for a combined policy and guarantee it should be possible for people who are willing to bear some portion of the risk themselves to get a cheaper insurance.  They would, of course, have to get a guarantee in respect of the portion they are carrying themselves.</P>
    <P>We have cured what I believe to be some serious defects in the law in respect of claims.  I refer to the position in Section 75 (2) where the insured dies or becomes bankrupt or insolvent the monies payable to such insured on behalf of an injured party shall not rank as assets of the insured or applicable to the payment of other debts.  Another feature to which I refer is the extension of the personal liability in Section 168 for negligent driving to the real and personal estate of the person who caused the injury. The third defect in reference to cases of compensation is also specially dealt with in Section 167 under which the State accepts liability in the same way as any of its citizens.  At present, payments by the State are made on an <i>ex-gratia</i> basis and no one regards that system as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In regard to public hire vehicles the Bill places full control in the hands of the Gárda Síochána and contains provisions for appeals to the Courts in certain cases&mdash;generally where the character of the applicant is concerned &mdash;and to the Minister in other cases&mdash; generally where the vehicle itself is in question.  Already the Gárda Síochána have had limited powers in Dublin County Borough.  The Bill enlarges those powers and extends them to the whole State.  Vehicles will be subject to expert examination at <Col N="1065" /> the outset and to periodical inspection while in use.  Drivers of public hire vehicles must possess certificates of competency of driving and conductors must be carried on all the larger buses. We have found it necessary (Section 90) to deal with the special cases where buses and other means of transport are not available so that children in outlying districts may be brought to school and that people will have transport facilities where public events attract an assemblage of the people.  We must, I think, face up to the position that we have not buses and railways everywhere, and I think that a suitable compromise of the various difficulties&mdash;of which I am not at all unmindful&mdash;has been reached by placing the matter in the primary control of the local Gárda Superintendent.</P>
    <P>The present law requires only one white light in the front of a motor car. We think there should be two.  They will define the width of the vehicle. We provide for the carrying of red reflectors on the rear of the ordinary pedal cycle and on all other vehicles which are not mechanically propelled vehicles.  We ask, however, for a lamp showing a red light to the rear in the case of such vehicles where they carry a load projecting more than six feet. Of course, all motor vehicles will continue to carry a red light in the rear as well as a white light in the rear, the white light to indicate the identification number.  Provision is also made for the lighting of vehicles drawing or being drawn by other vehicles and for the carrying of additional lamps in certain cases.  That is dealt with in Section 160.  The problem of dealing with dazzling headlights does not yet appear to have been solved.  My Department are, however, watching developments in the solution of the difficulties and we are taking power in Section 160 (1) (c) to deal with this matter if and when the solution can be found.  In the Bill as originally introduced we had a section requiring a person driving animals on the public road to carry a lamp.  This seems to be objected to as onerous and in fact unnecessary. On the Committee Stage we modified <Col N="1066" /> it by the substitution of a red reflector or a warning instrument, but this, too, apparently was not quite acceptable, and after full consideration we decided to drop it and the present Bill, as amended on Report Stage in the Dáil, does not contain it.  The Bill also makes provision in regard to parking places; appointment and payment of assistants at such places; erection of weigh bridges; closing of roads to vehicles; punishment of joy-riders; restriction on continuous driving; payments to hospitals, and very many other matters of a miscellaneous and useful character.</P>
    <P>I think the enactment of this measure which is in itself a handbook of the traffic laws should be of immense advantage to all those concerned in the administration of such laws.  Its structure is, we feel, sound and progressive. It aims at securing public safety on the roads, and where public safety is violated the Bill will secure payment to the injured party or to the representatives of the victims of fatal accidents caused by the negligent motorist.  No doubt suggestions will be made for the modification of the Bill. These suggestions will have the fullest consideration and examination, as our object is to secure that the Bill in its final form will reflect the considered judgement and combined wisdom of all Parties in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that every member of the House will agree that this is a measure very much desired and not by any means hurried.  The Minister said that the Report on which the Bill is based was circulated in 1928, and it is known to those who read the Dáil Reports that the Bill, or a similar Bill, has been before that House for a couple of years, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was struck by the remark which the Minister made at the end of his speech, when he spoke of the Bill as being, in effect, a handbook of the traffic laws.  I have endeavoured to read and to understand the Bill, but I think it is very far from being a handbook, if one means by that expression something of easy reference and easy understanding.  On the contrary, it seems to me to be rather unnecessarily detailed and difficult to understand. <Col N="1067" /> I would suggest the desirability of an official handbook being issued to explain the Bill.  That is by no means meant jocosely but quite seriously as a proposal that would be of use to the average person interested either as driver or as a person likely to be injured by a driver of a motor car. In the Bill I come across quite a number of phrases or terms that seem to me to be unnecessarily unwiedly.  The term &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo; is transformed right through the Bill into the term &ldquo;mechanically propelled vehicle.&rdquo; Motor vehicle is a term that is very easily understood, and is just as expressive and explanatory as the term &ldquo;mechanically propelled vehicle.&rdquo;  I find in the Road Traffic Act, 1930, that that change is very simply adopted by saying that the term &ldquo;mechanically propelled vehicle&rdquo; shall be called hereinafter a &ldquo;motor vehicle.&rdquo;  That seems to me to be just a little illustration as to how this Bill could be simplified for the average person who is likely to be affected by the Bill.  I realise that to attempt to simplify it now would be almost an impossibility; nevertheless, it seems to be worth consideration as to whether some modification of that kind could not be made even at this very late stage.  We get phrases like &ldquo;consequential disqualification&rdquo; and &ldquo;ancillary disqualification&rdquo;&mdash;very interesting terms, no doubt, but not easily understood and not quite suitable for a handbook.</P>
    <P>I am not going to deal with what might be called the general principles of the Bill, but there is a number of minor matters that will have to be dealt with, I think, on the Committee Stage.  There are a couple of these to which, I think, it might be well to direct attention with a view to consideration being given to them before the Committee Stage begins.  Some matters, probably, would not be easily dealt with by the unofficial Senator.  I have two items particularly in mind. One of these is a minor matter really&mdash; I think it is Section 15&mdash;where in the case of a person applying for a driving licence, there is no indication of personal application being necessary, and it has come to my notice recently that <Col N="1068" /> it is habitual in these days for a firm having a number of vehicles to apply en bloc by an agent or an employee going down to the tax office, putting in a number of applications, signed either originally by the applicant, or by the person who is making the payment of the motor tax in the name of the applicant.  It seems to me that that is a matter which ought to be remedied in Committee Stage and that the applicant, when making an application, should apply in person.  However, that is purely a minor matter.</P>
    <P>Section 30 is much more important, because it deals with public safety.  I do not know to what degree my comments on this might be acceptable to many of my friends, but where a person is charged with driving or attempting to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle while he is drunk, he is guilty of an offence, and there is a rigorous punishment provided for such offence; but there is provision made for an appeal against the decision of the District Justice.  Previous legislation, touching on this kind of subject, gave the District Justice power to disqualify, within his discretion, during the period between the hearing before the Court of Summary Jurisdiction and the Appeal Court.  That discretion is removed under this Bill, and the person who is charged with being drunk while driving or attempting to drive a vehicle may appeal, and in the period between the first hearing and the appeal he is free to continue driving.  The case may be a perfectly clear case, and the person may be proved to be completely incapable by virtue of his regular habits of drunkenness, but if he appeals, during the period between the first hearing and the appeal, he is free to continue driving.  This seems to me to be a deliberate omission, because in the Acts on which this particular Bill is, to some extent, founded, there was provision made for the suspension of the licence during the period between the first hearing and the appeal.</P>
    <P>In that same section also there seems to be an omission in respect to the question of control.  As the Bill reads, every person who drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle in a public <Col N="1069" /> place while he is drunk shall be guilty of an offence In previous statutes, and in the Road Traffic Act of 1930&mdash;a British Act&mdash;they have dealt with the person in control of a motor vehicle. In this Bill, the phrase &ldquo;the person in control of&rdquo; or &ldquo;when in charge of&rdquo; is removed.  At least, it does not appear.  This kind of case appears as likely to arise, or possible of arising, and for such a case there is no penalty involved&mdash;a man may be too drunk even to attempt to drive a car, and if he can be proved to be too drunk to attempt to drive a car there is no offence under this Bill.  A man may be sitting at the wheel of a motor car and he may know quite well that he is incapable of driving, and he refuses to drive or to attempt to drive, but he is in charge of the car.  His defence is a perfect one if he can satisfy the justice that he was too drunk, and knew he was too drunk, to attempt to drive the car.  The offence here is for driving or attempting to drive, and the terms of the Road Traffic Act&mdash;I do not know whether the provision existed in previous Irish legislation or not&mdash;that is, where it was an offence to be drunk in charge of a car&mdash;are omitted.  That, I think, would require some reconsideration, and we ought, at least, to have regard to such a possibility and make provision that a person who is in charge of a car must be a sober man. Those are the only two points to which I want to direct attention with a view to reconsideration between now and the Committee Stage.  Other matters, more technical and more difficult to explain, would have to be raised on the Committee Stage, but I would like some consideration given to the particular aspect of the section I have quoted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody in this House thoroughly agrees that such a measure as this is absolutely necessary.  I agree with Senator Johnson that this Bill deals so thoroughly with road traffic that any discussion on it will be more useful in Committee than on the Second Stage.  However, I should like to touch on the point, as Senator Johnson did, of consequential disqualification; that is, in a case where a driver is convicted of drunkenness while either driving or <Col N="1070" /> attempting to drive a car, in addition to such penalties as are set out here, it follows as a consequence that his licence is suspended.  I would ask the Minister to look at sub-section (3) of Section 30, which deals with that matter, and I wish to know if the consequential disqualification follows in case a person is convicted under that section; that is, where a man may be either under the influence of drugs or under the influence of drink, but not drunk; because I think that such consequential disqualification should apply to that section also.</P>
      <P>With regard to the speed limit, I think myself that we are all suffering from a mania for speed and I trust that the Minister will leave it to the option either of the Superintendent of the Guards or of the local authority to construct such speed limits, within the areas over which they have jurisdiction, as they may deem advisable or necessary.  Of course that is a Committee point.  With regard to compulsory insurance, every decent insurance company will welcome it, and more especially in regard to third party injuries.  The Minister made a statement which I, as one connected with insurance to some degree, resent; that is, that precaution will have to be taken to prevent the turning down of claims by companies on the ground of technicalities or informalities.  Everyone who has any connection with insurance knows that, not only in respect of motor accidents but in respect of other accidents insurance companies always pay, except there is substantial reason to show that there is no obligation to pay at all.  It may be well if the law is tightened up so as to ensure that shady companies should not evade their obligations, but in the case of the vast bulk of insurance companies there is no necessity for this tightening up at all; the law needs no strengthening in regard to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with previous speakers that on the whole the Bill is an exceedingly good one and that, after detailed debate, it ought to be passed with considerable satisfaction by the House.  I do not propose to go into any details, except in certain respects, where I would like to have it <Col N="1071" /> made clear the kind of amendments one might put down in the Committee Stage.  Before coming to these details I would like to say that I have a certain amount of sympathy with Senator Johnson in regard to the point he made about its being difficult for a layman to understand the Bill.  That is a sympathy, however, that I would feel in regard to almost every Bill of the kind.  The difference here is that a great many of the new regulations will affect the ordinary man in the street, and he will have to carry them out.  It occurs to me to ask whether there is any power, inherent in the Minister or his Department, to issue some kind of general handbook in connection with this legislation.  If some kind of summary could be issued and sold at a few pence it would, in my opinion, save the police a considerable amount of money in getting the Act enforced.  I do not think it would be possible, simply by changing a few words, to get people immediately to understand the effect of the changes on the law, but if someone in the Department could prepare a handbook and set out the detailed changes which are made, they would be easily understood, whereas otherwise it will take years for people to understand them.  If there is no such power I would like to see included in the Bill a clause giving power to the Minister and his Department to issue such a handbook in the future.  I do not think an obligation to attend in person is of any value.  The fact that a clerk sees a person who signs, and is competent to give information, is not proof of his qualification to drive. It is provided that any person who signed the declaration that he has no disqualification is entitled to a licence unless there is proof to the contrary. I think you would also cause considerable delay in insisting on a personal application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator forgets that you are giving powers to refuse a licence to persons who appear to be under a certain age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that there are no flaws in the Bill.  But with regard to age, if you say you are <Col N="1072" /> 21 years and upwards it is accepted without giving the exact age.  Now there are points that I wish to refer to dealing with the question of insurance.  Am I correct in reading that compulsory insurance&mdash;third party insurance&mdash;is only insurance against accidents caused by negligence? That is my reading of the Bill, and if that is so it means that, as far as the public are concerned, they are only half protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I think in practice it will be found that where there is an accident the insurance company will pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement by an experienced man like Senator Dowdall rather emphasises my point.  Because the only reason why it should be confined to negligence would be if the insurance companies charged a considerably higher premium, but in view of the statement of the Senator I assume that is not the case.  What is in my mind is that some of the worst accidents are accidents caused by skids.  Some of these may be due to negligence, others not.  Again, in many accidents there is a nice point whether there is any negligence.  I have driven a car for many years and have been fortunate in that there was never a claim against me for third party damages.  But I know a number of other people, against some of whom there have been such claims.  One case came to my knowledge where a person said if he admitted negligence a claim could be made.  He did not believe there was negligence and asked would he run into danger of the court if he admitted negligence in order to help the claim to be made.  I want to suggest that if it were possible to make it clear that in a bona fide accident, which was not caused by negligence, the driver would be covered for third party risks it would be a good thing.  If that could be done it would add much to the value of the Bill in the eyes of the public.  The Minister will understand the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another small point dealing with insurance is the question of licensing the driver.  I find the insurance I hold provides that my car may be <Col N="1073" /> driven by any licensed driver.  It also gives me protection for third party while I, as owner of the policy, am driving another car.  But as regards licensed drivers, one may as well openly confess one's sins.  I have found two or three days have elapsed sometimes after the expiry of my licence before I renewed it.  As no reminder is sent that does often happen to drivers.  I think in most cases insurance companies would not make a great deal of that point, but I think third-party-cover should cover any driver once licensed.  I think it right, of course, that the companies should take precautions and should be able to withdraw the insurance if they thought fit.  I do not want any flaw, due to the fact that a particular driver may, for a fortnight, less or more, inadvertently neglect to renew his licence.  I shall bring that up on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I would like, also, to ask in regard to compulsory insurance whether any provision is made to deal with the motor garages.  That is what I had in mind when I spoke of the possible amendments on Committee Stage. Reading the Bill I do not know whether motor garages are insured or not.  It is well known that motor garages can obtain, a general insurance, and that that general insurance covers all their employees when driving any car.  That is exceedingly important. Cars come in for repairs, sometimes they are insured, but sometimes their insurance is allowed to lapse because the owner does not need the car until it is fit again for the road.  The car is in the garage and is repaired and taken out on the road to see if it is fit.  The driver may be asked to produce the certificate of insurance in regard to a particular car.  The garage mechanic will not be able to do that, and the fact that there is a provision of insurance for that garage covering third-party for any car should be sufficient. Again, there is provision in the Act that no licence is to be issued after a certain date unless the licensing authority produces a certificate of insurance with regard to that car. <Col N="1074" /> That may lead to difficulties.  In many cases the insurance is not attached to the car but to the driver as in the case of a garage.  I take out an insurance policy on my own car, but I have a right to take out another car.  And there is no reason why I should not be properly covered for third-party insurance without an insurance for the particular car.</P>
    <P>There are also the licences issued to garages called &ldquo;Trade Plates&rdquo; and they cover any car.  In that type of licence you could not produce the actual certificate referred to in the Bill. I think that some provision should be made that any firm that obtains Trade Plates should produce a certificate to the effect that the firm is covered for all its employees.  That would get over the difficulty and add to safety from the point of view of the public. That is all that has struck me so far. I repeat what I said that the Bill is an exceedingly good one and will do much for the safety of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The short speeches made in the course of this discussion have indicated quite clearly to me that the Senators who have spoken have studied this measure, because they have all hit upon the very points which I think are of the greatest consequence.  Senator Dowdall made a particularly remarkable statement. He said wherever there is an accident the insurance company will pay.  He, I presume, has some connection with an insurance company, but of this I am certain that in making their calculations as to the amount they will charge they make them on the basis that they are to pay in the case of other accidents.  If the Minister could possibly secure that under the provisions of this Schedule they should be legally obliged to make a case, such as I have mentioned, I think it would greatly improve the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two points of great importance are Section 56, which provides for insurance and Section 168 dealing with the extension of personal liability for negligent driving.  Senator Douglas is quite right in saying that under the provisions of this Bill there is no liability except in the case of negligent driving, so far as insurance is concerned. <Col N="1075" /> That is provided for in Section 56, sub-section (1), paragraph (a).  I suppose the Minister is confining, and must confine himself, within the definition which has been laid down of negligence.  It is a great pity that he is not able to afford protection in cases where negligence cannot be proved.  That law of negligence in relation to accidents on the highway is in a most unsatisfactory condition.  The plaintiff or person injured has to allege negligence and, in the defence which is put in, there is usually a defence of contributory negligence.  One would imagine that the issue raised in a case like that would be very simple and very easily resolved.  It was so at one time.  The old judges put the question: &ldquo;Was the defendant guilty of negligence?&rdquo; and the further question: &ldquo;Was the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence?&rdquo; and, then, they put the determining question: &ldquo;Who was most to blame?&rdquo;  There was a lot of commonsense in that question.  It was the question that used to be put in my junior days at the Bar, but judges in England and elsewhere and the House of Lords, who considered their intellects more refined, have elaborated that in such a way that it is impossible now for a juryman to understand the meaning of the questions put to him, because this is the question now: &ldquo;Assuming that the defendant was guilty of negligence and that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, could the defendant, by the exercise of reasonable care, have avoided the consequences of the plaintiff's negligence?&rdquo;  That is one of the simpler questions that are put, so that this matter of negligence and contributory negligence in regard to road accidents is in a most unsatisfactory position.  I am sure that was brought to the notice of the Minister and, if, by this measure, he could cut the Gordian knot and resolve that question into its simple elements, he would be doing a great public service.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which I wish to call attention.  In the case of a road accident in which a person is killed the widow claims compensation. <Col N="1076" /> How is she to prove negligence?  The person who could prove negligence is dead and the person who survives, who may be the negligent person and, in nine cases out of ten, probably is the negligent person, will say: &ldquo;No, it was the fault of the poor man who is dead.&rdquo;  That is a blot, not on this Bill, but in the law as it stands, and the Minister, when introducing a section dealing with the extension of personal liability for negligent driving, ought, if he possibly could, grapple with the entire question.  If there is an accident involving a death, perhaps the best thing to do would be to say that there should be compensation for the widow of the dead person, but it might be better to recast all this law in relation to compensation where there is a road accident and put it on some other basis than the basis of negligence, which has not received a highly technical meaning as a result of the various decisions and contentions. That is a matter which might be brought up on Committee Stage.  No doubt the Minister has already considered it, but it is of such grave importance and requires so much consideration that I think the Second Reading Stage is the proper stage on which to bring it forward with a view to seeing whether some plan could not be devised to do substantial justice, particularly in the case in which the person who would be a witness of the negligence is dead and his widow and children are the sufferers.  I am pressing this point, because Senator Dowdall said that in the matter of this third-party insurance a charge for the insurance would be made on the basis that there will be compensation in the case of every accident.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in regard to Section 169 I should like to refer to. The section is very good in regard to the duty of drivers on the occurrence of an accident.  The most disgraceful thing in connection with these road accidents is that the person who injures a man, not knowing whether he has killed him or not, drives away either in a panic or from heartlessness. There are numerous accidents in which the person who does the injury drives away, and this section imposes considerable <Col N="1077" /> penalties on the person who acts in that way.  I would suggest another penalty.  I would suggest that a presumption of negligence should be drawn, as a matter of law, against a person who drives away, or that something should be done in the way of raising a presumption of negligence against him either at the suit of the wife or the person injured. That is a suggestion that will require great consideration.  I am bringing these points forward only as suggestions.  I know the great difficulty of legislating on these matters, but I can assure the Minister that the difficulty is nothing compared with the necessity for such legislation, and I hope the Minister, now that he is bringing forward a comprehensive, splendid and well-thought-out measure, will take the bull by the horns and grapple with this greatest difficulty in connection with road traffic.</P>
    <P>Some matters have been raised by Senator Johnson which are deserving of very serious consideration.  I do not agree with him when he says that &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo; would be a better phrase to use in this measure than &ldquo;mechanically propelled vehicle.&rdquo; Lawyers like to be accurate, and clients and the public generally are the persons responsible for making lawyers desire to be so accurate, because a lawyer would not split words if his client did not insist upon it. &ldquo;Mechanically propelled vehicles&rdquo; is the proper term to use.  The phrase &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo; would be altogether misleading, seeing that there are so many descriptions of mechanism besides the internal combustion engines which are used for the propulsion of vehicles and, therefore, on that point, I would rather agree with the draftsman.</P>
    <P>There was a point made by Senator Johnson which, I think, was very wise, in connection with persons who are drunk when driving motor cars.  The old law in regard to this matter was that if a person was drunk in charge of a horse and car he was liable.  That was very simple, and I think that really it applies in the case of motor drivers as much as in the case of drivers of horse drawn vehicles.  Of course there is the distinction <Col N="1078" /> that a motor cannot move unless the levers are altered, but I do not think that is reason enough for making an alternation in the law, particularly when a person may have a motor car stationary at a dangerous point in the road.  Therefore I think that unless it is already provided for the suggestion of Senator Johnson, which will no doubt be considered, ought to be accepted.  These are all the matters that occurred to me in regard to the Bill, because I must say that the Bill seems to be remarkably well balanced, and to represent a great amount of labour and thought and to be very sensibly constructed, but these are matters which I think ought to be considered with a view to improving the Bill.  They are the most difficult matters and the most urgent matters in connection with road traffic.  They are also of the greatest importance, and now that the Minister is bringing forward this measure&mdash;and he will receive, as I can see from the speeches made, every assistance in this House&mdash; I hope that he will be able to grapple with that question of loss arising from road accidents in a more comprehensive way than by basing it on the old criterion of negligent driving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to be a very complete Bill and, to me, at all events, it would appear to have covered, with the necessary detail, practically the whole of the points involved in this traffic code.  There is one exception, however.  There is one provision absent from the Bill which I think should be in it with regard to the placing of responsibility on pedestrians.  Anybody who drives a car, or who observes things at all, will agree that there is a very considerable proportion of what are known as jaywalkers amongst the general community. Unless a person exercises the most extreme care he cannot drive a car any day through Dublin without knocking down and probably fatally injuring quite a number of people, and that can be done without being accused of undue negligence.  A great many pedestrians seem to place the whole responsibility for their safety on the drivers of vehicles, and the serious part of that is that I have noticed reports of <Col N="1079" /> numerous accidents that have been caused by drivers trying to avoid pedestrians who, without warning, step in front of a motor car.  In trying to avoid those people he has often to swerve and, perhaps, mount the footpath and possibly kill or injure somebody else who is acting in a careful manner.</P>
      <P>Under the French code of laws, there are definite penalties for the pedestrain who walks carelessly or negligently across a thoroughfare because of the danger of causing other people to be knocked down by drivers trying to avoid him.  The British Safety First League, in issuing its periodical reports, indicates that quite a large proportion of the accidents, amongst them being hundreds of fatal accidents, are due to the carelessness of pedestrians.  In all cases, it is not the person who was careless is killed, but someone else who has been knocked down by the driver trying to avoid an accident.  This Bill puts no responsibility upon the pedestrian. It is all placed upon the drivers of motor vehicles and cyclists.  I think there should be some sharing of the responsibility in that respect.  In Section 15 the Minister has power to make numerous regulations, including that dealing with the construction of vehicles and with noise.  One point that requires consideration is the size of some of these double-decked lorries and vehicles of that kind for carrying sheep, pigs and live stock, especially on narrow roads.  They are really a great source of danger.  Cars coming behind and wanting to pass are unable to do so.  Going round corners and places of that kind it is necessary to drive blind to try to pass them.  Some of these vehicles should not be allowed on roads that are not wide.  At present they seem to be allowed on all kinds of roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and then there are tractors drawing other vehicles, all creating risks of a very definite character. In regard to noise I certainly think that regulations of a more severe character should be imposed in connection <Col N="1080" /> with motor bicycles.  These machines are one of the horrors of modern transport, and are a terrible test for nervous people and for invalids. Drivers of motor bicycles seem to think that the more noise they make the greater are their machines.  A regulation should be enforced for the insertion of some effective silencer on these machines.  When there are four or five of them dashing along the roads they are an absolute torture to the nerves. It might also be noticed that a very large proportion of accidents are caused by motor bicycles.  A young fellow who has a girl sitting on the pillion seat behind him seems to lose all sense of discretion.  He simply goes mad and that accounts for a tremendous number of fatal accidents.</P>
      <P>In regard to dangerous driving I notice that one aspect does not seem to have been taken seriously, and that is the speed at which buses meet other cars on narrow roads.  The private driver has always to slow down and to pull in close to the footpath.  I have never yet met a bus which slowed down when passing a car.  Buses go along at full speed causing a tremendous draught owing to the size of the vehicles.  It is left to private drivers to exercise care.  I would characterise as dangerous driving, the failure of a driver to slow down when meeting other traffic on narrow roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas, Senator Comyn and others raised points about insurance. That is a very important question, especially where people are killed without there being any negligence on the part of drivers.  I think owners and drivers of public service vehicles should be insured against genuine accidents because there are genuine accidents in which lives are lost.  It is a terrible consideration to think that the bread-winner of a family might be killed by a motor vehicle in a genuine accident and that his dependents had no redress.  I welcome particularly Section 54 in which it is proposed to punish the owners of vehicles who make out a time table which, in order to be worked to, involves breaking the speed limit.  There are scores of cases in which drivers were summoned for exceeding the speed limit <Col N="1081" /> although it was proved that in order to carry out the instructions of their employers, and to work to a certain time table, they had to exceed the speed limit or lose their jobs.  The Bill remedies that by making the person who issues the time table responsible.</P>
    <P>Another valuable provision is contained in Section 166 which puts a limit upon the hours in any one day during which a driver may be employed on a public service vehicle.  Of course, the time is very long, and it may be 11 hours all-over, but, not for more than 5½ hours continuous driving.  A valuable portion of sub-section (4) penalises a driver who drives longer than 5½ hours, because it will deal with the owner-driver of a public service vehicle who drives for whatever hours he feels inclined or for whatever pay.  After a certain period he must of necessity be a menace to other people using the highways, because such drivers get tired and sometimes sleepy.  To that extent, the Bill tightens up the law, although a provision of this kind which has been in operation in Great Britain for some time under the Traffic Bill of 1930 has been evaded wholesale.  There has been a certain amount of collusion between drivers and employers for monetary considerations with a view to evading this portion of the law.  Complaints have been received wholesale, so that I trust the Gárda will, for a time, at all events, see that this section of the Bill is administered effectively. If it were only closely enforced for a year or 18 months employers and employees would gradually work to it.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been a long time overdue. It was the subject of a Commission that sat for a couple of years and it has been dealt with in two Parliaments. It brings our laws, which are about 30 years behind the times, up-to-date. The one justification for the delay was the completeness with which the Bill covers the whole subject.  I entirely agree with the suggestion that someone might be employed to prepare a simple handbook explaining the main points.  It would be bought eagerly by everyone interested in transport, whether drivers or owners of cars and by large numbers of people.  The Department, I am sure, by the sales, <Col N="1082" /> would be able to defray the cost of the preparation of such a book if a reasonable figure&mdash;say about 6d.&mdash;was charged that would cover the cost.  It seems to me to be necessary, because this is a fairly complicated code of law covering a very wide field of activity now, and it is necessary that drivers and owners of vehicles, as well as a big section of the general public, should have a fairly general knowledge of what the law is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRobinson" hpid="Mr. S. Robinson Mr. S. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in the suggestion that there should be a handbook published if any official with the necessary knowledge could be got to prepare it.  I think it would be worth while to have it.  A handbook such as has been suggested would require to be accurate and to contain the full details.  I do not see how it could be done except purely by a compilation of police traffic regulations. When the Minister is replying I would like him to consider the advisability of allowing civilians to apply for the two positions of inspectors of bodies and of the mechanical parts of motor cars.  A policeman is most unlikely to have the knowledge of civilians in that respect, because it would require a great many years' experience to be able to detect mechanical and body troubles in motor vehicles.  In cities like Belfast and Cork I understand that civilians are at present doing that duty.  I would not like to see civilians definitely barred if they were better fitted for the work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Many things affecting live stock have been referred to here in connection with traffic regulations for motor vehicles.  At present, there are no standard arrangements dealing with the construction of these motor vehicles for carrying cattle or live stock.  There is a great necessity for some regulations dealing with loading banks, so that there would not be cruelty in the loading or unloading of live stock.  That work is often accompanied by cruelty when stock are being put into these lorries and also at the cattle market where there is no provision for discharging them.  At 6 or 7 o'clock in the mornings accommodation is hardly available for unloading cattle from these lorries at the market. <Col N="1083" /> When passing cattle, sheep and pigs on public roads I think it should be compulsory that motor vehicles should pull up.  It is not a question of going easy. It is impossible for a motor vehicle to pass through cattle without the risk of danger.  It was only last week I had a bullock in a bunch of ten killed because the motor car was not pulled up.  People driving motor cars or lorries should pull up or go very slowly in order to avoid injury to animals.  The Minister has given a great deal of consideration to the pros and cons of the traffic problem.</P>
      <P>I think the Bill would be all the more successful if the points I have referred to were dealt with by such legislation. I have strong opinions regarding pillion riding on motor bicycles.  Pillion riding should be abolished.  Many of the accidents that we read of in which young people are killed are caused by pillion riding.  Reference has been made to the noise caused by motor bicycles.  It may be satisfactory to the riders of these machines but it is the reverse for people who have to put up with it. Another matter to which attention might be paid is in reference to the use of motor horns.  It would be a good thing if there could be one kind of motor horn for all vehicles so that we would not have the variety that we have at present.  Some of these motor horns make people frightened.  If there could be a standard motor horn, something like the whistle on a railway engine, so that people would know what was coming when they heard it, it would be an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps if motor manufacturers were approached there could be produced, without any great hardship, a horn of uniform size for different classes of vehicles, the horns to be such that they would indicate the type of cars they belonged to.  I strongly suggest to the Minister that it should be compulsory on the owners of all cars to carry rere lights, so that a driver could give an indication when he proposes pulling up suddenly.  Because of failure to give an indication of that kind I have seen very bad accidents occur when, for instance, a car coming from behind ran into one in front.  Accidents <Col N="1084" /> of that kind could be avoided if drivers carried a rere light, and gave an indication when they proposed to pull up.  I hope the Minister will give attention to the points I have mentioned. My suggestions have been put forward in a helpful spirit.  I believe the Minister, in putting through this important legislation, will have the assistance of all classes of the public, and particularly the members of the cattle trade, in which I am specially interested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a word on behalf of a class, rather a numerous class, that seems to be forgotten altogether&mdash;those who ride and drive horses on the roads.  They get very little consideration from motorists. The motorist, when he meets a man with a horse on the road, seems to think that he owns the road, and that the man and horse ought to get out of his way.  I am one of those who still ride and drive horses a great deal on the roads.  I can say that on many an occasion I have escaped from motorists when riding or driving a horse with, as they say, &ldquo;the skin of my teeth.&rdquo; In my opinion a motorist ought to be compelled to stop at once when he gets a signal from a person riding or driving a horse, especially when coming near towns.  In many places it is highly dangerous to bring a young horse out on the road at all.  The tendency for motorists, evidently, is to think that the horse has no right to be there at all.  The usual signal for a person with a horse on the road to give is to put up his hand.  In nine cases out of ten that signal is disregarded, and the motorist rushes by.  He rarely looks behind to see whether the rider of the horse has been killed or not.  Occurrences of that kind have often made me wish that such people would be in a hotter clime before they reached the end of their journey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has to be remembered that a great many people still ride and drive horses, and especially farmers, whom I represent here.  They contribute a good deal to the upkeep of the roads.  They have as good a right to be on the roads as any motorist.  I would like to see a provision inserted in the Bill for the imposition of severe penalties on <Col N="1085" /> persons who disregard a signal from a person with a restive horse on the road. In this connection I would like to say that motor bicycles are a terrible danger.  Even old horses, accustomed to almost all kinds of traffic&mdash;to passing traction engines and motor cars., etc.&mdash; become terrified and restive at the noise of motor bicycles.  I hope the Minister will give attention to the points I have mentioned.  I speak on behalf of a large number of people who either from choice or because they cannot afford to have a motor car, still ride and drive horses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>In listening to Senator O'Connor, I could not help thinking that I never came across a person who ever sounded a horn loud enough to satisfy me.  I think a loud horn is a very useful thing in helping to clear a road.  I put it to Senator O'Farrell that the old view the law took of a motor car was that whoever drove it or brought it on to the road was in charge of a very deadly machine.  In the old days, I believe&mdash;I am sorry that Senator Comyn is not here to bear me out in this&mdash;the person in charge of such a machine was expected to take extraordinarily good care.  If an accident happened the onus was put on him to show that he had taken every precaution.  But of course, as we all know, &ldquo;the law is a hass.&rdquo;  In my opinion the best illustration of that is to be found in the law with regard to motors.  If a man steals your money with the intention of putting it back, such an explanation as that will not satisfy a court of law, but a man may take your motor car, drive it around and wreck it, and he is not regarded as a robber or a thief.  He is merely regarded as a joy rider.  Members of the House know that an enormous number of accidents have taken place as a result of this practice of joyriding, and still no discredit attaches to people who have stolen cars that have caused accidents.  The law regards them very differently from other types of thieves.  I would suggest to the Minister that, when overhauling the laws dealing with motorists, he would make the taking of a motor car by irresponsible people a criminal offence, <Col N="1086" /> just as the stealing of money out of a till is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister, in making regulations, will go cautiously along the lines suggested by Senator O'Connor.  A very great hardship would be imposed on people if, suddenly, all kinds of new mechanical devices such as automatic lighting, dipping headlights and so on, had to be attached to motor cars.  No doubt these are all desirable things.  The makers of new cars are fully alive to their importance, but I think it would be a great hardship if all these expensive devices had to be attached to all cars.  A great number of people for years to come cannot afford to drive anything but an old car.  All these devices and recommendations are really the outcome of the desire to make the road safer for the dangerous driver. Of course, the real protection and safety is in careful driving, but nowadays the tendency is to make the road safe for the speedy driver.  We see all over the country where, with that object in view, corners are widened. While all that is very desirable it should not operate so as to relax ordinary care in driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I would like to refer to.  In the case of accidents insurance companies always ask: &ldquo;Did you sound your horn?&rdquo;  If a person did not sound his horn the assumption always is that he is in the wrong.  That is why there is so much horn sounding going on.  The Minister has been to America, and he knows that there is extraordinarily little horn sounding in that country.  There is no horn sounding going around corners except you overtake a car.  The reason for that is that everybody is supposed to be on the right side of the road, and therefore there is no need to sound the horn.  Another reason why there is so little horn sounding in America is that when driving from a by-road on to the main road the driver has to stop dead before entering a main road.  Therefore, there is no reason for people driving on the main road to be continually sounding the horn.  I hope the Minister in making his regulations will consider these points.  Their adoption, I think, would <Col N="1087" /> make for greater safety and much less noise.  I would like to know from the Minister if some means could not be devised so that people could take out a five-year licence.  It is a great nuisance having to take out a fresh licence every year.  Sometimes one forgets all about it.  If five-year licences were issued I think it would save a lot of trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that in the course of their remarks Senator O'Connor and Senator Miss Browne were a little bit too hard on motorists. Their remarks might, perhaps, apply to the drivers of buses and lorries but certainly not to the motor-owner-driver. I think it will be admitted by most people who use the roads that this latter class are most courteous and considerate.  There are certainly some people who, as Senator Miss Browne said, think nothing should be on the road but themselves.  Such people are in the minority.  Senator O'Farrell's remarks with regard to &ldquo;safety first&rdquo; struck me as being very wise.  I suggest to the Minister that in consultation with the Minister for Education, he might consider issuing instructions to school teachers to have &ldquo;safety first&rdquo; lectures delivered to the children once a week or once a month.  I think if such an instruction were given it might have the effect of saving very many valuable lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Section 46 of the Bill which deals with speed limits, it strikes me that the regulation for trapping motorists is a great nuisance and hardship to many people. They are pulled up and put to considerable expense and trouble in defending the charges made against them.  Could not the matter be more effectively dealt with by having the engines of all cars &ldquo;governed&rdquo; down to the speed limit desired.  I remember I had a little car when the times were more prosperous than they are now&mdash;that was before the economic war started&mdash;and it was &ldquo;governed&rdquo; down to 25 miles an hour.  I think if my suggestion were adopted it would save the public a great deal of annoyance and would obviate the <Col N="1088" /> necessity for these police traps.  With regard to Section 161 which deals with the carrying of lights in connection with live-stock travelling on the roads the Minister's statement on that satisfies the objection I had to the section&mdash;that the lights need only be carried by the drivers after the live stock.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to the members of the Seanad who have spoken on this Bill.  The number of suggestions of a useful kind that have been made is quite large.  I, as well as the officials of my Department who have had the duty cast upon them of drafting this measure, will be very happy indeed to go very carefully between now and the Committee Stage into the suggestions made.  We will be quite happy to try and put into form for the Seanad any suggestions that we think would be an improvement on the Bill and that would meet with the views put forward by the Senators who have offered them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson, I think, suggested a handbook.  It is usual with lawyers who are interested in a specific subject, when a piece of legislation of this kind and of so comprehensive a character as this, is issued in this country, as in other countries, to take upon themselves voluntarily the task of compiling and issuing a handbook of the nature suggested.  I firmly believe that before this Bill becomes an Act such a handbook will be produced. Already, perhaps, more than one rising barrister has such a handbook in mind, and I am strongly of opinion that there will be competition among young lawyers who wish to make a name for themselves as being experts on this subject and in the compilation of handbooks.  I do not know whether that would be exactly the type of handbook that Senator Johnson had in mind.  Probably he had something more simple in mind, something that would not use the phraseology that one usually finds in Acts of Parliament and in handbooks issued by lawyers largely for the use <Col N="1089" /> of lawyers.  However, it is quite possible that something of the kind might be done even by our own Department, and I will see if it is possible.  I know, of course, that there would be in the Department people quite competent to do it, but I do not know what the Department of Finance or the Comptroller and Auditor-General might think about it. I cannot say what their viewpoint might be on the subject.  These are things we will have to bear in mind, but if it is possible to get the time and permission to do it, it is a matter that will certainly have our attention.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson also called attention to Section 30, which deals with the question of a person driving a car while drunk.  We have deliberately left out of this Bill the matter of making it a criminal offence to be in charge of a motor car while drunk. That was deliberately left out.  It is open, of course, to any member of the Seanad to introduce an amendment and to have the matter raised here again.  Perhaps it would be a good thing to hear what the judgement of the Seanad would be on that subject, but certainly in the view of the different people who have dealt with this Bill since it was first introduced, it has been decided to change the law as it exists, and to make it an offence to drive or attempt to drive a car while being drunk.  As Senator Johnson said, a person sitting in a car might realise that he was too drunk to drive.  Our belief is that, so long as he does not attempt to move that car or to put it in motion, he should not be under any liability beyond whatever liability he may be under for being drunk.  We think we have made the section dealing with the offence of driving a car while drunk very tight and, in the Dáil certainly, the penalties for that offence were made very severe, much more severe now than when the Bill was first introduced.  Furthermore, we believe that the very severity of the penalties for that offence will render the number of cases in the future of persons driving while drunk very much fewer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> There was a good deal of discussion by several members of the Seanad on the question of negligent driving. That is a very difficult subject indeed, and it has received considerable attention since the Bill was first introduced. It has been discussed over and over again in the offices which have charge of administering the Act, in the draftsman's office, and with the various parties concerned, the police and insurance companies.  I think that the wisdom of all the parties that have been consulted on the matter is embodied in the Bill.  It was decided that, at any rate, so far as we have been able to gather the opinions and the wisdom of all parties, we could not go further.  On the question of the insurance that would be necessary, the insurance companies would not know what they were asked to insure against if one did not make some restriction. One would not know the premiums to be charged, and they might be very exorbitant and out of all proportion. We could not get any definite promise from any of the representatives of the associated insurance companies&mdash; both Irish companies and the representatives of English companies here, that were consulted&mdash;we could not get anything from them that would enable us to come to a more definite conclusion as to how we should define this question of negligence in driving or insure against anything that would not be as definite as what is conveyed by &ldquo;negligent driving,&rdquo; and that is not always very definite or easy to define.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas, I think, raised the point about persons driving a car while not actually licensed.  He said, I think, that he himself had driven a car for a day or two without getting a licence.  That, I think, is a fairly common occurrence, and we have provided for that in the Bill.  We have got assurances from the insurance company that where a person omits to get his licence for a few days it will not be held against him in the documents that govern insurance.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas also raised the question of the general insurance certificate covering a motor garage and the number of cars there might be in that garage at different times.  That is covered by sub-section (1) of Section <Col N="1091" /> 67.  I think that the Senator will find that his point is covered by that sub-section.  The other point which the Senator raised, about the trade plate, is covered also by that sub-section, I think.  I have doubts about it, however, and will look into it.  It is a point which we think it would be possible to cover.</P>
    <P>Senator Comyn spoke about the extension of liability for negligent driving.  I think that what I have already said on that covers the Senator's point.  Undoubtedly, there is a grievance in the case of a person who is killed and whose relatives would be in the position of not being able to prove negligence.  As far as I have taken any interest in this matter, my experience&mdash;and I think it is the general experience&mdash;is that where there is a doubt in cases of that kind and the case goes to a jury, the jury usually gives a decision on the side of negligence. That is to say, where negligence is averred in the court by a person seeking damages, the jury usually takes a very sympathetic view.  How to cover that point further than we have done, however, we have not been able to discover.  Perhaps the wisdom of the members of the Seanad may be able to suggest some means for covering that in a wider way and bringing in cases such as those suggested by Senator Comyn.  Any suggestions that are brought in on that point we shall be happy to consider.  I do not know if we can get any section that would cover the case of the person who decamps after an accident.  I think that kind of a person ought to be penalised.  I think that such persons, whether they decamp, as Senator Comyn said, because of panic or from some other less honourable motive, should be subject to extra penalties. That is a matter to which we will give consideration.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell raised the question of the responsibility of pedestrians to look after their own safety. I think the Senator will find provision for that in Section 144.  Sub-section (k) of that section gives power to make regulations governing and controlling the conduct of pedestrians on roadways <Col N="1092" /> and in particular the crossing of roadways by pedestrians.  Power is given under that sub-section to the Commissioner to make whatever regulations he thinks necessary.  Very wide powers are given both to the Commissioner and to the Minister for making regulations in this Bill and the Seanad will be as pleased as, I think, the majority in the Dáil were, to know that practically all of these regulations will have to be laid before the Oireachtas before they come into operation.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell also dealt with the question of the construction of mechanically propelled vehicles.  That is covered, I think, by Section 15.  I think that the Senator will find that all that he wished to have done has been covered in that section.  If not, or if any other member of the Seanad has any suggestion to make on the matter, we will be happy to consider it.  The question of noises is also covered, I think, by that section.</P>
    <P>It is proper, as Senator O'Farrell remarked, with regard to the matter dealt with in Section 54 of making the proprietor or owner liable for the person in his employment exceeding the speed limit, that the liability should be on the person who orders that person to commit that offence. That was a section very properly introduced into this Bill.  With regard to Section 156, that very wide and comprehensive section to which Senator O'Farrell also referred, it is as well to state at this stage that there was very considerable discussion in the Dáil on the question of making the owners of private cars liable under that section as to the hours of working. The result has been, owing to the pressure in the Dáil and to reconsideration given by ourselves, that we intend to introduce an amendment in the Seanad here, with the permission of the Seanad, to exclude private and State cars from that section.</P>

Senator Seamus Robinson <Col N="1093" /> made a point with regard to Sections 87 and 94&mdash;I do not know whether he mentioned the sections or not&mdash;that civilians should be employed for the inspection of cars.  I know that as a result of amendments put into the Bill we have made it possible for experts to be employed, civilian or others, for the examination of every portion of public service vehicles.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Connor suggested loading banks for cattle carried in lorries for transport.  I doubt very much if it would be possible for us, within the ambit of this Bill, to make loading banks compulsory.  One can imagine the number that would be necessary all over the country.  I do not think it would be possible to bring such a provision into the Bill.  It would be ruled out on the ground that it would be outside the scope of a Bill dealing with road traffic.  The question would also arise as to who was to pay and where the funds were to come from.  That would be a big subject, and would lead to a great difficulty as between the local authorities and the Exchequer as to who was to be responsible for the money necessary to provide them.  It is hardly within the scope of this Bill.</P>

I am quite in sympathy with the points made by Senator Miss Browne with regard to horses and I am afraid the matter has not got such attention as it deserves. I shall see if something cannot be included in the Bill to cover the point raised in regard to persons riding horses on the roads.  &ldquo;Joy-riding&rdquo; has been covered, and has been made an offence under Section 60.  Senator Counihan dealt with the education of school children on the question of traffic.  I think his suggestion is a wise one, and it has already been attended to to some extent.  There have been consultations between officials of my Department and the Education Department and we made some progress in inducing the Education Department to bring to the notice of the children one <Col N="1094" /> question of road traffic at the present day.  We have not gone to the extent that Senator Counihan would wish us but we have gone some way.</P>

Rural districts would not be covered where play-grounds were not required.  Senator Counihan suggested the provision of &ldquo;governors&rdquo; on motor vehicles.  That has been gone into, and we have been advised that governors on motor cars are not trustworthy and have proved more of a danger than a safety.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that because there is little that happens that Senator Counihan does not ascribe to the economic war.  Again I think it was Senator Counihan mentioned the provision of lights when driving cattle. There was at first some provision in the Bill making it obligatory for drivers of cattle to carry lights.  After a little discussion in the Dáil this was dropped; perhaps some members of the Seanad might like the matter revived again.  The motorists want the drovers of cattle to carry lights, but the owners of cattle object.  There was such a provision, as I indicated, in the Bill when originally introduced but after long consideration and discussion in the Dáil it was decided to drop it.</P>
      <P>I regard myself in the capacity more of a stepfather to this Bill than any other.  It was originally introduced by my predecessor.  Of course it has since been changed and, naturally, considerably improved since we took it over.  I think it is a good Bill and I have no doubt, as a result of discussions here, and of suggestions made, and amendments moved, it will be still further improved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad approves of the Trade Agreement between the Irish Free State and the Union of South Africa signed at Ottawa on the 20th day of August, 1932, the text of which is contained in the Report of the Imperial Economic Conference held at Ottawa, 1932 (Supplementary Volume), laid on the Table of the Seanad on the 30th day of November, 1932, and recommends the Executive Council to take the necessary steps to ratify the said Agreement.</P>
      <P>An Agreement has been made between the Irish Free State and the Union of South Africa involving some customs arrangements, and I ask the sanction of the Seanad now for that Agreement, as I think it is necessary.  The matter is very simple and will not require much discussion.  The facts in connection with it are as follows:&mdash;The two Governments concerned in this Treaty agree to allow to each other tariff preferences specified in the Schedule to the Agreement.  The Union of South Africa agrees to give the following preferences:&mdash;Hosiery of all sorts five per cent.; tractors and parts, ten per cent.; stout, 6d. per Imperial gallon. The Irish Free State on the other hand agrees to give the following preferences:&mdash;Currants, one sixth of the full rate; raisins and other dried fruits, one sixth of the full rate; canned fruit, one sixth of the full rate; wine not exceeding 30 per cent. of proof spirit, 40 per cent. of the full rate; wine exceeding 30 per cent., but not exceeding 42 per cent. proof spirit, 33? of the full rate.  In addition to that there are certain other allowances:&mdash;Sparkling wine, in bottle, 30 per cent. of full rate; still wine, in bottle, 50 per cent. of full rate; maize meal, 100 per cent. of full rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I conclude that means no charge at all, but, however, the Minister will explain that.  Preferences granted under the Treaty by the Irish Free State to South African goods involve no change in existing tariff arrangements except in the case of maize meal. There is, at present, on maize meal a <Col N="1096" /> full duty of 9/- and a preference of 6/- per cwt.  This duty is imposed under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act.  Under the Cereals Bill, when it becomes law, the importation of maize meal will be prohibited except under licence.  When that legislation comes into force it is understood to be the intention of the Department of Agriculture that the Emergency Imposition of Duties Order, imposing a duty on maize meal, will be revoked, and that reliance will be placed, so far as maize meal is concerned, on the prohibition contained in the Cereals Bill.  Arrangements will, presumably, be made by which no barrier will be placed in the way of the import of South African maize meal under licence in order to give full effect to the spirit and letter of the Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear something as to whether we are to get the same concession in regard to imports into South Africa that the British are getting.  We have been for some six months pressing this question with regard to New Zealand, where there is a 3/6 import duty on Irish whiskey which does not exist in regard to Scotch whiskey.  So far we have failed to get any satisfaction whatever in regard to that.  Apparently now, in regard to this Treaty before us, the manufacturers of whiskey are to get nothing at all.  I should like some information from the Minister as to what the duties are at present, and whether the concession that is given by South Africa to Scotch whiskey is going to be extended to Irish whiskey. I am inclined to believe that a special arrangement has been made by the British with South Africa by which Scotch whiskey is allowed in under special conditions, and I would like some information on that point.  I know one positive case where we are <Col N="1097" /> disqualified, and I know of no particular agreement made by our Government except with Canada, where we are allowed the same terms as the British.  I want to know what has been done here in safeguarding our interests in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Much on the same lines I would ask the Minister how we stand with regard to the other Dominions in regard to the articles mentioned here. I think on the last occasion he told us that at Ottawa there were no fully accredited delegates of the other Dominions and that, while efforts were made to reach agreement, and while he hoped agreement would be reached, they had to be referred direct to the respective Governments.  I do not want him to make a statement if it is not opportune to make it, and I do not want to press him to do so, but I know that whiskey is not the only thing we export.  There are other trades that are affected in the case of New Zealand in which we are definitely interested.  I should also like to know the reasons why the procedure in the case of South Africa, which one would have hoped would have been very definitely friendly to us, was different from that which we made with Canada.  The Canadian Treaty was extremely simple, and, while it did not give us anything that our neighbours across the water do not get, it did protect us definitely against Canadian favouritism towards British produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, most of our exports here are really competing with Great Britain.  There is comparatively little competition with any other country, and, therefore, taking it all round, the most satisfactory thing that we can get in the way of protection for our exports at the moment is to be sure that we will get nothing which will give a preference to British goods against ours.  That was achieved in the case of Canada and was, to my mind, as satisfactory as we could possibly have expected.  It was too much to expect Canada to give us preference over Britain.  I, frankly, am disappointed that we did not get the same at least from South Africa, and it does seem that, while we have made certain concessions, and fairly good concessions, <Col N="1098" /> in spite of the fact that, according to Senator Colonel Moore, there is a definite snag in some of them, we do not seem to have got very much. The concessions we got deal mostly with things we are sending to South Africa, but there are other products which we export and which we might very well send to South Africa, if we had some preference.</P>
    <P>It does seem to me that this agreement leaves the British Government in a position to use pressure in South Africa to give special concessions to British goods, and we, not being in a position to use the same kind of pressure, will not get the benefit, whereas, in the case of Canada, any pressure that is brought to bear need not worry us, because we know that for a number of years we are protected, we must get any preference given to Great Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Parkinson remarked here once or twice that the bloodstock going into South Africa have to pay a tariff of £100 per head. I want to ask the Minister if that fact was adverted to when the arrangements were made, and if any efforts were made by him to get a preference in that respect?  A tariff of £100 on a thoroughbred horse or mare is a tremendous tax, and, as we are making a trade agreement, we ought, if possible, to remove a tariff of that sort in order to give these breeders an opportunity of extending their markets. There was, at one time, a considerable market in South Africa.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister could tell us what are the South African tariffs on the commodities in respect of which we get preference?  I notice that we get five per cent. on hosiery, ten per cent. on tractors, and so on, but, if there is a very high tariff, say 40 or 50 per cent., on these, it seems almost a negligible preference. I should like also to know&mdash;I have not the figures before me&mdash;what are the trade relationships between South Africa and the Saorstát.  What are the relative amounts of our exports to South Africa and our imports from them?  Do they favour us or otherwise? The maize meal conundrum wants some explanation.  It is extraordinarily complicated as attempted <Col N="1099" /> to be explained by Senator Colonel Moore, and I think the Minister might explain it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to give any definite figures with regard to the trade between the Saorstát and South Africa.  The figures available in our trade and shipping statistics relate only to goods which are consigned direct to us from South African ports but it is reasonable to assume, and, in fact, we know it definitely to be the case, that the bulk of the goods which come to us from South Africa come via Great Britain, just as the bulk of the goods we export to South Africa go through Great Britain.  In relation to that trade, we have no figures at all.  Various estimates have been prepared and they show that the trade, heretofore, has, generally speaking, been in favour of South Africa although in particular years that might not have been the case.  There have been considerable fluctuations in trade as between one and another particularly with regard to maize&mdash;I refer to whole maize and not maize meal.  The Treaty which it is proposed to ratify is one that was prepared in circumstances which did not permit of as full a review as might have been possible of the various matters in which the trade between the two countries could be facilitated.  Although attention was given to a number of possibilities, the time available and other difficulties prevented the inquiries being made amongst interested parties in each country as to the effect of the various alterations in duties which were proposed by one side or the other, and, consequently, it became necessary to conclude an agreement which referred only to a limited number of articles but in the expectation that the existence of that agreement would furnish us with a basis on which to build at later periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our experience has been that the Government of the Union of South Africa are very willing and anxious to extend trade relations with the Saorstát and, on another occasion, I am sure it will be possible for us to secure other arrangements which will enable trade to be improved in other articles <Col N="1100" /> between the two countries.  I may say that the definite matter of the export of horses from the Saorstát to South Africa was fully discussed, but the representatives of the Union of South Africa were not in a position to offer any tariff concession in that regard. Heretofore, the position has been that we got no preference whatever from South Africa.  As I think I explained in the Seanad before, none of the States members of the Commonwealth was willing to agree to a general preference system between all members. South Africa, particularly, heretofore, gave no preference except to Great Britain or in consequence of definite agreements entered into which secured for South Africa concessions in return for concessions given.  Following the implementation of this Treaty, we will get a tariff concession from South Africa for the first time and the practice here will also have to be changed but will be changed in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, the Saorstát has given substantial preferences on all duties to goods which were produced in Commonwealth countries irrespective of whether we got anything in return for the giving of those preferences.  Because of the situation that has developed as a result of the Ottawa Conference and the very definite indication of policy given by the different Governments represented there, it will be necessary for us to revise our attitude and to take the position that we will give concessions only where we enter into definite agreements to give them in return for definite concessions granted to us. The position regarding the three articles in respect of which a preference is given is this: the South African duty on hosiery, socks, stockings, underwear, and the like is 15 per cent., and on pullovers and jerseys 20 per cent., while the preference given is five per cent.  At the present time, there is no preferential duty applicable to tractors entering the Union of South Africa and the effect of the Treaty is to secure for us a preference of ten per cent. for the first time.  The duty on stout in South Africa is 2/3 per gallon and the effect of the Treaty is to reduce the duty on Saorstát stout to <Col N="1101" /> 1/9 per gallon.  On the other hand, the various items in which we are concerned do not necessitate any change in the tariff schedules here.  The preferences which are given have been given in the past and we merely contract to continue them for the duration of this Treaty.</P>
    <P>As regards maize meal, the position is much as described by Senator Colonel Moore.  The 100 per cent. preference can be taken to mean that no Customs barrier will be imposed to the importation of maize meal from South Africa.  Another interpretation is possible but that is the interpretation to which we can adhere.  Of course, any maize meal which is imported from South Africa will have to be sold in accordance with the law prevailing here at the time, and, in so far as that law places a certain restriction on the sale of maize meal as such, South African maize meal will be subject to this restriction the same as home-produced maize meal.  The existing duty will, of course, be repealed in the near future in consequence of the passage of the Cereals Bill, which defines the conditions under which maize meal may be imported in any event, but the Act will be administered in accordance with the spirit of this Treaty, that is, to give a very definite preference to maize meal, if any, consigned to this country from South Africa.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other points raised, I am not in a position to state what is the duty on spirits consigned from Great Britain to South Africa. The Treaty which was concluded between Great Britain and the Union of South Africa at Ottawa makes no reference to spirits and, presumably, no change in the pre-existing position has been effected since.  At the present time, we are taking up with the Government of South Africa the question of the duty which has been collected by the South African Government and which was imposed in March last as an exchange compensation tax. We are maintaining that, because the Government of South Africa has since departed from the gold standard.  The retention of that tax is no longer justifiable <Col N="1102" /> and should not, in future, apply to Irish spirits.  Discussions on that matter are in progress at the moment but what the outcome is likely to be I cannot say.  I do not know whether it would be in order to discuss the position <i>vis-á-vis</i> New Zealand or other States, but no change has taken place since I spoke here on the Canadian Treaty.  I, perhaps, did not quite appreciate, when at Ottawa, and when we agreed there to carry discussions to a certain stage and then postpone them for resumption after the conclusion of the Conference, the difficulties that arise when one tries to conduct negotiations of that order with Governments situate on opposite sides of the globe.</P>
    <P>The distance constitutes a difficulty, but there is no reason to believe that the tentative agreement which we reached, I think, in every case at Ottawa, will not be ultimately embodied in a trade agreement of the same kind as those concluded with Canada and South Africa.  In the meantime I do not anticipate that any substantial change to our detriment will take place.  The particular matter to which Senator Jameson referred concerning a differential duty against Saorstát whiskey in the Dominion of New Zealand is being examined, and certain discussions with representatives of the New Zealand Government are in progress.  Whether we will be able to secure definite concessions in that regard will, I think, depend on the value of the concessions we can give in return.  I have no doubt whatever that the concessions we are at present giving to the products of New Zealand here are of sufficient importance to them to justify an effort on their part to retain, by giving us certain concessions in return.  This Treaty with South Africa can be regarded not so much as a final document fixing trade relations between the two countries for all time, or for five years, but as a beginning of the establishment of those relations in treaty form which can be elaborated on, and which, I have no doubt, will be elaborated upon, when occasion and opportunity offer for the bringing on of new commodities subject to these terms, one way or another.</P>

      <P>I have some experience of that matter.  I happened to be in South Africa in 1922 and I found that practically all the horses there were foreign horses.  For some reason or other racehorses are not bred in South Africa.  At that time most of these horses were Irish horses.  Although I was there for a different object I was asked on my return to Ireland to buy racehorses and to send them out.  I explained that I was not a horse merchant and that the buying of racehorses was an extremely difficult job. That shows that some trade in horses should exist in South Africa.  It certainly seems extraordinary, if it is correct, that there should be a duty of £100 per head on horses, considering my experience there.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to give some explanation.</P>

      <P>I believe in trade representatives and I say they would be useful.  We know what Consuls do. The Free State Government should pick out someone on the spot to whom in cases like this people could go to find out information.  It would not cost much.  Nearly every country has Consuls here, and if we had someone in the Dominions representing us it would undoubtedly help, because local people could get in touch with the Governments of other countries and that would be of great assistance.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Department of External Affairs, for reasons of their own, have a pronounced objection to the appointment of honorary Consuls in such places, such as other Governments have. Some of these objections are obvious. It is a matter which might definitely be considered in relation to the general position concerning the representation of the Saorstát abroad.  The matter is under consideration at the moment, because our experience has been that trade follows representation to a large extent, and that the development of these markets must be preceded by the creation of representatives of some kind.  I can assure the Senator that the matter has not been overlooked.</P>

      <P>(1)  the present position of pig production in Saorstát Eireann and of the industries and trades dealing with live pigs, pig meat, whether fresh or cured, and other pig products,</P>
      <P>(2)  the measures requisite to promote the production of pigs of the quality and in numbers calculated to ensure the maintenance of output at a point which will supply, constantly, the demand of the home market and provide for the requirements of the export trade while giving a steady economic return to producers of pigs and those engaged in the handling of pig meats and other pig products,</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion deals with pigs and pig products.  The last time a census was taken of the agricultural output it showed that the pig industry was a very important one.  At that time the figures showed that pigs and pig products were valued at £9,000,000 out of a total agricultural output representing £65,000,000 for the year.  A sum of £9,000,000 formed a very considerable portion of the agricultural industry and should get serious consideration. At first sight the motion appears to be of a legal character, but on examination it will be seen that every single part of it is necessary.  Part I deals with the effect of the different products on one another.  That is to say, that sometimes there is a good price for bacon pigs but porkers bring less.  Perhaps we lose a certain market for pork, and by the time there are big numbers available again the price of bacon goes down, or when we get back to pork the market is not there.  The inter-relation between bacon, pork, and live pigs is a matter to be investigated.  Part II deals with quality.  As the Seanad is aware, we put a tariff on bacon and pig products coming into this country in January, 1932.  About the end of July these tariffs were increased, and were made operative against countries <Col N="1108" /> within the Commonwealth of Nations. As a result no bacon or pig products whatever are imported except under licence, and a licence is only applicable in cases where the meat is being used for further manufacture.  Really there is nothing allowed in except pigs' tongues for tinning, because the people in the tinning trade here were not able to get sufficient pigs' tongues and we had to allow them to import under licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No investigation has been held to ascertain whether home curers are supplying the home market with what home consumers like.  For instance, before the tariff went on home consumers were accustomed to getting either Irish, American or Continental bacon as they wished.  The American bacon was of a different type, but there were people in this country who were keen on it.  We never had any proper investigation to know whether the home curers have supplied that type of bacon or not.  This part also deals with supplies for export, in order to ascertain whether the bacon and pork is the best type for the market to which it is sent, and whether by some change in the quality of the pigs, we might not get a better price and a better name for Irish bacon and pork, and also get an economic price.  The experience in the pig trade is that when prices are bad the number of pigs go down, and that when the number of pigs have gone down prices improve, but that then farmers reap no benefit. There is a sort of cycle right through for years, of a rise and fall in prices and a fall and rise in the numbers. It is a rather ambitious plan to try to establish some sort of an economic price.  This tribunal will be asked if they can do something in the way of price stabilisation.  Part III deals with proposals for reorganisation of the industry.  Many plans have been submitted to the Department of Agriculture during the last 12 months, and probably before that, by the bacon curers and by other people interested in the pig trade.  Plans have been given to us which purported, at any rate, to solve the whole question. When we came to examine these plans we found, as a rule, that there was <Col N="1109" /> some difficulty or other: that they were not ideal in themselves and were not an obvious solution of the whole difficulty. Some of these plans appear to be fairly good and might conceivably, with certain improvements, be made satisfactory and submitted to the tribunal for examination.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) of the motion deals with the measures which, having regard to the national interests, should be taken to &ldquo;encourage the production of pigs of suitable and uniform type.&rdquo; There again we have a certain difficulty all the time.  There is a problem about the breed of pig that should be encouraged in the country.  There has been a considered policy in the Department of Agriculture for some time for the encouragement of the large White York.  In the greater part of the Free State there is no great difficulty with regard to that.  Producers, bacon curers and everyone concerned seem to agree that that is the best type of pig for the greater part of the Free State. When we go towards the Six County Border we are met with a difficulty. There is a good deal of trading across the Border in small pigs and porkers. As Senators are aware, in that part of the country there is a peculiar trade. The farmer kills the pigs on his own premises and brings in the carcasses for sale to the market.  The pigs that do best in that market are what is known as the Ulster breed.  Now, there is a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst producers where the two lines meet.  We in the Department permit Ulster pigs&mdash;boars and sows&mdash;to be kept in certain counties such as Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, but when you come to, say, the northern part of Leitrim or of Meath, the pig producers there say that they would do better with the Ulster pig than with the large White York.  There is, therefore, at least certain dissatisfaction with the policy the Department is pursuing along the Border lines&mdash; between the two zones where the Ulster pigs are kept and where the large White York pigs are kept.  That is a matter that the tribunal will have to consider.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of Section 4 of the motion deals with the marketing of <Col N="1110" /> pigs.  Some people believe, and I think there is a certain amount of substance in it, that there is great waste in the marketing of pigs in this country.  At places where pigs are offered for sale, whether it be at fairs&mdash;they are not now offered so much at fairs as they used to be&mdash;or, as is more often the case, at railway stations the practice is to have three or four buyers representing three or four different factories. It is obvious that there is a certain amount of waste in that way. That is also a question that the tribunal will consider.  The question of curing comes under paragraph (c). We had a great reputation for bacon in this country.  I believe we still have a great reputation for the bacon we produce.  That was due to various causes.  Probably one of the reasons for that reputation was the type of curing that was done here.  That type of curing is being departed from, to a certain extent.  It, too, is a question that will have to be investigated by the tribunal.  The question of veterinary inspection comes under paragraph (d).  That is a paragraph that has created a certain amount of comment. We have been asked why should we want to interfere with people with regard to the hygiene of pig production. Well, we know from experience in the Department&mdash;I think people generally know because figures have been published from time to time&mdash;that in certain areas pigs are much more liable to tuberculosis than in others. The popular belief is that it is due to feeding on milk.  Whether that is really true or not it is hard to say, but there is very strong evidence to show that it is due to milk feeding that these pigs get affected with tuberculosis.  An investigation into that matter and the getting of some knowledge on the subject might lead to a big improvement in the position.  It might not entail very much expense if the thing is done in a proper way and the proper remedies are pointed out to the farmers living in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>The bigger question about veterinary inspection comes in on the bacon side. Under the Fresh Meat Export Act we are bound to examine the carcasses of pigs that are exported as pork.  We <Col N="1111" /> are bound under the Act to give a certificate that the meat is of good quality and free from disease before it can be exported.  On the other hand, there is no provision for the inspection of pork that is to be consumed at home, and there is no provision for the inspection of bacon. We have, to a small extent, got markets outside of Great Britain for bacon, and in some of these markets we are bound to give a veterinary certificate that the bacon is free from disease and so on.  It is not so easy to do that in present circumstances, although of course, we naturally do it when these markets require it.  We think the tribunal should examine the position to see whether the provisions of the Fresh Meat Act should not be extended both to the fresh meat that is offered for consumption at home and to bacon, whether it is offered for consumption at home or abroad.  Section 5 of the motion deals with the control of exports. In every market, practically, that we had any touch with at all there were quotas for the amount of bacon and pork allowed in.  Even on the British market now there is a proposal that a quota system be instituted.  If quotas are put on in any of these foreign markets and if our consumption at home is limited, as it is of course, we may be up against the position that we can only produce a certain number of pigs and must not go beyond that.  Therefore, the question of the control of exports of live pigs is rather an important question now, or probably will be in the near future.  Section 6 of the motion is one that is usually put in when a tribunal like this is being set up.  The purpose of it is to cover matters that we might forget.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is to meet a situation where the tribunal might make recommendations to the Executive Council that would involve legislation.  It would, of course, be a great help to the Executive Council and afterwards to the Oireachtas&mdash;if the Executive Council were to put any proposals before the two Houses&mdash;to know what would be the probable administrative <Col N="1112" /> expense.  We could, of course, without coming to the Dáil or the Seanad appoint a Commission on this matter, but it would not have the same legal authority as a tribunal of this kind. The reason why a tribunal like this is being set up is because it can <i>subpoena</i> witnesses to deal with certain matters which, I think, it should have power to inquire into.  I need hardly say that information of a confidential nature that the tribunal might require from a bacon factory with regard to costings and so on, would be treated as confidential and not issued to the public.  But the tribunal might also require information that would not be confidential which, unless it had the power to <i>subpoena</i> witnesses it might find it very difficult to procure.  The tribunal will have much the same power in that way as the Tariff Commission.</P>
    <P>I expect that when the tribunal has examined the position the members will draw up some sort of a report.  Whether they will draw up a unanimous, or majority or minority reports, of course remains to be seen. It is only when these reports have been presented that the business of the Executive Council and of the Oireachtas would commence.  As in the case of the Tariff Commission they will present, I take it, a report to the Executive Council.  The Executive Council then would have to consider the report.  If the Executive Council decide to promote legislation as a result of the report of the tribunal, of course that legislation would come before the two Houses.  I am not sure, however, that the tribunal is certain to present a report of that sort, because a big number of the proposals or suggestions that were put to us for dealing with the whole industry were of a kind that might be dealt with without any legislation at all.  That is to say they were proposals that could be adopted by the producers and by the bacon factories, at least for a time on a voluntary basis.  I do not know of course what view the tribunal may take of these proposals when they come to examine them, but it is possible the tribunal might make a <Col N="1113" /> report which would not involve legislation, and of course it is possible that they would.  In any case, if legislation were necessary it would have to come before the two Houses. I do not think there is anything further I need say at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us the nature of the tribunal that it is proposed to set up?  I think it would be advisable, in fact necessary, to have on that tribunal representatives of the pig producers, the bacon curers and pork shippers.  The Minister, in explaining the motion to the House, dealt with it in a rather sketchy manner.  Some of his points did not seem to me to be very valid. For instance, when he referred to the marketing of pigs I thought he meant the marketing of pigs and pig products in England, but as he went on I found he meant the marketing of pigs locally.  He said that they were offered for sale at various places, sometimes at railway stations and that there were two or three buyers competing for the pigs on offer.  That seemed to the Minister to be wasteful. Well, it might be wasteful, but I think it might possibly result in the producer getting a better price for his pigs when there were two or three buyers in competition for them.  The competition, even between bacon factories, ensures two things: one, that the consumer gets bacon at a reasonable price, and secondly, that the quality of the bacon sent out by the bacon curers is kept up to the mark.  Paragraph (d) of Section 4 of the motion speaks of regulating &ldquo;hygienically the conditions under which pig husbandry is carried on, and the veterinary inspection, ante and post mortem, of pigs slaughtered for the home and export bacon and pork trades.&rdquo;  There is a very big catering organisation in London.  At the door through which an assistant passes out to serve a customer there is this notice displayed: &ldquo;The customer is always right.&rdquo;  People in the bacon trade, and, let me say, the dairying industry also, have the idea that the belief in the Department of Agriculture is &ldquo;the official is always right.&rdquo;  I know very well, and <Col N="1114" /> the Minister himself knows, that even he sometimes strays from grace in this matter.  It will be in the memory of members of this House that there was a closing down of a bacon factory here some few years ago.  Those of us who know anything at all about that know that it was the manner in which the inspector in that case exercised his functions that caused that strike.  I trust, if there is to be any more legislation with regard to regulating and controlling the industry, that safeguards will be put in to ensure that the trader will get some consideration, and that the word of the inspector will not be taken always without consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the principal cause which tempted the Minister to put down this resolution was the enormous falling off in the pig population of our country.  If we were living in normal times, and if that reduction in the pig population had occurred in such times, I would wholeheartedly support the resolution; but when this enormous falling off of our pig population is caused by our own direct action, I think that this resolution and the setting up of this tribunal is a farce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the pig producers and the farmers of this country require to be told about the production of pigs. We produce the finest bacon in the world and, thanks to the Department and the Minister's predecessor, we are now producing bacon of a uniform type and quality, and for that reason our bacon is very much appreciated in the British market.  We produce a quantity of pigs enormously greater than what is required for home consumption. It must be plain to everybody that the reason for the abnormal falling off in the production of pigs is the economic war and the 40 per cent. tariff, and to the fact that pig production is not paying for those reasons. It is an impossible job to produce pigs, even with the bounty, to sell against the 40 per cent. tariff.  Of course, the Minister will say that we have a bounty against that, but our bounties will not cover even the cost of production. Every farmer in the country knows <Col N="1115" /> perfectly well that if he produces more than is required for the home market, the more he produces the more he will lose, Consequently, he is not going to produce them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the class of pigs for the home market, I understand that in the rural areas of this country a very much heavier and fatter pig is required, but if you look even at the quotations from to-day's or yesterday's papers, of the leading bacon merchants, you will see quite plainly that in producing a pig up to 12st. and selling it, you will get £1 more for it than at 16 st. I saw the price quoted at 57/- for a pig of 12st., and of 30/- for a pig 16st. That meant getting the pig up to 4 st. more and suffering a loss of £1.  The farmers of this country, as I said, know all about the production of pigs. They know what class to produce for the market in order to sell at a good price, and they will not produce pigs which they will have to sell at a loss. They will curtail their output for the reason that the more they produce the more they will lose with the present circumstances of the economic war and the 40 per cent. tariff on our exports.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, in the setting up of this tribunal under the proposed terms of reference, would add to these terms of reference that the tribunal should consider giving the producers of pigs something near the cost of production, it would be some reason for the setting up of such a tribunal, but if it is going to mean nothing but the hampering of the industry, my advice to the Minister is to let the pig industry alone, because any interference with the industry will do more harm than good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Counihan's language is rather too vigorous when he says that the setting up of this tribunal will be a farce.  I do not think that Senator Counihan really meant to convey so much as that word implies.  The Minister, I believe, was quite right in insisting that it should be a tribunal and not a commission, because if there is any subject on which it is necessary to get accurate information, this is the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> Senator Dowdall, very properly, suggested that in this tribunal the trade should be represented&mdash;the manufacturers of bacon, the people that buy the pigs.  I agree that they should be represented.  I would also make this suggestion, that there should be on that tribunal some person who is definitely opposed to excessive official interference with the work of farming. An inquiry is necessary for this reason, that of all the branches of the farmers' business the branch in which fluctuations have been most injurious to the farmer is that of the production of pigs.  The animal, as we know, is capable of very rapid multiplication. When prices are good, farmers are accustomed to breed in order to have pigs for the good market, and then, when the good market passes away, they have a number of pigs which they are bound to have to sell at very low prices.  That happens very frequently. It has happened very frequently in my own experience, and I have often felt that the Irish farmers have not had as much foresight in the matter of breeding pigs and of regulating the supply of pigs as the farmers of other countries. They have suffered in consequence of that and if this tribunal could make some suggestions whereby a steady supply of young pigs could be available&mdash;a steady uniform supply&mdash;I think it would be found that the breeding of pigs in this country would always be economical.</P>
    <P>I think that, probably, Senator Counihan misunderstood the Minister on another point also; because, if I heard the Minister rightly, he did indicate that in order to help the pig trade and the production of pigs, there would be something like an attempt at a uniform price.  Perhaps I am mistaken, but I understood that from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A guaranteed price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, some sort of uniform price.  I think you can go too far altogether with your guaranteed prices, because some person has to pay for it.  However, I am sure that the Minister, with the experience he has now acquired in his office, to which he <Col N="1117" /> has devoted a great deal of time and attention&mdash;I am sure now that the experience he has acquired will make him feel that, perhaps, there can be too much guaranteeing of prices on all sorts of commodities.  However, in that matter the Minister is a better judge than I am.  I would be inclined to leave people alone as much as possible. I am sure Senator Counihan will agree with me in that and also that everybody who understands the circumstances of this country will agree.</P>
      <P>There was one matter in which, I think, the Minister was mistaken.  It has been referred to already by Senator Dowdall.  The Minister seems to think that it is a great waste to have two or three pig buyers at a fair or a railway station.  If it is a waste of the time of two of the pig buyers, I can assure the Minister that it is a tremendous consolation to the farmer with pigs to sell to know that there are two buyers.  I think that, on the balance, the public are better served by having three buyers at a fair or railway station rather than one buyer.  The farmer is inclined to think that with only one buyer present he is not going to get a proper price, and even with three or four buyers present he has the suspicion in his mind that they are all in league.  So that, understanding as I do, the psychology of the farmer, I think that the waste of public time is more than compensated for by the ease of mind of the farmer, who has pigs to sell, when he goes home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to draw attention.  That is paragraph (d) of Section 4, which proposes to &ldquo;regulate hygienically the conditions under which pig husbandry is carried on and the veterinary inspection, ante and post mortem, of pigs slaughtered for the home and export bacon and pork trades.&rdquo;  That has to go before the tribunal, but if the tribunal does recommend regulations from the pig-sty to the counter, it means, I think, a lot of officialdom.  I hope it will not be necessary to carry these regulations to the utmost limit which is contemplated in that paragraph (d).  However, I think it is a good thing that there should be <Col N="1118" /> a tribunal.  I think it is a good thing that there should be an inquiry and if it has only one result, namely, to steady the supply of pigs in the country and give the farmer what he has not got, in my experience, up to the present, the chance of a good market as well as the liability of a bad one, it will be good.  The farmer always breeds at the wrong time.  He runs after a good price and then when he has a lot of pigs the price is bad. If the Minister can succeed in doing that, either by means of his tribunal or in any other way, he will have done a great service to the country; but in doing it, I hope he will refrain as much as possible from domiciliary visits and interference in the farmers' business and that he will appoint as few further officials as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all satisfied that there has been a case made out for the setting up of this tribunal.  I am interested in all sides of this business, as a producer, a fattener of pigs, and as a curer.  I have never heard even a single complaint at any end of the interest, at the buyer's end or the producer's end, either of the quality or the numbers offered by the suppliers.  As showing that the quality is right I believe that we have succeeded in getting the best possible prices across the water for bacon more often than any other exporters.  On that ground alone I think it can be shown that the qualities of our supplies are right.  In recent months, if we suffered in anything in this country, it was in the surplus of a certain type of pig&mdash;the heavy-weight fat type&mdash;which is largely exported and the only market for which is across the water.  We can send very little except lean bacon to the country.  You must export the fat bacon.  That market for four or five thousand surplus fat pigs per week has been shut off from us.  I for one cannot find any reason for the setting up of a tribunal at all events during the present abnormal time through which we are passing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the desirability of veterinary inspection and hygienic methods.  Lest what the Minister said might go unchallenged I <Col N="1119" /> may say that we of the Irish Co-operative Factory pay at least £400 a year to have our pigs inspected.  No bacon leaves the factory without veterinary inspection.  It is quite possible that the section here about inspection might be meant to apply to pigs raised by the farmers at home.  The Minister did not explain that, but if that is what it does mean, I think it would be very objectionable. I am aware that there has been a move made to stabilise prices, that is to raise up, to some extent, the price of bacon at home and across the water.  I am also aware, although I do not give the source of my information because it is confidential, that it was suggested there should be a levy made on pigs for the purpose of stabilising prices.  I think that would be a very objectionable thing from the point of view of the small pig raiser and feeder, and they are the greater number engaged in the raising of pigs.  I suggest, lest that idea would go any further, that it would be very objectionable to have a levy of that kind upon pigs.  Judged by our experience of the levy made in the dairy industry it is the small supplier that would be victimised, and it is the large suppliers that would gain anything from it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to prejudice this matter.  If it was right that a tribunal should be set up I would be perfectly willing to support it, but judging from the abnormal conditions prevailing I think it would be very wrong, and would put the industry altogether upon the wrong road.  My experience over a number of years is that the industry has gone on fairly well and safely.  If there is any industry that might be said to be representative of the small people&mdash;that is the small supplier and the farmer&mdash;I think this is one, and it would be a pity that it would be interfered with.  There is nothing more useful that I can see than this industry as it stands and for that reason I oppose the setting up of this tribunal.</P>

      <P>As I know very little about pigs I did not intend to intervene in this debate.  All I know about pigs is that I am fond of bacon and pork, <Col N="1120" /> and that I support the native industry. Senator Dowdall asked the Minister to put representatives of the producer and manufacturer and the shopkeepers upon this tribunal.  I would appeal to him to put representatives of the particular section of the community who are most concerned in this system upon the tribunal.  Although I always support Irish bacon I know the Danes, and to a great extent the Canadians, do a great trade in bacon.  They turn out the stuff better&mdash;I do not say that theirs is better bacon&mdash;but they turn it out in a more saleable condition than do the Irish manufacturers.  They provide the wholesaler and the shopkeeper with exactly what they want.  I do not know the particular technical terms of the trade but I can explain myself in this way: If the wholesaler or the shopkeeper when buying hams, gams, shoulders or sides, says he wants them very fat, or fat, or lean, or very lean, he gets what he wants.  That is how the Danes and the Canadians do their trade here.  The Irish manufacturer does not bother very much about these things.  He says take it the way you get it.  That may be all right here, but if we want to do trade with other countries we must do what the Danes and Canadians are prepared to do. Senator MacEllin said that prices are better now than before the economic war.  I am glad to see food prices low but we must face the facts, and if prices are low and if the producer does not get a decent price he is not going to go on producing.  That is the trouble. No matter what laws we may pass the production of cattle, sheep and pigs in this country is going to be ruled by the law of supply and demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last half century the trouble about pigs in Ireland was that when the pigs were dear people started breeding pigs.  When they fell in price people did not breed a lot, and then prices rose.  Many people had gone out of production and even killed their sows.  I do not see, no matter what law you pass, that you will ever get over that.  The farmer will produce what pays him best; if it does not pay him he will not produce.  The farmer is no fool no more than anybody else. The first time I knew that there was <Col N="1121" /> such a term as the Ulster pig was when I heard it here.  I had not heard the name before.  In Cappoquin, Waterford, Cork, Tralee, Limerick and Castlebar in the west the demand is for the leaner type of pig bacon.  It is different in Cavan where they have a heavier pig, and I think it would be very foolish for the Minister to interfere with the production of that pig where there is a trade in it round about Cavan.  That is the sort of pig they want to buy there and not the other kind.</P>

      <P>Senator Staines seemed to think that he was contradicting me when he said the farmer was no fool. I did not say that the farmer was a fool.  I know more about farmers than Senator Staines.  They will not enter into production unless it pays them and the whole process is governed by the law of supply and demand.  I admit that, of course.  Senator Staines admitted that it is not exactly the economic war that is the cause of reduction in the number of pigs, but that reduction comes about automatically from time to time, according to the supply of pigs.  If there is an extra supply the prices drop.  The farmer foolishly enough does not stick steadfastly to the production of pigs; he sells and often kills his sows.  When prices rise again he has no sows.  That is the root cause of the ups and downs in the pig trade.  Senator Counihan is a very good illustration of the farmer who becomes a politician.  When the politician clashes with the farmer the politician will come out on top. Senator Counihan is bitterly opposed to this inquiry, because it is proposed by the present Minister.  If it had been proposed by his predecessors, Senator Counihan would jump up and support it, but he does not care two hoots for it because it is proposed by the present Government.  Senator Counihan went on to try and prove the terribly bad prices that were received for pigs.  He knows nothing about the pig trade.</P>

      <P>We were talking about the prices of pigs.  Taking the prices as I have seen them last week, bonhams fetched 25/- to 30/- in the West of Ireland.  That is higher than any time in the last two years.  Why is that?  For the simple reason that farmers have gone out of production of pigs now as in the last 10 or 20 years. They go out of production when they do not get good prices.  That is the reason why farmers go out of production of pigs from time to time. There is a good deal to be inquired into by this tribunal; there is a good deal of inequality at any time in connection with the bacon industry.  For instance, prices are often far higher in the fairs than at the bacon factories for pigs delivered there.  What is the explanation of that?  Why should not a man get more if he brings his pig to the factory than if he brought him to the fair, where the buyer has to carry them back to the factory?  Why should pigs be brought to the West of Ireland and transferred to the South, and why should higher prices be paid in Claremorris than in Limerick, and vice versa?  Surely there should be an inquiry into that.  It is my belief that one of the explanations for that is that there is some arrangement made between the bacon curer and what is <Col N="1123" /> known as the middleman, that they will pay a certain flat rate to the factory and give him the difference in commission, which is very substantial.  I have seen a case of a man selling pigs in the town of Claremorris.  He was offered a certain price, and he brought them to the bacon factory and found that he could not get within 7/6 of the price at that factory 100 yards away. That is the explanation of it&mdash;there was an understanding between the buyers and the factory owners that they would get a certain amount of commission, and that at all times they would create employment for a certain section of the middlemen.  Surely, that must be set right?  Why should the producer be asked to bear that difference?  I think it is unreasonable.</P>
      <P>With regard to the class and breed of pigs, the large White York is as good a breed of pig as there is in any part of the world, and I understand that Denmark, at the present time, is doing its best to establish their particular breed as something of a similar nature of the large White York.  Yet, when it comes to feeding it, it will be found that that type is not as easily finished as is a cross between the large White York and the Ulster pig.  That is an easier and faster finished pig and, perhaps, it would be desirable to have that cross rather than the pure large White York alone.  All crosses, when it comes to a question of feeding, are often more easily fed than the pure breeds. With regard to the question of veterinary inspection raised by Senator Dillon, I agree with Senator Dillon that further interference with the feeding, housing or looking after of stocks by the farmers in their yards is not wanted.  The farmers do not want any interference of that description. They are well able to see that the pigs are properly housed, and they will house them with a view to seeing that the animals are turned out properly and quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interference, however, is necessary with regard to veterinary inspection from the point of view of the prevalence of tuberculosis.  It is <Col N="1124" /> already on record, I understand, that in the creamery districts of the South of Ireland a very substantial proportion of the pigs are tubercular.  That is the case, and it might not be wise to publish those facts, but I understand that it is the case simply because the cows, which were great producing cows, were growing old&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to the position of the bacon trade as a whole, there is more demand in Liverpool, and in England, generally, for Irish bacon than there has been for a long time past.  In the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> of to-day you can find the prices quoted as follows: Irish, 85/-; Danish, 80/-; Swedish, 74/- and Dutch, 70/-.  That goes to show that you have not lost your markets on the other side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I always said we did. It goes to prove, in any case, that the people who are talking about having lost markets are wrong.  If you have the right product and if you are able to place it on the market, it will be bought any time.  If you want to talk from the political point of view, it can be said that, during the Black-and-Tan régime here, when the greatest row in the history of the two countries was in <Col N="1125" /> progress, they bought more of our stuff and paid higher prices for it than they ever did before or since.  With regard to this tribunal, I believe a tribunal is not a satisfactory method for finding out the feelings of the farmers with regard to the grievances they have in their relationships with the bacon curers and the pig buyers. It is my opinion that the working farmer does not as a rule come before a tribunal and, if he were brought here forcibly, he would be so disconcerted before such a tribunal that you would not get all the information he has out of him.  In view of that, I believe that some other method must be devised, if you like, to assist the tribunal or to replace it.  I suggest that something in the way of a questionnaire should be sent out to every parish or to every county in Ireland to well-known pig producers.  They could be asked to set down their views on the pig-producing question and they could, in answering the questions, add their comments on the whole situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that this tribunal is to consist of civil servants and, in that regard, I re-echo what I said a couple of years ago in regard to the tribunal of civil servants set up to inquire into the bacon industry.  I objected before to the Tariff Commission which we had here in the past.  I said then, and I say now, that there is only one member of the Tariff Commission knows anything about live-stock, and he knows it inside out.  That man is Dan Twomey, but the other two members are civil servants who do not know the first thing about the live-stock industry.  I suppose that other members of the Civil Service would be appointed to help this tribunal out. Those are not the proper people to go in detail into this matter and to find out all that is to be found out from the farming community.  I do believe that you would get good results from this inquiry, but there is no necessity why it should cost any money.  If it does cost money, it is to a great extent a waste of time, because you would get just as much information from the adoption of the suggestion I make. The Department officials will be able <Col N="1126" /> to do what these civil servants are expected to do, that is, to compile the facts and to make a report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to oppose this motion to set up a tribunal to inquire into the state of the pig industry in this country.  It is not necessary to set up a tribunal now any more than it has been for many years.  Why is the motion brought before us now? Why are we asked to give our consent to it now?  I do not like to be unduly harsh but there is no use in hiding facts or in beating about the bush at a time when the country is in the state it is in at present.  My idea about this tribunal is that it is another system of eye-wash for the farmers&mdash;&ldquo;hog-wash&rdquo; was the very appropriate name given to it by a member of the Dáil&mdash; to try to divert their attention from the real cause not only of the depression in the pig industry but of the whole deplorable state of the agricultural industry.  That is my opinion of it and I believe that the tribunal will not produce one atom of good.  It will not produce any more evidence or information than the Minister could get from the officials of his Department. For many years that Department, particularly under the guidance of his predecessor, gave their special attention to the bacon industry.  At the Albert College in Glasnevin and through the country pedigree pigs of the highest order were produced, and in the Minister's own constituency I could name half-a-dozen breeders who would give him more information than all the tribunals of civil servants he could set up in the next hundred years.  They are men who have given their time and attention to it and who have produced pigs of the highest order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to depart from what is called the economic war without saying a word, in spite of the objection there is to the mention of it.  In the first place, the name &ldquo;economic war&rdquo; is a misnomer.  Let us face the fact that this Government had in trust certain money belonging to certain people which was not handed over to those people.  We said here before, <Col N="1127" /> and I say it now, that that was national embezzlement and that the country was properly suffering for the crime of the Government.  If a private person commits a crime, he is held up to public odium and sentenced to imprisonment.  This is one of the most serious crimes, and let us not now complain.  The country has no right to complain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so long as they gave their consent to that, and that is the cause of the depression in the bacon industry.  I am rather surprised to hear Senator MacEllin say that there is a great market for our bacon in England.  The stock argument of Fianna Fáil is that the English market is no use to us whatever; that it is gone and done for and that the English people are not eating bacon any more.  Let me give the figures. For the first three months of this year, 7,000,000 cwts. of bacon were sold in England.  Of that amount, Denmark sent to England 4½ million cwts. and the Saorstát sent 99,000 cwts.  If they are so anxious to get our bacon, how does the Senator account for those figures?  We were always able to beat the world in the English market, and in recent years even the Danes, with their great organisation in this industry.  By sheer quality, and by the regulations made for sending bacon to that market, this was one of the industries in which we were able to compete with the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator MacEllin stated that the price of pigs is higher now than before the economic war started.  It is.  It fluctuates.  At the end of 1931 the price was about 30/- per cwt., which was uneconomic.  That was due to an over supply and, of course, the fall was a natural one.  When the economic war started we had the distinction, as I call it, of producing bacon which commanded 10/- per cwt. for certain classes of pigs.  There were three prices&mdash;20/-, 15/-, and 10/-.  That is the level to which the present Ministers have brought the price of pigs in Ireland. <Col N="1128" /> Of course, the people went out of production.  Where is that going to lead us?  What prospects are there? What is the tribunal going to tell us? How are we going to improve the prices?  If people get into production again the price will go back to 10/-. You cannot get away from that.  No tribunal will stop it.  What, then, is the good of talking about stabilising prices?  I believe, with Senator Dillon, that this motion is a preliminary to further activities in the way of a levy. Veterinary inspection and hygienic conditions have been referred to.  I do not know what is meant by that. If it means that inspectors can go into yards&mdash;Senator MacEllin said he would not like that&mdash;to see if the pigs' tails are properly curled, no one will like it.  I always heard that when a pig's tail is curled the animal is in good condition, but if the tail hangs limp and straight it is in bad form.  I could tell by looking at a pig's tail whether it was in good form or not.</P>
    <P>There is great activity amongst certain elements in the country at present, and young men are being recruited at 1/6 daily, I suppose, to learn sword practice.  Perhaps the Minister might induce them to turn their swords&mdash;I will not say into ploughshares but into curling tongs and rings&mdash;not for their noses&mdash;for their ears, so that they would look much more attractive.  The proposal is ridiculous.  It is eyewash and, in my opinion, is meant to be nothing else.  That is the reason I am opposing it.  When the motion was being debated in the Dáil Deputy Keating of Wexford, who knows more about this question than any member of the Oireachtas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They eventually prevented him from being heard, as the Minister moved the closure.  Above all others, Deputy Keating could tell the truth about this question, and he <Col N="1129" /> could tell more than any tribunal. Why was his statement not heard?  I hope the Seanad will throw out this motion.  As far as I know, nobody wants it, neither pig producers nor bacon curers.  In normal times, when there is no so-called economic war on, there might be some use for such a tribunal.  There is none whatever now. It can only be misleading and do what it is meant to do&mdash;throw dust in the eyes of the people.  I oppose this motion, and I hope other Senators will do likewise.  There is one danger which I should mention.  We have had various indications of the Government's intention to concentrate on the home market.  A different type of pig is wanted for the home market from that which makes the best bacon for the British market.  If the people depart from the production of the large White York, which makes the best bacon for the British market, very grave injury might be done.  In spite of the Government's efforts the economic war is not going to last for ever, and eventually we shall get back our markets, but we may find ourselves landed with an unsuitable type of bacon pig for export.  County Wexford is a great pig-producing county, and could supply the entire home market.  We must always have an enormous export for this particular product of the agricultural community, and we should not do anything which might endanger our chances in the British market when normal times return.  I hope this motion will be rejected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw attention to the fact that similar questions <Col N="1130" /> have been discussed and examined before now.  I am sure Senator Counihan and Senator Miss Browne will be interested to know that in 1914-15, under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture at that time, there was a very exhaustive inquiry into the position of the Irish pig-breeding industry, and it was by no means shown in the evidence then submitted by farmers, that there was such an earnest desire to have no interference whatever from the Department of Agriculture. In fact, the evidence of farmers at that time was full of suggestions about what ought to be done, and explanations of the then awful condition of the bacon trade, and the very small number of pigs being fed.  Many of the conditions existing to-day were complained of as being prevalent at the time the inquiry was entered upon, and I am quite sure that if anyone took the trouble to go through the evidence, it would be found in the report of the Commission that the cause of the complaints then adverted to still exist and that many of the suggested remedies, conflicting as they were, have still to be put into effect.</P>
      <P>I think another point was forgotten by those who are opposing the motion, and that is that there was a similar inquiry has recently been conducted in Great Britain with regard to the pig trade there, and that the Commission has made some very definite and far-reaching recommendations regarding the production, the type and the marketing of pigs and bacon. If these recommendations are put into effect, as they are likely to be, whatever may happen regarding future relations between this country and Great Britain, they are going to have a considerable effect upon the bacon trade of this country.  That fact alone would justify the Ministry here in entering upon a new inquiry as to the position to-day and the prospective position here of the pig-breeding and bacon industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some idea of the reasons why this particular form of tribunal has been adopted in this case.  Under the last Government Senator Miss Browne, Senator Counihan and one or two other <Col N="1131" /> Senators were very strongly in support of the proposition that every proposal touching fiscal matters, tariffs, and so on should be preceded by an exhaustive inquiry into all the factors relating to the industry proposed to be protected and assisted.  I think that was quite a desirable precedent to the imposition of any tariffs.  But the proposal here is to do exactly for the pig industry what was advocated and given effect to by the Tariff Commission which was established under the auspices of Cumann na nGaedheal, so that the criticism on that score falls at once and is not valid now.  The motion reads:</P>
    <P>... it is expedient that a tribunal be established for the purpose of inquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance.</P>
    <P>I am not going to quarrel with the form in this case.  The device has been used on other occasions over similar wide long-range inquiries, to establish a tribunal under machinery which was never intended for this purpose, and I would suggest to the Minister that instead of using a tribunal established under a particular Act for dealing with something like industrial disputes, so that a definite public matter should be inquired into by an authoritative body, that that machinery is not appropriate to this kind of inquiry.  The presumption is that if both Houses agree to the setting up of such a tribunal then the Minister will make an Order, and that tribunal will then have a good deal more authority with regard to calling witnesses, taking evidence on oath, and securing papers than an ordinary Commission might have.  I believe it is much more satisfactory that an inquiry of this kind, which has not to deal with a definite matter of public importance, but to deal with a matter of public importance, should be established by the device of having an inquiry of the kind set up by a resolution of both Houses, with power, without using this particular device.  That is purely a matter of form but it is well to reiterate criticism of this kind on the point previously gone over, that this machinery was established for an <Col N="1132" /> entirely different purpose and is not the most suitable machinery for this kind of inquiry.</P>

I have always had a great belief in the present Minister for Agriculture, and in his predecessor, and I am very loth to take another view, when he says that he wants an inquiry &mdash;although I thought that the Department would be able to deal with it&mdash; and wants outside assistance.  Accordingly I would not be prepared to quarrel with him over a small matter in the way of expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 of the motion states that the tribunal may take into consideration &ldquo;any matter which, in the opinion of the tribunal, affects the welfare of the pig and bacon industry.&rdquo;  If the Minister were to get a few people holding different political opinions on that question to act as members of the tribunal I am afraid we might have a bit of scrapping at the tribunal.  From the opinions that we have heard expressed here to-day there is no question whatever but that political matters come tremendously into this. If the tribunal is composed of people thoroughly conversant with the pig industry, and if they confine themselves to that and do not go into the question as to whether the economic war has destroyed the pig industry or not, you may get a valuable report.  Of course if that question was raised, and if you had on the tribunal people who held <Col N="1133" /> that the economic war had nothing to do with the present depression or position of the pig industry, then I fear some would think that the tribunal was being used in a wrong way.  A good deal will depend on who is put on the tribunal.  I take it that what the Minister is after is that people will act on it who will not bring politics into the question, but will confine themselves to the state of the industry.  The Minister is asking for an inexpensive tribunal to inquire into a technical matter connected with the pig industry, and I do not feel disposed to oppose his motion.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question raised by Senator Jameson I think if we were, say, to pick a tribunal from the Seanad, representing every interest, that we would not get a unanimous report about the causes of the depression in the pig trade.  The tribunal will be composed of civil servants.  Civil servants have no politics and are not likely to quarrel about the economic war.  The tribunal is being composed entirely of civil servants because we thought that from every point of view they would be the best to give a report on the various matters referred to. Deputy Dowdall and other Senators thought that the various interests concerned should be represented.  At first I had that opinion myself.  I called the bacon curers together and also some bacon producers.  In the meantime I had been considering the matter, and came to the conclusion that it was not advisable that we should have these people on the tribunal.  When they came along, the first thing they said was that they should all be represented on the tribunal.  I said that I thought not.  I said to the bacon curers: &ldquo;If I put one of you on the tribunal will the others be satisfied to have him inquiring into every single matter connected with your business?&rdquo;; and they said they thought not, that it would not be fair. That was the first objection.  The producers would not have, perhaps, the same objection.  A farmer would not mind very much whether another farmer was appointed on the tribunal <Col N="1134" /> to inquire into his business or not.  If we were to have distributors, shippers or any other interest represented on the tribunal, I think we would have the same objection as we had in the case of the bacon curers&mdash;that they would not like to have colleagues of theirs inquiring into their business; where they bought their pigs, how they cured them, where they get their markets and what they are able to get for their bacon and so on.  The bacon curers definitely objected when I put that point to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point of view is this.  If we were to put a curer, a distributor and a producer on the tribunal, when they came to make a report in which they had to divide up the different expenses of pig production, is it not quite likely that we would not get a unanimous report?  If the producer wanted to draw attention in the report to something such as Senator MacEllin reported, that he was not being treated fairly by the curer, it is not likely that the curer would sign the report and have it unanimous.  Also if we were to come to the point of trying&mdash;I am only saying trying in this case because I do not know&mdash;to get some recommendation with regard to stabilised prices, the question would arise as to what is a fair price.  One may take it for granted that the producer is not going to understate what he could produce pigs at.  The curer and the consumer would be interested, I take it, in keeping the price as low as possible&mdash;within reasonable limits&mdash;so that the consumption of bacon would remain at the highest possible level.  There, again, one could not expect to get a unanimous report.  The producer would say that one price should be fixed.  The others would say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and would insist on signing a minority report on that.  If we were to put these three interests on the tribunal I think the result would be that we would have three reports.  We think the fairest way is to get all these people to come before the tribunal and give their points of view.  It will be the task of the tribunal to sift their evidence and make their report.  I might say, in passing, that the evidence in cases such as this is always available for members in the <Col N="1135" /> Library.  Usually it is not printed, because the cost would be too great, but members of the Oireachtas will be in a position to consult, in the Library, the evidence given by any person.</P>
    <P>I was very much surprised in the Dáil on Friday last&mdash;I was not surprised in the Seanad, because I knew what to expect&mdash;to find that there should be any opposition to a proposal like this. Why should anybody object to an inquiry being held except for one reason&mdash;that is, political prejudice?</P>

      <P>How could I, except under the powers I have already, and I can use those powers without going to the tribunal at all?  The tribunal does not give me any new powers. Whatever powers I have I can use them.  Senator Johnson raised the point that this motion was brought in the form that the tribunal is to deal with &ldquo;a matter of urgent public importance.&rdquo;  We may have abused the thing in that way.</P>

      <P>My predecessor brought in a similar motion about the mixing of grain.  I did not object to it.  I did not say in relation to that motion what Senators have said here to-day in connection with this, although I could very well have done so: &ldquo;This should have been done ten years ago.&rdquo;  I took up the attitude to let the matter go to the tribunal.  In that particular case the mixing of grain may have helped to save the grain position.  At any rate it could have been said then that the motion dealing with the mixing of grain should have been brought in years earlier.  Are the Senators who are opposing this doing so on the grounds that there is no more necessity for this motion now than <Col N="1136" /> there was ten years ago?  Very probably a good deal of legislation is introduced that there is no more necessity for now than there was ten years ago.  But the fact is that we are always trying to improve a bit.  I am also told that we have the best pigs and bacon in the world.  Well, if it is possible to make them better why not do so?  If I, as Minister for Agriculture, sat down in the Department, signed my name to the documents put before me, and said that everything was splendid, that we have the best pigs, cattle and horses in the world, and did not intervene in anything, I do not believe Senators would be satisfied. They would say that the Minister was not active enough, and now because the Minister proposes to be a bit active they find fault with him and say that he should not interfere.</P>
      <P>In introducing the motion, I referred to the different matters that the tribunal would investigate.  Some Senators appeared to think that I am putting it to the tribunal that everything is wrong here.  I am not saying anything of the sort.  For instance, I think myself that we cannot improve on the breed of pigs in this country. I said that we had complaints on the border line between two zones within the Free State, that is where the Ulster pig and the large White York are produced. If you take the border line between these two zones&mdash;Leitrim-Cavan and Meath-Cavan&mdash;there is a certain amount of dissatisfaction.  It is only in that area of the Free State a question would arise as to whether it should be the Ulster pig or the large White York that should be produced. I would be surprised, for instance, if the tribunal should recommend that the Ulster pig be brought back to Cork, or the White York to Cavan.  It is only on the border line that question would arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Counihan talked about the falling off in numbers, and, as I expected, he said that was due to the economic war.  Some Senators spoke about the great pigs they produced.  I bred some pigs myself, but it was because of the policy of Cumann na nGaedheal that I had to go out of pigs. I was breeding them fairly successfully <Col N="1137" /> up to 1929.  From that on I found I was doing it at a loss until I had to get out of them practically altogether. I am going back into the breeding of them now a little bit, hoping they may remain at something of a better price than they were in 1930 and 1931.  I am a little bit more optimistic than some Senators appear to be about the pig position.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan said that we produced the finest pigs in the world. That, I think, is true, though of course I cannot state it definitely.  At any rate we are getting top price on the British market to-day.  The Senator also spoke of uniform quality.  I do not agree with him there.  That is one of the big complaints we get from the trade&mdash;that they are not getting uniform quality.  Senator Staines drew attention to that.  I have heard very many in the trade make that complaint&mdash;that when they want a dozen sides of a certain quality they cannot get them.  These are matters that can be referred to the tribunal and investigated to see if some improvement cannot be made.  Senator Counihan says that the farmers know all about their own business.  He said that my predecessor had made great improvements in the pig industry.  Is it possible that when my predecessor was here the farmers did not know all about their own business, but now that he is gone they do know all about their own business?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">

      <P>Any way my predecessor had to interfere.  His interference, according to the Senator, was welcomed. The farmers did not do things for themselves, but the Minister did them for them.  Now we are told that they are able to do things for themselves without my interference.  Senator Counihan also said that if we included in this motion a proposal to give the producer the cost of production he would support it.  If the Senator looks at Section 2 of the motion he <Col N="1138" /> will find this in it: &ldquo;while giving a steady economic return to producers of pigs.&rdquo;  I think, in view of that, the Senator ought to vote for the motion, if his opposition is not due to political prejudice.  He said he would vote for it if it was proposed to give the producer the cost of production. I have just read for him that the motion contains what he asks.  Senator Comyn suggested that we ought to have on the tribunal some person who would be against official interference.  I can tell the Seanad that the whole tribunal would be against that.  Whatever Senators may think, civil servants are just as human as other people and do not want to interfere if they can help it.  They will not.  I think, interfere in this business if legislation can possibly be avoided.  I think they will advise against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dillon protested against what he heard was a proposal to make a levy.  I am not sure, but I think that perhaps he is right, and that in some of the proposals sent up to me there was a scheme of levy and bounty, but I do not think it was a feasible scheme.  I do not remember it myself. We had so many schemes sent up to us for consideration that it was impossible to deal with them all.  I think, however, there was one scheme like that and that it did not appear to me to be feasible.  I do not know whether the tribunal will find it feasible either, but possibly it is a matter which they will consider.  I must say, however, if Senator Dillon is connected with the factory side, that representatives of the factories were with me several times.  As a matter of fact, to one particular meeting last year every factory in Ireland was asked to send representatives.  As a result of that meeting a representative committee was appointed to represent the factories&mdash;so many to represent the big factories, so many to represent the cooperative undertakings and so many to represent the small factories.  I have been meeting these representatives very often and every member of that committee was in favour of the tribunal, with the exception of one big factory which is not in favour of it. <Col N="1139" /> I also met some of the largest producers in the country&mdash;even representatives of the Farmers' Union.  So it cannot be said that I am prejudiced. All these producers and members of the Farmers' Union were enthusiastically in favour of the tribunal.  As a matter of fact, if it were not for the pressure brought to bear by the Farmers' Union in this case, I think the tribunal might not have come off so quickly.</P>
    <P>Of course, if any person here opposes the tribunal we can, as an alternative, turn to a commission.  We can make the same inquiries, as far as the producers are concerned, through a commission because the farmers will give the evidence required without subpæna. We will get the information we want, until we come to a few big factories in the country, and it only means that if you turn down the tribunal you are just going to save these few big factories.  That is all it amounts to.</P>
    <P>I might assure Senator Staines that we have no intention whatsoever, in the Department at any rate, of interfering with the Ulster pig in Cavan or in the zone in which they are placed, but, as I said already, there is a certain amount of difference of opinion just on the borderline between the two.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator MacEllin's suggestion, sending out a questionnaire might be a means of getting information.  We will naturally send this to every county.  I imagine that the procedure of the tribunal will be to send an invitation to every factory asking them to submit evidence if they care to do so.  A similar invitation, I presume, would also be sent to such organisations as the Bacon Wholesalers' Association and the principal organisations connected with the bacon industry, and also, probably, to every county committee.  That will mean that the county committees will probably select producers in their respective counties to give evidence and in that way we will get the best evidence we can before the tribunal.  It will not <Col N="1140" /> cost very much money.  As far as I can see, the only expense would be the cost of witnesses.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Browne said that it was not necessary now any more than years ago, or that if it is necessary now, it was just as necessary then. Probably that is correct.  It may have been necessary five or six years ago, or possibly ten years ago, but I hold that it is better to deal with it now than to put it off for another ten years. Senator Miss Browne also said that she is able to get people in the County Wexford with the best of information on this subject and who would give that information to me.  The difficulty is that too many people are offering information on the subject, with the result that it is very hard to decide which of them is right and which is wrong.  It would take me a very long time to listen to the various people to whom I should like to listen.  I think the only feasible way for these people to act is to submit their information to the tribunal, which will listen to their views.  If they will give the information to me they can just as easily give it to the tribunal.  I suppose I may pass over Senator Miss Browne's lecture on morals and go on to the next matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Browne also said that for the first three months of this year our exports were small.  That was quoted in the Dáil also, but when I looked up the matter I found that Danish exports had gone down much more than ours in the first three months.  I can imagine a person in the Parliament of Denmark with the same political prejudices as Senator Miss Browne, getting up and denouncing the Danish Government for losing the English market.  They lost to the extent of quarter of a million hundredweights in the first three months of this year.  Imagine the Opposition in Denmark attacking the Danish Minister for Agriculture on that!  He cannot plead an economic war.  As a matter of fact, if he pleaded that, the Opposition would say: &ldquo;Well, now, have you not got the opportunity to take the trade from the Irish, who were such <Col N="1141" /> fools as to get into an economic war?&rdquo; What defence would he have on that?</P>

      <P>Well, if the Senator did, perhaps I could have dealt with it. Another point raised by Senator Miss Browne was that at one time bacon was down to 10/- here and to 15/- and 20/-. It is obvious that the economic war was not responsible for that.  If you take 40 per cent. of that it is only 4/-. We were giving a bounty of 10/-, which means that we were giving them a bonus of 6/- over and above what the price was&mdash;that is, if the price was ever 10/-, which I do not believe it was. The Senator also spoke about some military force getting 1/6 a day.  I do not know what military force that would be, unless it was the &ldquo;Blue Shirts.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be in order to deal with it.  The economic war will not last for ever, as Senator Counihan and Senator Miss Browne say, but if it does not last, I wonder what these Senators will have to talk about.  The County Wexford would not supply the home demand in bacon.  As a matter of fact, our home consumption in bacon would be almost two-thirds of the highest production we have reached for the last ten years. That was something like 1,400,000 pigs, <Col N="1142" /> and our home consumption is equal to almost 1,000,000 pigs.  So that, the home market is really very important in this matter.  It is much more important than some Senators seem to realise.  It is well over half of the whole production even at the peak point of production, and practically 100 per cent. when our production goes down as low as it did in 1926 and 1927, which was the lowest for the last ten years.  The number killed in that period was down well under 1,000,000 pigs.  I do not think that, under the Fianna Fáil Government we will ever descend so low in production as that again.  That, of course, happened under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnson very wisely remarked that, if a Government had time, every tariff and every matter of that sort should be preceded by an inquiry such as this.  I think that was the complaint of the Opposition, that in every case we were putting on tariffs without proper inquiry.  But now, when we do propose to have an inquiry before proceeding in certain matters, I find the Opposition just as bad.  It is very difficult for me to know how I can get Senator Counihan or Senator Miss Browne on my side.  In fact I have almost despaired of it.</P>
