      <P>Copies of the memorandum explaining the various provisions of this Bill have already been circulated to Senators.  I am not sure whether any Senator desires to raise any particular point as I have not received notice of any intention to do so.  In general, I think a discussion on a Bill of this sort can best be dealt with on the Committee Stage.  If there are any points which occur to Senators at this moment, which they would wish to discuss in <Col N="1874" /> detail, I would suggest that they should mention them now so that I can arrange to have them dealt with by the appropriate Minister on the Committee Stage.  The Bill, as no doubt the Seanad is aware, is an omnibus measure touching many Departments and is merely intended to renew laws which expire from year to year and which in present circumstances it is felt desirable to keep in force.</P>

    <Title>Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Bill, 1933 (Certified Money Bill)&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is consequential on the passing of the Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act, 1933. As the Seanad is no doubt aware, Section 4 of the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Act, 1923 provides that the allowance and travelling facilities to be paid to and received by each member of the Oireachtas shall commence and be payable as from the day on which he shall take the Oath which was formerly prescribed by the Constitution, after his then last election to the Oireachtas.  As the Oath referred to is no longer a part of the Constitution, the section mentioned has ceased to operate and <Col N="1875" /> the present Bill provides for the commencement of payment of the allowances and travelling expenses to members of the Oireachtas elected after the passing of the Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act, 1933.  In the case of a member elected to Dáil Eireann at a general election, Section 2 of the Bill provides that the allowance and travelling facilities shall be payable as from the date on which the Oireachtas is summoned to meet, subject, of course, to prior compliance by members with the Standing Orders of the Dáil.  In every other case, payment is to commence as from the date of compliance with the Standing Orders of Dáil Eireann or Seanad Eireann. Sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Bill follows the lines of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the 1923 Act.  In sub-section (2) of Section 3 provision is made for the first time for the payment of expenses incurred by a member of the Oireachtas when travelling to Dublin for the purpose of complying with Standing Orders, on a date prior to the date of such compliance.</P>
      <P>It has been felt that, in the case of members who have to come a long distance in order to comply with the requirements of the Standing Orders, it was a hardship to deny them their travelling facilities in respect of a journey which was essential if they were to fulfil their functions as members of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 (3) of the Bill follows the lines of Section 5 (3) of the 1925 Act. Section 5 of the Bill provides for the payment of the allowance and travelling expenses to a Deputy elected during the period between the passing of the Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act, 1932, and the passage of this Bill into law.  As the House is no doubt aware, during that period a by-election took place for the constituency of Dublin University.  This Bill will enable the statutory allowance to be paid to the member of the Dáil who was elected as a result of that by-election. There will be little or no additional cost to the Exchequer as a result of the Bill.  The grant under Section 3 (2) of the Bill of travelling expenses from a date prior to the date <Col N="1876" /> of the actual compliance with the Standing Orders, while it will entail some additional expenditure, will be offset, wholly or partly, by the saving in consequence of the payment of the allowance, in the case of a member elected at a general election, only from the date of the opening of the Dáil, instead of from the date of his taking the oath, which, in many cases, formerly was prior to the date of the actual opening of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 of the Bill reads:</P>
      <P>This Act shall be deemed to have come into operation on the passing of the Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act, 1933 (No. 6 of 1933), and shall have and be deemed always to have had effect as on and from the passing of that Act.</P>
      <P>It is an old adage that children must creep before they walk, but this legislative infant prodigy is going to jump hurdles several months before it is born.  I wonder if the Minister for Agriculture, in his enthusiasm for raising bloodstock, has been the inspiration for this particular Bill.  I should like to ask the Minister if he can give us any estimate of the number of further exorcisms which will be required before the ghost of the empty formula is finally laid.  I interrogated the Minister for Local Government some time ago in a similar way but he was unable to give any kind of definite reply save to say that, as the necessity for further implementing of the removal of the Oath arose, the Government would deal with it.</P>
      <P>This new game invented by the Government of chasing the Oath is likely to rival blind man's buff as a popular game for future generations. I have no doubt that at some date in the distant future some of the grandchildren of the Minister will be asking, &ldquo;Grandad, what did you do in the Great War?&rdquo;  And he will reply, &ldquo;I chased the Oath through the Seanad.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This game was started by the President some time ago.  He has, however, recently reverted to his favourite pastime of playing postman's knock with Mr. Thomas.  It was then continued, as I inferred a moment ago, <Col N="1877" /> by the Minister for Local Government. I am not quite sure whether the Minister for Lands and Fisheries indulged in the pastime or not.  Here we have the Minister for Finance to-day coming along, believe it or not, to indulge in another lap of this game of chasing the Oath through the Oireachtas.  I believe he will tell us that this is the final stage of this performance, the final triumph of the anti-Oath element in the State.  I think if he takes that view he is unjustifiably sanguine, unwarrantably optimistic.  I think no one who pays close attention to the implications of the Constitution and its provisions will agree with the Minister that this terminates the discussion of the Oath.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking on another Bill in the Dáil a few days ago, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been found time and time again that Bills passed through the legislative assembly with the intention of effecting certain changes in the law have been found subsequently to do nothing of the kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement, in a limited sense, might be applicable to these Bills dealing with the Oath, but only to a limited extent.  They have been passed with the intent, not of changing the law, because, as I shall argue in a moment, the present Government have never yet faced up to dealing with the fundamental law upon which these matters rest; but for the purpose of humbugging the people into the belief that they were changing the law.  They have done nothing of the kind.  They have neither changed the law nor humbugged that intelligent section of the people which understands what is afoot into believing that they have achieved what they have professed to do.</P>
    <P>This claim of the Government to have got rid of the Oath seems to me to be very questionable indeed.  The claim of the Government that they have got rid of the law dealing with the Oath is somewhat similar to the claim of the burglar that he has got rid of the law against theft when he ignores that law.  The law is still there, whether it is ignored or defied. This law dealing with the Oath is still <Col N="1878" /> part of the fundamental law of this State, whether the Government ignore it, defy it or attempt to nullify it.  The Treaty, including the Oath, is still the law of this State.</P>
    <P>I raised this point on the Second Stage of, I think, the Constitution (Amendment No. 21) Bill.  I argued the point, and the Minister in charge of the Bill&mdash;the Minister for Lands and Forestry&mdash;was either unable or unwilling to rebut my contention.  He remained silent on the point then and since.  If my contention be correct, there is a very serious and important issue involved and, possibly, an awkward constitutional impasse is being created by the procedure which the Government have seen fit to adopt. If the Treaty, including the Oath, still remains the law and that law prescribes certain procedure as requisite and essential to qualify persons to act as legislators in the Saorstát and to give validity to their acts as such, are the decisions which are made in the Oireachtas binding in law if the persons making them, or any of such persons making them, fail to comply with the procedure prescribed by the law to qualify them to act as legislators? If not, are not all the decisions of the Dáil, since a certain Deputy participated by vote in its proceedings who had failed to comply with these provisions, prescribed by law, lacking in validity?  That is an important matter.  It is a matter which may possibly involve the citizens of this State in serious constitutional difficulties. We should not lightheartedly assent to steps which may have that sequel.  I put that point of view forward, not because I consider that my opinions on legal or constitutional matters carry any great weight, but because I think it is a consideration which should not go unrecorded when such matters as this are being discussed by the Parliament of this State.  While I am not pressing my dissent from this proposal to a division&mdash;there are obvious reasons why it would be futile to do that&mdash;I want to have my dissent placed on the records of this House.  I want to make clear that, in my opinion, this Bill represents another phase of the continued <Col N="1879" /> effort of the Government, I shall not say to scrap the Treaty&mdash;they have not faced up to that yet&mdash;but to nullify the Treaty, to indulge in a species of bootlegging a Republic into the Saorstát under the protection and the prestige of the British Commonwealth. As such, I consider it represents an unmanly attitude.  It is a form of political subterfuge which is unworthy of any State and, especially, of a State whose spokesmen occasionally take upon themselves to lecture the world on how countries should be run.  I think that this Bill represents a step by the Government which should be resented, and I want my dissent placed on the records of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to call the attention of the Minister to a point that may be worthy of consideration.  The Constitution provides that the Oireachtas shall make provision for the payment of its members.  Article 20 of the Constitution says that each House shall make its own rules and standing orders.  Section 2 of this Bill makes the payment of allowances to members dependent upon compliance with the standing orders of each House.  A majority of a House may make standing orders in respect to its members which will have the effect of nullifying a statute.  That is to say, the statute itself, which is an Act of the Oireachtas as a whole, the Dáil and Seanad being the two Houses concerned, lays down that certain payments shall be made. Under this Bill, that provision might be nullified, in effect, by the action of one House in respect of its own members&mdash;that is to say, by the enactment of certain standing orders.  Those standing orders would, therefore, become more effective than, and superior to, an enactment of the Oireachtas. I should like if the Minister would look into that difficulty before the Bill comes before us again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the point made by Senator Johnson to be: that the allowance made to a member of the Oireachtas depends on his compliance with the standing orders of the House of which he is a member and that that House might make standing <Col N="1880" /> orders with which, for conscientious or other reasons, he could not comply; therefore, he would be unable to receive his allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, that is what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be something in that argument which would be worth looking into.  At the same time, I do not think you can deal with it in a Bill of this kind because the Constitution, rightly or wrongly, does give considerable latitude to each House in prescribing its own standing orders, even in respect of the right to sit in the House.  This Bill deals only with the payment of allowances.  Therefore, while you might provide that whether a man complies with the standing orders or not, he should get the allowance, that would not enable him to sit in the House if the House were to prescribe conditions which made it impossible for him conscientiously to do so.  I am afraid that this is one of those things which must be left to the good sense of the House itself.  I think that the Constitution was right in giving to each House that power over its members.  If, in the almost unthinkable eventuality, either House were to attempt to exclude a certain class of members by means of standing orders, the Oireachtas, as a whole, would have to use all those powers which it possibly could to remedy that, if necessary by amendment of the Constitution.  It is an interesting point, but I do not see how it can be dealt with under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Milroy, that is not a thing upon which anybody can give an authoritative opinion and it could only be decided by the courts.  I hope it will not be decided by the courts and that it will be left to the realm of External Affairs.  Whether the argument be sound or not-I am not expressing any opinion&mdash;it does not seem that there is any case for not passing this Bill.  Members will take their seats, and whether the existence of members who have not taken the Oath is to invalidate the law or not, the question as to whether those persons receive an allowance will not make <Col N="1881" /> any difference.  There is no question about it, this Bill ought to be passed as a natural corollary to the previous Acts.</P>

    <Title>Finance (Customs and Excise Duties) Bill, 1933 (Certified Money Bill)&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is necessary in order to confirm certain Financial Resolutions which were recently reported by the Dáil.  These number eight in all.  In addition, advantage has been taken of the occasion to make certain minor changes in the customs and excise laws which administrative experience has shown to be desirable.  As in the case of the Expiring Laws Bill, I suggest that a discussion on this Bill should take place on the Committee Stage. For the information of the House I propose to indicate briefly the purport of each section in the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 1, 2, 3 and 5 confirm Financial Resolutions, which, respectively, imposed duties on rose bushes, grass seeds, women's clothing and bottles.  In regard to women's <Col N="1883" /> clothing and bottles it should be said that no additional tariffs are being imposed, as the duties were previously in operation under Emergency Orders. The Emergency Orders in question have been revoked with effect as from 24th November, the date upon which the duties now sought to be confirmed by the Bill became chargeable by virtue of the Financial Resolution passed in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Section 4 covers the First Schedule and confirms the Financial Resolution which imposed or altered duties on a variety of articles such as bicycle hubs, under-axles, belts and belting, liquid driers and lamp shades.  Section 6 covers the Second Schedule, with the exception of Reference Nos. 3, 5, 6a and 6c, the provisions of which I propose to explain further.  The Schedule generally is in confirmation of Financial Resolution 4 passed by the Dáil. This Resolution related to duties on a variety of articles, including rubber boots, clothing and picture frames.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 3 of the Second Schedule provides for the amendment of Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1932, under which there is general power to issue licences for the free importation of dutiable goods where such goods are essential to a process of manufacture and are unlikely to be obtainable in Saorstát Eireann.  It has been represented that experience has shown that the expression &ldquo;process of manufacture&rdquo; is too rigid in its application and involves inequalities amongst industrial concerns.  It is proposed to provide power to construe the expression &ldquo;process of manufacture&rdquo; as including an industrial process and also industrial operation, whether of the nature of construction, assemblage, repairing or other similar nature.</P>
    <P>Reference No.  5 of the Second Schedule provides for the substitution of a wider licensing provision in respect to a number of dutiable articles in regard to which a restricted licensing power already exists.  It also provides for a licensing power for certain cast-iron articles for which no licence can at present be granted.  In these cases it has been represented that experience has shown that the <Col N="1884" /> existing licensing power is too rigid and that its limited nature has caused hardship and involved some manufacturers in outlay which it was not anticipated they would have to bear when the duties were first imposed.</P>
    <P>Reference 6a of the Second Schedule makes no change in the existing position, but it has been suggested by the Revenue Commissioners for the sake of clarity and to remove any doubts. Reference 6c in the Second Schedule provides for the insertion of a licensing clause in respect of certain articles made wholly or mainly of brass, bronze or gun-metal.  Sections 7 and 8 confirm Financial Resolutions making alterations in the taxation imposed on motor vehicles, and certain minor matters connected therewith.  Sections 9 and 10 propose to effect some changes in the law which administrative experience has shown to be necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 9 in particular brings the law as regards drawback and re-importation provisions in the case of woven tissues into the same state as it is in regard to other dutiable goods. Section 10 clears a doubt which has arisen.  It provides in regard to a resolution which has statutory effect by virtue of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 that the duty of customs chargeable by virtue of any such resolution shall be deemed to have been imposed by an Act so passed. Sections 11, 12 and 13 are characteristic of Finance Acts in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the fact pointed out by the Minister that much of the details of this Bill can best be discussed in Committee, there are one or two matters on which I would like to have more enlightenment because they affect the question whether an amendment should be put down and also the character of the amendment.  I do not know whether the Minister for Finance would be able to answer fully some of my questions with regard to Section 7.  He probably will.  The provisions of Section 7 seem to me to have been prepared rather hastily and I am not at all certain that they are not amendable.  They may, to some extent, defeat what is the <Col N="1885" /> object which the Government has in view.  I take it that the principal object is to try and encourage the assemblage of motor cars in this country and that it is considered by the Minister probable that certain American cars may possibly be assembled in this country.  I assume that the Minister recognises that while there are many reasons why American cars are suitable for this country and suitable for the roads in this country, they are manufactured in a country where taxation is completely on a different basis with regard to the technical horse power, which is so high as to make the rate of tax prohibitive here, certainly in the case of the lower priced cars.</P>
      <P>I am very much afraid that unless some amendment takes place in these provisions it will be very difficult indeed for, at any rate, some firms who would be anxious to take advantage of this, to take the matter up with the American manufacturers for whom they are agents.  I am very anxious to see whether some arrangement could not be made to clear this matter for agents engaged in the sale of cars here.  That is rendered difficult because of the arrangement of the sections.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister could tell me the meaning of the words &ldquo;to an extent for the time being approved by the said Minister.&rdquo;  I do not know what is the meaning of &ldquo;to an extent for the time being&rdquo; but I think I can explain the difficulty by giving a hypothetical case.  Those who know anything at all about the ordinary retail motor business know that in a very large number of cases the customer, though he may take months to bring himself to the point of buying a car, yet, once he buys it, wants to bring that car home at once and take his family out in it that evening.  He expects to take the car home that evening.  Those engaged in the trade say that their experience is that as the law stood they could find out whether the £16 tax was the tax that was to continue for a period.  But under this section as it stands the customer would have to find out the Minister's mind that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In putting forward this matter I am <Col N="1886" /> not trying to raise some points on the Bill, but there is here a serious difficulty. That is, as to whether for the time being the Minister would regard as an assemblage the putting together of certain parts, some of which would be partially assembled before they came over here.  I gather from the Minister's speech in introducing the Bill that certain partial assemblages which may be necessary now might not be necessary afterwards, and it may be possible later on to have the whole engine put together.  I take it his idea is that the complete engine might come in.  Would it not be possible to provide some method by which the certificate of the person assembling might be attached to the car, so that you could go and get your licence at £16 for the American car?  That is the difficulty.</P>
    <P>In the future this will certainly be hypothetical in the sale of cars, and I think there should be some provision which should provide to have that matter cleared up and not have the section reading: &ldquo;in respect of which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that such vehicle was assembled in Saorstát Eireann in a manner and to an extent for the time being approved of by the said Minister.&rdquo;  A certificate should be attached to the car in a prescribed form.  As the section stands now it is not workable.  You do not pay your tax to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, you pay it to the Department of Local Government and Public Health, and there must be some way by which you can produce a certificate.  I think that could be very easily provided for if this Bill were amended.</P>
    <P>There is another difficulty which seems to me more serious still.  It certainly is not made clear in Section 7. This, again, bears upon the meaning of the words &ldquo;for the time being.&rdquo; Assuming for the sake of argument that a car is assembled and that, in the opinion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the tax will be put at £16.  Now most people expect a car to last for several years. Assume that they are getting a car of 26, 28 or 30 horse-power and assume that they want to buy that car because <Col N="1887" /> they know that the tax will be £16. They want an assurance that the licence on the car the following year and the year after will be £16.</P>
    <P>If an engine and a complete body shell are to be regarded as parts it need not be completely assembled here.  That is the Minister's point of view at the moment, but I think in twelve months' time there is a possibility that the Minister would view it on a changed basis as to what is &ldquo;assemblage&rdquo; in the case of a particular car.  It may be that what may now be regarded as an assembled car would cease to be regarded as such. The question is, will the car in a year or two years' time come within the 26, 28 or the 30 horse-power?  I doubt if it will.  I doubt if that is what is intended.  It should be a car which at the time of assembly complied with the regulations.</P>
    <P>Another point in connection with that is that agents for American manufacturers are anxious to see if it is not possible to take some advantage of the section to do that and to do it fairly as between the different manufacturers. I think it would be necessary for the Minister to make an order, amendable, of course, by a further order which would set out what is an &ldquo;assemblage.&rdquo; The agent here could then send that order to the manufacturer in America and say: &ldquo;If you are prepared to comply with that and allow your parts to be assembled here, then your customers will get the benefit of the £16 tax.&rdquo;  There would, unless this were done, be a serious disadvantage with regard to the tax.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if it is only something that is to come and you have to negotiate with the Minister for the time being, and if the thing is liable to sudden change, there would not be the same attractiveness from the point of view of the American manufacturer. There will still be a considerable uncertainty and, what is more serious still, there will be an extreme difficulty in the case of the agent ascertaining the exact provision.  I would like to know the Minister's attitude towards an alteration in this section which would provide that the tax would be <Col N="1888" /> payable on a certificate by the actual assembler.</P>
    <P>In another section it is provided that the word &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; can mean an &ldquo;assembler.&rdquo;  At any rate the tax should be paid on a certificate attached to the car, the certificate to be signed by the assembler, and secondly the Minister should make an order providing what was to be regarded as an assemblage at that time.  It would then be a very easy thing for the assembler to give a certificate that such and such a car was assembled in accordance with that order.  It is a matter that could be tested.  If that order was changed in 12 months' time, which I think the Minister has in mind, then it would be quite easy to go back a year and see if a car made in 1933-34 complied with the assemblage order in that year.  I think it is essential, if this is to work, that a car which qualifies now for the £16 tax should remain for the life of that car subject to that rate of tax.  If it is going to be affected by a later order, which will restrict the amount of assemblage that can take place, then it will defeat its object.  I raise these matters because I think the Minister may be able to tell us what is really the policy of the Government. If I knew that, it would be much easier for me to frame amendments along the lines I have in mind.</P>
    <P>Section 8 raises another matter which I think is not very clear as the section stands.  It provides a very heavy penalty for a person who, having taxed his car at, we will say, the £10 rate uses it for another purpose which would render it subject to the £15 or £16 a year rate.  I agree that where that is deliberate, or where there is any attempt at fraud, the penalty is not the tiniest little bit too high, but where it is a <i>bona fide</i> case due either to a misunderstanding or to extreme difficulty in understanding what the law is, I think the penalty is too high.  I think, too, that it should be a maximum penalty.  I think I am correct in stating that in the case of customs and excise penalties, they are penalties which cannot be reduced by the court. They are fixed penalties.  In that case, I think the penalty prescribed here is far too high.  If, for the sake of <Col N="1889" /> argument, a taxi-driver were, for instance, to take his family out on a Sunday evening and not charge them for the run, he would be rendering himself liable to the higher rate and to the penalty laid down here.  That, I think, would be grossly unfair.</P>
    <P>There is another class of case in which very considerable difficulty arises.  When the difficulty was put to me I was not able to deal with it, but I know of two or three cases where this particular difficulty has arisen.  It is the case of where a private car is used occasionally for the bringing, say, of garden produce to market.  That may happen ten or 12 times in the year, but it is not the usual use to which the car is put.  A case was taken to the court some time ago and dismissed.  I am not sure whether it was taken any further.  I am not quite satisfied as to what the position is in regard to a case of that kind, but I think that where there are doubts of that kind the penalty provided here is too high.  I think the section should either provide that where a person knowingly does so and so, the penalty would be as laid down, or that this should be a maximum penalty, so that the court would have power to deal with the circumstances of particular cases.  The section provides that a person found guilty of an offence under it shall &ldquo;be liable on summary conviction thereof to an excise penalty of whichever of the following sums is the greater, that is to say, £20 or three times the difference.&rdquo;  I think I am correct in stating that in such a case the court will have no option but to impose the minimum penalty laid down.  If the Minister is able to satisfy me on the points I have raised, it may not be necessary for me to put down any amendment for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I would be glad, when the Minister is replying, if he would inform me as to the exact position with regard to imperial preference under Schedule 2, Reference No. 2.  There you have certain minimum duties substituted in certain cases for the existing duties. You either pay the existing duty or the minimum duty, whichever is the higher. The existing duties, in every case, were subject to one-third British preference <Col N="1890" /> and what I want to know is, does the one-third British preference clearly and beyond question apply to the minimum duties?  If the minimum duty here is 10/-, will the duty for British goods be 6/8?  I think I am correct in stating that when these minimum duties first came into force it was held that the British preference did not apply: that it was the minimum duties, irrespective of whether the goods were subject to British preference or not, that did apply, but that after some weeks the Revenue Commissioners changed their minds.  I think the position now is that in the case of certain of these duties the British preference is being applied. There is a doubt in the matter.  I think it is correct to state that the British preference was not applied for some six weeks or so, but that it is now being applied: that it is now held that where the minimum duty is 10/-, it is 6/8 for goods if the certificate shows that they have been produced within the British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>This matter is causing some doubt outside, though I think one can be positive in stating that it is now held by the Revenue Commissioners that the British preference applies.  The difficulty here is that these are all Acts by reference.  When I looked up Reference No. 2, I discovered that it was an amendment to a section in another Act, and that the other Act provided for the British preference.  It would be of the greatest possible convenience to traders if the Government would reduce the number of alterations in the tariff law which are expressed in terms of reference to other Acts. The Financial Resolutions which are introduced in the Dáil are nearly always in the same form.  I do not remember one single case in which any of the three newspapers published here got the duties correctly in the first instance.  That has caused a great deal of chaos, due almost entirely to the fact that the Resolutions which, of course, must be secret until they are introduced into the Dáil, are rushed off in a great hurry to the Press.  Someone in a newspaper office hastily looks up the eight Acts that have been amended, so that as a result something is bound to go wrong in a newspaper <Col N="1891" /> office with unsatisfactory results so far as traders and others are concerned. One result is that very often you get attempts at hasty buying of goods in stock, due to a mistaken impression got either by a manufacturer or a trader from the Resolution as published, and secondly, prices are marked wrongly owing to the uncertainty that prevails.  I know that the best Government in the world, and even the present Minister for Finance would hardly claim that for his Government&mdash; I am sure he would not expect me to believe it in any case&mdash;could not avoid uncertainty in the matter of tariffs, but when you put a duty on an article, weeks must elapse before the officials can decide exactly what that article means.  When you include, as you do in certain of these minimum duties, a phrase such as this: &ldquo;goods of the nature of certain articles&rdquo;, well, you are asking for trouble straight off.  I think very little harm would have been done by waiting a week longer and referring the matter to the officials at the Castle, so that the use of phrases such as I have mentioned could be avoided altogether.  As it is, anomalies are inevitable.  I had a case myself in which I am not quite sure whether the correct duty was or was not paid. It was a case in which a certain quality of wool was imported by my firm.  The English firm, in the kindness of their hearts, thought fit to include three very small window tickets which were invoiced as free.  They were value for about ½d. each, but these were held to be &ldquo;printed matter,&rdquo; so that we had to pay the minimum duty of half-a-crown. Probably we shall take steps to warn that firm not to make any more free gifts of that kind to us, as they prove rather too expensive.  That is the kind of anomaly I have in mind. I am not grumbling at that kind of thing, because to a very large extent it is unavoidable.  I think, however, that things of that kind could be avoided if the Government were a little more explicit in the definitions.  I think if a week or ten days were allowed to the experts at the Castle to prepare explicit definitions it would save people a great deal of trouble and, <Col N="1892" /> incidentally, a great amount of expense.</P>

      <P>The farmers in my part of the country&mdash;I do not know so much about other places&mdash;object to this duty of 2/- per cwt. on grass seeds. The farmers, before the pressing disabilities which they now suffer came upon them, were very anxious to secure the best permanent pasture that they could procure.  They had to buy seeds and they were always anxious to get the greatest variety calculated to give them good pasture.  I do not deny that good seeds came from the North. But our friends in the North were not able to supply all our requirements. There was considerable demand for grass seeds and much of them had to be imported.  To a person who is not a farmer 2/- per cwt. may seem small, but with all the penalties and difficulties that are pressing on the farmer at the present time anything in the nature of an increase in what he has to buy is a serious matter for him. Unless we can be assured that we can get all the grass seeds we require and that they can be produced in this country there is an objection to a tariff upon the importation of grass seeds.  We do not save our own grass seeds in the South; we buy them as we require them.  In a tillage country the farmer has to buy a very large amount of seeds and they are a very costly item in his expenditure.  I would like to call the attention of the Minister to that matter.</P>

      <P>The points raised by Senator Douglas refer to Section 7 of the Bill.  I should like to say, on the matter of the certificate, that it seems to me that the proper person to give a certificate would be the Minister for Industry and Commerce.

      <P>I mean rather the county councils and local authorities. I think the Senator was rather unduly apprehensive of the manner in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce would operate his powers under the section.  I take it that in fact he will follow the procedure suggested by Senator Douglas, that is to say, he will issue orders from time to time stating the amount of work on the car that he requires to be done in this country before it would be eligible for the concession. I am certain that that order would provide that it was only in respect of cars assembled after that date that the requirements specified in the Minister's order would apply.  I cannot conceive that a concession having been granted in respect to any specific car would be withdrawn by subsequent order.</P>

      <P>I conceive that on the section as worded that might possibly arise, but that would be a breach of faith that no Minister would be guilty of.  Possibly the Senator might wish to have some stronger safeguards than that.  I would not like that the passage of this Bill into law should be unduly delayed, because we are anxious that the road taxing authorities should be in a position to give the concession as from the first day of the year.  While I am not in a position to give any undertaking on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I would press the Senator that he should take the opportunity, on the main Finance Bill for next year, to provide for a more definite procedure for the administration of this concession than is set out here.  If the Senator would require something more, then I suggest he should press the Minister, who will be here during the Committee Stage of the Bill, with a view to getting from him an undertaking such as I have indicated.</P>

      <Col N="1894" /> On the question of the British preference as it applies, I think, to Item 2 of the Second Schedule, I would like to point out that it is purely an anti-dumping provision and that the imposition of the duty was not directed against manufacturers in Great Britain; and accordingly the point whether there is or is not a British preference is of very little practical importance.  Owing to the form in which the Resolution was drafted British preference has not in fact been changed.  There is no departure from the imperial preference offered formerly to goods manufactured in Great Britain in the Resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the School Meals (Gaeltacht) Act, 1930, so as to secure that as far as possible the sum of £10,000 provided by the Oireachtas under that Act will be available for the recoupment of those local authorities which have shown the greatest readiness to apply the Act to the fullest extent to their districts.  As the members of the Seanad are doubtless aware, the School Meals (Gaeltacht) Act, 1930, authorises certain boards of health to provide meals for children attending schools in portions of the Gaeltacht scheduled under the Act. The expenditure incurred by these authorities from the rates for the provision of food for such meals is recoupable from a State Grant to the extent of one-half.  The Act of 1930, however, provides that the aggregate recoupment from the State Grant to all these local authorities in respect of any financial year shall not exceed a sum of £10,000.  In order to apply this overriding maximum of recoupment to each local authority concerned, it is necessary in pursuance of the Act to allocate this £10,000 between the districts of these authorities in proportion to the average annual school attendances in the areas scheduled under the Act in each district.  The effect of this allocation is to earmark a fixed portion of the £10,000 to each such district as the maximum amount of recoupment which can be paid in respect of a financial year to the local authority at the usual rate of 50 per cent. on their expenditure. In illustration of this, I might point out that if the amount earmarked from the £10,000 to a local authority were £2,000, and the local authority spent during a financial year not more than £4,000 on the provision of food for school meals, the recoupment payable <Col N="1896" /> to such authority would be one-half of the actual amount expended. If, however, the amount spent by the local authority exceeded £4,000 the recoupment payable would only be the fixed amount of £2,000 no matter how much was expended in excess of £4,000.</P>
      <P>The local authorities administering the Act are the boards of health in Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, and Mayo counties.  Some of these boards have shown great readiness in availing of the provisions of the Act to the fullest extent while others are not inclined to levy a sufficient rate to earn the full amount of the State Grant earmarked for their districts.  In Galway County, on account of the poverty of the inhabitants in the scheduled areas in Connemara, the board of health have found it necessary to provide school meals during the entire school year, winter and summer.  Moreover, the average cost of the meals in that county is increased by the fact that the schools are smaller and more widely scattered than elsewhere.  In addition there is greater difficulty in obtaining supplies locally and the cost of transport is higher.  The Galway Board of Health, have, therefore, been obliged by these circumstances to incur expenditure in excess of the amount for which they could receive 50 per cent.  recoupment from the amount of the State Grant allocated to their district.  The amount allocated to that district from the Grant of £10,000, in respect of the year 1932-3, was £2,451 8s.  10d., whereas during that year the board expended on the provision of food in school meals £7,199 13s. 9d., which at the usual rate of 50 per cent. recoupment would entitle them to a reimbursement of £3,599 16s. 10d.  But the maximum recoupment available, as above shown, was £2,451 8s 10d., which left the board with a deficiency of £1,148 8s. in respect of recoupment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, the Donegal Board of Health have declined to expend more than the proceeds of a rate of approximately 1½d. in the £. on the provision of school meals in their district, and in the year 1932-3 their total expenditure for the purpose was £3,205 8s. 11d. in respect of which <Col N="1897" /> they received £1,602 14s. 5d. as recoupment. The amount earmarked for their district from the State Grant of £10,000 was £3,423 3s. 7d., so that the balance of £1,820 9s. 2d. was returned to the Exchequer as unexpended. Small surpluses were also returned from the Cork, Mayo and Kerry districts, so that in respect of the year 1932-3 a total unexpended balance of £2,628 4s. 0d. out of the grant of £10,000 was returned to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The aim of the present Bill is to ensure that such unexpended balances may be made available to meet any deficiency in recoupment from the State Grant in a district in which the local authority has incurred the necessary expenditure to give full effect to the provisions of the Act of 1930.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary for me to refer to the benefits conferred by a hot school meal on children who have to travel long distances on foot in all seasons to attend school.  School managers and teachers generally have shown their appreciation of these meals, and it is only through their willing cooperation that the arrangements can be successfully carried out.  County medical officers of health, as a result of medical inspection of the school children, have testified to the favourable effect of the school meals on the health and physical development of those children.  It is, therefore, only fitting that local authorities who are willing to expend their money in promoting these arrangements should be encouraged by receiving their due measure of recoupment from the State Grant.</P>

      <P>I wish to support this Bill.  I think the Bill is very desirable from a public health point of view as well as from an educational point of view.  School meals for school children have been permissible for the last nineteen years.  I think that the first Act was in 1914 and that it was extended in 1916 and 1917, but this Act, which gives a Government Grant, and which has been in existence now for two or three years, has not been fully availed of.  I think that what the Parliamentary Secretary suggests might be very desirable in inducing those local authorities which <Col N="1898" /> have not spent to the full extent to go further and to expend it rather than see the portion of the grant which would be available for them going to some other local authority.  For that reason I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill.</P>

      <P>On this Bill I want to deal, in the first place, with exclusive fishery rights. It is accepted internationally that exclusive fisheries extend to a limit of three miles from the coast all round and also within a point not measuring ten miles across.  The position, however, although generally recognised, has been a matter of consideration by a committee appointed by the League of Nations, which has not yet come to any conclusion with regard to alteration of those limits.  A Convention was agreed to at The Hague in 1882, and it was subsequently ratified by an Act which went through the British Parliament.  Practically all countries bordering on the North Sea, and all countries that we have to deal with, which trawl in our waters, were parties to that Convention, so that until some further agreement is reached by the League of Nations we can rely on the three-mile limit as the basis of legislation here.  In order to deal with foreign trawlers we had, up to the present, to rely on the Act of 1883.  That Act was brought in to implement the Hague agreement of 1882.  The penalties for infringement of the Act were very small.  That was our trouble.  The penalties were £10 for the first offence, and £20 for a subsequent offence.  It was found by the Fisheries Department that it paid foreign trawlers very well to infringe the law and to pay the penalties because they were so small.  Acts have been passed dealing with trawling. The Principal Act was passed in 1889, <Col N="1899" /> and was amended two years afterwards by another Act, imposing penalties of £5 for a breach of the by-laws.  As that penalty was quite insufficient to deter steam vessels from trawling in prohibited areas the amount was increased to £100.  That Act gave power to serve a summons on the owner of a trawler within the then United Kingdom.  The Act has been practically inoperative since 1923, because the Free State Government has no power to serve a summons on the owner of a British steam trawler, and has no jurisdiction to serve a summons within the United Kingdom.  As these are the principal difficulties we have been up against, this Bill has been introduced to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes severe penalties, whether the offender is registered in the Saorstát or outside the Saorstát, whether caught fishing in waters within the three-mile limit, or hovering in these waters, unless hovering there for a legitimate purpose.  There is an international understanding that foreign vessels can call to a port for shelter in bad weather, or for repairs, or in case of sickness on board, and matters of that kind.  Of course, these matters will be exempted under this Bill.  We are taking power, however, to see that when they have done their business they must leave, and not hover around. The penalty for a first offence in the case of a vessel hovering within forbidden waters is £50, and for a subsequent offence £100.  In addition, if there is fishing gear found on board it can be forfeited.  Under the Bill the Minister is empowered to make by-laws under which it is forbidden to use in the area specified in the by-laws trawl nets, seine nets, or other prohibited nets that can be hauled along the sea floor by boats of a class to be specified.  The principal class of vessels to which the by-laws will apply are those driven by mechanical power, coal, oil or electricity.  Some of the by-laws, of course, only refer to steam trawlers, so that new vessels driven by oil or by electricity do not come within the definition of previous legislation. The penalty for a first offence for trawling is £200, and it is increased to <Col N="1900" /> £500 for a subsequent offence.  The fishing gear will be forfeited and, in the case of a third offence, where we have the same owner in the three cases, the vessel itself can be forfeited.  These penalties are to apply to vessels whether owned by Saorstát citizens or owned by people outside the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be enforced by Saorstát sea officers and, as will be seen, these will be composed of the Gárda Síochána, of appointed officers of the Defence Forces, officers taken from the Department of Industry and Commerce, and officers from the Fisheries Department.  These officers will be invested with very full powers with regard to the right of search, the right to examine and interrogate persons on board, the right to examine all documents, log books, etc., and the right to bring a vessel to port, in case they are not satisfied with the explanation given.  They can also pursue a vessel which is caught fishing within the limit. Of course, a vessel may, within a few minutes, put herself outside the limit when pursued, but under this Bill our patrol vessels will be able to pursue the offending vessel as far as is necessary in order to capture her.  They may arrest and bring the vessel back to port.  Powers are also taken in the Bill with regard to detention.  A boat may be detained until the case is tried by the District Court and, in case a fine is inflicted, may be detained until it is paid.  If there is an appeal to a higher court the boat may be detained until satisfactory sureties are offered for the appearance of the accused at the higher court.  There is also power to forfeit the vessel if the fine is not paid.</P>
    <P>Another matter dealt with concerns some foreign trawlers that are in the habit of dimming their lights at night, so that they cannot be identified, or of covering the number plates and identification marks by day, by hanging tarpaulin or something over them, so that they cannot be identified unless pursued.  There will be heavy penalties for such offences.  Of course, that is an offence in itself under the Merchant Shipping Acts.  These Acts apply to British vessels and the matter can be taken up, but if they do not come <Col N="1901" /> under the Merchant Shipping Acts foreign vessels may be taken up and fined for attempting to obliterate the identification marks.  These are the principal matters dealt with.  The Bill has been brought in to protect the rights of our own fishermen in the in-shore fisheries, and I have no doubt that every member of this House will be in favour of it.  If any suggestions can be made towards improving the Bill we will be only too glad to consider them.</P>

      <P>I wish to welcome this Bill.  I live near the sea and I am very intimate with numbers of fisher men around the coast.  I have always been in sympathy with their hard lot. I hope the full penalties will be enforced on people who are caught trawling.  We have a great deal of trouble with them off the coast.  The lobster fisheries off Wexford are very valuable, but they have been seriously hampered by trawlers.  For that reason I hope when these people are caught they will be severely dealt with.  The Sea Fisheries Act, which was passed by the former Government, did a great deal to help the fishing industry, and I hope that this Bill will do still more.  There is a great hindrance to the industry still because there are heavy tariffs against fish sent across the Channel.  As we sell practically all our lobsters in England the heavy tariff there has caused greater loss than was caused previously by the trawlers.  Until that is removed, there will not be very great prosperity amongst the lobster fishers, at any rate, so that this Bill, I am afraid, will not help them to the extent that we would like.  The trawlers have been particularly busy off the Saltee Islands and during the lobster fishing season, incidents have happened there which might astonish the House if they were related.  I think I mentioned on a former occasion that the French trawlers added insult to injury by going on the island and killing the birds there which are preserved by law and using them for bait in the lobster pots.  On one occasion, when the Muirchu caught a trawler, the Guards from the Kilmore Quay station went out and seized the <Col N="1902" /> French lobster pots and found in them the bodies of the birds.  We then knew that they had been going on to the islands and taking the birds.  I am rather doubtful as to the powers of the boats to catch the trawlers. That has been the difficulty.  We have no means of catching them and I am afraid that the patrol boats will not be able to do it.  However, I hope that things will improve under this Bill and I welcome it very sincerely. It is not often that I have a word of praise for the Minister for Agriculture, but I welcome this Bill and I hope it will improve the lot of the fishermen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>The sea fisheries, 30 or 40 years ago, were a tremendous source of revenue to the country and they have been steadily becoming extinct.  I think that a sum of £9,000 on an expenditure such as the Free State has is contemptible to deal with such an industry as that with which we are dealing here to-day.  No later than less than a year ago, I was standing at a point between Ballycotton Island and Roche's Point, a stretch of the coast of, say, 10 miles, and I counted eight trawlers, not one of them, I should say, outside the three-mile limit.  What I should like the Minister to explain is, if I were a Guard officer, how I could catch those eight trawlers?  On that occasion, I motored on to Ballycotton and one of those trawlers came into Ballycotton and loaded up with fresh vegetables and milk&mdash;a perfectly legitimate thing and desirable, I should say, from our point of view&mdash;but so far as I could see, a Guard officer had no opportunity, unless they came in after trawling, of catching them.  I think it would not be very expensive for the Department to establish patrols at, say, the places at which we have at present lifeboat stations.  It would amount to a very small sum of money and I am firmly convinced&mdash;when I say <Col N="1903" /> that I am firmly convinced, I mean that all the fisher people around the coast are firmly convinced&mdash;that the cause of the decline in fishing is this power trawling that has been going on immediately inside our headlands, and I would suggest that the Minister ought to spend liberally to prevent this happening.</P>
      <P>Another thing to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention is that there is apparently no control over the lobsters that are taken and I think that it will be found that nearly half the lobsters on sale are generally those that are about to spawn.  I think that that fact is a serious obstacle to the possibility of having a large number of lobsters.  In other countries&mdash;America, I believe&mdash;they go to the extent of having lobster hatcheries.  Whether that is an advantage or not, I am not prepared to say, but I should be very glad to know if the Department has examined the possibility of having lobster hatcheries around the coast.  The same thing applies to oysters.  Of course, the French are really the greatest experts in fishing in the world and they spend enormous sums of money.  At Arcachon, they have oyster beds that are famous all over the world and the result is that they produce oysters that are perfectly free of all traces of typhoid fever and other diseases.  They supply practically all France with those oysters.  I am not expert enough to say whether an oyster bed can be planted but I have no doubt in the world that when we have such places as Galway Bay, Kenmare River and places around Cork such as Oysterhaven, it would be very easy to reestablish this most profitable and valuable industry.  I make these suggestions to the Minister and I think that the fishing folk are entitled, at his hands, to have a very thorough investigation of the possibilities I have suggested.</P>

      <P>I think this is a very good Bill and a very necessary Bill, and I rise only to reinforce the remarks of the last two speakers and to urge on the Minister <Col N="1904" /> that while the publication of a piece of paper like this and the giving of these particular powers to officers in the Free State are most excellent, we would like to be assured that there will be the means of enforcing what is contained in this Bill.  We believe at the present moment, that the means are not there, and whatever protection vessels there are at the moment&mdash;and I believe there are very few of them and only one big one&mdash;I think it is essential that the Department should consider spending more money in increasing the number of fast vessels by purchase, or in some other way which would make this Bill an actuality and not simply a piece of paper on our statute book.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question raised by Senator Crosbie, I stated that the cost of the Fishery Department was £9,000.  That is the administrative cost, but in addition to that, there is a sum of £60,000 voted annually to the Sea Fisheries Association for the development of fisheries. I thought that the Senator wanted to know what the Department was costing in officials.  The Muirchu costs about £8,000 as well, so that there is more being spent on the development of fisheries than the figure I gave would lead one to believe.  We are voting £60,000 a year now to the Sea Fisheries Association.  With regard to the matter of having more patrol boats, I think it is the view of those who know most about the fisheries that it requires boats of the type of the Muirchu to deal with these trawlers.  I think Senator Miss Browne is right when she says that small motor boats would not be very effective, but it is rather difficult to justify getting more boats of that type in view of the size of the industry we have here.  The actual cost of another boat like the Muirchu would be about £40,000, and the total output of the fishing industry is only about £75,000.  So that taking those figures&mdash; £9,000 for administration, £8,000 for the Muirchu, £60,000 for the development of fisheries&mdash;in an industry worth £75,000, it would appear that we are spending as much as can be justified.  If things were looking better in the fishing industry, however, I <Col N="1905" /> think we in the Fisheries Department would make an attempt to get more money for protection.  It is quite possible they may improve as times go on. The big difficulty about the fisheries is that it is the herring and the mackerel fisheries that have principally gone down.  They are not, of course, so much affected by trawlers, but the world market for these two kinds of fish has gone down very much.  Russia, Germany, the United States and some of the bigger countries which took big supplies of herring and mackerel from us are now supplying themselves, and they do not want ours any longer.  It would appear now as if the herring and mackerel fisheries are gone, with very little hope of reviving them unless there is a change in conditions in the big world markets.</P>
      <P>Senator Crosbie referred to lobsters. We have only power, under present legislation, to deal with the size of the lobsters that can be marketed.  We can prevent the marketing of small lobsters, but we cannot stop the marketing of spawning lobsters.  There is a Bill at present under consideration dealing with the matter, and I promise the Senator to look into the matter to see if that Bill can be brought forward at an early date.  Of course there is no lobster fishing at the moment.  The matter of oysters was also raised by Senator Crosbie.  The Department is doing some little bit for the oyster fisheries in the Lee at present, but there appears to be a plague amongst oysters here, in Great Britain and in other places at present.  They are not increasing, and until we get at the bottom of the trouble, it does not appear that we can get the oyster fisheries back to their former position. The trouble has not been cleared up at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other question raised was whether this Bill would do any good. I think this is the right end to start at, to take powers to deal with the trawlers.  We have, for instance, taken power whereby even a small boat may go out, identify one of the trawlers and report the matter.  Then within the following four or five weeks the Muirchu may come along and take that boat into custody, make the necessary charges and have these very severe penalties inflicted.  We depend <Col N="1906" /> to a great extent on the very severe penalties, and I think if we can catch out a few of these trawlers, and get these very severe penalties inflicted, that it will terrorise other offenders into obeying the law.  If that is not sufficient we must, of course, consider the acquisition of other boats of the type of the Muirchu.</P>

    <P>Question: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amending Bill to the Cereals Act of 1933.  It amends the Act in four respects.  Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 are merely definitions. Sections 6 and 7 deal with the problem that has arisen of the small mills. Those who took a keen interest in the Principal Act will know that a licensed flour mill had amongst other things to mill a certain quota and if the quota were not filled, the mill was subject to a fine of £25 for the first offence and £50 for a subsequent offence.  We had also a provision in the Principal Act for permitted mills. By permitted mills were meant mills that milled on commission throughout the country and also milled wheat for farmers' use.  In practice we find that there are a number of mills that both import a certain amount of foreign wheat to mill for sale and also mill on commission.  The principal business of these small mills is to mill on commission but at times perhaps they import say 100 barrels of foreign wheat and mill it for sale.  They have a very poor idea of the amount that they might be able to dispose of in the year and they are very badly circumstanced to pay a fine of £25 for the first offence or £50 for the subsequent offence of giving a wrong estimate of what their powers in that respect might be.  We propose under Sections 6 and 7 to exempt those mills which mill under 1,000 barrels of wheat in the year from the penalties for disobeying the quota.  In that way they will be quite free to carry on as before, milling on commission for farmers and milling a small amount of wheat also for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1907" /> Section 8 deals with the case of farmers, wheat growers, who did not register in time.  In the Principal Act it is laid down that every farmer must register as a wheat grower before 1st May in order to be eligible for the bounty or subsidy when the wheat of that particular year is sold.  The Bill had not passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas until fairly late in the session and the farmers claimed that they had not got a sufficient warning of the date when registration was due.  The result is that we had quite a number of applications coming in late.  We think that it would be a great hardship on those farmers, particularly in the first year, to penalise them to the extent of 6/- or 7/- per barrel because they had not obeyed this particular regulation.  We had about 8,000 growers registered up to the 1st July.  Since that 2,000 further applications came in.  We may take it therefore that practically one-third of the growers would be excluded from the bounty if this amendment were not brought in.  We are only making the amendment for this year.  In future years the date 1st May will have to be insisted on because it is very difficult to work a scheme like this in the Department if we have not got sufficient data early in the year to calculate the acreage so as to be able to fix the national percentage and the total quota for the year.  As, however, this year the number affected is very large comparatively we can allow them to come in up to 16th December, as is provided here.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with another matter that has arisen.  It deals with a matter that was somewhat involved perhaps or overlapping in the Principal Act. The principle underlying the cereals legislation with regard to wheat was that no bounty would be paid except for wheat used for human consumption. It has been found in practice that, if a person is registered as a dealer and also, say, as a maize miller, he could, under the Act, pass some wheat on which the bounty is payable into his own maize mill and have it mixed with maize for animal feeding. That is a thing that we would like to <Col N="1908" /> have amended, because, having paid the bounty on the wheat, we would like to have it used for human food only.  Section 9 brings in the necessary amendment.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with seeds. It is desirable, of course, to give power to wheat dealers and flour millers to sell the best samples of wheat which they get as seed.  The dealers and flour millers buy their wheat in the open market at more or less the same price.  They have this year adopted the principle in most cases of buying on the bushel.  Most of the millers gave a fixed price of 17/6 for a 62 lbs. bushel.  In some cases, they gave 2d. less for one pound bushel downwards and 2d. more for one pound bushel upwards.  The people from whom they buy the wheat get the bounty.  They could easily, as the Act stands, sell that wheat as seed and they would naturally charge the same for that seed as the ordinary seed merchant could afford to sell it at.  The ordinary seed merchant has either to import the wheat or buy it from the farmer.  He has to buy it from the farmer knowing that the farmer cannot get the bounty.  The ordinary seed merchant, therefore, could not afford to sell the wheat at less than 23/6 a barrel.  This would give a very unfair advantage to the flour miller or wheat dealer in regard to the seed if we left the Act as it is.  It would enable them either to undersell the the seed merchant by 6/- or 7/- a barrel or sell at the same price and make a profit of 6/- or 7/- a barrel more than the seed merchant.  We propose to give the registered dealers and flour millers power to sell the seed but for the seed they sell they must refund to the Minister for Finance the amount of bounty paid. They will then be paying say 23/6 for the wheat the same as the seed merchant. They will be on the same level and the State will get something out of it to which it is entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any check on the amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, they must make returns of the amount sold for seed. That will be already in the regulations. <Col N="1909" /> They must account for how they dispose of all the wheat they buy. Some goes to the flour miller, some may go to another dealer, some may go to the distiller and some, anyhow, will go for seed.  It will all be accounted for, and we will be able to trace it in all cases.  There was one other danger as things stood, and that was where a dealer buys wheat from a farmer say at 16/- or 17/-.  He knows the farmer is going to get the bounty. He could re-sell that wheat to another farmer for seed, say, at 18/-.  That farmer could re-sell the wheat to the dealer again, say, for 16/-, because he would get the bounty.  The same parcel of wheat might go backwards and forwards several times at the expense of the State with neither the dealer nor the farmer losing.  Even though we have fairly honest people in this country, both farmers and dealers, we would like to remove the temptation that there is for trading of that sort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not rise to criticise the Bill.  I am satisfied that the Bill is reasonable and that every section is necessary.  It is quite understandable, when a new scheme of this sort is introduced, that there would be some little snags in it.  I think the scheme will now be quite workable. The whole wheat-growing scheme this year has been fairly successful. Practically all the wheat grown has been millable wheat, and the farmers are getting a price that I think they consider pays them, namely 23/6.  The Minister has been very fortunate in having an exceptionally good year.  In a normal year we would not have nearly as much millable wheat.  I have seen samples this year from the poorer counties, like Cavan and Monaghan, and it is not millable.  We can picture what that wheat would be if we had a season such as we had two or three years ago.  It would mean that not an acre grown in these districts would be millable.  It all boils down to this: that we can grow wheat in the Free State in what I might describe as the barley counties.  Outside of them, I am afraid that in a normal year, if we get back to the kind of years we had four or five years ago, when we had <Col N="1910" /> a wet back-end, they will not be able to grow millable wheat which will keep, because the wheat will be two or three weeks more in coming to maturity than in the barley-growing areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of mixing with maize, I thought the Minister would deal with that.  Does he propose to do anything with regard to helping the market for oats?  He has fixed a quota of 33? per cent. for mixing with maize.  That has retarded the demand for the mixture very considerably.  The increased proportion of oats and the low price at present ruling for livestock make it unremunerative to feed the mixture to animals.  I saw in the Press this morning that it is alleged that the millers are charging £3 per ton for the admixture over the price which would otherwise obtain.  I think that is not true.  I think the price to-day would be about £1 per ton more as a result of the mixture.  I do not think it is any more in the area I come from anyhow.  The Minister puts on 33? per cent.  The effect of that is that the people in the districts that do not grow oats are paying £1 per ton more for their maize meal and they are getting maize meal and that they consider is not as good for feeding as if there were no mixture.  The people selling the oats are getting no better price. It is being sold at 7/- or 8/- per barrel still.  I think a much better proposition has been put up to the Minister, namely, to put a duty of £1 per ton on the maize coming in.  The result would be that the small farmer and cottier would be paying the same price as he is at present for maize, and getting pure maize meal instead of a mixture. That £1 per ton on the maize meal could go to subsidise or give a bounty for the export of the oats.  I think that is reasonable.  It would not bring the Minister for Finance into it, and it would have the effect that the oats would get away.  There would be a market for the oats if we gave a bounty of 2/6 per barrel.  I think we would get sufficient from an import tax of £1 per ton on maize to give 2/6 per barrel of an export bounty on the oats shipped.  That would increase the value of every barrel of oats in the <Col N="1911" /> country by 2/6.  If the Minister would do that, I think it would help considerably. It would not increase the price of maize meal more than it is at present by the system of mixing. There would be no penalty on anybody. Every farmer would have to pay extra for his maize meal, and have to contribute in that way to the people who are growing oats in the oat-growing districts.</P>
    <P>An export bounty would not mean that 2/6 would have to be paid on every barrel of oats grown.  It would only have to be paid on the oats exported. I do not believe there would be one-twentieth or even one-fiftieth of the crop exported.  It would have the effect of raising the price.  I put it to the Minister that after six or nine months' working of this admixture scheme, it would be much better to put in force the system put before him by the millers, of putting an import duty on the maize and giving an export bounty on oats, which would relieve the situation.  At present, there are certain districts in the Free State which can hardly get a market for oats.  If you had an export bounty it would give them a market.  That would help the situation and help tillage.  It is useless for the Minister to ask the farmers to grow more cereals and to go on tilling, and to say that they must break up the ranches.</P>
    <P>What is the good of breaking up ranches or lea land at the present time, when your cattle or your pigs or sheep or fowl will not command an economic price?  If you have to sell anything that comes off these ranches, you cannot get an economic price.  It would encourage tillage very much if you could increase the price of oats by 2/6 per barrel.  I submit that the scheme I am now putting to the Minister would have that effect to-morrow if put in force.  The Minister has, I understand, power to do that under the Cereals Act and there would be no loss whatever.  It would be a gain to Leitrim, Sligo and the poorer counties which do not grow oats for sale and have to buy all their feeding stuffs. These people grumble a great deal <Col N="1912" /> about having to pay an extra price and getting what they call inferior feeding stuffs.  The farmers in the east of the Free State who grow corn for sale are getting no benefit under the Cereals Act.  They are getting no better price for their oats than if there were no Cereals Act in existence.  The price of oats is the same for them as it is in Scotland or the North of Ireland, while the Cereals Act was to give them a better price for their oats.  In that respect, the Cereals Act is a failure and as long as the present prices obtain for cattle, pigs, fowl and live stock generally, the Cereals Act is bound to be a failure.  The more oats and barley we grow, the less market we shall have and the less the price.  There is no way of getting rid of the oat crop except by the aid of export bounties.  The Minister will say that the Minister for Finance cannot afford to provide export bounties and we shall probably agree with that.  If the Minister worked the other way and made the people buying imported feeding stuffs pay for the export bounties, it would be a solution of the whole problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to endorse all that Senator O'Rourke has said.  I come from the largest grain-growing county in the Free State.  There, the situation of those who grow black oats is a terrible one.  I can buy all the black oats I want for feeding at 5/6 per barrel.  I do buy some oats.  I grow a considerable quantity of oats but I have always bought additional oats because, in former years, the feeding of everything, from poultry up to bullocks, paid very well.  The large farmers&mdash; those who fed&mdash;always bought from the smaller farmers, who grew grain and did not feed but sold their young stock.  I can endorse also what Senator O'Rourke has said about the discontent of the farmers in not being able to get pure maize.  The mixture is infinitely inferior to, and much dearer than, the pure maize.  That is a great hardship indeed on those who feed&mdash; not that there is any great inducement to feed but one must do something. At the moment it is quite impossible to sell grass cattle.  Fewer people than in former years are putting in their <Col N="1913" /> cattle to stall feed and those who are are doing so simply because they cannot sell them at any price off the grass.  The feeding is costing them a great deal more, notwithstanding the very much lower price they are getting. Even in a county like Wexford, where practically every farmer grew corn, the amount of pure maize used was enormous.  The more corn we grow, the more maize we bought to mix with it.  From my own experience and from talking to other people, I can say that the mixture is infinitely inferior in feeding quality to the mixture they made themselves by buying pure maize and mixing their own oats and barley with it.  I do not know that any purpose would be served by saying more.  The situation with regard to grain is a very desperate one in the country and I am afraid the Cereals Act has been a failure.  We prophesied on these benches that it would, and I am sorry to say it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator O'Rourke and Senator Miss Browne speak on a question of this kind the Seanad is very likely to pay very close attention to what they say.  Senator O'Rourke has put forward the proposal that, instead of mixing the Irish oats with maize, we ought to put a tariff on maize and give a corresponding export bounty in respect of our own grain.  He says that that can be done without any intervention on the part of the Minister for Finance.  In my opinion, that would be an impossibility.  I also differ from him in his main thesis.  I think that the object of this measure was to secure that grain should be grown in this country for the purpose of consumption in the country.  The most effective way of securing that would be so to legislate that there would be a mixture of the imported maize with Irish grain. I do not think that that could be carried out by any other method than that provided for in the Cereals Act.  I understood Senator O'Rourke to say that the mixture of oats and maize is inferior to maize itself.  Senator Miss Browne stated positively that it was infinitely inferior.  In the next sentence she said: &ldquo;The more grain that is grown in my county the more maize we <Col N="1914" /> import&rdquo;; or, to put it the other way, &ldquo;the more maize imported, the more grain is grown for the purpose of the mixture.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This amending Bill deals entirely with wheat and flour.  I did not think it was necessary or proper to deal with maize.  When the Principal Bill was being introduced about <Col N="1915" /> this time last year I said we were going to provide for a guaranteed market and a guaranteed price for wheat, but a guaranteed market only for oats and barley, not a guaranteed price.  I admit that has not worked satisfactorily, because there were a number of people in this country, merchants and millers, trying to take more than their share of the advantages to be derived under the measure.  That Bill was mainly for the benefit of agriculturists. It sought to get a good price for the farmer with grain to sell and endeavoured to have grain sold as cheaply as possible to the farmer who wanted to buy.  I am afraid the Bill failed largely because the merchants and millers tried to take more than their share, more than they got before the Bill was brought in.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Rourke mentioned that some one put down the increased profit to the millers at something like £2 10s. or £3 yesterday.  That was not my impression.  My impression of what was claimed was that if the miller gets it at £5 a ton, he charges £7 10s. Formerly, if he got it at £5 a ton he sold it at £6 10s. 0d., and the point was made that millers were not justified in charging that for milling the mixture.  Senator Miss Browne said oats are being sold at 5/6 a barrel in some places.  It is being sold in other places at 6/- and 7/- and under our scheme the merchants are buying at 9/-.  There is no doubt whatever the merchants are buying it and the millers are buying it.  I think this will have to be followed by other proposals which will provide that the farmers will get the benefit of whatever schemes are in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators are congratulating themselves that this is going to fail, but I think they ought to wait another year.  Unless we safeguard the farmers who have corn to sell and the farmers who want to buy foodstuffs, the Bill will not be a success.  I hope the Senators who declare that it will not be a success will support me later when I bring in a Bill to provide that the farmers get a fair share of the advantages.  I must emphasise that the Bill has been a success.  If you <Col N="1916" /> take up any list of market prices in England for foodstuffs you will find barley and oats are selling cheaper than they are here.  At Liverpool market last Saturday barley imported from Russia and the Danube country sold at 4/5 a cwt.  That would be 8/10 for our barrel of barley.  If we were exporting barley instead of using it in a maize meal mixture the farmer would be getting 7/6 a barrel.  The price of English barley used for brewing has always been much higher than feeding barley.  If we were importing against Russia and the Danube country I hold that the farmer could not get more than 7/6 a barrel here.  Senators may claim that barley is being sold at 11/- but that is 5/- a barrel better than if we had no Cereals Bill.  Oats are being imported at 3/7 a cwt. or 6/6 a barrel.  Freight and the merchant's costs have to be considered in that connection. If we had no Cereals Bill the best oats would not be more than 5/6 or 6/- a barrel.</P>
    <P>There is great difficulty about black oats in County Wexford.  Oats are being used more and more as a milling cereal.  Up to a few years ago large quantities of oats were used whole for feeding horses.  Black oats were then considered as good as white oats.  Now when oats are being milled the black are found to be very inferior to the white.  I asked some millers to give their experience in the de-hulling of black and white oats and the average reports show that good white oats will give a yield of 70 per cent. and the best black will be something under 60 per cent.  The very best white oats against the very best black show a difference of 12 per cent., equivalent to one-eighth. There is no great future for black oats in comparison with white. There are farmers in Wexford and adjoining counties who have been in the habit of growing black oats and it is hard to get them to change over to another cereal.  They would be well-advised to change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can help them this year in that matter, especially when <Col N="1917" /> oats are so cheap as Senators claim. There was another point made about the pure maize being better than the maize meal mixture.  The Department and its instructors have been carrying out experiments for the last 15 years. I am sure it is seven years ago since I read about experiments being carried out by the county instructors and in the Albert College.  In every case the home-grown grain was superior to or at least as good as maize, excepting in the case of small pigs.  In many other cases maize was inferior to oats or barley.  So far as experiments go the mixture is superior to maize.  I have been in some of the bacon factories and I have asked other factories what they thought of the bacon.  They say that the bacon is of much better quality since home-grown grain was used.  The bacon fed from pure maize was not of such good quality and the present-day quality has been very much improved.</P>

    <Title>Horse Breeding Bill, 1933&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Horse Breeding Bill, 1933, be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Our present powers in regard to horse breeding are derived from the 1918 Act which was brought into operation in this country on the 1st January, 1920.  Under this Act which we at present operate it is not an offence to keep an entire horse, but it is an offence to use that entire horse as a stallion for the service of mares, unless the entire horse is licensed.  There are exceptions there.  A stallion used by the owner for the service of his own mares is exempt, as is also a stallion registered in a stud book and used for the service of mares registered in a prescribed stud book, or other mares <Col N="1918" /> approved by the Department of Agriculture. These two classes are exempt.  Apart from these two exceptions an entire horse used for the service of mares must be licensed.</P>
      <P>The weakness of the present law is this&mdash;that a person may keep a stallion and claim that he is not using the stallion for service.  We cannot bring a case against him unless we have proof that he is using the stallion for service.  It is very difficult at present to bring such a case because the man is using the stallion for the service of the mares of his neighbours and friends and it is almost impossible to imagine that these would inform on him or give evidence against him so that we have really no way at present of dealing with these stallions that are unlicensed.  A great number of them are unsound and unsuitable and they are doing a great deal of damage to the horse breeding industry in the country.  The Department of Agriculture for some years past has spent a considerable amount of money on nominated mares, on the supply of good stallions to the country at half price and in giving loans to people to keep good stallions.  In many other ways the Department has spent a great deal of money on the improvement of horse breeding in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that has been frustrated to a great extent by these unlicensed stallions. The present powers are ineffective and we are seeking in this Bill powers somewhat the same as we have over bulls and boars under the Livestock Breeding Act to prescribe that stallions cannot be kept unless they are licensed&mdash;with certain exceptions.  There are exceptions. Where a stallion is registered as a thoroughbred, where he is used exclusively for the service of mares on the stud books he would be exempt. The reason for that is that there have been cases where stallions were used which had great records as racers and where their progeny were proved to have been so used. Still those stallions would not be passed by a veterinary surgeon.  It would be anomalous under this Bill if we had to order to be castrated these very good stallions that were well known to be very valuable to the <Col N="1919" /> country.  These are stallions from which we got very good stock.  It would be a pity if we were compelled under the Bill to have such animals castrated.  That is why they are exempt.  It is also felt that stallions used exclusively for racing should be exempt.  These two classes are exempt under the present Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in Section 15 for a system of permits.  Where the owner of a thoroughbred stallion registered in the stud book would prefer to apply for a permit or exemption, it is open to him to do so under this Bill.  Apart from that however, it will be an offence to keep an entire horse unless the horse is licensed.</P>
    <P>The usual provisions follow in this Bill somewhat the same as we had under the Livestock Breeding Act. Application must be made before the prescribed date.  The prescribed date is 31st December.  If a person is forgetful or negligent and applies after the prescribed date there will be an increased fee because it is a very costly thing to send a special inspector out to examine a stallion where a late application has been made and we have prescribed here that an additional fee will be charged in such cases, from £5.  It may be less.  The amount however will be prescribed.</P>
    <P>Another power which we are taking in this Bill is the limit of the area over which the stallion can be used. The reason why I mention this matter is because it was raised in the Dáil. Deputies wanted to know why this provision was put in.  It is because we find in the Department of Agriculture that there are certain areas where it is necessary to license a stallion of not so high a standard as would be licensed in other parts of the country. In the poorer districts where mares are few and the fee is small we may get a person to keep a stallion that would not be altogether up to the standard.  There it would be necessary, perhaps, to have that stallion for that particular district.  If it were permissible for the owner of the stallion to use the stallion once licensed in any part of the State afterwards it would be possible for an owner to <Col N="1920" /> keep an inferior type of stallion that had been registered in a particular area.  Afterwards that stallion could be got into an area where he would not be up to the standard required by the Department.  We have power under the Bill to deal with those cases.  That power would only be used in such cases as I have mentioned where a stallion below the standard would be licensed.</P>
    <P>Where the usual notice is served to have a stallion inspected for licence, and where the licence is refused, the person is notified to have the stallion castrated.  That is much the same as in case under the Livestock Breeding Acts.  If the person takes no action we can under the Bill inflict the penalty.  We may eventually prevent the keeping of such an animal up to the point of compulsory castration, and powers are taken in this Bill to have stallions castrated at the expense of the owners.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill there is also a panel of referees.  We find the same provisions in the Livestock Breeding Acts where we have a panel of referees, and the same provision was made in the 1918 Horse Breeding Act.  We are continuing that panel.  We are only making this change: Under the 1918 Act, when once we put a man on a panel he remained there as a life member.  As a result the panel often became very large, because in some cases when a man got old and unfit for the work new men had to be put on, and the old members still remained on, though unfit for work.  The old members in some cases became useless. For that reason we are proposing in future to have a panel only for three years.  At the end of the three years the men who were not prepared to act are removed from the panel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that we are all in favour of the main object of this Bill.  It seems to be as necessary in the case of the ordinary stallion as the Act which we passed some time ago with reference to bulls.  But, in the debates in the Dáil, a very serious question was raised as to the exclusion from the Bill of bloodstock.  I read the debates in the Dáil very carefully. The Minister himself seemed to be as anxious as anybody else that bloodstock should be excluded, as far as was reasonably possible.  He suggested that an amendment should be introduced at a later stage of the Bill, having expressed his sympathy in favour of bloodstock being excluded on the Second Reading.  As a matter of fact, an amendment was introduced and passed on the Report Stage of the Bill in the Dáil.  It takes the form which Senators will find in sub-section (1) (a) of Section 4, and is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The owner of any stallion, which is entered in a prescribed stud book and which&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) is used for the service of no mares other than mares entered in the stud book in which such stallion is entered, or</P>
      <P>(b) is of or over the prescribed age and is used exclusively for racing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with reference to paragraph (a) that I wish to point out that it does not go far enough.  I am not speaking for myself in this matter.  Personally, I know very little about the breeding <Col N="1922" /> of bloodstock, and I am very sorry that Senator Parkinson is not able to be here to-day.  He is unavoidably absent, but he will be here for the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I need scarcely say that he is an expert, probably the very best expert in this country, on this subject.  At any rate he is an expert for whom we, in this House, must have the very greatest respect, and what I am saying on the subject is really based on information which I have received from him. Senator Parkinson informs me that, instead of confining the exclusion from the licensing provisions in the Bill of any stallion in a prescribed stud book and only used for mares entered in that particular stud book, it should be made very much wider: that it should be made to include all stallions entered in any stud book recognised in any country where racing takes place and used for mares entered in any such stud book.  The reason for that is this: that a great many bloodstock mares entered, say, in any foreign stud book come over to this country because of its magnificient soil for the purpose of bringing up young horses, and also because of the extremely careful and expert manner in which the business of bloodstock breeding is carried on here. These mares come over here.  They are entered, some of them, in the British stud book, some in the French stud book&mdash;and I may say that very many French mares come over to this country &mdash;and more of them are entered in American and in Austrian stud books. This should not be confined merely to &ldquo;a prescribed stud book,&rdquo; and I do not think it should be left even to the Minister to prescribe what stud books the stallions and the mares are to be entered in.  They are all recognised stud books and can be absolutely depended on.  The amendment which Senator Parkinson suggests should be made in the Bill is to insert, instead of sub-section (1) (a) of Section 4 the following: &ldquo;all stallions entered in any stud book recognised in any country where racing takes place and used for mares entered in any such stud books.&rdquo; That is to say, the mare need not be entered in the same stud book as the stallion.  That is a very important <Col N="1923" /> matter, and one which I think the Minister will see the force of.</P>
    <P>The only other matter which seems to require some consideration on the Committee Stage is the exclusion from the operation of the Act of two-year-old colts.  There was also a very long and interesting debate on this matter in the Dáil.  After the best consideration that I could give the matter it struck me that the very best thing would be to exclude bloodstock altogether from the provisions of this Bill.  However, I do not suppose the Minister would be willing to go as far as that, but I would recommend to his most favourable consideration the matter with reference to the stud book to which I have called attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that Senator Brown has made the statement to which we have just listened.  I entirely agree with what he said.  I had thought of saying the same thing myself.  The Minister, no doubt, was led into bringing in this Horse Breeding Bill because some years ago a somewhat similar Bill was brought in in connection with cattle breeding, and he probably thought, just on the face of it, that what was suitable for cattle would be suitable for horses.  But, as a matter of fact, the two things are very different.  I am not against this Bill in its general lines, because for years I advocated a similar measure for cattle. If it were not for the way in which it deals with bloodstock I would entirely agree with what the Bill proposes. The question of bloodstock&mdash;putting it under the control of the Department&mdash; was the one that was principally dealt with in the Dáil.  The Minister tried in various ways to accommodate himself to the ideas put forward there, but he admitted that the technical difficulties, of keeping some out and letting others in, would be hard to overcome.  Finally, I suppose as a result of the discussions that took place, this particular clause was inserted.  In my opinion it would have been much simpler and better if the Minister had excluded bloodstock altogether.  Any animal entered in a general stud book in this or other countries should be excluded.  I am <Col N="1924" /> dealing now with thoroughbred bloodstock and not with hunter bloodstock. The difficulty about this matter is that one does not know who is to decide whether an animal should be allowed in for breeding purposes or not.  I am personally very much against officials undertaking this sort of work unless it can be said that other methods have failed.  If they have actually failed over a long period of time, then there is certainly a very good reason for putting the matter under some control. But in this case exactly the opposite is the fact, because the bloodstock in this country is better than that in any other country in the world.  Everybody comes here for our bloodstock, not only for racing stock but for our hunter stock.  Therefore I can see no reason for putting this matter of our bloodstock under the control of officials when it has been so successful hitherto. But the question really is, who is to decide?  We will suppose that some very competent official is told off for this purpose.  He goes around and he looks at certain horses.  He is probably a very competent and decent person and wants to do the best that he can, but how is he going to know, because there is no means of knowing? Nobody in the world has yet found any means of knowing.  If anybody could find out, with any certainty, the proper horses to breed from he would win all the races in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody has tried, and no one has been able to find out the reason why one horse should be better than another with the exception of those with experience on race courses in the case of half-bred stock.  Outside that they can only make a guess, and not a very certain guess, as to what is good or not.  Therefore, if you send people out to judge a matter of that kind you will find they cannot do it. I saw a very well-bred horse standing at Mullingar.  I went there to see him and what did I find?  I saw him with his fetlocks quite bent over.  He was struggling across the stable on his pasterns.  But he bred many winners, however.  He was not a horse for hunters; but he would be stopped and put aside if some official went down and disqualified.  I am not talking <Col N="1925" /> now of one individual horse.  If I went to the stud book I would find dozens of cases of horses that would not be expected to win races but did win races.  Perhaps I might go so far as to quote an instance, not of the class of horse I found in Mullingar, but a horse of the very highest strain of blood to be found in the stud book and whose progeny for the last hundred years has been at the top of the list and is now, with one or two others at the head.  It will be interesting to some people if I give this instance.  The name of the horse was Stockwell&mdash;the emperor of stallions. His stock prevailed in the country for the last hundred years and is now, at the present moment, at the head of everything.  Look how he was bred. Stockwell was not a very good looking horse himself.  He was big, clumsy and a bad mover but he won the St. Leger.  He was by Baron, and Baron was a horse described by the people of that time as having an ugly Roman head&mdash;a gloomy Roman head.  But he won the St. Leger all the same.  Stockwell's dam was Red Roarer&mdash;a most confirmed roarer and a very bad horse on a racecourse, not like Stockwell at all.  However, in spite of these disadvantages, Stockwell won the Leger and the Two Thousand Guineas.  That was not a chance case.  Going back another step, the Baron's dam was Echidna.  She was described as a fiddle-headed animal.  Of course I do not mean she had a fiddle head or that she had a Roman nose but any official would disqualify it.  However, I am only showing that it is not possible to judge a thoroughbred horse simply by the effect of appearance.  To go back one more step in that particular family we find that the sire of Baron was Irish Bird Catcher.  Irish Bird Catcher's dam was Wicherley, described as a wretched horse that would never breed a hunter for anybody.  She was offered on the turf for £30 but no one would buy her.  She was the dam of Baron and the grand dam of Stockwell. So here we have a whole lot of bad mares and they have established a record for the finest family in the whole stud book.  I have not examined this year's list.  If you go back a few years you will find, in fact, no horse <Col N="1926" /> in the stud book that has not Stockwell's blood.  Now you propose to send down the country an official&mdash;some veterinary surgeon or other&mdash;and he is to decide whether a certain horse is to succeed at the stud or not.</P>
    <P>The object of the Bill is to protect half-bred horses&mdash;sometimes more than half-bred&mdash;against the incursion of bad, diseased blood.  You are to protect them against stallions either inferior or with certain diseases.  That is a very reasonable proposition.  I was bred in the country, I may say in a racing stable, and, therefore, I have some knowledge of the subject.  I know that throughout the country there have been small studs. Thoroughbred horses would be brought down for mares, but as these small studs have only five or six thoroughbred mares, they were not sufficient, and the sires would be used for half-bred mares in the country.  What was the result of that?  The result was that, from these country places and small studs have come the best horses in the world.  I remember a horse brought up in one of these studs, it was sent over to England, won the Stewards' Cup at Goodwood, against 45 starters, the biggest number ever seen.  That horse was brought up in a small country place in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It was the same way with hunters. Hunters bred in this country for the last half century have been bred from these stallions at these small country studs and used all round the neighbourhood where they are sometimes led along from place to place.  Now we are going to bring all this under the control of the officials in Dublin.  The Minister pledges himself, no doubt, that no wrong will be done in any of these cases, but it is very unwise for any Minister to promise a thing of that sort, because he does not see it himself. He could not possibly see it. Some official may go out and stop the breeding of horses such as those I have mentioned, and the Minister cannot possibly see it.  I think the Minister would act in a much better and wiser way if he would exclude thoroughbred horses.</P>
    <P>Going back to the question of appearance, a good many years ago the <Col N="1927" /> German Government wished to establish a national stud.  They sent people over to England and Ireland and they bought at lavish expense all the best horses they could find and took them over to Germany and set up a national stud there.  Not having as many racehorses as we had, they judged by the appearance of these horses, to a great extent, but it was very soon found that appearance was no use whatsoever when it came to the breeding of horses and the stud became useless and had to be broken up.  There is only one test for a racehorse and that is whether he wins races or does not.  The horses that do not win races are no use no matter what their appearance is.  Those who do win races may be good to look at or they may not.  In the same way, a horse may look to be the finest horse in the world and turn out to be useless in the stud.  I remember the case of one horse that won the Derby a good many years ago and he was absolutely useless in the stud.  Horses are thrown out every year because they are no use and because they do not breed good racehorses or good hunters.  What the Germans did is just what the Minister is trying to do now and there is a danger that he will find himself in the position of having good horses thrown out by men who, on the face of things, cannot give a fair decision.  I remember that a few years ago there was a certain gentleman&mdash;I think he was a Mr. Webb&mdash;who was at the head of the Congested Districts Board, I think, and who got it into his head that a certain class of horse would be the salvation of the West.  He insisted, against the advice of racehorse owners and other people, on bringing that class of horse down.  Everybody that had anything to do with the training of horses spoke against it, but when a man is determined on a thing he will do it no matter what anybody says. As far as anyone could see, the only qualification of this horse was that when he was trotting he nearly hit his nose with his knees.  It was interesting to see him trotting around Ballsbridge. He went about as fast as a donkey would walk but he certainly <Col N="1928" /> could raise his hoofs high.  I do not know what has become of that class of horse, but we never see them now.</P>
    <P>My advice to the Minister is to make a simple rule and take out the whole question of the thoroughbred horse from this.  He can do that quite easily if he takes out sub-sections (a) and (b) from Section 4.  I have no further objection to the Bill except this.  There may be other things depending on this which would have to be changed also, but if the Minister does what I suggest it will settle that.</P>

      <P>I think that Senator Brown has made a very good case for an amendment of Section 4 so as to provide that there shall be exemption in the case of a stallion which is used for the service of no mares other than mares entered in a stud book.  I think a very good case has been made by the Senator.  In addition to what he has suggested I would urge on the Minister this further consideration, that, so far as my experience goes, a mixture of the blood is an advantage.  That is another consideration I would submit to the Minister.  It is with great trepidation, of course, that I venture to differ from Senator Colonel Moore in anything relating to the horse, but I do not think it would be wise to introduce this sweeping amendment which he suggests.  It is all very well to exempt thoroughbreds mated with thoroughbreds, but when you come to consider the question of mating a thoroughbred with a farmer's mare in order to get a hunter there are matters to be considered other than the swiftness of the sire.  The main question to consider in that case, I think, is the soundness of the animal.  Before thoroughbred sires can be used indiscriminately for being mated with farmers' mares so as to produce saleable stock I think it is essential for the protection of the farmers that the sire should be sound in wind and limb.  I believe that is the objection to the argument put forward by Senator Colonel Moore and I am sure that it is probably the reason why the Minister has made the distinction between the two classes.</P>

      <P>I wish to support Senator Colonel Moore.  I listened <Col N="1929" /> with great interest to his most interesting speech not altogether because of my own experience in horse-breeding, although I have had a certain amount of experience, but because I have consulted with a great many noted horse-breeders in my own county, and they are afraid that official meddling may interfere with the horse-breeding industry and take it out of the hands of the experts who, in the past, have bred horses which, as Senator Colonel Moore has said, cannot be beaten anywhere and cannot be improved upon. The horse that will suit one district may be quite unsuitable in another.  I know of one horse in Wexford, which was unsuitable in a midland county and got rid of, from which the finest horses that ever crossed a ditch in Wexford have been bred.  The type of horse in Wexford is the weight-carrying hunter, and I defy any Minister or any &ldquo;vet&rdquo; to improve the breed of horses in that district.  This question of horse-breeding has grown up throughout centuries and not merely for the last couple of hundred years.  The horses in this country have been famous for centuries. We know that from the ancient records.  It may not be very much use to look back on these records now, but it is interesting to see from them how horse-breeding stood many centuries ago in this country.  These records show that several things go to the making of the matchless horses we produce in this country&mdash;horses which all the world combined has failed to beat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is first of all the soil of Ireland. The limestone soil makes bone which cannot be produced anywhere else.  There is also the quality of the old Irish mare.  I would be very glad if, in any Horse Breeding Bill, an effort was made to preserve the old Irish breed.  Then there is the Irishman's sporting instinct which makes him an expert.  The feeling amongst Irish breeders I met is&mdash; if I may put it this way&mdash; that this is a Medicine Bill, an interference with a business which can scarcely be improved upon.  The horses in Wexford at present are practically all the progeny of great racehorses and Derby winners which <Col N="1930" /> have made a great name for that county.  The types which my part of the country requires are weight-carrying hunters.  I can foresee types of horses being sent to Wexford by some veterinary inspector who does not understand that they will be quite unsuitable there.  I agree that bloodstock should be exempted from the Bill.  I remember very well the &ldquo;hackneys&rdquo; which have been referred to and which ruined the old breed in the west.  That was an example for us.  The &ldquo;hackneys&rdquo; cross of these and the Connemara ponies were ridiculous looking animals, and might be described as freaks.  They went far towards ruining the breed of horses in the district.  Many famous horses have been bred in Wexford including Napoleon's charger, Marengo.  That horse was bred in Wexford and was the property of a French officer.  When Napoleon set eyes on him he never rode any other horse.  A study of the Irish horse is exceedingly interesting from the historical point of view.  Art Mac Murrough's horse was bred in my county.  A French chronicler of King Richard's Army gives a very interesting description of the meeting with the Duke of Gloucester in 1399:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Between two woods, at some distance from the sea, I beheld MacMoré and a body of the Irish, more than I can number, descend the mountain.  He had a horse without housing or saddle, which was so fine and good that it had cost him, they said, 400 cows; for there is little money in the country, wherefore their usual traffic is in cattle.  In coming down it galloped so hard that in my opinion I never saw hare, deer, sheep or any other animal, I declare to you, for a certainty, run with such speed as it did.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a description of the horse ridden by Art Murrough in 1399. Coming down the centuries we had Marengo, Napoleon's charger.  Evidence can be found of the wonderful superiority of the horses bred in my own part of the country.  A writer in the &ldquo;Sporting Review&rdquo; of 1839 said apropos of Harkaway:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;By the way, odd as it may seem, there is a nationality of shape about <Col N="1931" /> that extraordinary animal that cannot but strike anyone used to the anatomy of the Irish horse; I think I could have named the country of his birth, had I met him in Constantinople.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All these interesting references to the Irish horse proved that the knowledge which makes the expert has come down to us; that it is hereditary.  A Bill like this is totally different to one dealing with cattle breeding.  There is no comparison.  The experts in my part of the country are rather disturbed by this Bill, believing that it may do serious harm.  They believe that as this business was carried on successfully in the past, there should be no meddling with it.  Racing experts may have a different opinion, but we do not breed horses for racing in Wexford. The horses required there are heavy weight-carrying hunters, at which we can beat the world.  A thoroughbred horse that would be successful in Kildare might be absolutely unsuitable in Wexford.  I do not want to oppose the Bill, seeing that it has been approved of by people who know vastly more than I do about this question.  But the people I spoke to expressed other views to me and they have been breeding horses for generations. I am expressing the views of those I spoke to in my own part of the country, and I think it is only right to put forward those views.</P>

      <P>I desire to endorse the remarks of Senator Miss Browne and Senator Colonel Moore, and to suggest that if possible bloodstock should be exempted from the Bill.  In case that is not possible, Section 6 is one that requires particular attention, because under it the sale of any racehorse is made more difficult.  It is an annoying stipulation, it serves no purpose, and simply imposes trouble, and possibly cost on a big industry, which has its own peculiar difficulties, not the least of which is the Government's policy.  It must be borne in mind that Irish racehorses in all branches have a worldwide reputation.  The biggest market is in England.  The Irish bloodstock industry is now subject to attacks <Col N="1932" /> beyond its capacity to bear.  This is not the time to come along with a further disability and to create more difficulties for this industry.  References have been made to the quality of Irish bloodstock.  It has achieved that reputation without any help from any Government.  Now the Government is going to interfere with a successful industry, or rather with what was a successful industry.  There is one advice to be given the Government, and that is: &ldquo;Hands off the Irish bloodstock industry.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This Bill seems to me to be like a repetition of the old story, locking the stable door when the steed is stolen.  We have it on the authority of the President himself that the English market is gone.  With the horse trade the English market was the best market we had.  Comparing the number of mares that came from England with the number that came from France or from other countries the difference is marked.  Everyone knows that many more mares came from England than from any other country.  Considering the difficulties in getting mares or stallions across to the other side of the Channel, certainly they would want to be very good steeplechasers to be able to jump the tariff walls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is only one side of the horse question.  Take the big carriers in the City of Dublin.  Take Guinness's brewery.  The horse I admire most of all in Dublin is what, for want of a better name, I shall call the Guinness Clydesdale.  It is a noble-looking animal, and the click of the shoes of Guinness's horses on the streets of Dublin brings joy to the heart of every Dubliner especially when that click resounds off a Parnell whinstone sett, but the Guinness Clydesdale and the whinstone setts are fast disappearing from our streets.  To-day, we must have our streets French polished and consequently, the horse must go and the motor car takes its place. Take, then, the case of the farmers of the country who always had what I shall call, again for want of a better name, the old Irish draught horse.  It is just as well to realise that people who breed horses have an awful lot of <Col N="1933" /> horse sense.  They know exactly what they want.  If a man who had an Irish draught animal wanted a foal similar to the mare he had, he brought it to a particular stallion and if he wanted a hunter, he brought it to a thoroughbred.  Then, go right across the country from Dublin to Clifden and you find the Connemara ponies. Within the past 20 years, the people of Connemara, without any Government assistance or Government interference, have succeeded in improving wonderfully the Connemara pony. They have done that without inspectors and without Government interference, but now, when we have no export trade for horses, we come along and introduce a Horse Breeding Bill.  I cannot help thinking of what Dean Swift said about the Government of his day:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Behold the proof of Irish sense,</P>
    <P>Her Irish wit is seen</P>
    <P>When nothing's left that's worth defence</P>
    <P>They build a magazine.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that Section 4 can be amended to great advantage if it should be decided that a thoroughbred is not to be excluded from the operations of this Bill.  I also agree that the breeding of thoroughbreds should be excluded.  The best knowledge and the most expert knowledge and the greatest perseverance have, for long over a century, been devoted to the breeding of the thoroughbreds of this country.  That is all I shall say about the advisability of excluding the thoroughbred.  He stands out in the world to-day as one of the best that can be produced, and I think it would be a pity to take the risk of interfering with the method by which our thoroughbred stock has been produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Section 4 and the provisions to the effect that a sire will be eligible for exemption provided he belongs to a certain stud book and is not mated with any mare except those entered in that stud book, I quite agree that it would be necessary to have that amended.  Mares come over here from foreign countries and I think they should be encouraged rather than discouraged in that respect <Col N="1934" /> because the introduction of foreign blood into the bloodstock is a very useful adjunct to horse breeding here. Still more so, perhaps, is it necessary for occasionally getting a thoroughbred from countries other than this, and we have a notable instance in the case of Roi Herode, the French horse that came over here 20 or 30 years ago, and was one of the greatest successes we had in this country.  That is known to most people who take an interest in horse breeding.  If that animal came over here at present and this Bill, as it is now drafted, were passed, he would not be eligible for exemption if he were mated with the mares of this country.  He would not be eligible for exemption being entered in a French stud book unless some French mares came over with him.  It would be, I think, a great loss to horse breeding if foreign stock were to be prevented from coming in here.  This point should be carefully considered by the Minister and some improvement made in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is the other matter that the section merely mentions a stud book. The plain draught-horse has a stud book of his own, and there are different types of horses for different stud books. It would be well to specify the bloodstock stud book, otherwise one might mix up the question of stud books still further.  There is a draught stud book and a thoroughbred stud book, and it would be better to avoid any confusion, and I suggest that the particular stud book should be specified more definitely than in the Bill at present.</P>

I did not do so because buying racehorses for anybody else is a big job and I should probably have got myself into great trouble by picking out some nice-looking horses, <Col N="1935" /> not one of which would have won a race, and then I should have come in for it.</P>

      <P>I am interested in the observations that have just been made by Senator Brown and Senator Colonel Moore.  I meant to say something on that line in reply to Senator Staines, who said that the British market was our only market for horses.  He is not here now, so I need not go into it further.  I did not think that this debate was going to range over such a wide field.  We went back to 1399, into the present and into the future. Senator Miss Browne spoke about Napoleon's horse, but Senator Comyn assures me that Napoleon's horse was a mare and not a horse.  I want to correct Senator Miss Browne in that. The big objection that has been raised to the Bill is that we do not give sufficient protection to owners of bloodstock. There are three classes of horses really to be dealt with: firstly, bloodstock horses that are used for the service of bloodstock mares only; secondly, thoroughbred horses such as were referred to by Senator Colonel Moore, used for the service of other mares from which hunters are bred; and thirdly, the type of horses we are trying to get at under this Bill, horses used by the farmer.  It is most peculiar that in a House like this there is not a single voice raised on behalf of the farmer who wants to get a certain type of horse.  Every single Senator talked as a bloodstock owner or talked for what I regarded as the aristocracy of the breeders.  Even Senators who represent farmers in this House did not raise a single protest about getting at the farmer's horse.  They did not care if we wiped him out completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rather an exaggeration because the farmers' horses are got from thoroughbred horses and therefore, in pressing for protection for these horses, we ask for protection for the horses in which the farmers are interested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to preserve the <i>status quo</i> in regard to bloodstock horses.  I did want to get at what was <Col N="1936" /> referred to as scrub horses in the country, whether they were kept by farmers or by tinkers and that is what the Bill is for.  We want to exempt, if possible, bloodstock horses, and when my Department put up this Bill, in the first instance, and I was asked to exempt bloodstock horses I said &ldquo;What will that mean?&rdquo;  I was told that they would have to apply for exemption.  I asked was it not much easier to apply for a licence or a permit.  There was then a permit provision put into the Bill which provided that these permits would cost them 5/- and that they would have to apply for such permits.  A man who owns recehorses will not miss 5/-.  All he will have to do is to fill a form each year, and I am assured by people who go in for racing that they have to fill on an average five or six forms for every race for which a horse is entered. They will have to fill only one form to get a permit.  The Bill came into the Dáil in that form, that is, on the understanding that the owner of a bloodstock stallion could be exempt from the Act by applying for a permit and paying 5/-.  I was then attacked in the Dáil in regard to the Bill and I said &ldquo;I am quite prepared to do what was done in the 1918 Bill.&rdquo;  I then asked the draftsman to draft an amendment giving them the same exemption as they had in the 1918 Bill.  What exemption had they under the 1918 Bill?  The Act says that stallions of this class shall be exempt, &ldquo;A stallion entered in any prescribed stud book if used for the service of mares so entered or mares approved by the Department.&rdquo; That is a bit wider than what is in the Bill&mdash;&ldquo;A stallion entered in a prescribed stud book if used for the service of mares so entered.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What stud book was prescribed since 1918?  The general stud book prescribed by Messrs.  Wetherby.  Only Wetherby's was prescribed.  That is horses entered as thoroughbred stallions in Wetherby's for the service of mares entered in Wetherby's were exempt.  We brought in an amendment in the Dáil for exactly the same purpose.  It has the same effect, if our prescribed regulations remain the same because we have Wetherby's in mind. <Col N="1937" /> We mean to carry on in the same way as for the last ten years.  Any stallion entered in Wetherby's and used exclusively for the service of mares entered in Wetherby's would be exempt.  I am quite prepared to put into the Bill the very same clause as appeared in the 1918 Act.  I am prepared to change the paragraph in Section 4, so that it would read &ldquo;entered in any prescribed stud book if used for the service of mares so entered or mares approved by the Minister.&rdquo;  That would be the very same wording as in the 1918 Act.  Why I should be asked to go further I do not know because I have not heard any complaint from bloodstock owners that they were put to any trouble for the last ten years. These stallions were exempt when used for the service of mares entered in Wetherby's.  One would imagine from the tenor of Senators' speeches that we are interfering with the bloodstock trade.  We are not interfering with the trade.  We are making absolutely no change for racehorses. We are leaving the conditions exactly as they were.  I am prepared to put in the same words as in the 1918 Act because, as far as I am concerned, the regulations will be the same, as I am advised by the officials of the Department that the regulations have been sound.  As I have already mentioned, we shall have a consultative council under the Bill of people representative of the horse breeding industry.  If they put up a very strong plea for any change in the regulations we may consider changing them but until that is done they will have to remain as they are.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the type of horse mentioned in particular by Senator Colonel Moore and by Senator Miss Browne&mdash;thoroughbred horses that are used in the country, in the first instance brought down to a small stud in the country and used for the service of the owner's five or six thoroughbred mares, and also used for the service of farmers' mares in the district for the breeding of half-bred horses, hunters and so on.  The same type of horse in Wexford was referred to by Senator Miss Browne.  Every one of these horses has to be licensed.  They <Col N="1938" /> have to be licensed under this Bill also, under the very same conditions.  They could not be used for the service of these mares for the last ten years except they were licensed.  We are making no change in that respect. Senator Miss Browne spoke about a well-known stallion in Wexford.  She would give the impression, I think, that under the new Bill things are going to be interfered with, and she said that the people with whom she discussed the Bill said that it was needless meddling.  She mentioned the case of &ldquo;Brighter London.&rdquo;&ldquo;Brighter London&rdquo; and many other good horses were placed there by the Department. It was the Department's officials placed them there.  We have in the Department at our disposal some very good judges of horses.  They have put the best horses that can be got at the disposal of the people.  These are the officials that are going to carry out the Bill, so we need have no fears of the officials of the Department when they can pick such horses as &ldquo;Brighter London.&rdquo;  Of course, I may say that all these horses are licensed. They are licensed for the last ten years. One would get the impression from speeches made by some Senators that we are coming in now to interfere with these horses.  These horses were all licensed under the 1918 Act.  They have to be licensed.  We are making no change in that system.</P>
    <P>Senator Staines spoke about the joy that it brings to his heart to see Messrs.  Guinness's horses.  There will be no more joy brought to the Senator's heart, because Messrs. Guinness now have no horses.  He will have to go back on his imagination to get joy in them.  When he says that the farmer knows what he wants, I am reminded that I have often used that argument myself.  The farmer knew what he wanted before the Livestock Breeding Bill was introduced.  Many farmers knew the difference between a good bull and a bad bull, yet it was necessary to interfere and to do away with some of the bad bulls.  It is necessary now to interfere in much the same way to do away with the bad horses.  We know very well in the Department that there are horses used <Col N="1939" /> for service which are unsound and unfit.  They are being used for service in circumstances in which we cannot bring any charge against the owner.  Senator Staines gave the Connemara pony as an example of what the people could do without the Department.  The Dáil votes money every year to the Connemara Society and the Department sends down inspectors every year to help the society to improve the Connemara pony.  If, therefore, the Connemara pony revival has been as successful as the Senator maintains, I say again that we have very good inspectors in the Department, that they have done their work well. Senator Garahan spoke of the difficulty supposing &ldquo;Roi Herode&rdquo; came across.  &ldquo;Roi Herode&rdquo; may possibly be in Wetherby's.  If he is, he is entitled under the old Act and under this Bill to serve mares entered in Wetherby's.</P>

      <P>If he was not in Wetherby's he could not come in here without a licence.  That was the position for the last ten years, and we are going to maintain that position under this Bill.  If he is not in Wetherby's he cannot come in here without a licence.  If he is in Wetherby's, he can come in here and be exempt.  We will have the very same position with regard to &ldquo;Roi Herode&rdquo; and any other horse.  The position is this: bloodstock stallions entered in the stud book are exactly in the same position as for the last ten years.  There is no change whatever, as the Bill stands.  I am prepared, however, to bring in the same wording as in the 1918 Act.  I have an amendment ready to introduce on the Committee Stage to satisfy owners that we are not trying to put anything across them in that matter.  Horses used for racing and in training for racing will be, I think, in a better position under this Bill than they were. They were exempt under the other Act, because naturally the owners claimed that they were not using them for service.  They are also exempt under this Bill.  Thoroughbred stallions used for the service of other mares, that is <Col N="1940" /> half-bred and common mares in the country, will have to be licensed under the Bill.  They had to be licensed for the last ten years.  They could not be exempted under the 1918 Act.  They are in the same position.  The only difference is that we are trying to exclude and get rid of the unsound and unfit stallions in the country that are being used illegally at present.  That is the only class that we want to get at.  I can assure the Seanad that the Bill is brought in for no other purpose than to get at that class, and no objection has been raised in the Seanad to getting rid of that class of stallion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide machinery for the regulation and the variation of rates leviable at harbours.  At present, rates leviable at harbours controlled by bodies of commissioners or trustees are authorised by special Acts and Provisional Orders made from time to time in respect of the undertakings. The number of enactments and orders is upwards of 100, dating from 1820 onwards, and, though they do not all deal with the levying and collection of rates, most of them include provisions relating in one way or another to the matter.  In practically every case the rates authorised relate to the maximum charges which the harbour authority may levy and so long as that limitation is not exceeded, and so long as the rates charged are charged equally to all persons in respect of the same descriptions of vessels and goods, the harbour authority has complete discretion as to the amount to be charged and the incidence between various rates of a particular character and between different classes of rates.  There is at present little or no similarity between rates charged at one port and those at another and that is due to the fact that <Col N="1941" /> these undertakings have, up to date, developed independently of each other.</P>
      <P>Under existing statutes, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has, in relation to certain harbours, powers to adjust the rates to the revenue requirements of the undertaking. Under the Harbours, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1920, he has power to authorise a temporary increase in charges.  The existing powers, however, have been found to be insufficient in various respects. For example, it is not possible under the existing powers to alter the incidence of the rates as between vessels of different classes or as between tonnage rates on vessels and the rates on goods, unless such alteration was required either as a corollary to the adjustment of the revenue of the undertaking or for the purpose of increasing the charges to enable the port to operate without loss.</P>
      <P>The Ports and Harbours Tribunal, which reported in 1930, considered the present position in respect to harbour rates and made a number of recommendations. In paragraph 1085 they state:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We recommend that the present system of fixing rates by Special Act or Provisional Order should be departed from and that a simpler and more elastic system should be introduced.  In our opinion, maximum rates on vessels and goods should be fixed by the Department of Industry and Commerce for each port, after due inquiry into the revenue requirements of the undertaking and after hearing and considering any representations by the authority or by parties concerned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In paragraph 1086 they state:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is, in our opinion, necessary and desirable that harbour authorities should have power, within proper limits, to deal, by varying their rates, with local conditions and requirements and to assist, for example, an existing industry or develop a new one.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these two paragraphs the Tribunal was concerned with the existing procedure for the various rates.  At the present time, any harbour authority <Col N="1942" /> desiring to vary the maximum or minimum rates of charge have to promote a special Act or Provisional Order. They recommended that power should be given to the Minister to make a variation by Order on representations from the harbour authority and after hearing any interested party.  They went on to say, however, in paragraph 1087:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There remains the question of dealing with complaints by traders or ship owners who may consider themselves aggrieved by the rates actually charged in particular cases. The Department of Industry and Commerce should have power to deal with such complaints and, after due inquiry, to vary by Order any rates charged by a harbour board which, in the opinion of the Department, operate unjustly or have been fixed as a result of prejudice or unfair partiality.  We look upon this power as a necessary part of the general oversight of harbour administration which we recommend should be assigned as one of the duties of the Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again in paragraph 1088 they state:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend, further, that the Department should be empowered to move with a view to varying maximum rates and, in certain circumstances, to enforce the levying of actual rates without an application from an interested party.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Bill gives effect to these recommendations of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal.  It may be asked why we have decided to act upon these recommendations in advance of the general Bill to give effect to all the recommendations of the Tribunal.  The answer is that it appears that some considerable time must elapse before the general Bill can be prepared and introduced. In the meantime, it is considered desirable that these particular recommendations should be brought into effect so that any variation in harbour rates desired by a harbour authority or considered necessary by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on the representation of parties, whether traders or shippers, who allege that their interests are being <Col N="1943" /> prejudiced or, having regard to considerations of general policy, by the Minister on his own initiative, should be made possible.  Since the Bill was introduced in the Dáil, various representations have been made by harbour authorities and various recommendations have been made for the amendment of the Bill.  In the long run, these suggestions boil themselves down to the proposal that, whenever the Minister proposes to make, amend or revoke a harbour rates order, notice of the intention should be published and any interested party should be given power to make representations to the Minister, these representations to be followed either by action on the part of the Minister or by a decision on his part to institute a local inquiry into the proposed new rates order.  I introduced, on the Report Stage in the Dáil, an amendment designed to meet that particular proposal.  It has not, apparently, entirely satisfied the different harbour authorities and I propose to suggest to the Seanad on Committee Stage a further amendment which will, I think, make quite clear to these harbour authorities that we desire to give full effect to their suggestion.  It will be an amendment to Section 5, designed to ensure that when it is proposed to make, amend or revoke a harbour rates order, adequate public notice will be given and power given to interested parties to make whatever representations they desire.</P>
    <P>A further section of the Bill, which has nothing to do with its general purport, is a section which improves Section 2 of the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919.  The effect of this amendment is to permit the transfer to the Department of Industry and Commerce of functions, powers and duties relating to harbours, docks and piers to be limited to powers and duties relating to one or more particular harbours, docks and piers.  That amendment is considered necessary for administrative reasons.  It is of no special importance, but advantage is being taken of the introduction of this Bill to give effect to that provision.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose that this Bill is regarded in any sense as a contentious <Col N="1944" /> measure.  In any event, any suggestions that have to be made concerning it will probably be more conveniently discussed on Committee Stage.  In principle, the Bill is designed to give effect to the recommendations of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal in the paragraphs of its report which I have quoted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this is a very good and necessary Bill.  I say that because I had experience some years ago of a harbour board.  The Bill provides a more elastic but, I think, more useful and less costly procedure than that afforded by Provisional Order, which was the procedure which had to be adopted heretofore.  I think it is quite right to implement the recommendations of the Tribunal in respect of the matters set out in the Bill because I think that it will not be possible to introduce any Bill which will carry out all the recommendations of that Tribunal.  The recommendations are very good but the diversity of matters dealt with and the interests of the different ports are such that it would be very difficult to frame a Bill which would embody all the recommendations. I was pleased to hear the Minister say that he will give consideration to any suggestions to carry out what, I think, he intended to carry out in the amendment which he introduced on the Report Stage of this Bill in the Dáil.  Speaking for myself, I think that the Bill is almost satisfactory as it is but, to make assurance doubly sure, I shall put forward a suggestion by the Cork Harbour Board for the Minister's consideration.  I think that it will effect what he intended to effect in the amendment which he introduced on Report Stage.  I think that this Bill should be passed into law as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I support the remarks made by Senator Dowdall.  It has been suggested from Cork&mdash;which, I hope, is not altogether against the suggestion &mdash;that the following amendment might be made:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Make it obligatory on the Minister to hold an inquiry if <Col N="1945" /> requested by the harbour authority concerned before making a harbour rates order, or</P>
    <P>(2)  that the Minister should follow the procedure laid down in the Cork Act&mdash;namely, that before making a harbour rates order he should cause notice of the proposal to make the order to be published and should consider any representations which may be made to him in consequence of such notice.</P>
    <P>I feel confident that the Minister will be able to satisfy Senator Dowdall, the Cork Harbour Commissioners and myself.</P>

      <P>Of the two suggestions made by Senator Crosbie, I was disposed to accept the second.  The suggestion was made originally that there should be a local inquiry in every case. That suggestion was, obviously, impracticable and undesirable, because, in the majority of cases where a harbour rates order is likely to be made, no opposition will be forthcoming; everybody will agree that the order should be made and, in these circumstances, it would be obviously undesirable to put the authority to the expense of a local inquiry.  The suggestion was then made that a local inquiry should be held whenever the harbour authority so desired.  That might be quite feasible in relation to the larger harbours but, in relation to some of the smaller harbours, it is undesirable because there might be a tendency to suggest a local inquiry without serious consideration and without any serious intention of paying the costs of the inquiry when held. The experience of the Department of Industry and Commerce is that it is very hard to get some of these small harbour authorities to pay anything. <Col N="1946" /> The second of the suggestions was preferable&mdash;that wherever it was intended to make, amend or revoke an order relating to harbour rates, notice of intention should be given and procedure laid down for the making of representations.  In the original Bill, it was provided that such notice would be given &ldquo;if the Minister at his discretion so directs.&rdquo;  In the amendment on the Report Stage, we deleted those words and said that notice of the proposed order &ldquo;shall be published at such time or times and in such manner as the Minister directs.&rdquo;  The wording of the sub-section however was left otherwise unaltered and it commences as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Whenever the Minister has made or proposes to make.&rdquo;  A fear was expressed that we might give notice of the intention after the Order was made and, consequently, on the Committee Stage in the Seanad, it is proposed to take out the words &ldquo;has made or&rdquo; with consequential amendments throughout, so that it will be quite clear whenever it is proposed to make an Order that the notice will be published and the representations made considered before the Order is, in fact, actually made.</P>

      <P>I am particularly anxious that no delay should take place in the preparation of the necessary legislation; but that is going to be a very big task and, although work is proceeding on it, I would not like to mention any definite date by which it is likely to be completed.  The work falls mainly on the transport section of the Department of Industry and Commerce, which has already a considerable volume of work placed upon it under the various Transport Acts that have been passed.  That work will ease off in the very near future and, when all the preliminary arrangements <Col N="1947" /> under these Acts have been completed, ordinary routine work will start again. When we arrive at that stage we should be able to make, in relation to this legislation, much more rapid progress than has been possible heretofore.</P>

      <P>With regard to the International Load Line Convention and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, a Bill embodying both conventions was before the House some weeks ago.  I do not think there was much discussion, but at least there was some discussion.  The International Load Line Convention fixes the manner of the load line marking of ships and the circumstances under which these load lines may or may not be observed.  The purpose is merely to secure uniformity between the various international regulations. The convention was ratified by the Saorstát and we have brought our legislation into conformity with it. It comes into operation on the 1st January.  I think that is the date <Col N="1948" /> generally agreed to between the countries concerned.</P>

      <P>This convention was given legislative effect in the same Bill as that which dealt with the Load Line Convention.  It embodies the recommendations of an international conference which considered the regulations that should be adopted in relation to the safety of life at sea.  There was an international conference after the Titanic disaster, but before it reached any conclusion the World War disrupted international harmony.  It was not until the World War was well over that international harmony was resumed and a new conference was summoned which produced a new convention. This deals with matters concerning lifeboats and lifebelts which ships must carry.  The purpose of the convention is merely to secure international uniformity.</P>
