      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 9.  To add at the end of the section the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provided that in the case of a person who had been employed on the tramway and who had prior to the critical date been awarded or received compensation under the Electricity (Supply) Acts, 1927-1932 or otherwise, such person shall be entitled to elect to apply for and obtain the compensation provided under this Act in lieu of such compensation <Col N="748" /> so awarded to or received by him and in the event of such person so electing it shall be a condition of his obtaining compensation under this Act that he shall refund to the appropriate authority the amount of compensation already awareded to or received by him under the said Acts or otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment applies to one of the late employees of the Cork Tramways Company.  I think the Minister is fully acquainted with the facts of the case and promised to look into it. I am prepared to accept whatever decision he comes to.</P>

      <P>I have been looking into the case of the individual Senator Crosbie has in mind, and I must say that I cannot feel I have got all the facts.  I was somewhat disconcerted by the amendment that has been tabled, because it seemed to indicate that there were some facts I had not obtained.  As I understand, the gentleman in question was manager of the Cork Tramways, and when they were taken over by the Irish Omnibus Company in April, 1931, his services were dispensed with, as the managing was done by the general manager of the Irish Omnibus Company.  On the termination of his services a certain payment was made to him by the company. The amendment suggests that the person concerned was in some way associated with the electric lighting undertaking, and that he was compensated under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927-1932.  As far as I am aware that is not the case.  As I have been informed, the person concerned was employed on the tramways, and was not entitled to compensation under the Electricity Supply Acts. The position in this case is somewhat peculiar.  While on the whole I feel that it might be desirable to make some alteration, so as to include the person concerned, there are considerations pointing in the other direction. The Cork Tramways ceased to be operated by the original owners in March, 1931, when they were taken over by the Irish Omnibus Company, <Col N="749" /> and were run by that company until September, 1931.  The transfer of management resulted in the termination of the appointment of this person. There is no doubt that if he had been continued in his employment until the tramways ceased to run he would be eligible for compensation under this Bill.  However, he received a gratuity from the company, although the amount does not appear to have been as substantial as he would have obtained under the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Crosbie stated that only one person was concerned.  Some doubt has also been cast on that assertion, by the inquiries which I have made, and consequently that makes it more difficult to deal with.  There was no time to prepare an amendment, but it appears to me the only amendment that would be necessary to cover this case, and any other possible case which might exist, if any, would be to change the critical date in the Bill from 30th September to 31st March. As far as I have been able to discover that would not involve any increase in the estimate of the cost, as the list of the employees on which the calculation was based was the list of the Cork Tramways Company and Electric Lighting Company.  Consequently it did not indicate any changes that may have taken place in the employment given in the tramways between the date on which the Irish Omnibus Company took them over and the date on which they ceased to run.  If the Seanad desires to deal with the matter, in lieu of Senator Crosbie's amendment, an amendment such as I suggest might be inserted, either by agreement at this stage, or by a postponement of this stage of the Bill. I would merely indicate that I would not propose to cease examination of the matter on the amendment of the Bill, as it might be possible that some fact would come to light which would alter the position, and necessitate some variation of the amendment, in which case I would move to have that variation made when the Bill goes back to the Dáil.  As far as I have been able to discover, that would not be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that if the critical <Col N="750" /> date in the Bill were changed from the date the tramways ceased to run, to the date on which they were taken over by the Irish Omnibus Company, the possibility of any such omission as Senator Crosbie seeks to guard against would be reduced.  No matter what date we select there is the possibility that there is a person whose employment was terminated a short time before and who may feel a grievance. There are two dates which can obviously be chosen without any suggestion of unfairness to anyone.  It is between these we must choose.  One is the date on which the trams ceased, bearing in mind that there may have been economies effected by the Omnibus Company during the short period in which they ran the trams, knowing that the service was going to cease in any case, and the date the tramways passed from the control of those who had been running them as a permanent service, into the hands of those who merely conducted them as a temporary service, pending the change over to omnibuses.  If the Cathaoirleach sees no objection, and if the Seanad is agreeable I move:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 2: To delete in line 34 the words and figures, &ldquo;30th day of September&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words and figures &ldquo;31st day of March.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to the Minister for the suggestion he has made.  I know that he will give sympathetic consideration to the claim of this man, and I hope he will be able to see his way to give him compensation. It is one of the hard cases that invariably crop up.  I beg to withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister suggested this amendment himself, because I think it augurs well for the speedy passage of the Bill through the Dáil.  There are a great number of these tramway men in a bad way in Cork, and their claims have been a long time outstanding.  I hope the Minister will hurry the Bill through in <Col N="751" /> order to meet the great distress that exists amongst the ex-tramway employees in Cork.</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Products (Regulation of Export) Bill, 1933&mdash;Committee Stage.</Title>
    <P>In this Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Agriculture; the expression &ldquo;agricultural product&rdquo; includes any product of agriculture or horticulture and any article of food or drink wholly or partly manufactured or derived from any such product, and fleeces and skins of animals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 1.  To delete in lines 23-4 the words &ldquo;and any article of food or drink wholly or partly manufactured or derived from any such product.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will remember that when we were discussing the Second Reading of this Bill, I drew attention to the extremely wide scope of the conditions and especially to the definitions in the first clause.  If Senators will look at the amendments I have put down they will see that they all deal with the restriction of the commodities to be dealt with by the Bill to agricultural products.  In moving these amendments I disclaim any idea whatever of interfering with the Minister for Agriculture in his desire to obtain powers to enable him to deal with the question of quotas with which, as he says, he <Col N="752" /> has to deal and for which he has to get powers almost at once because the quota question is coming into prominence in connection with agricultural exports.  As far as I am concerned, I have no intention whatever of interfering with the Bill, so far as these products are concerned.  That is a matter that lies purely and simply between the Minister and agriculturists.  The words, however, which I want to take out of Section 1 altogether go beyond anything really connected with agriculture. The section reads: &ldquo;The expression agricultural product includes any product of agriculture or horticulture.&rdquo;  Then come the words which I want deleted&mdash;&ldquo;and any article of food or drink wholly or partly manufactured or derived from any such product.&rdquo;  I am not interfering with the succeeding phrase, which deals with fleeces and skins of animals. If Senators read this section they will see that very large industries in this country which are totally disconnected with agriculture are brought under this Bill and can be dealt with by the Minister for Agriculture.  If such industries are to be dealt with, they should surely be dealt with by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. One can hardly expect our Minister for Agriculture, no matter what qualifications he may possess, to be able to deal with all the intricacies of most serious and large industries.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion on which I spoke on this Bill I mentioned the industry with which I am connected and I pointed out that the Minister for Agriculture could under this Bill proceed to deal with our industry under the regulations of this Bill.  That is why I have had to put forward two other amendments, one of which is to delete paragraph (c) of sub-section (1), Section 2.  That paragraph says, in dealing with these various commodities, the Minister shall have power to make an order providing &ldquo;for requiring persons to export to such country during any specified period or periods a specified quantity of such product.&rdquo; I leave out the question of agricultural products and I hold the Minister can deal with them if he deletes the words I want omitted.  Again, you will <Col N="753" /> see that the other sub-section which I propose to delete is a sub-section dealing with penalties which might be very severe.  I would commend the attention of agriculturists to these penalties.  The sub-section runs:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may in any export order provide that where he incurs expense under this section by reason or in consequence of the failure of any person to do any specified thing which such person is authorised or required by or under such order to do, the Minister may recover such expense from such person as a simple contract debt, and the Minister may by such order provide that the certificate of the Minister shall be conclusive evidence of the incurring of such expense and of the amount of such expense.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister is to proceed to recover from the individual trader who is ordered to export these things the cost of buying and exporting them.  I would ask Senators to take their minds away from such matters as pigs or cattle and apply this section to the industry which I mentioned on the last day. The Minister might approach the distillers and say that it would be a good thing to sell a certain quantity of our Irish whiskey abroad.  He has powers under these three sub-sections which I have mentioned to proceed to order us to sell a quantity of whiskey abroad to some unknown country.  He could not possibly have any knowledge whatever as to the effect of such an order upon our trade. He says, of course, that he will appoint a committee to deal with this section.  When you come into a trade such as ours and appoint other distillers or other people to sit down and require from us the whole of the information regarding everything connected with our business and expect them to decide what we are going to do with our product, I think the House will clearly see that a situation will arise with which I doubt if even the Minister himself will be capable of dealing.</P>
    <P>I have said the Department of Industry and Commerce is the proper Department to deal with this matter. A very strange thing has happened since the last occasion on which we <Col N="754" /> debated this matter.  I think the House was rather amused when I pointed out that we might have a shortage of various things in this country.  I said rather jokingly that we might be even short of the product with which I deal.  Sometimes strange coincidences occur.  The very next day we received a very friendly letter from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is trying to do his best to assist our business.  It was a confidential letter connected with the trade in America, and it asked how much whiskey could be sold in America by our firm.  I do not think I am disclosing anything which is confidential, because it was really a friendly letter. The Minister in that letter wanted particulars of our stocks, the price and the age of the whiskey&mdash;in fact, every thing connected with the details of our business.  I am going, of course, to take this matter up with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We are all interested in the American business, and are doing our best to profit by it. What I am pointing out, however, is that it is a very extraordinary thing that the Minister for Agriculture should have power to do in the case of our products what he seeks to do under this Bill.  I do think the Minister ought to leave us out of this. I think the Minister should define much more clearly the commodities with which he really wants to deal.  I do not think the House can deal properly with the Bill unless that is done.  I am sure there are included under the heading of agricultural products, sundry things which the people who deal in them would not like to be affected by this Bill, but I think it is going altogether too far to give general powers to the Minister to deal with anything which is included under the first definition clause.</P>
    <P>I have shown that in one instance, at any rate, an industry with which I think the whole country is intimately connected can be dealt with in a way that is not desirable under this Bill. I should like to hear what the Minister's objections are to defining the articles he really wants to deal with in the Bill, and to letting the House, in these circumstances, say &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; or <Col N="755" />&ldquo;no,&rdquo; as regards the matters to be dealt with.  I do not want to interfere with giving powers to the Minister to deal with matters with which he is competent to deal, but it is quite wrong, I suggest, to give the Minister the widespread powers which would be conferred by this Bill.  Unless the Minister can explain the matter more clearly, I think we should pass these amendments and take these various articles which are connected with manufacture and not with agriculture, clean out of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole urgency for this Bill according to the Minister's statement on the last occasion was that the British Ministry are preparing a quota in reference to bacon.  Is bacon an agricultural product?  I suggest that it is partly manufactured.  It is derived from agriculture, but bacon alone of itself is not an agricultural product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Senator A Senator">
      <NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
      <P>Is butter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of bacon at the moment.  If amendment No. 1 is passed, it is very questionable whether bacon will be covered by the Bill.  It has to undergo a process of manufacture or derivation from agricultural product.  It is not directly an agricultural product in the form of bacon.  Therefore, it has to undergo some process so that the passing of the amendment would mean the rejection of the Bill in so far as it applies to bacon, which is the one item for which it is urgently required.  With regard to drink, I suppose milk is a drink and might be said to be an agricultural product.  Is cream an agricultural product? It is not an industrial product unless it has been treated in some way.  It has to be derived from what might be admitted for the moment to be a direct agricultural product, but unless the part of the definition which the Senator desires to be deleted remains in, it is questionable whether cream could be brought within the operation of the Act.  I lay stress, however, on this one item of bacon, and I say that the passing of the amendment would make the whole Bill inoperative <Col N="756" /> in so far as it affects the immediate purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Jameson, because the industry with which he is connected is a very important one in relation to the county from which I come.  We are the greatest barley growers in Ireland, and on account of that industry I should like to support Senator Jameson's amendment as far as possible. I could not agree with Senator Johnson in his arguments about cream.  It is not a manufactured article.  It goes through no process except merely the process of separation from the milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be stretching it very far to say that that was manufacture. Butter, of course, does go through a process of manufacture, but to suggest that the mere fact that the cream which is separated from the milk is a process of manufacture is stretching the thing very far indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to suggest to Senator Jameson that he should withdraw his amendment.  As Senator Johnson has said, and as the Minister has pointed out, the urgent question at the moment is the question of pigs and pig products.  I do not think anybody could find fault with the Minister for seeking powers to deal with these, but those powers are very drastic.  On reading this Bill, I did not at first consider it so very serious, as I had not enough time to study it carefully.  Bills are coming in so fast that we cannot study them carefully or give proper attention to them, but after Senator Jameson's speech on Second Reading, I read the Bill more carefully, and I found that it was very drastic.  I hope the House will not agree to give the Minister the drastic powers he seeks in this Bill with regard to articles other than pigs and pig products. For that reason, I would ask that the amendment be withdrawn and an amendment substituted to the effect that the Bill shall apply to pigs and pig products only.  Senator Jameson mentioned Section 2 of the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is very important from your point of view, I have no doubt, but it does not arise on this section.  Senator Jameson travelled a little far afield but I shall call the section again and you can then talk on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the Bill, the Minister can only deal with a product which some other country has placed under a quota system and even if Senator Jameson's whiskey were placed under a quota system, I do not see what harm the Minister would do. I do not for a moment believe that it will be placed under a quota.  As a matter of fact, at the present time the strength of alcohol allowed into America is only 3.2 per cent., and I am sure Senator Jameson's whiskey is stronger than that.  Last night, I found that out.  I do not think the Senator need fear that his product will be interfered with because I have never yet heard, in all that I have heard of quotas, of any country putting a quota on whiskey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Wilson's argument shows a degree of, shall I say, innocence which is not usual to him and particularly, when he talks about the United States.  I think his line of argument that because he has never <Col N="758" /> heard of something it is all right to include it under a definition in the Bill is not one that you could possibly justify.  I am not going to make prophecies and I certainly know nothing whatever about what is going to happen with regard to the whiskey trade but I am pretty certain that if the present attitude of the various nations continues and no kind of economic agreement is come to, you may see all kinds of devices used by nations and they will not be devices that Senator Wilson has heard of before in many cases.  The argument, if I understand it correctly, put forward by certain Senators, and by Senator Johnson in particular, is that in order to include cream, pigs' heads and other things you must have this extremely wide definition.  I think that is a mistake and that it is far better to go definitely for certain commodities and state them or if you are not prepared to do that, to provide as Senator Counihan suggests for the commodity you want to deal with.  Instead of having the provision as set out here that an order may be made by the Minister which will set out all the various provisions including power to force a person to export etc., it would, in my opinion, be better to provide that the Minister may by order, subject to the approval of the House, extend the commodities to which this Bill will apply.  That would be a much simpler form and would not create the uneasiness which would be caused by the present provisions.  There are a number of us here who feel&mdash;and I know that Senator Johnson is one in spite of his attitude on this Bill&mdash;that we have in the past made mistakes through granting far too much power, in many cases, unintentionally, by passing Bill which can be used for totally different purposes altogether.  I would suggest to the Minister that if he is not prepared to limit this and to make clear what it does apply to, it would be far better to apply it to pigs and to provide in the Bill that it may be extended to other agricultural products by an order laid on the Table of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may reply that this can only apply when an order is made and <Col N="759" /> that the Bill really provides what I am suggesting.  In case he does give that answer I should like to give my reply in advance.  It is that the position is quite different.  Supposing, for the sake of argument, we are dealing in this Bill now with pigs and supposing we have butter or cream to deal with, say, in a fortnight's time. The Minister makes an order including cream and no one in this House will object but if he makes an order under the Bill as it stands and includes in that order all the powers which this Bill gives him with regard to cream, a great many of us may object.  We may object to the power in the order to force, as he could under the Bill, persons to export cream although they did not want to.  We may object to certain other things but I need not go into details.  If you do as I suggest, however, the Minister will retain his power so far as the particular commodity is concerned and either House can object to the specific order and the specific provisions in it.  If you leave it as it is now, you can do nothing but disapprove of the order.  You cannot amend the order; you can only annul it and if the Minister makes an order applying to a new commodity and if the members of the House are satisfied that the order should be made in regard to that commodity but are not satisfied as to the details of the order, they must say: &ldquo;You must not deal with that commodity at all&rdquo; or they must accept the whole thing.  That is what I object to&mdash;it is giving very specific executive power without any control by the House.  If the Minister would include such commodities as he requires now or has reason to believe he may require in the near future and take power to extend it by order, he will get everything he wants.  There will be no unreasonable delay and I think he would get over Senator Jameson's difficulty.  He certainly would get over the difficulty I see.</P>

      <P>After all, can there be any possible objection to naming in the Bill the different commodities which the Minister finds it necessary to export? That is the simplest way of dealing with it and the less wide these Acts are the better because, as Senator Jameson has pointed out very clearly to us, it gives the Minister the opportunity of putting searching questions to business people and business people have not got the time and certainly they have not got much inclination to answer these things.  I suggest that the Senator is perfectly right when he says that we are entitled to know the various commodities which the Minister intends to regulate by quota.</P>

      <P>I think that some of the Senators are unduly perturbed about my powers under this Bill.  First of all, what Senator Johnson says is quite right.  If we were to accept the amendment proposed by Senator Jameson, the Bill would be absolutely useless to us, because we would not be allowed to deal with bacon, butter, condensed milk, cheese or oatmeal. Every one of those products is going to be put under a quota system by the British Government if they carry out their present intentions.  Bacon, condensed milk, cheese and oatmeal are to be put under the quota system before Christmas if they carry out their intentions and, if I were to adopt the suggestion of Senator Douglas, I would have to call the Seanad together from week to week as each matter arose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not my suggestion.  My suggestion was that the Minister should take powers in the Bill to extend the Bill by order to any commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is how the Bill stands.  I must issue an order for each commodity under this Bill.  It is the only way it can be done.  The first part of Section 2 provides: &ldquo;If any country to which any agricultural product is usually exported from Saorstát Eireann establishes any system of restriction or control of the import of that agricultural product,&rdquo; then an order must be made.  I must issue an order for each agricultural product to each country.  There must be a separate order issued, and that order must be laid on the Table of the two Houses.  Within the next 21 sitting days either House can annul it if they think well of doing so.  With regard to the four articles that have been mentioned, I would be excluded from dealing with them if Great Britain introduced a quota system in regard to them before Christmas.  I may say, too, that the definition here is exactly the same as the definition in the British Act and in the North of Ireland Act.  We thought it well to have the same definition, because our Bill is more or less a reply, if you like, to the British Act.  The British Act lays it down that they will not deal with any country that does not bring in the administrative machinery to deal with quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if the powers are the same in the two Acts that he has referred to: that is, as regards the things that can be done by order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not gone through the North of Ireland Act, but the definition in this Bill is the same as the definition in the North of Ireland Act and in the British Act.  As I said before, if we want to take a quota from Great Britain in the case of bacon then we are compelled to have an Act such as this, or some regulation, setting up the necessary administrative machinery.  This Bill is the <Col N="762" /> administrative machinery that we propose to set up.  Unless powers are taken so that the Government can regulate the export of the global quota, then Great Britain will not give us a quota.  Therefore, we are obliged to take those powers.  Suppose for instance&mdash;I think it is unlikely&mdash; that Great Britain introduced a quota system for whiskey, stout or biscuits we could not take a part of the quota for these articles from Great Britain unless we had the power to deal with it in this way.  Therefore, if whiskey, stout and biscuits are excluded in this Bill there will be no necessity to regulate these industries because they will not get any part of that quota. You cannot get a quota unless you have the administrative machinery to deal with it.  I cannot interfere with a trade unless there is a quota adopted by some country with which we are carrying on a trade in the ordinary way.  I cannot interfere unless two things occur: (1) first of all that you must have a country with which we are trading and (2) that such a country has adopted a quota system. Unless these two conditions are fulfilled I cannot intervene.  If these two conditions are present, then I can make an order for each commodity exported to each country.  That order must be laid on the Table of the two Houses.  Either House can annul it within the next 21 sitting days, so that I think both Houses are amply safeguarded as regards any objections they wish to make to any order issued in the case of any commodity.</P>
      <P>Suppose, for instance, there was a quota for whiskey.  If I make an order I must first of all set up a consultative council.  Sub-section (2) of Section 5 lays down:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A consultative council established under this section shall consist of such persons having experience or special knowledge of the matters on which such council may give advice or assistance to the Minister as the Minister, after such consultation as aforesaid, shall from time to time nominate to be members thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, in case Senator Jameson has any doubts about the matter I <Col N="763" /> want to assure him that under that sub-section I would not be permitted to go out and nominate anybody I wished to act on that consultative council.  I am compelled under the sub-section to nominate persons &ldquo;having experience or special knowledge of the matters&rdquo; dealt with under the order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 5 says that the Minister &ldquo;may.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the sub-section that I have quoted says &ldquo;shall consist of such persons&rdquo; and so on.  I am advised by the draftsman that &ldquo;may&rdquo; there means &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  I think Senators need not be so apprehensive about the powers taken under this Bill because the Minister cannot possibly interfere with a trade except in the circumstances I have mentioned.  A trade must be organised under the Government in order to get part of the quota at all.  If they are not organised then they will not get it.  That is why the Bill is introduced.  If, for instance, I found that the people in the whiskey trade did not want to export whiskey I could not compel them to do so.  If they refused to register I cannot touch them.  I cannot compel exporters to register.  Therefore, I do not see where the apprehension arises at all.</P>

      <P>I think that my friends on the opposite side ought not to press this amendment.  The Minister has said that the definition in the Bill is in identical terms with the words in the statutes relating to Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  I should be very much surprised if that were not the case.  I accept the Minister's word because he has said it, but I also accept it because it is a reasonable thing. Does this definition section go so far as Senator Douglas seems to think? &ldquo;any article wholly or partly manufactured or derived.&rdquo;  Senators may think that embraces almost everything, but that is not so.  Did Senators observe this &ldquo;and fleeces and skins of animals&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>I am trying to put to my friends on the opposite side the contention that the amplitude of these words is really more apparent than real.  Although it may mean whiskey, because whiskey, of course, is derived from barley, a little yeast and some brown sugar, and beer is derived from barley and yeast, I would say that whiskey, beer and biscuits would come within this section.  I do not know that very much more would come within it.  The Minister has called attention to sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 5.  He must have a consultative council, it must consist of the leading men in the particular business that he is dealing with.  Senator Douglas who reads all these Acts of Parliament with meticulous care has called attention to the fact that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used in sub-section (1) of Section 5.  Now I hope Senator Douglas will not attribute anything that I say to the Minister because that has been his practice. As a Senator I say that &ldquo;may&rdquo; in that case means &ldquo;must&rdquo; and not &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and that the Minister in this special legislation dealing with quotas and with the lives of the people must consult with the men engaged in the trade before he can make any order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator tell us the meaning of the words that immediately follow &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;whenever and so often as he thinks fit&rdquo;?  Does that mean that the Minister &ldquo;must whenever and so often as he thinks fit&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>These words relate to time and to the terms of reference, but you are not giving the Minister complete authority over you.  You are not making him a dictator.  A dictatorship would be absolutely impossible in this country, because, as I said before, and I believe said truly, if there were 3,000,000 Irish people in Russia there could never be a dictator in Russia.  If you are giving the Minister certain powers in this Bill, there is no use in unnecessarily limiting those powers. He will have to deal with countries in which the fashion for the time being is quotas.  He will have to bargain and to look after his exports and his imports.  I think you should give him <Col N="765" /> as much authority as you think is necessary.  I believe this Bill represents the minimum of what he ought to get.  I know that the objection of Senator Jameson and Senator Douglas is not a factious one, but I think they are not exactly reasonable in regard to this measure.</P>
      <P>Now we do not know where we are going.  We have to deal with what is called a quota system.  It is very fashionable at the present moment.  I do not think this quota system will last very long, but, long or short, we are dealing with it and I think we ought to give our Minister for Agriculture all the authority that he can reasonably ask for.  I do not believe that on a construction of this sub-section the Minister is getting as much authority as would appear from a first reading of it.  It must be wholly or partly a product of agriculture.  Senators will see that the things that are not regarded as a product of agriculture in this sub-section are &ldquo;fleeces and skins of animals.&rdquo;  I would imagine that these were a product of agriculture because animals are fed on root and other crops grown on the land.  The definition shows that the wording is limited and very strictly limited in this section.  Although, of course, we are not supposed to take precedents from other countries, I have always found that in those statutes passed by the Imperial Parliament the rights of the subject are all carefully looked after&mdash;I mean that Ministers are not given more power than is absolutely necessary to meet the circumstances of the case.  If you limit this in the way that has been indicated by Senator Douglas, I think you will tie the hands of the Minister and prevent him from being able to do his business.  The Minister must set up a consultative council.  He must consult the members of that council which will be composed of the principal men in that particular trade. That being so, I think it would be wrong for the House to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister could tell the House what is the procedure adopted in other countries outside of Great Britain where quotas <Col N="766" /> are adopted.  The quota system is in operation between various European countries for quite a good while.  I wonder is this Bill based upon the experience of the successful procedure adopted in these countries.  The quota system is comparatively old now and there must be a certain recognised procedure adopted by countries that have had to deal with it.  Is this Bill based upon the experience of the successful and satisfactory procedure adopted in these countries?  To me the principal danger arising out of a Bill of this kind is the amount of graft that can enter into it. When you license exporters and give them a monopoly of export, just as when you license importers of any particular article, you are likely to have discrimination and favouritism employed, injustice done, prices ordered accordingly, and a good deal of corruption enter into it.  I wonder is there a real danger, if licensed exporters in regard to any of the commodities mentioned are appointed, that they will not export a sufficient quantity.  I fancy it is a very remote danger, because, obviously, the effect of the quota will be that we shall be permitted to import into Great Britain a smaller quantity of any particular commodity than is now the case.  Why there should be a danger in that case of there being a shortage or a failure on the part of a licensed exporter to meet his commitment, I cannot see.  This question of &ldquo;may&rdquo; as against &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is one of those puzzles and quibbles of the law that I am unable to understand. If it should be &ldquo;must,&rdquo; I do not see why &ldquo;must&rdquo; should not be put down, or why we should resort to the musty precedents of always putting in a word which means the reverse of what it does in ordinary life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Seanad is dealing with this matter rather too casually, if I might say so, and that the interests concerned are much more vital than the House seems to think. I take it from what the Minister says that he is taking powers under this Bill to deal with articles of food and drink manufactured from grain in this country&mdash;that both stout and whiskey are now being placed under the control of the Minister under the powers embodied in this Bill.  These are very difficult industries to deal with, industries which require the closest attention of those engaged in them, and industries which will be broken to pieces if you put anybody in control of them who does not know the conditions under which they are carried on.  If the Oireachtas choose to hand over to the State, as they are doing in this Bill, power to control those industries, you are very likely going to see those industries depart out of the Free State.  The Seanad seems to think that I am talking in an exaggerated way about dangers of this kind.  I shall give one or two instances from my own business to show that if the State were to issue an order to us to send away a certain quantity of whiskey to keep up the quota, and were to buy it from us, they would straight away ruin our business.  Whiskey is an article which has to be kept for over seven years before it can be sold.  The stocks of these old spirits are in many hands. They are in Northern Ireland; they are in Great Britain; they are in the hands both of distillers and bonders who bought them in previous years. The management of those stocks and the regulation of the product required to keep those stocks right form one of the most difficult problems that anybody has to face.  If the Minister were suddenly to find out that to keep up the quota with Great Britain, say, a certain quantity of whiskey had to be sent over there, and supposing that he said to us that we must export a certain quantity of whiskey to Great <Col N="768" /> Britain to complete the quota, every calculation that we had made as to the different markets to which whiskey is supplied would be upset, and it might completely ruin our trade with other countries, and even in this country.  If a consultative council is set up and proceeds to demand from us details of the stocks held, before whom would the details be laid?  Every competitor we have in the trade.  I do not know of any surer method of ruining a business than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like to deal with the question of porter and ales, but I was a brewer for 25 years.  I know the business relations between Great Britain and various other countries.  If the Minister attempted to issue orders to any individual brewer that he was at a certain time to export a certain quantity of his product to any particular country, he might quite easily ruin that individual.  How could anybody know what are the private conditions connected with the business of any particular brewer?  The mere disclosure of the stocks of a concern as applied to one of our greatest industries here would be one of the most dangerous things that the Free State ever touched.  The Bill should not be passed without taking these particular things out and that can best be done by defining what the Bill has to deal with.  I assure the Seanad that they had better ask for a short postponement until we consider the situation. I am asking that in all seriousness.  It is not a thing to be dealt with casually. You are dealing with manufactures which are vital and of the greatest importance to the Free State.  I would ask the Seanad not to be in a hurry and to postpone the consideration of the Bill until we see the real implications of it.  I would ask the Seanad not to proceed further with the Bill to-day. It has not been adequately discussed. No speech made to-day showed that Senators really grasped the seriousness of the situation and nothing that the Minister has said has shown that he grasps the seriousness of the situation. My amendments are only put forward with the object of removing the dangers from the Bill.  We should have seriously considered amendments by <Col N="769" /> the Minister himself to guard against the dangers which I am referring to. How long have the various industries concerned got to come together and consider what the Bill means and to make suggestions?  We have not had any time.  I would ask the Seanad seriously to consider whether, under the circumstances, it is not advisable that the Bill should be postponed at least until we meet again.  There has been nothing put forward to show that we do not want the Minister to get any powers which he really wants.  I am warning the Seanad that the Minister is being given powers in regard to some of the industries included in this Bill that may ruin these industries. These are powers that ought to be taken out of the Bill.  I do not really know what is the best way to do it, but if this amendment is rejected I warn the Seanad that they are doing a most dangerous thing.  I suggest to the Minister that we should be given at least until we meet again to seriously consider this Bill, so that the industries brought under the Bill may consider the matter themselves and see what suggestions can be made to remedy the position.  We should do nothing in a hurry which is going to endanger some of the industries on which the Free State depends very largely.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out to the House that I have allowed Senator Jameson to debate the second amendment which he has on the paper because he considered it part and parcel of the first amendment.  His second amendment deals specifically with the matters he dealt with in his speech. The amendment is to delete the subsection requiring persons &ldquo;to export to such country during any specified period or periods a specified quantity of such product.&rdquo;  He wants that excluded by the second amendment and that seems to be a proper safeguard. That is what he has been arguing in his last speech.  As far as I allowed him to do that because I thought the amendments were part and parcel of one another, perhaps I did mislead the House and may have held up some Senator unwittingly from arguing further matters.</P>

Senator Jameson has said a good many things which are worthy of the most mature consideration of this House, and which ought to be debated in it.  He told us something new in relation to whiskey, that it would ruin him, or men like him, if they were compelled to export a certain quantity.

Is it that he would be compelled to export raw spirit, so as to make up the consignment?  I would like to know <Col N="771" /> what the Senator means.  I would like to know the extent to which the trade in whiskey would be injured or might be injured.  That is a matter very well worthy of consideration.  If Irish distillers were placed in such a position that they would have to export immature spirit, or had to get spirit from distilleries which are not so good as Senator Jameson's distilleries, that might ruin their trade.  I quite admit that it might ruin their trade.  The Senator said that he was a brewer for twenty-five years.  I suppose as a distiller he must have been a brewer.</P>

In this country we produce beer which is probably the finest alcoholic product in the world, because it contains just enough and not too much.  There is substance in it, eating and drinking.

We have to deal with other nations, and not merely Great <Col N="772" /> Britain which, I understand from the Minister, are contemplating the establishment of quotas.  I have some little knowledge of Great Britain, and I imagine that it will be some little time before quotas are established there.  France has a quota system, Germany has a quota system. All the nations have gone in for the new fashion.  How long they are going to continue it I do not know.  While that position is facing us in regard to our exports, we should be prepared to give the Minister the greatest possible facilities and the fullest powers.

      <P>Perhaps the Minister wants the Bill.  He can have the important portions of it if he accepts the suggestion I made, to apply it only to pigs and to pig products.  If he will confine it to these products I think the House is prepared to give him the Bill to-day.  Otherwise, I am inclined to agree with Senator Jameson that we should adjourn consideration of it until we meet again.  It is a very drastic Bill.  It practically makes the Minister for Agriculture a dictator as regards the products and manufactures that are to be exported.  No matter how important Senator Comyn may consider whiskey and beer exports, there is a much more important consideration, the export of cattle, and the conditions under which they are to be exported.  I suggest to the House, and to Senator Comyn, that many more people will be thrown out of employment or will lose their means of livelihood if the Bill is carried out in the only way that the Minister wants to do so.  There are over 3,000 persons engaged in the cattle trade.  There are thousands engaged in the sheep, horse and pig trades, to whom no consideration is given.  The Minister stated that he consulted everyone in connection with the pig and bacon trades.  There are only about 250 people connected with the pig and the bacon trades, while, according to the statistics, thousands are engaged in the cattle trade, and three-quarters of all the farmers derive their principal livelihood from that trade.  Senator Jameson's suggestion should be adopted and consideration of this Bill should be adjourned for a fortnight in view of the fact that few Senators read the Bill until they heard what Senator Jameson had to say on the Second Reading.  If the Minister wants the <Col N="774" /> Bill he should accept the suggestion that has been made, to apply it to pigs and other produce, and to give time for consideration of other products and manufactures.</P>

      <P>Senator Jameson and Senator Counihan based a good deal of their criticism upon the danger of the Minister interfering unduly with the conduct of their respective businesses, or any other business which might possibly be brought within the region of the definition.  I suppose we need not advert specifically to the terms of the amendment, because the whole principle of the Bill is involved in this discussion.  The Minister referred to the Northern Ireland Act which is parallel with this.  It is not exactly the same, because it is called the Agricultural Marketing Act (Northern Ireland), 1933, and has specific reference to British agricultural development schemes.  The Minister read the definition of the Northern Ireland Act.  It is very likely the same in the British Act. It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Agricultural product&rdquo; includes any product of agriculture or horticulture and any article of food or drink wholly or partly manufactured or derived from any such product, and fleeces and the skins of animals.</P>
      <P>I read in Section 14 of the Northern Ireland Act:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Ministry may by regulations make such provisions as appears to the Ministry to be necessary for all or any of the following purposes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  for giving full effect to this Act:</P>
      <P>(b)  for regulating the removal from Northern Ireland into Great Britain of any agricultural product&mdash;</P>
      <P>including manufactured articles, which Senators fear would include cattle</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;the marketing of which is regulated by a scheme for the time being in force under this Act or under the Act of 1931, the quantity of the product or of any description thereof which may be so removed, and the descriptions <Col N="775" /> of the product which may be so removed, and in particular (without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision of this paragraph) for the following matters:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the registration of persons carrying on business in Northern Ireland as dealers in the regulated product:</P>
    <P>(ii)  the exemption from registration of such classes of persons carrying on business as aforesaid as the regulations may specify:</P>
    <P>(c)  for constituting, for the purposes of this Act, committees composed of representatives of persons carrying on business as dealers in a regulated product;</P>
    <P>(d)  for subserving the purposes of any order under Part I of the United Kingdom Act regulating sales of an agricultural product; which includes whiskey, beer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just taking one portion of it.</P>
      <P>For giving effect to the provisions of a development scheme under Part II of the United Kingdom Act in so far as that development scheme is applicable to an agricultural product the marketing of which is regulated by a scheme administered by a board under this Act.</P>
      <P>Bear in mind, all this may be done by regulations to be made by the Minister which regulations are to be laid on the Table.  Then we have Section 15 of the Northern Ireland Act which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any officer authorised by the Ministry shall have power to enter at all reasonable times and to inspect</P>
      <P>(a)  any land or premises occupied or used by any person registered as a dealer under regulations made under this Act for the purposes of his businesses as such dealer; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  any land or premises which the Ministry has reason to believe <Col N="776" /> to be occupied or used by any person for the purpose of producing, selling, grading, marking, packing or storing any regulated product.</P>
    <P>The Ministry may for the purposes of this Act by order require any producer of, or a person carrying on business as a dealer in, a regulated product to make to the Ministry at such time or times and in such form and manner as may be prescribed by the order, returns as to the production, sales and stocks of the regulated product, and also, in the case of a dealer, returns as to purchasers of the regulated product.</P>
    <P>So far as these powers are concerned, which the Northern Ministry has, and which are the powers objected to, they are rather beyond the powers given in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has been dealing with a lot of clauses but would he say where such powers as are given in Section 2 are given in that Act?  He is wandering quite outside what we are talking about.  The provision I have been objecting to is that requiring to export.  Is that in the clause which the Senator has read?  If he is going to deal with the matter he must deal with it fully.  He must compare the powers fully in each Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers in the Act are entirely unknown.  They are such as the Ministry in Northern Ireland may wish to make by regulation&mdash;any powers they wish to regulate the trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland in respect of agricultural products.  So far as I can read the Bill it is rather limiting than extending and while the specific reference to the power to export is only in this Bill, that is because of the different circumstances of the two countries.  As the Minister pointed out if these powers are not taken then the power to export any commodity that is quota-ed is destroyed.  The whole question seems to me to be whether an industry desires to have its export trade conserved.  If we want to have it destroyed then we should refuse the powers given in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I desire to say that I agree with the suggestion made that the Committee Stage of the Bill should be postponed until Wednesday, 16th August.  One has to appreciate the manner in which Senator Jameson fought for the industry with which he has such a long and honourable association but another aspect of the case has to be cited also.  The purpose apparently of the two chief protagonists of these amendments is to make a fight for the particular industries with which they are concerned. Senator Jameson is making a fight for the whiskey industry and Senator Counihan for the cattle trade. They are both inclined to disregard other industries to be covered such as cheese, butter, bacon and oatmeal.  They are making a case for their specific industries and the House is led to believe by a series of inferences, that no case can be made for the other industries which would be allowed to remain under the Bill.  That is not so.  When we are dealing with these matters we should be perfectly fair and we should say whether we have given each industry concerned due consideration. I have given this matter full consideration and I have already made up my mind in regard to it.  Senator Jameson for instance spoke of the tremendous damage that might be done to his industry by the application of the powers given in this Bill.  He said that stocks of whiskey might be held in various depots outside the country and if the Minister, to complete a quota, had to call upon certain supplies to meet orders in other countries, irreparable damage might be done to the industry.  Does that not apply to any other industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jameson wants to restrict the application of the Bill to certain articles.  I shall take the one product to which most reference has been made, bacon.  I listened to a speech of a Senator during the week who is a director of a co-operative bacon undertaking in this country, an undertaking which merits every form of support, being run by farmers on a co-operative basis &mdash;an undertaking which has made good. What is their position?  Their position <Col N="778" /> was that at the beginning they were compelled to export but as time went on they concentrated on the home market and their entire output is now practically absorbed in the home market.  They export a certain amount but not very much.  If the terrible things to which Senator Jameson referred are likely to occur in respect to one industry, if the Minister disregards the best interests of the industry under this quota arrangement, what is to happen in respect to co-operative bacon undertakings?  Their chief trade is in this country and the Minister may come along in an exactly parallel case to that quoted by Senator Jameson and he may compel that undertaking to export half of their output and so to neglect the home market.  What is going to be the result?  They are going to lose their home trade.  If the Minister concentrates on that factory they must lose that trade and irreparable damage may be done to that undertaking. When we are dealing with the Bill, I think we should not apply it to certain commodities and exclude other commodities.  Either the Bill is a good one or it is not.  Either the Minister should not be given these powers to deal with any commodity or he should be given them to deal with all commodities. Do not differentiate between beer, cheese and cattle.  Do not differentiate between cheese and whiskey.  Do not differentiate between oatmeal and Senator Comyn's beer. It is said that irreparable damage may be done to some of these industries but I take it that the Seanad will deal with the Bill as a whole and, in considering the merits of the various industries, remember that they are necessary in building up the nation economically, that one is as necessary to build up the nation economically, as the other.  We should have time to deal with the merits of the Bill as a whole.  I want to be perfectly fair to Senator Jameson and to Senator Counihan and to give the House an opportunity of considering the matter further.  I want the House to bear in mind that no case has been made out for differentiating against any industry.  It is possible that the Bill should be further examined to see <Col N="779" /> that no unnecessary hardships will be inflicted on any industry and accordingly I move that the further consideration of the Bill be postponed until 16th August.</P>

      <P>I should just like to say that I know that the Seanad can regulate its own procedure but I would like Senators seriously to consider the very serious proposition that has been made to postpone the further consideration of the Bill for a fortnight.  We have been pressed within the last few days to have our machinery brought in and to have it ready.  Our representatives in Great Britain have been giving undertakings that this Bill will be through in the shortest possible time. If the Seanad decides otherwise, we shall have to take the risk of that.  I cannot influence the Seanad any further but I just want to put before them that it is a rather serious step. Possibly we may not do as well in reference to the quotas as if we had our administrative machinery prepared. I am not using that as a threat.  I am saying that it may possibly happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to move an amendment to confine this Bill to pigs. I absolutely agree with Senator O'Hanlon that it is unfair for anybody to speak for one particular industry, to try to get that industry excluded and leave the Bill as it is for other industries, even though it is a harsh Bill.  If the Seanad believe that it is harsh for one industry, they ought to try to make the Bill apply equally to every industry, so that everybody will have a fair chance under it.  I think if Senator Jameson and Senator Counihan would only realise how the Bill is going to work they could not possibly object to it.  I would like to say that in the first place we are only going to apply it where we have been doing a trade in a certain country in a certain commodity.  We could not compel anybody to export cattle say, to <Col N="780" /> Turkey, because we had not been doing that trade with Turkey before.  It would be only to carry on the normal trade, as it were that this Bill, could be applied.  Secondly we cannot compel anybody to register.  If any person in the trade does not want to come under the Bill, he need not come under it because if he does not register we cannot touch him.  I should like to say one other word in reference to the case which Senator Jameson made. Paragraph (c) which he wants deleted may not be perhaps as explicit as it should be.  I am quite prepared to put in there before the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; so that we cannot compel anybody to export except those who are registered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So that we must have a person willing to register before we can touch him.  I do not think that it can be contemplated that if a certain factory had a bacon quota of, we will say, 200 cwts. a week, any Minister would say &ldquo;you must export 250 cwts.&rdquo; What he will say is: &ldquo;If you wish to have 200 cwts. you will have to stick to that.&rdquo;  These remarks cover paragraphs (b) and (c).  I am prepared, also, to bring in an amendment to add the words &ldquo;not being more than had been applied for&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;product.&rdquo;  I think that should be sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to know.  Considering the amount of time we have had to consider this Bill, I think it must be admitted that it was absolutely impossible for the various industries concerned to give it sufficient consideration.  I am speaking now of the facts in my own industry and incidentally I mentioned others. The industries concerned had no opportunity <Col N="781" /> of coming together to consider these matters.  It would be impossible to get them together to consider the matter before to-morrow.  It is quite evident that the Minister is trying to meet our difficulties as they have been indicated in the course of the debate, but I hold that we should get a little more time.  Twenty-four hours are no use.  If Senator O'Hanlon's proposal is adopted, we will have time to look into this and I believe from the way the way the Minister is taking it, that we will find methods of getting over our difficulties that will make it well worth the postponement.  I think the right thing is to let us have time to look into it.  That we are going to get in quotas that will burst up this country in the course of the next fortnight, I can hardly believe.  If the Minister could name any mortal thing in respect of which the position is going to be damaged by leaving this over for a fortnight, he could, as Senator Counihan said, get his Bill quite easily, but I believe that the wisest thing is to allow us this fortnight.  When we meet again, we will probably have found out methods of dealing with the difficulties and it will not be a matter of such trouble as it has been to-day. This is a very serious question and the amount of time we have had to consider it has not been at all sufficient and I would urge the adoption by the House of Senator O'Hanlon's proposal.</P>

The Seanad does not do so much work that it cannot extend its time.  As it is important from a national point of view, I think we ought to give a week to the Senator to bring forward any suggestions he desires.</P>

In support of <Col N="782" /> Senator Jameson, I may mention that I discussed this Bill with some Senators who take a great interest in all the Bills passed through this House, and some of them did not know the drastic provisions included in it.  I myself was not aware that they were quite so drastic until I heard Senator Jameson speak, and, for that reason, I suggest that we would want a fortnight to consider them.  A week would do, but as we have already arranged to adjourn for a fortnight, I think that Senator O'Hanlon's motion should be accepted.</P>

It is a very vital consideration and I suggest that the House should not arrive at any definite decision to-day.  We could take the Report Stage to-morrow when the amendments can be put down and if these are considered so unsatisfactory as not to be acceptable, the House can <Col N="783" /> decide on further action.

I am asking that consideration should be given to the proposal of Senator O'Farrell that no decision as to these amendments should be come to, that there should be no further discussion of the amendments until the House has seen what the Minister proposes, he having heard the objections raised by those concerned.  It may be that when he has consulted his draftsman, he will be able to bring draft amendments forward in a way which would meet whatever solidity there is in the objections.  The House may then decide that they are not satisfactory and that further discussion of the Bill should be postponed.  It seems to me, however, in view of what the Minister has said regarding urgency, that unless he is quite incapable of meeting the objections that have been raised, the House should not make itself incapable of meeting the Minister's point of view regarding urgency.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 6a:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 4, sub-section (8).  To add at the end of the sub-section a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  that the applicant's wife or husband, father or mother, son or daughter or brother or sister is the holder of a certificate under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (8) gives a list of the grounds upon which a certificate may be refused, and on no other grounds. In reading the evidence that was presented to the Select Committee that considered the Moneylenders Bill in 1929 one finds certain references to the evils that arise from a number of moneylenders, possibly or probably in collusion, acting together and, in effect, forcing loans upon a borrower, and using the same kind of related influences to press a borrower. It was found in some cases that a husband and wife were running two separate businesses from two separate addresses.  My amendment seeks to make it a ground on which the authorities may object if one of a family has already got a certificate and if they think it desirable to object to granting <Col N="792" /> one to another member of the same family, whether wife or husband, father or mother, son or daughter, brother or sister.  This does not make it a condition that no member of the family should have a licence, but it makes it a possible ground of objection, and I think, in view of all the circumstances, it is not desirable that two members of the same family, particularly a wife and husband, should be trading from separate addresses and each of them have a moneylender's licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Select Committee had evidence of such cases before them and they did not make any recommendation in the matter.  The effect of the amendment would be that if one member of the family is in the moneylending business a brother, or a sister, or some other member of the family, who may be acting independently, could not get a licence.  I think you are excluding other members of the family from going into the business if you accept the amendment.  As the Committee did not make that recommendation I do not feel justified in accepting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not prohibition. It is only to allow this to be made an objection, if it is thought, in the circumstances undesirable that a wife should also have a licence, it being well known that the husband had already got one.  If that is a state of things that is not desirable, then it should be a possible ground of objection. While I am prepared to admit that the case of a wife and husband is much more important to achieve the end I am seeking, I think also that in the case of a father and son, if they are both working and living and acting together in every possible respect, and if, for some reasons of their own they decide to run two businesses, objection might be made by the authorities, and if such an objection is made, then it might be a ground for refusing a licence.  I think it would be wrong of the Seanad to be deterred by the argument of the Minister that, because the Committee of 1929 did not make a recommendation, which means that it did not bring in particular amendments <Col N="793" /> to the Bill then before it, therefore we should not amend this Bill.  If that argument were to be effective, then this Bill should not be before us, because the Bill which the Committee reported to the House is a very different Bill from this one.</P>

      <P>So far as any changes made in the Bill are concerned they are really drafting changes.  The recommendations of the Committee have been rigidly followed by us, at least that was the intention, and I cannot see any changes that were made, or any deviation from anything which the Committee recommended, except drafting changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the Minister and I would ask the Seanad not to accept the amendment.  If a man has got a licence the Senator wants to prevent the wife, or the father, mother, son, daughter, brother or sister from holding a licence.  That is really carrying it too far.  In the case of moneylenders, two brothers may go into the business, or a brother may go into the business in one street and a sister, who may get married into business in another street.  By allowing the greatest amplitude to the class of people who engage in the business you have more competition amongst the moneylenders and, consequently, a lower rate of interest.  I quite agree with Senator Johnson that you might have a gentleman know as Solomon in one street, David in another, Jeremiah in a third, and Zacharia in a fourth.  That is what the Senator has in mind.  But you cannot legislate for that sort of business unless you legislate with great precision. Why did not the Senator bring in an amendment that no single person shall be allowed to carry on business in two places?  If a man is carrying on a successful business in one street, why prevent his brother, who may be his deadly enemy, from starting business in the next street?  I think Senator Johnson is actuated by the highest motives, but I do not think the amendment is practical.  Certainly the Committee that considered this question did not recommend it.  I shall vote <Col N="794" /> against the amendment and I ask the Seanad to vote against it.</P>

      <P>If the superintendent is satisfied from knowledge of the circumstances that it is undesirable that M. Mofsovitz, of 7 Trinity Street, Dublin, and S.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that the licence should be refused.  Unless there is some such clause as this there will be no right to refuse a licence. I am guided in this by the evidence before the Committee which will be found from question 1599 onwards and is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Chairman.&mdash;Are you in the employment of M. Mofsovitz, 7 Trinity Street, Dublin?&mdash;Witness&mdash; No.</P>
      <P>What firm do you represent?&mdash;S. Mofsovitz of 34 Exchequer Street, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any relationship between <Col N="795" /> S. Mofsovitz of 34 Exchequer Street, and M. Mofsovitz, of 7 Trinity Street? &mdash;Am I supposed to deal with 7 Trinity Street?  I do not belong to there.</P>
    <P>We will not press you to answer. If you were sent here to refuse to answer questions you can retire.  You can decline to answer questions if you wish.  Your evidence is absolutely voluntary.  If your instructions are to refuse to answer you are quite right to carry them out?&mdash;I belong to 34 Exchequer Street, and I have nothing to do with Trinity Street.</P>
    <P>Is there any relationship between S. Mofsovitz and M. Mofsovitz?&mdash;I believe there is a relationship.</P>
    <P>Tell the Committee what it is, or is it so mysterious that it is not to be divulged?&mdash;I think they are husband and wife.</P>
    <P>You are not quite sure that they are in fact married?&mdash;I know they are husband and wife.</P>
    <P>Are you with the husband or the wife?&mdash;With S. Mofsovitz, the husband.</P>
    <P>And they carry on business as two separate establishments in two separate streets?&mdash;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is obvious from that illustration that there is some purpose not entirely open, free and above board in the carrying on of these separate businesses.  Two members of the same family, husband and wife living together, and carrying on two business under two separate licences&mdash;that may be perfectly honourable, but it may not be.  It may be considered by the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána that it may be undesirable. All I am seeking is that that should be a possible ground for refusal. People may object on the ground that married women have equal rights with men and that there should be no differentiation between their rights.  That is, perhaps, a sensible objection, but I think it is desirable that there should be the right to refuse a certificate on the grounds of close relationship if it is thought undesirable that two members <Col N="796" /> of the same family should have a moneylender's licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>That evidence was before the Committee and, notwithstanding that evidence, the Committee did not think it was proper to refuse a person a licence because some remote relative of his also had a licence.  I think the Committee were right and for this reason: that if M. Mofsovitz and S. Mofsovitz were engaged in a conspiracy to defraud the public, M. Mofsovitz would call himself Moses, but he did not.  There was no deception; there is no fraud.  That is the reason the Committee came to the conclusion that it was better to encourage these moneylenders to be honest. There is no necessity for the amendment whatever.  Certainly in the evidence before the Committee it is shown that in that particular case there was no necessity for it, because if any person went for a loan of money to M. Mofsovitz and was refused, he would go to some person with some other name.  It is a rather peculiar name.  That is the first time I ever heard of that name.  It is a very unusual name.  Anybody going to a moneylender to look for money and expecting to get it I imagine would know his way about Dublin.  If he is refused by one Mofsovitz he is not likely to go to the other.  If the other Mofsovitz called himself Moses, or Jacob or Isaacs, he might go to him believing he was a different person.  It is on that principle that I am opposing the amendment.  Why should not a wife, if she has money of her own, be entitled to engage in any business she likes, or why should not the brother or sister of a successful moneylender be entitled to start a business, just as publicans, lawyers, and doctors do? One brother succeeds another and takes some of the business, perhaps, that is there.  While I have the greatest respect for the underlying sentiments of Senator Johnson, I think it is unreasonable and unwise for him to insist on this amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 9, sub-section (1).  To delete in lines 64-65 the words &ldquo;totally dependent on&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;not living apart from.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section provides that no contract for repayment by a borrower of money lent to him shall be enforceable, unless, before the money was lent, a note or memorandum in writing of the contract be made and signed personally by the borrower, or, where the borrower is a married woman totally dependent on her husband, by the borrower and her husband, and unless a copy is sent to the borrower within seven days of the making of the contract. I am not sure whether the House is sufficiently concerned with this very important problem.  It is extremely important and the House should not let this Bill pass without considering it.  The question of a married woman getting loans without the knowledge of her husband has caused a very great deal of trouble in this city, and in most towns, and was subjected to a great deal of attention by our committee and by the committee that preceded the passing of <Col N="798" /> the British Act.  It was decided here that where the borrower is a married woman totally dependent on her husband, both borrower and husband must sign the document.  It seems to me that the purpose aimed at will be destroyed if we use there words &ldquo;totally dependent on her husband.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case where a married woman is seeking a loan from a moneylender, if totally dependent on her husband, the husband must be required to sign the document.  The words &ldquo;totally dependent on&rdquo; her husband would remove the onus and enable the husband to know nothing about the loan if she had 2/6 a week from any source whatever.  She would not then be &ldquo;totally dependent on&rdquo; her husband.  The purpose of the section would be destroyed by the use of these words.  I am seeking to amend it by inserting the words &ldquo;not living apart from&rdquo; her husband.  That is to say, where the husband and wife are living together, and the woman seeks a loan from a moneylender, she must inform her husband.  That is the meaning of the amendment and that was the intention of the section.</P>
      <P>The only question is whether it is desirable to retain in the section these limiting words &ldquo;totally dependent on her husband,&rdquo; or getting the purpose of the section actually secured, by requiring that the double signature shall apply when husband and wife are living together.  I do not think there is any question of the desirability of preventing a moneylender getting the signature of a married woman to a promissory note, without the husband's knowledge.  If the person happened to be an aged person, with the old-age pension she would not be &ldquo;totally dependent on her husband,&rdquo; and, therefore, in these circumstances, the purposes of the section itself would be destroyed.</P>

      <P>I submit to the Minister that the amendment is very well <Col N="799" /> worthy of consideration.  If it is not accepted it might be said that Section 9 (1) has no effect whatever.  The Senator stated that if a woman was in receipt of the old age pension she would not be totally dependent on her husband.  Presumably she would be 70 years of age and would be scarcely likely to go to a moneylender for a loan.  Take the case of a charwoman who earns 2/6.  She would not be totally dependent on her husband.  That is just the class of woman who would go to small moneylenders around the city. Senator Johnson's submission is well worthy of consideration if this section is to have any effect.  In regard to moneylenders, I think the great evil in connection with this question is that wives have been able to borrow money unknown to their husbands.  That has caused a great deal of domestic tragedies.  I have no sympathy with the heir who goes to moneylenders and borrows money at 25 per cent. or 30 per cent., and I have no sympathy with &ldquo;the man about town&rdquo; who borrows £50 or £100 to go to the Curragh races, and who pays an exorbitant rate of interest.  What ought to be guarded against by the Minister, and what is deserving of consideration, is that a good many of these monetary transactions on the part of wives are at the bottom of a great amount of domestic unhappiness, things that are never heard of and that never appear in the Press. These wives borrow money without the knowledge or consent of their husbands. That leads to domestic unhappiness. For that reason I submit that the amendment of Senator Johnson is a very wise one, and that it, or some modification of it which the Minister thought proper, is necessary. If an amendment something like it is not introduced, the section is a mockery and a delusion.</P>

      <P>The position is that the Select Committee dealt with this matter.  They had evidence before them with regard to it and they turned it down.  I understand one of the reasons that actuated them was that there might be cases of married women living with their husbands who <Col N="800" /> were carrying on business, independent of their husbands, and that in such cases&mdash;they might be extreme cases&mdash;the husbands might compel their wives to give them a greater measure of support from the business that was being carried on independently, by having to get the husband's signatures to documents if negotiating loans for the purposes of the business. I think that was the main ground on which the committee turned it down. The committee had all the evidence before them, but of course that has no compelling effect on the Seanad. Senator Johnson said that I was suggesting something like that before.  I was not.  The Seanad is free to decide what it wishes.  In getting the Bill drafted I kept it down to the evidence that the committee had before them as they went into the consideration of it.  I do not feel justified in departing from their recommendation.  They decided definitely on this and I understand turned down the other proposal unanimously.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that the committee appointed made this recommendation and with his usual loyalty he has had adhered exactly to the findings of the committee.  I think in the Seanad we are entitled to appeal from that decision.  The Minister has great experience, and I would take his opinion on a question like that before I would accept the opinion of most committees.  I do not know the names of the members of this committee.  The Minister put the case of a married woman who might be carrying on business, who might have occasion to resort to moneylenders, and that her husband extract from her a contribution as consideration for signing a bill.  I ask the Minister if in his great legal experience he has ever come across a case like that.  I venture to say he did not.  I never came across such a case.  Suppose a poor woman carrying on a business, with a husband who was no good in the kitchen, and a child in her arms, had to go to a moneylender, do you think she would lose?  The Minister followed the recommendation of the committee, which rather shows <Col N="801" /> me that perhaps members of the Committee had never experienced any of the real hardships of life.  I still urge on the Minister to accept without a division the proposal of Senator Johnson.</P>

      <P>There is something to be said for the view put forward by the Minister, but something has also to be said for this point of view.  I know conditions in the city fairly well. There is a tremendous number of married women who carry on small businesses apart from their husbands. These are only side lines, but I think that the husbands of women circumstanced such as they are ought to get some protection in a measure of this kind.  I have had some experience of the ramifications of moneylenders in this city, and my experience tells me, we cannot be too drastic in the methods we adopt to curb the activities of some of the people who are carrying on this business.  They have brought more unhappiness into decent homes in Dublin than anything else I know of. I think that in all the circumstances the Minister ought to agree to the proposal of Senator Johnson notwithstanding the fact that the Committee made a somewhat different recommendation. I am not passing any comments on the view of the Committee but, speaking from my own experience in these matters in the City of Dublin, I think the Minister ought to accept the amendment suggested by Senator Johnson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there will be very many cases where women who are not dependent on their husbands are carrying on business.  If they are carrying on a business and are independent of their husbands they do not require to go to moneylenders at all. There are several married women, no doubt, who are very energetic and enterprising, hard-working women, who have made a great struggle and carried on a very successful business on their own, but that type of woman will not need to be protected from the moneylenders. They are quite able to protect themselves.  Any woman who is able to carry on a business of that kind is independent of the earnings of her <Col N="802" /> husband, and I do not think this Bill will apply at all to her.  I do say, however, that there are thousands of women in the city here, and in other parts of the country who are carrying on small businesses only as a side-line. They are wholly dependent on their husbands in reality because the amount of their earnings is very small in proportion to the family budget requirements. A tremendous amount of unhappiness has been caused by moneylenders going about canvassing such people and inducing them by every means to accept loans.  I think the amendment might be accepted by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I would just like to say that I quite appreciate the importance of the point the Minister has made, that it may be that a woman has a worthless husband and so does not want to have to divulge to that worthless husband the fact that she is receiving any money from the moneylender, not because he would have any moral objection, or would want to take charge of the house itself, but he might probably &ldquo;sponge&rdquo; on her. I quite appreciate that point, but for one case of that kind there are 200 or 2,000 of the kind where moneylenders in the past have been lending money to married women and tragedy upon tragedy has occurred because the husband knew nothing about it.  I think this &ldquo;totally dependent&rdquo; proviso would largely nullify the whole intention of the section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6c:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 10 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>10.  Under any contract for the repayment by a borrower of money lent to him or to any agent on his behalf by a moneylender after the commencement of this Act or for the <Col N="803" /> payment by him of interest on money so lent, it shall not be lawful for any interest to be charged at a rate exceeding 60 per cent. per annum or the corresponding rate in respect of any other period, whether such rate is expressed as payable by the terms of the contract or becomes directly or indirectly chargeable thereunder.</P>
    <P>This raises a matter of importance and it is distinctly related to other sections in the Bill.  Those who have been following this question will have known that there have been demands for a restriction of the rate of interest which moneylenders may be allowed to recover.  It is extraordinary, it is almost inconceivable, the rates of interest that in fact have been current under moneylenders' agreements.  Section 13 of the Bill, as it stands, makes a certain reference to 39 per cent. That is a provision which I am seeking to amend by a later amendment by reducing the rate to 25, but that is not the maximum rate of interest.  If the question is brought to the court, and if there is an excess over 39 per cent., it will be presumed by the court that the charge is unconscionable and harsh.  The onus of proof that it is not so lies on the moneylender.  My proposal in this new section is to make a 60 per cent. rate the maximum which may be recovered.  The effect of the amendment is that if any contract be made after the passing of the Act it shall not be lawful to charge more than 60 per cent. per annum interest.  That is not a very wide or extravagant claim.  In fact, to very many people it will seem to be an extension of the provisions of the Bill and that it would allow moneylenders to charge more than they are at present allowed to charge.</P>
    <P>I am raising the matter in this form for the purpose of getting an expression of opinion from the Seanad as to whether a maximum rate of interest should be put into the Act.  If it is thought that 60 per cent. is too high, at a later stage it can be amended.  I am putting down 60 per cent. because that is the figure that has run through discussions here and in England as a <Col N="804" /> rate which would allow moneylenders to carry on their business, where they lend money without security, and which would allow them a sufficient rate to make provision for bad debts, for the expenses they incur at the present time and still leave them a very considerable margin of profit.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to go into the question as to whether the figure is too high or too low, but the purpose at the present time is too fix a maximum which the court would not be allowed to exceed in making a final ruling.  It has been said&mdash;in fact that there has been a judgment in the British courts to the effect&mdash;that even 100 per cent. was allowed in the case of a disputed claim and even 100 per cent. was held to be not harsh and unconscionable even when the Moneylenders Act of 1900 was pleaded.  As I understand, and as I am advised, the Bill as it stands at present does not make any figure the maximum.  It simply throws the onus of proof that the charge of 39 per cent. is not harsh or unconscionable, on the moneylender.  I want at a later stage to throw that onus on the moneylender even when he charges more than 25 per cent. but the purpose of the present amendment is that, even though the justice may decide that more than 25 per cent. should be allowed in all the circumstances, he should not be allowed to give judgment for more than 60 per cent.  The essential feature of it is that it is intended to fix the maximum that even the courts would be allowed to award to a moneylender and that that maximum should be stated in the Bill.  As I have said if the Seanad thinks that 60 per cent. is too high to allow as a maximum, I would be prepared to agree on Report Stage to reduce that figure.  I put down 60 because it is the figure which moneylenders themselves, particularly in the English inquiry, had indicated as a figure which will allow them to carry on business, to lend money to unsecured borrowers, and still pay expenses and make provision for bad debts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Senator Johnson was ever in what we <Col N="805" /> call temporary necessity, because if he were he would see that in this section, which has a great deal to recommend it, there are some things which he has not considered.  Let us take the case of a man who may want £100 for a week.  He may have plenty of resources but he may want £100 just for one week.  He may be inclined to pay £7, £8, or £10 for the use of that £100 for the week.  That would be more than 60 per cent. per annum.  I wonder whether Senator Johnson would consider limiting his amendment to cases where that high percentage is demanded on a Bill of say three months or six months?  There are very serious necessities, very urgent necessities of substantial people from time to time.  It is only in the Minister's walk of life or in my walk of life as a solicitor or a barrister that these cases come to one's notice.  I have had several such cases brought to my notice.  I know several occasions on which substantial men were in the most extreme need of money for a week or so and these men would no more think of asking you or me to sign a bill for them than they would think of burning their right hand.  They would much rather go to a moneylender and say: &ldquo;What about giving me £100 for a week?&rdquo;  A man would frequently much prefer to pay a £5 or a £10 note rather than let anybody know he was in need of £100.  If we are to allow these people to go on at all, we must allow that freedom in commercial intercourse which is necessary, provided, of course, that we protect the people who are in need of protection. I would say that for a three months or a six months bill 60 per cent. is too high but what about the bill for a month or for a week?  Would you limit a man to 60 per cent. on a bill for a week?  That is only £1 and a moneylender will not lend £100 for a week for £1.  He might say: &ldquo;If you give me £5 I will give you £100 for a week.&rdquo;  That is the difficulty in the amendment proposed by Senator Johnson and that is the reason why I think the per annum requirement there and the absence of any limitation as to the time during which the money is <Col N="806" /> to be lent is, I think, defective. Senator Johnson, of course, has considered it but it does not appeal to me at all unless the short-term loans are excluded from this section.</P>

      <P>Senator Comyn suggests, and I should be inclined to agree with him, that there are very few people here, with the exception possibly of himself and the Minister, who can really appreciate the various aspects of this Bill.  It brought my attention to the fact that the people on the opposite benches, on which we usually have a number of bankers and people interested in the banks and the moneylending business who could be of considerable use to us in connection with this Bill, are not here at all this evening.  When it is a question of dealing with financial matters relative to the moneyed interests of this country we have full benches on the opposite side of the House.  They are all here to offer advice to the Minister and to the rest of us as to what should be done if there is any suggestion of putting a little bit extra on income tax or anything of the kind, but when it is a question of protecting the, comparatively speaking, poor people of the country from the moneylenders, from the wolves, they are not here and they are not interested.  I say that it should not go unnoticed that the people who could be of the greatest possible benefit because of their experience walked out of the House this evening and left us here to discuss this matter in which the poor people of the country are very much concerned.  I think it very regrettable that they should not be here this evening above every other evening and for this Bill above any other Bill to help us to put the brakes on the moneylenders of this country.</P>

      <P>Under Section 13 as it stands while this 39 per cent. is not stated as the maximum rate of interest, it is the maximum rate.  The section says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Where, in any proceedings in respect of any money lent by a moneylender after the commencement of this Act or in respect of any <Col N="807" /> agreement or security made or taken after the commencement of this Act in respect of money lent either before or after the commencement of this Act, it is found that the interest charged exceeds the rate of 39 per cent. per annum, or the corresponding rate in respect of any other period, the court shall presume for the purposes of Section 1 of the Moneylenders Act, 1900, that the interest charged is excessive, and that the transaction is harsh and unconscionable, but this provision shall be without prejudice to the powers of the court under that section where the court is satisfied that the interest charged, although not exceeding 39 per cent. per annum, is excessive.</P>
    <P>The effect of that section is that in any proceedings taken in court&mdash;and, of course, if people are charged more than 39 per cent. they will allow proceedings to go to court the moment they know that this is the position&mdash; without any evidence whatever being tendered, the court is bound to presume that any interest charged in excess of 39 per cent. is excessive. There is no question of giving any evidence or of pointing out the circumstances of the loan or anything else.  The court is bound to take notice of it and bound to regard that as excessive, so that while it is not stated as being the maximum rate, the effect of the section is to make it the maximum rate.  There is no question of the rate being 40 per cent., 50 per cent., or 60 per cent.  The 39 per cent. is final and maximum in its effect. The court must presume when the interest is in excess of 39 per cent. that the interest is excessive and is harsh and unconscionable.  Senator Johnson referred to decisions under the 1900 Act.  There have been numerous decisions under that Act but, in that Act, there was no idea given to the court as to what rate of interest would be excessive or considered harsh or unconscionable. There was no guide given to them, but this Bill, which follows the British Act of 1927 and a similar measure passed by the Northern <Col N="808" /> Parliament in which the rate is set out at 48 per cent., sets out the rate as 39 per cent.  No decision under the 1927 Act has been brought to my notice, but, since 1927, the Senator, I am sure, will find, if the decisions are looked up, that the court has been guided by that 48 per cent.  The Bill provides that where any interest is charged in excess of 39 per cent. the court must presume that it is harsh and unconscionable.</P>

      <P>I have been advised that the contrary is the case.  I am not able to decide between conflicting lawyers, but I looked up the British Act of 1927, and I find that the whole drafting of Section 10 of that Act is the same as this proposed Section 13 except for the rate of 48 per cent. and these words, which are omitted in our draft: &ldquo;unless the contrary is proved&rdquo;.  That is to say, if it is found that the interest charged exceeds a rate of 48 per cent. per annum or a corresponding rate in respect of any other period the court shall, unless the contrary is proved, presume for the purposes of Section 1 of the Moneylenders Act that the interest is excessive. The absence of these words: &ldquo;unless the contrary is proved&rdquo; suggested to me that the very removal of them made our draft the maximum, but I was advised that that is not so and that, in fact, our draft leaves the position thus: a moneylender goes to a court to recover his debt and is met with the assertion that the rate of interest is more than 39 per cent. or 48 per cent., as the case may be, and the presumption shall be that the rate is harsh and unconscionable, but it does not close the question.  The plaintiff, that is, the moneylender, can then bring evidence to show that it is not harsh and unconscionable, that the risks were great and that the rate of interest, even if it were 60, 70 or 80 per cent., was reasonable.  What happens then is that the court may reopen the proceedings, and even if there have been payments made above the amount which would be reasonable and equitable, may make a new account.  I should like to be convinced that the <Col N="809" /> Minister's reading is watertight, because that would be quite enough to satisfy me that there is no need to move this amendment.  In fact, it would be very much better than my amendment, but I am not yet assured that his reading is right, and unless I can be satisfied between now and Report Stage that it is, I should like to press this amendment or some modified form of it.

      <P>I want to presume for the time being that the 39 per cent. rate remains in this section and that, as the Minister says, it is watertight&mdash;that it becomes the maximum rate of interest that may be allowed.  Although this Bill has been before the House in one form or another for four years, as it stands any money borrowed up to the date of the commencement of this Act would be subject to the rate of interest stated in the agreement in connection with the promissory note and the Act of 1900 would apply, that is to say, there would be no maximum and, in fact, there would be no governing rate of interest allowable.  I want, by this amendment, to make the provisions of Section 13 (1) apply in respect to a loan made before the passing of the Act as well as to a loan which succeeds the passing of the Act. It may be objected that this has some retrospective effect and that if a man made a contract to pay 166 per cent., which, by the way, appears to be the ruling rate per annum, according to one expert moneylender witness, and if the promissory note were signed embodying a rate of that kind, even though it were made since this Bill was drafted and since it came into the region of the legislature, the obligations of the borrower would not be affected in the least by this section unless it is amended in the way I desire. It is because I desire to bring under the protection of the section moneylending agreements undertaken before the passing of the Act that I move the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment of Senator Johnson's goes very far indeed in principle because it means that contracts, already made, are to be broken.  It is much worse than retrospective legislation.  It is legislation that breaks contracts already made on the faith of a statute passed in the year 1900.  That is a rather serious thing. <Col N="811" /> I do not think there have been any complaints sufficient to justify the Minister in adopting such a drastic course as that.  I would not like to see legislation of that kind, not merely retrospective but destroying the faith of contracts, introduced into this measure. Now if the measure was very urgent a little might be said for it, but so long as I have been a member of the House we have been talking about a Moneylenders Bill and there has been considerable delay.  If the matter was very urgent the late Government or this Government might have proceeded more rapidly.  The Senator has not pointed out any glaring cases of injustice that could not be covered, and reasonably dealt with, by the Act of 1900.  After all, we are dealing with fairly small matters here, and therefore why introduce a principle that would be destructive of confidence in other matters?  Here is an amendment by which it is proposed to break contracts already in existence.  I am very glad that Senator Jameson, who knows so much about matters of this kind, is in the House.  I recommend the Seanad not to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The objection that I have to the amendment is very similar to what Senator Comyn has stated. It will be urged from the moneylenders' point of view at any rate that risks were taken, when there was no such basis as this 39 per cent. in lending money, risks that will not be undertaken when this Bill becomes law and that contracts have been entered into.  The effect of this amendment would be to give these retrospective effect, and in that way to nullify, to a considerable extent perhaps, many existing contracts that were entered into before this Bill became law, and perhaps long before this measure was contemplated.  For these reasons I could not accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not adverted to the fact that if these contracts were entered into they were entered into since 1929 when a Select Committee, having made inquiry and having had numerous moneylenders before it, representative and unrepresentative, <Col N="812" /> put this 39 per cent. provision into the Bill.  The Bill was accepted by the Ministry of the time. It has been simply delayed, one way and another, until it is now before us as No. 2 Bill, 1933.  These limitations, I would point out, were before the moneylenders all those years.  I think it is not reasonable to say that they should be free, even after the passing of this Bill, to charge rates of interest that may be said to be normal and, therefore, not unconscionable, the normality amounting to 166 per cent. according to the witnesses who appeared before the Select Committee, and, in some cases, to 1,000 per cent., I think, that those people who got themselves into the net of moneylenders prior to the passing of this Bill ought to get some relief from the Bill. I am afraid, however, from what the Minister and Senator Comyn have said that thousands of men, some of them in a deplorable position at the present moment because of the toils that they have got into, are not going to get any relief whatever from the passing of this Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 9a:</P>
      <P>Section 13, sub-section (2).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  For the purposes of this section, where the interest charged on a loan is not expressed in terms of a rate, the rate of interest shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the First Schedule to this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this amendment ought to be acceptable because there is prescribed in the Schedule a method of calculating the rate of interest where the interest charged on a loan is not expressed in terms of a rate.  It should be of interest to those members of the House who have not concerned themselves with this problem to know that it is very seldom indeed, in the course <Col N="813" /> of the ordinary business of moneylending, to declare a rate of interest on a loan.  A person seeks a loan of £10.  He gets £7 10s. and signs a promissory note for £10.  That is considered to be a loan of £10, and he binds himself to pay, say £1 per month for ten months.  No rate of interest, therefore, is noted on the promissory note, or on any other agreement.  The Schedule indicates a method of arriving at a rate of interest where no rate of interest is expressed in the agreement.  In Section 9 of the Bill it is provided that in such a case the method of calculation described in the First Schedule is to be applied, but there is no direction as to how this 39 per cent. is to be calculated.  It is for that reason that I am seeking to insert this amendment in the Bill.  It directs that in arriving at the 39 per cent., where no rate of interest has been indicated in the agreement, the method of calculation shall be that contained in the First Schedule.</P>

      <P>Section 17.  After the word &ldquo;moneylenders&rdquo; in line 46 to insert the words &ldquo;whether personally or by his agent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading I raised a point about the collecting of moneys by moneylenders, or their agents, on Sundays.  The Minister pointed out that in his opinion the phrase &ldquo;carrying on business as a moneylender&rdquo;<Col N="814" /> would cover the collection of moneys on Sundays, and therefore would be prohibited.  I think there is some doubt as to whether the collection, as it is done, would always be construed as carrying on business, but there is this method that is sometimes applied and I think unless it were guarded against would certainly be applied because this collection on Sundays is a very favourable form of forcing collections and bringing a doubtful debtor to boot.  A moneylender may appoint a collecting agent to do the collecting for him.  If that were done I doubt whether that would be construed as &ldquo;carrying on business&rdquo; for a moneylender by the agent.  It is for that reason that I want, by inserting in the Bill the words in the amendment, to guard against any risk.  It is to make certain that the evil which the section seems to guard against should not be evaded that I am moving the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment is unnecessary.  Surely a moneylender who employs an agent to collect on Sundays or on any other day, just the same as when he employs a person in his office, is carrying on the business of a moneylender.  One may assume that in most of these cases very many of the persons negotiating a loan would probably negotiate it with some assistant or some person in the office. Surely it could not be construed that that was not carrying on the business of a moneylender.  In the same way, if the moneylender employs an agent to go out on Sundays I do not see where there is any loophole, and how that could not be construed as carrying on the business of moneylending. I may say that I do not see any objection to the amendment.</P>

I employed them to collect my debts in a general way as agents.  They may act in contravention of some provision of the law.  I am very doubtful whether I could be made responsible for their <Col N="815" /> offence under an Act of this kind.  The Minister says that he sees no objection to the amendment.</P>

About one and a half hours ago it was decided by the Seanad that this matter be adjourned to 16th August.  I am one of those Senators who remained here, but many other Senators have left.  In any other assembly that I have been attached to <Col N="816" /> I must say such a thing as this would never occur.  It is a most extraordinary procedure to adopt in connection with the resolution carried a short time ago that at the tail-end of the meeting a motion should be proposed rescinding the original motion.  If you, sir, are satisfied that the Standing Orders are being complied with, I am not going to raise any objection, but I certainly raise a personal protest against the procedure adopted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 9c:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 18 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>18.&mdash;(1)  No written communication relative to a moneylending transaction shall be addressed by the moneylender or his agent to the borrower otherwise than to the borrower at the address of such borrower as stated in the note or memorandum of the contract or, where no address is so stated, to the borrower at his usual place of residence for the time being.</P>
      <P>(2)  No moneylender shall visit such borrower, whether personally or by his agent, otherwise than at the address of such borrower as stated in the note or memorandum of the contract or, where no address is so stated, at the borrower's usual place of residence for the time being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has sprung up a practice amongst a certain class of moneylenders to bring what you might call blackmailing influences and certainly undesirable coercive measures to bear upon borrowers by approaching, either by letter or personal call, the business place of the borrower.  It is when a man is in difficulties that he goes to a moneylender as a rule.  In many cases it is the kind of resource that the borrower does not want to make public and, particularly, does not want to inform his employers about.  I know of my own knowledge of a commercial traveller having been placed in a very difficult position indeed by the fact that a letter was addressed to him &ldquo;care of his employers.&rdquo;  It is a well-known rule in the commercial world that a letter sent to an establishment in that way may be opened by the firm and that was the case in the particular instance I have in mind.  Of course, trouble ensued.  In other cases it is not by letter that the moneylender approaches the borrower at his business premises, but by a personal call.  As the person calling is very often known by the marks of his countenance, or by other signs, to be a <Col N="818" /> moneylender's tout, again odium falls upon the person for whom he enquires. The object of the new section I have put down is to prevent that practice. I think the new section should commend itself to the House, because the practice is&mdash;I was going to say pure blackmail, but, if not quite pure, it is blackmail nevertheless.  I ask the House to approve of this attempt to put down that practice.</P>

The amendment states: &ldquo;No written communication relative to a moneylending transaction shall be addressed by the moneylender or his agent to the borrower otherwise than to the borrower at the address of such borrower as stated in the note or memorandum.&rdquo; However, that can be dealt with on the Report Stage, and I am prepared to accept the principle of the amendment.</P>

I think October 1st is late enough, and I should like some amendment to be put into the Bill which would prevent any charge higher than is fixed in the Bill in respect of any transaction after the date of the passing of the Act, not after the date of commencement of the Act.  The date of the commencement of the Act will be 1st January. The date of the passing of the Act may be 16th August.  It is the date of the passing of the Act that should be the determining date in regard to the rate of interest.
