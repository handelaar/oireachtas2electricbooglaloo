      <P>I am inclined to agree, the Government having declared its mind, that this is not a matter on which we ought to have a fight between the two Houses, but it does not change my point of view.  I think it is a matter of very great regret that the Ministry cannot see its way to alter the decision.  I am particularly interested in the fact that the proposal that the Seanad should not insist on their amendment is seconded by Senator Quirke, because at the last meeting of this House we had a long speech from Senator Quirke in which he stated that it was wrong and absolutely unfair to call Irishmen resident in the United States aliens.  The Senator dealt with that at very considerable length.  When it comes to a matter providing that Irishmen born in Northern Ireland who come to reside here shall have the <Col N="614" /> same rights as the ordinary citizen, then we find Senator Quirke not only voting against what he urged originally but actually seconding a motion proposing that the Seanad do not insist on the amendment.</P>
      <P>I consider there is a very great difference between the position of an Irishman who has emigrated to the United States and the position of a man who, through no fault of his own, happened to be born in an area which is partitioned.  If we stand against partition, as probably every section in this House and in the other House does, we should make it as easy as possible for an Ulsterman to invest his money in Saorstát Eireann.  In that way the sooner will we end partition. There is a principle involved here, but this is a relatively unimportant Bill which will I suppose only affect two or three companies.  At the same time I do not see why the same facilities should not be given to persons born in the Six Counties as to others.  In relation to industry they are put in a worse position than others.  We describe them as citizens but we place them in a worse position than was intended under the Constitution.  I can see certain difficulties in allowing persons who still reside in the Six Counties the same facilities as persons who come here to reside, and having to wait five years before being placed in the same position as a person from any other country.  However, this being the decision of the Dáil, and the Bill being relatively unimportant, I do not think we should insist on this amendment. But, on the next opportunity, when another Bill dealing with the same principle comes before us, we should assert our decision, if the House is still of the same opinion.</P>

      <P>While I do not wish to make political propaganda I regret very much that the present Government are acting in an entirely different spirit to that of the previous Government towards the people of the Six Counties.  One of the Acts dealing with the Civil Service definitely states that all Irishmen are eligible for admission to the Civil Service here.  I do not know of any Act passed by the <Col N="615" /> previous Government which enshrined the principle that has been introduced by the proposal in this Bill.  We had during the present régime the Control of Manufactures Bill and the Cement Bill by which people born in the Six Counties are cut out.  To my mind that is perpetuating partition. That is a principle for which I cannot stand.  I want to work for the independence of the whole country and, if the Government of the Six Counties do wrong&mdash;and they are doing wrong every day&mdash;that is no reason why we should follow their example.  No matter what our politics we should work for the unity and independence of Ireland.</P>

      <P>As one who had the misfortune, through no fault of his own, to be born within the area now known as the Six Counties I object to the principle enshrined in this Bill. I object to partition.  Partition was forced upon us under circumstances over which we had no control.  It is wrong to put our seal upon it.  I cannot understand the attitude of the present Government in adopting this line.  More than one Minister in the present Government, and at least one or two Ministers in the previous Government were born in the Six Counties.  The attitude that the present Government has adopted is most illogical and is wrong.  I cannot see any reason why this House, or the other House, should adopt such a line of action.  We object to partition but, at the same time we support it by the proposals in this Bill. I strongly object to that, and I will do everything I can to oppose such action.  Incidentally I am very glad to see the Minister for Industry and Commerce sufficiently restored to health to be here to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to add by way of explanation that has not been put before the House in considerable detail.  On the Report Stage when discussing the amendment in the name of Senator Dowdall I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I have given a considerable amount of thought to the question, both since it came before this House and while it was before the Dáil. I think if the matter were not pressed on this particular Bill and if Senator Dowdall and the House would agree to the withdrawal of the amendment until the question had further <Col N="617" /> examination, I would undertake to the House to try to bring together the nursing organisations, the Committee of the Associated Hospitals and the various interested parties to see if a pension scheme could be evolved and, possibly, a benevolent fund established apart from any contributory pension scheme that might be evolved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Dowdall, continuing the debate, stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary, I ask leave of the House to withdraw the amendment.  When I was tabling this amendment I did recognise that this was a very complicated matter.  I am pleased to learn that the Parliamentary Secretary has devoted his attention to this, and I am sure, having regard to what he has said, that if all we desire is not obtained, a considerable amount will be obtained.  I do not know what the procedure is as regards deleting the amendments already adopted, but if the Minister moves in the Dáil to disagree with them, I can assure him that when the matter comes again before the Seanad he will have my support.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And then Sir E. Coey Bigger stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I welcome the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I think he has taken a very wise and judicious course.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardBigger" hpid="Sir E. Bigger Sir E. Bigger">
      <NameTxt>Sir E. Bigger</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not quite gather what Senator Dowdall had said and when the Parliamentary Secretary stated that he was going to bring all these hospitals and associations together, I thought it was in furtherance of the scheme before the House.  However, if the Parliamentary Secretary intends to introduce a further Bill with the same object, I am quite ready to accept that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 7, sub-section (2).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, no deduction shall be made from the salary of any person in the Civil Service of the Government of Saorstát Eireann&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  who was appointed with a special agreement as to the amount of his remuneration and who satisfies the Minister that, for the purpose of accepting such appointment, he gave up any profession or occupation from which he derived an income not less than the remuneration which he agreed to accept in respect of such appointment;</P>
      <P>(b)  who was appointed subsequent to the 6th December, 1922, with a special agreement as to his remuneration and who for the purpose of accepting such appointment gave up an appointment in the service of any other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt with this amendment at some length on the Committee Stage and I do not think there is much to be gained by my repeating what I stated then, except to say very briefly&mdash;the principle is similar to that in other amendments which deal with slightly different matters, in the names of other Senators&mdash;that I am endeavouring to establish that where there has been a <i>bona fide</i> contract, whether strictly in writing or verbally, that contract shall <Col N="619" /> be kept.  I feel very strongly that the State should not, by legislation, place itself in a position in regard to its employees in which an ordinary employer could not, or would not, place himself in the ordinary course of business.  If an employer has a written contract with an employee he could not, without special legislation, break that contract.  If he has only a verbal agreement he could quite probably break that contract, but that is not in keeping with the standard that most of us try to observe.  It is generally recognised that such agreements, if admitted, would not be broken.  I believe there are only seven or eight people affected by this amendment. The object of my amendment is to place the State in the position in which, if the Minister is satisfied there has been a contract, it will not be broken.  I can understand that the Minister is in a certain amount of difficulty with regard to some of the amendments.  He indicated very clearly on the Committee Stage that he had a considerable amount of sympathy with this amendment, but that he felt some difficulty in dealing with it himself. I am suggesting to the House that the Second Chamber would not be worth its salt if it did not send down an amendment of this kind to the other House and give the other House an opportunity of righting a matter of this kind.  We are not asking the Minister to do anything more than he did on the Committee Stage when he admitted that he had a certain amount of sympathy with the amendments and that there was a problem to be solved. If the matter were considered by the other House, I have great confidence that they would agree with this amendment. I do not know the names of all those affected.  I am merely interested in the principle which, I think, is exceedingly important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the private employer, which has been quoted by Senator Douglas, the Senator says that that employer, if he made a contract, would carry it out and would not break it under any circumstances. Would he carry out that contract if he were insolvent?  Supposing <Col N="620" /> that particular employer had not sufficient money to pay the particular individual with whom he had made the contract, would that individual get his money?  Here is a case where there is not sufficient money to pay our employees.  I consider that unless this Bill is passed the Minister, unless he introduces fresh taxation, will be insolvent in respect of these payments.  He will not have sufficient revenue to meet this expenditure.</P>

      <P>Whether the individual has rights or no rights, it is an extraordinary doctrine because nobody will ever afterwards have any faith in a signed agreement if he knows that the State will destroy that contract the moment it finds itself hard up for money.  There is another amendment in my name in connection with the same doctrine later on.  I hope the Minister is not going to rely on the argument that the Free State is insolvent to defeat this amendment.  Whether the claims are just or unjust, I believe that we are not going to be influenced by any ideas that the State is solvent or insolvent and that if we do not get this money we cannot pay our way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>When this amendment was discussed on the Committee Stage, the Minister expressed himself in sympathy with it and he did not plead the insolvency imagined by Senator Wilson. There can be really very little money in it, but apart from the amount of money involved there is a question of contract, and if there is a contract we should keep it.  Governments can be shockingly cruel at times, but they should not try to get away with the idea that they are not actually dishonest because they have powers of legislation behind them and because they can determine a contract by legislation without consulting the other party to it.  That in itself is not a justification. I do sincerely hope that if there are people of the type mentioned in the amendment, we shall, for the sake of the good name of the country, keep our contract with them.  The Minister may be able to say that there are no people of that type, but if he is not sure regarding the facts, he will have time between now and the time this matter comes before the other House, to see what are the facts of the position.  If he does find that there are people such as those mentioned in the amendment, I am sure he will recommend its acceptance to the other House.</P>

      <P>This is a matter on which I should like to have the expressed opinion of the Seanad to guide me.  I did indicate on the Committee Stage&mdash;one feels these things without even being able to give a rational explanation for them&mdash;that I felt that there was some justice in the amendment but I have not been able to see how I am going to meet the case of a person who has a specific agreement in writing or a person who has an equally specific agreement which is purely verbal.  This is a matter in which I think the Seanad could quite properly make an amendment or a recommendation to the Dáil.  It does not touch the principle of the Bill and if the Seanad decide to pass the amendment I shall give it sympathetic consideration between now and the time for reporting it again to the Dáil.  I should like the Seanad to express its opinion in regard to the amendment and if the feeling of the Seanad is that it should be accepted, without binding myself that the Dáil will accept the amendment, I think I can say that I shall certainly go as far as I can to meet the view expressed by the Seanad in regard to it.</P>

      <P>New section.  Before Section 9, and in Part II, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>9.&mdash;Nothing in this Act shall take away, prejudice or in any way affect any right of any transferred officer, as defined by the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act, 1929 (No. 36 of 1929), under Article 78 of the Constitution or under the said Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act, 1929, or any powers or jurisdiction conferred by the said Act upon the Civil Service (Compensation) Board established in accordance with the said Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> On the Committee Stage I stated my reasons for moving this amendment.  I think that the transferred officers are entitled to all the consideration we can give them for the reasons I stated on the last day.  We had to create a Civil Service, but these men could have retired under Article X of the Treaty and if they had done so, we would have had to pay them a pension and also to pay the salaries of those who would take their place.  We had to train a Civil Service and as the Minister knows when he came into office he had a very efficient Civil Service.  These men are entitled to special consideration and I think that the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given this matter a great deal of consideration with a view to seeing whether it was necessary to do anything further to provide further safeguards for the transferred officers.  I am advised that it is not necessary and that, from the point of view of the drafting of the Bill, it is undesirable.  Accordingly, I have not been able, as I had hoped, to put down an amendment which would meet the situation which Senator Duggan has in mind but which I am advised does not exist, that is to say, that there is nothing in the Bill which in any way interferes with the existing rights of the transferred officers.  Accordingly, I would ask the Seanad not to send this amendment to the other House.</P>

    <P>I propose to debate this amendment not on the basis set out by Senator Wilson, but on the basis that we are able to pay our bills as we go along. <Col N="624" /> This amendment also deals with the contract type of case.  This amendment in Senator Brown's and my name and amendment No. 4 in the name of Senator Dowdall, are practically identical.

The number of persons affected by this amendment is not very large, but they are important people and they are people with whom the late Government, or statutory bodies who held office under them, made contracts for a specific number of years at certain salaries.  If these arrangements had been made by anybody except the Oireachtas, the law would hold that whoever signed them on behalf of the employer must stand by them.  We know, of course, that the Oireachtas has power to alter the law but, as Senator O'Farrell says, that power ought to be exercised with judgment and care to ensure that we do no wrong or that we do nothing which ordinary individual citizens could not and should not do.  Because of these powers, the Oireachtas should not make legal the doing of things which, in the mind of the ordinary individual, is not honourable or right.  The people affected by this amendment are important people and one or two of them&mdash;I have not much knowledge of the cases&mdash;are foreign citizens who came over here for a certain specific purpose to serve the needs of the Free State.  These arrangements were made with them and they have been working here under contract for a certain number of years. They have no pensionable rights and are not in our Civil Service.  Our civil servants have pensionable rights and their rights are not being interfered with under this Bill.  These individuals, however, who have no pensionable rights made a bargain to come <Col N="625" /> over here and to give their services to the State and they are now going to be reduced because their employers, the Irish Free State, are, as Senator Wilson says, becoming hard up.  I do not think that that is fair or right.</P>
      <P>There are then the cases of people appointed by statutory bodies who were empowered to make these arrangements and who made these arrangements. These persons are extremely important and they filled an office in the State which required people of very exceptional qualities, and though you might get some small sum of money out of them by applying the &ldquo;Cuts&rdquo; Bill to them, I do not think that the amount of money involved is worth it. I do not think the Free State should soil its reputation for small sums of money such as are here involved.  No doubt, the Minister knows all the cases, and I do not think that in respect of the amounts of money involved, the plea could be put forward that they are such as to require any huge alteration in the Bill.  I hold that this is a question of honour and of right, and I hold that the State should not do things which the individual could not legally do and should not alter the law to suit its apparent needs in this way.  This is a very difficult matter on which to divide the House because I do not think that a question like this ought to be made a Party question at all.  We know that if I am supported in my amendment and if the Seanad passes the amendment, the Minister can go to the Dáil and, by calling on his Party, have the amendment reversed.  I hate doing that kind of thing and I do not believe that Party voting should enter into this at all.  If the Minister would tell us that he would consider the matter and deal with it as he thought fit, I should be prepared to take the Minister's word that he would do the right thing.  I am, therefore, very diffident about dividing the House, as I look on this as a point of honour and a point which, I think, the Minister should deal with. I am prepared to trust him, and before I say any more or ask the House for an opinion, I would ask the Minister to let us have his views.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment for the purpose of having a discussion and, in this connection, I would suggest to the Minister that Section 9, sub-section (2) does itself make provision for a certain amount of discretion. It reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From all salary which, during the current financial year, is earned by and payable to any member of a body to which this section applies in his capacity as such member, a deduction shall be made of such amount and at such times as the Minister shall, in each case, direct, having regard to the deductions from salaries to be made under Part II of this Act and to the circumstances of the case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That sub-section gives the Minister power to determine the actual amount of the cut and the time at which the cut may be made and it gives him power to take into consideration all the circumstances of the case.  He is prepared to go that far and the amendment only suggests that he may go a little further and exempt a person altogether because of the special circumstances of his case.  He may, perhaps, be able to say that this sub-section is quite sufficient to enable him to deal with the people referred to in the amendment but I would suggest that he should consider the amendment together with the sub-section I have quoted and see if the Bill, as it stands, is sufficient to deal with the case.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Senator Jameson has given me the opportunity of making a statement. My own feeling is that as sub-section (2) stands, in respect of the words which Senator O'Farrell has quoted and taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration, I would be able to deal with all the persons who might otherwise fall within the ambit of this section.  I do realise very much that where persons are appointed to statutory positions and their remuneration fixed, directly or indirectly, under statute, it is very difficult for me to come in and, as it were, by a side wind, repeal previous legislation.  In the case particularly of people who are not nationals of this country but who <Col N="627" /> have been engaged on a purely commercial basis without any advertence as to whether they are Japanese, Chinese or Irish, I feel that I would have to take that as an over-riding circumstance into consideration and to exclude them from any sacrifice under the Bill.  That, in general, is the manner in which I propose to interpret that section.  The last stage of this Bill was taken in the Dáil in circumstances that gave me no opportunity of adverting to that but I have no hesitation in giving that undertaking to the Seanad now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Bill is passed through its Final Stage I desire to say a word on it.  I regret that on the last day I was not present for the whole of the Minister's reply, and because of that there are just a few things I want to deal with.  The first is a quotation from a leading article that appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> on July 20th under the heading &ldquo;False Criticism&rdquo; in which <Col N="629" /> this statement was made: &ldquo;On Tuesday Senator Staines described as an aid to Communism the reduction in Gárda pay which his own Party initiated in 1931.&rdquo;  On the face of it that looks true, but I would remind Senators of the old saying: &ldquo;That a lie which is half the truth is ever the worst of lies.&rdquo;  It is true that the Minister's predecessor, Mr. Blythe, in trying to fill the gap in his Budget explored the Gárda Síochána avenue if I may put it so.  He was entitled to do that.  I am sure the people on the Government Benches will concede that.  I concede the same to the present Minister.  He is perfectly entitled to explore every possible avenue when it comes to a question of economies so that he may be enabled to fill the gap in his Budget.  But as to the reference to &ldquo;Senator Staines's Party,&rdquo; what are the facts?  The moment it was announced in the Press that the then Minister for Finance was about to make a reduction in the pay of the Gárda, I went to Mr. Blythe and to the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, and protested against any cut being made.  I said that they had been badly treated in the case of the two previous cuts, and that they were not going to stand any further cuts.  So far as I could, I insisted that there should be no further cuts.  Other members of this House, who are also members of our Party, also protested to Mr. Blythe.  As a matter of fact, when I was away in the country I believe our Party decided on sending a deputation to Mr. Blythe in connection with the matter.  There were other protests as well.  The result was that the proposal to cut the pay of the Gárda was not put into force. In other words, Mr. Blythe's proposal in its stark nakedness was killed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Minister for Finance now brings this same proposal before us, clothed in the form of a Bill. Although the Bill has gone through the Dáil I want to renew here the protest I made to Mr. Blythe when he proposed to cut the pay of the Gárda.  I want to say, too, that I will forgive the present Minister everything if he follows, even at the eleventh hour, the example that was <Col N="630" /> given by Mr. Blythe, and says that he will not cut the pay of the Gárda. I understand that on the last day during my absence, the Minister, in referring to my speech, said that I did not tell exactly the circumstances under which the Gárda got the Desborough scheme in 1922.  He made the claim, too, that the pay of the Gárda was only legal from 1924, and said that the memorandum referred to was sent to the Gárda in 1924.  I have employed a good many men during my life, shop assistants and others.  I had very few agreements with any of them.  In fact any agreement I had with them was a verbal one that I would pay them so much a week or so much a month. So far as I was concerned, I always felt it was morally binding on me to pay them the salary or wages agreed upon.  In the case of travellers and others paid on a commission basis, of course there was always a legal agreement. But, so far as I was concerned, I felt that I was as much bound to pay those with whom I had a verbal agreement as I was to pay the people with whom I had legal agreements.</P>
    <P>So far as the Gárda are concerned, the facts of the case are that I went to the Provisional Government at the time and fought for the Desborough scheme for them.  I met with opposition from the Provisional Government, but eventually, so far as the rank and file of the Gárda were concerned, it was agreed to put the Desborough scheme into operation.  It is not fair to say now, that because that scheme was not embodied in an Act before 1924 that it was not a binding agreement.  I acted as a sort of go-between at the time between the Gárda and Provisional Government, and I want to say that the agreement then arrived at was, in my opinion, just as binding as if it had been enshrined in an Act of the Oireachtas.  I am not blaming the present Minister.  He has told the House what was supposed to have happened then.  I am telling him and telling the House what actually did happen.  With regard to the statement of the <Col N="631" /> Minister in reference to the memorandum supposed to have been sent to the Gárda in 1924, I can find no trace of it, and so far as I know no one connected with the Gárda knows anything at all about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a reference to community living in the case of the Gárda.  Now I know a little about community living and about family life. Take the average country station in which you have two unmarried Gárda. They decide to live in the barrack. They have to employ a barrack servant to cook their meals and to pay her. Incidentally they are paying her also for cleaning the barrack which is Government property.  I do not think with that sort of community living that these two men could save very much. I know for a fact that the Gárda themselves would be delighted if they were ordered to live outside the barracks. Another point made by the Minister was that the Gárda had not made any demand for increased pay.  The fact is that they have been demanding an increase in pay for the last eight or nine years.  Their request for an increase of rent allowance has been before the Government for the last 18 months.</P>
    <P>I would make an earnest appeal to the Minister that, even at the last moment, he should forget about this cut in the pay of the Gárda and do for them what Mr. Blythe did in 1932.  I am making that appeal to the Minister not for the purposes of political propaganda but for the good of the country, and I hope he will respond to it.</P>

      <P>Arising out of certain remarks made by Senator David Robinson in reply to a statement of mine with regard to the wages of farm labourers on another occasion, I wish to say a few words on the Final Stage of this Bill.  The Senator said that farmers were cutting the wages of their labourers because they were obliged to do it, and that for the same reason the Minister was obliged to cut the pay of public servants.  There is no analogy whatever between these two cases. The farmer, through no fault of his own, has been reduced to such a condition <Col N="632" /> that he cannot pay to his labourers the wages that he was paying to them a few years ago.  With things as they are at present, farm labourers will be lucky if they get any wages at all in the near future.  That is due to the condition to which the farmers have been reduced by the policy of the Government.  The State finances are in their present condition not because of anything which could not be avoided but because of the deliberate incompetency of the present Government. The present Government have wasted millions and they are continuing to do so.  It is for that reason that I oppose this Bill on principle.</P>
      <P>As I said on a former occasion, if the condition of the country were normal, I would probably be in favour of some readjustment of salaries.  I want again to say that there is no comparison between the wages the farmer pays his labourers and this present &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; Bill.  There was another matter which Senator Robinson referred to, though strictly it does not come into this Bill, but as he was allowed to refer to it I may be permitted to say a word or two on it. It is with regard to the Government's wheat growing scheme.  I believe that scheme was doomed to failure before ever it was started.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I should waste the time of the Seanad in replying to the statements that have been made by Senator Staines, because on this stage of the Bill, in view of what has already happened to-day to say anything may seem rather like pumping oxygen into the patient in order to keep it alive. The Bill has received a very deadly blow at the hands of the Seanad, and it is questionable whether it is going to survive it or not.  But, since the question as to what was going to happen to the Gárda in 1932 has been raised, I think there is no harm in letting the Seanad into the real secret.  There is here a letter from my Department to the Department of Justice, dated 5th January, 1932, in which this sentence occurs:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As a contribution towards the solution of the problem confronting <Col N="633" /> the Exchequer the Government have decided that an all-round reduction of about 5 per cent. should be made in the remuneration of the Gárda Síochána.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In consequence of that the then Government went to the trouble of getting a pay order prepared and the Minister for Justice wrote to the Commissioner of the Gárda on 7th January, 1932, to the following effect:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Justice to transmit for your information the attached copy of a minute received from the Department of Finance intimating that the Government had decided that a reduction of 5 per cent. should be made in the remuneration of the Gárda Síochána.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course no further steps were taken because the general election of 1932 supervened.  When I hear Senator Staines and the other Cumann na nGaedheal Senators repeat what was said by members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Opposition in the other House that, &ldquo;Well, they had changed their minds; they were going to deal more kindly with the Gárda than we have done,&rdquo; it reminds me of a man protesting that he was not going to commit a murder because he had been executed himself previously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable persons whose property may have been damaged or who may have sustained losses due to damage to property from the period on or after 24th April, 1916, up to 12th May, 1923, and who, for one reason or another have been excluded from the scope of the existing Damage to Property (Compensation) Acts.  I shall deal with Section 2 first, as it covers most of the matters concerned. It will be seen that Section 2 (1) (a) states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All injuries to property, being a building or chattels in or about a building, which occurred in Saorstát Eireann on or after the 24th day of April, 1916, and before the 21st day of January, 1919, and which were occasioned by acts of the British military or police authorities (whether such authorities were or were not acting or purporting to act under martial law) and which were sustained in one or other of the following circumstances, that is to say, while such building was being defended in arms by any person ordinarily resident therein against such authorities or while any such person was under arrest or was endeavouring to resist arrest by such authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an extension of the existing law.  It covers a period which has not been dealt with hitherto under Damage to Property (Compensation) Acts prior to the proclamation of the First Dáil and subsequent to the outbreak of the insurrection in 1916.  It will cover also any losses that may have been sustained in the circumstances covered by the section during the anti-conscription period and during the period before the resistance to the British régime was regularised by the constitution of the Dáil.  It is rather remarkable that that period, which was very significant, has hitherto not been dealt with by the Damage to Property (Compensation) <Col N="636" /> Acts, and it was felt that, as this Bill, so to speak, was winding up and liquidating all claims and amending very serious deficiencies in the existing law, that period should also be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The remaining parts of the section deal with all the injuries to property which occurred between 21st January, 1919, and 11th July, 1921, in respect of which either no claim was made to the Damage to Property (Compensation) (Ireland) Commission or a claim was made but was not determined by that Commission.  That covers the case of those people who, for conscientious reasons, subsequent to the Treaty of 1921, feeling that being opposed to the Treaty they should not take advantage of any of the machinery set up under it, failed to claim.  It is felt with regard to them that, as so much water has flowed under the bridge since and as a considerable change has taken place in public opinion in regard to the position, these people should be given an opportunity now to make a claim which they may have felt themselves precluded from making in the critical period when the Compensation (Ireland) Commission was sitting.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) of the sub-section might be described as the originating section.  It proposes to remove disabilities which were imposed upon Republicans by the Principal Act, the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923.  Possibly members of the present Seanad are not aware of it, but under the Act of 1923 there was one very serious defect.  A person suspected&mdash;and it never went beyond suspicion&mdash;of complicity with the forces which were ranged against the Provisional Government at the time, and subsequently against the forces of Saorstát Eireann, in cases where reports were made for compensation by the county court judge at the time, and where decrees were not awarded the Minister could simply refuse to honour the report or to act on it in any way.  In the other cases, where the attention of the court was drawn to the terms of Section 9 the county court judge, if satisfied with the evidence, would have no option but <Col N="637" /> to refuse compensation, no matter in what circumstances the property was destroyed.  The general purpose of this Bill is to remove these disabilities and to enable compensation to be given in a number of cases where court decrees had already been made, or where awards were refused because of one or other of the sections referred to, or where the Minister for Finance, having received the report of the county court judge, had refused to act upon it.</P>
    <P>The general method of procedure will be exactly the same as in the Principal Act of 1923.  That is to say, a person will have to apply to the court; the case will be heard in the Circuit Court and there will be an opportunity there for both parties, the applicant on the one side and the Minister for Finance on the other side, to produce witnesses either to prove or to refute the claim.  There is no substantial departure from the procedure of the existing Act in any way, but there are a couple of modifications. For instance, under Section 11 power is taken, with reservations, to meet particular cases of hardship.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Notwithstanding anything contained in any other Act, and except where a reinstatement condition is attached to the decree and no part of such reinstatement condition was complied with before the passing of this Act, no payment shall be made after the 30th day of September, 1934, in respect of any compensation awarded by a decree made under the Principal Act...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of that is to enforce the reinstatement condition.  A number of decrees were granted many years back with a reinstatement condition attached.  No attempt has been made on the part of some of those who received the awards to comply with that condition.  The Minister for Finance can neither disburse the money to them nor appropriate it to any other purpose.  It is proposed in the circumstances set out in a subsequent sub-section, to compel them to rebuild before the 30th September, 1936, or else to forfeit the award made under the Principal Act.  There are a few exceptions. One is the case of a person who <Col N="638" /> is not actually in possession, but who will be next in possession when the present beneficiary dies, who would be quite willing to rebuild if he were in possession.  Others are where, for one reason or another, due to age or some other frailty, the existing holders are unwilling to build and cannot be compelled to do so.  In that case in sub-section (2) we make special provision to meet it.  That is to say, in the case of a person to whom compensation was awarded who dies after the passing of this Act and before the 1st day of July, 1936,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;no payment shall be made after the expiration of three years after the death of such person,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and in case he dies after the 30th June, 1936; and</P>
    <P>&ldquo;any son or daughter of such person has before the 1st day of July, 1936, agreed in writing with the Minister that, in the event of his or her becoming entitled on the death of such person to the land on which was situate the premises in respect of which such compensation was awarded, he or she will, within a period of three years after the death of such person, completely comply with such reinstatement condition,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>then in either of these two cases the provision as to forfeiture does not apply.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with cases which have arisen, one comparatively recently, where compensation has been paid, and some of the chattels in respect of which compensation was given are subsequently found, and become the property of the Minister for Finance, who will be bound to offer them for purchase to the person to whom compensation was originally ordered.  If they are not sold at an agreed price, then the Minister for Finance has power to dispose of them in the open market, and, I suppose, the beneficiary might buy them for whatever they fetch.  These are the only proposals in the Bill.  I need not detain the Seanad by dwelling upon them at length.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the estimated amount that will have to be paid in compensation under this Bill?  That, of <Col N="639" /> course, is a rather important consideration. I hope this is really the last of the Bills we shall have regarding the payment of compensation and pensions arising out of the civil war and the preceding war.  We have had practically in every case to pay pensions and compensation to everyone engaged on either side.  Now we have to pay for the damage done by both sides. Undoubtedly the principle we have adopted is a rather assuring one for those who may desire a scrap in the future.  We have committed ourselves to the principle of paying everybody who engages in any fight in this country.  No matter whether he wins or loses he is bound to win in the long run, as far as finances and pensions are concerned.  I do not offer any objection to the payment of pensions, in regard to the civil war, to all concerned, because of the particular circumstances. There is one section which I think should not be included, Section 10, which deals with cases in which an appeal was lodged by the Minister against the award on the grounds laid down in (a) and (b) of Section 9 of the Principal Act, and on other grounds.  In many cases the applicant made a settlement with the Minister as a result of which the appeal was withdrawn or, in some cases, allowed to go to the judge, who made a reduction in the original amount claimed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister takes power here to reopen these cases and to give the person concerned the amount he was awarded at first, although he agreed to a lesser amount.  What pressure has been brought to bear on the Minister in this respect, and how many cases of that kind are there?  There must be some insistent people, I suppose, or he would hardly go out of his way to reopen cases of the kind.  It is hardly fair to ask the State to allow the Minister to reopen these cases now, and to pay out sums of money in excess of the sums they were prepared to accept when they made a settlement with the Minister.  This seems to me to be the most unreasonable and unjustifiable section in the Bill.  I would like to know what are the <Col N="640" /> grounds for it, if there are many people affected, and why the State should be asked to foot the bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of a very large number of people who object to compensation being paid to people who went out against the majority in this country, the majority that voted in favour of accepting the Treaty.  These people went out in rebellion or sheltered forces which were in opposition. The Minister is here to-day by virtue of the fact that the Treaty was accepted.  Otherwise he would not be here.  He and his Party did all in their power against it.  It is very unfair, especially in the present state of the country's finances, when we are heading for national bankruptcy, that money should have to be paid to people who were on the side of failure. As Senator O'Farrell has pointed out, it is a direct encouragement to people to go out and fight in order that they may get compensation, even if they fail. It is a terrible principle and I protest against it.  Large numbers of people on the majority side suffered very serious consequential losses, but they were deprived of any compensation because that question was not covered by the Act.  I realise that consequential losses could not be taken in, because all the money in the Bank of England would not pay for them.  To bring in this Bill proposing to pay compensation to people who helped those who were in revolt against the State, and against the majority of the people, is a wrong principle.  Large numbers of people keenly feel being taxed for that.</P>

      <P>What cases are covered by the latter portion of paragraph (c) of Section 10?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>it shall be lawful for the said Minister, if he so thinks proper, to pay in accordance with this section to such person, subject, where there was attached to such decree a reinstatement condition, to compliance by such person with such conditions (if any) as the said Minister thinks fit to attach to such payment, such sum, not exceeding the difference between the original <Col N="641" /> amount and the agreed lesser amount, as the said Minister thinks proper&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Does that mean that it applies only to cases where there was a reinstatement condition?  It would limit the Bill to a great extent if the section only applied in such cases.  Perhaps the Minister would explain why these words are put in and what a reinstatement condition has to do with the payment of the money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator Jameson I might help to clarify the matter.  It might not be practicable in a case where a reinstatement condition was originally imposed to enforce that condition now.  It might have been originally a condition to reinstate a building, which has since been replaced by another building. Instead, we might ask the person either to accept some lesser amount, or to do some other work of the same nature as reinstatement.  I can only do that where there was a reinstatement condition attached.  It does not, as the Senator seems to believe, debar me from dealing with other cases in which no condition of that kind was found.</P>
      <P>On the general merits of the section I think that if Senator O'Farrell was as fully aware of the circumstances as I have had to make myself in regard to the matter, he would see that it is a section that is wholly justifiable. First of all, if the Senator will turn to paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) he will see it reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where an appeal was lodged by the Minister for Finance against such decree on the ground that paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of Section 9 of the Principal Act applied to such a person, or on that ground and other grounds&mdash;</P>
      <P>and that following the notice of appeal,</P>
      <P>an agreement was entered into between the said Minister and such person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases, I feel that appeal was lodged under section 9 in order to coerce a person into making a settlement <Col N="642" /> which otherwise he would not be prepared to make if Section 9 were not there.  He was put into the position that if he did not make such a settlement he would have to run the gauntlet twice over.  He might have already secured a decree in the other court because the knowledge that he was a member of, a helper of, or an active sympathiser with these associations, had not come to the notice of the authorities, or they were not in a position to produce evidence to show that he could be ruled out under Section 9.</P>
    <P>Having secured his decree on the merits of his claim, that is to say on the ground that he had sustained damage to such and such an amount&mdash; that it was considered merely a question of equity, that he had sustained damage to this amount in circumstances that existed at the time, and the court had granted a decree in his favour&mdash;then having secured that decree he was put in this dilemma that, possibly, subsequent information may have come to the authorities to show that he was an active sympathiser&mdash;and &ldquo;active sympathiser&rdquo; was a term that might be very widely construed by the courts.  There was then no regular political Republican organisation but he might have been a person who was known to have been a supporter of the Republican movement generally. Possibly on going to the courts he would be confronted with this statement, and it was possible for the State to make the claim that, irrespective of whether he had suffered this serious loss or not, he was known to be a supporter of the Republican movement and that therefore he was debarred from securing compensation.  This person had sustained very serious damage, and it was possibly vital to the future of himself and his family that he should be compensated for that damage at the earliest possible moment. He wanted to be able to turn and pursue his ordinary avocations at the earliest possible date, but he had to run the risk of being brought to the court a second time by the Minister for Finance, having this section pleaded against him, and losing everything which the court had awarded him in <Col N="643" /> the first instance.  That is the position in which these people were placed.</P>
    <P>I have studied a number of cases and it has been brought home clearly to my mind that these people if they thought they would have a fair trial in the second court and that this section would not have been pleaded against them, would have refused to make any settlement, because their losses were not covered by the amount awarded them but they went on the principle that a bird in the hand was worth two in the bush.  In these circumstances they were compelled to accept the compensation offered them.  We are reopening the cases of these people who were originally disqualified from procuring compensation by the operation of Section 9, and we are allowing people who would have gone to the courts but who did not do so because they felt that Section 9 would be pleaded against them, to come forward and to make fresh claims.  We say that we are entitled to reopen cases where Section 9 has been used to coerce a settlement out of court that people who were placed in that cruel position should be no longer prejudiced, and that the original decree should stand.</P>
    <P>On the merits of the original decree I should like to say that there are not many cases on record so far as I know where the Appeal Court reduced the amount of the original decree.  They allowed it to stand without any reduction and the only cases where there was any alteration in the original decision were those cases in which Section 9 was pleaded against the applicant.  I think, in view of the fact of the original decree having been allowed to stand in those cases where Section 9 was not pleaded, we are perfectly justified in accepting that decree and in being bound by it, in determining what compensation will be paid in cases which will be reopened in the circumstances which I have related to the House.</P>

      <P>I think we shall leave that till doomsday to decide.  No matter who was responsible for it, over ten years have gone by and the point is, are we going to continue to keep alive the spirit of bitterness engendered by the Civil War?  We have paid already £3,000,000 for damage caused since the truce. There is left a small remnant of damage still to be compensated for. The fact that the State up to this has refused to recognise the claims of these people is only breeding illwill and keeping alive feelings that in the interests of the nation it were much better had been appeased long ago.  I do not know to what Parties the beneficiaries would now attach themselves. We do not know whether they would be on the extreme right or the extreme left of the present Government, but at any rate they were all Irish citizens who suffered in the civil conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> If the verdict of two recent general elections is taken into consideration in connection with these matters, I am not sure that we can say that everything that was done on one side during the civil conflict has been justified any more than the things that were done on the other side have been justified. I am quite prepared to admit that damage was done by both sides to the common body of the Irish nation.  One side has been fully and adequately compensated for that damage so far as it could be done during the ten years that preceded our advent to office. There remains something more to repair, which is trifling in comparison. We say that it would be much better that this £350,000 should be spent and that all these records, as regards mere physical injury, should be blotted out. If that were done, the general appeasement which would ensue would be worth much more to the Irish people of the future than this £350,000.</P>

It will take some time to debate these amendments. We cannot debate all these details on Second Reading.  Senators would have to make a study of these matters and, perhaps, would have to get the assistance of some legal gentleman.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter first arose when a Moneylenders Bill was introduced as a private measure in 1929.  After going as far as Second Reading in the Dáil, it was referred to a Select Committee of the House.  That Select Committee, which was representative of all Parties, examined the question very closely and in very great detail and a considerable volume of evidence was given before it.  They reported back in, I think, December, 1931, but before their recommendations could be embodied in a Bill, the Dáil dissolved and, consequently, the Bill had to be re-introduced.  Before much progress was made, however, the Dáil again dissolved and we are now in the position of trying to get it through.  It is not, I trust, a contentious measure. It is a measure which has been accepted by the Government and which is carrying out in every way the recommendations made by that Select Committee.  We have followed all the recommendations made and embodied them in this Bill.  I think that the evidence tendered before that Committee should satisfy us that a necessity exists for such a measure.  In 1927, a Bill was introduced and passed in the British Parliament on practically similar lines to the Bill now before the House for consideration.  A Bill on practically the same lines has also been passed through the Northern Ireland Parliament.  The main difference in the Bills is the rate of interest. In the British Act and in the other Act, the interest is fixed at 48 per cent.  The recommendation here was that the interest should be 39 per cent., <Col N="648" /> and that is the provision embodied in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how exactly they work that out, but from the evidence before them the committee was, apparently, satisfied that that was the rate that should be fixed. It would not be for me to say whether that was wrong or otherwise.  The position with regard to moneylenders was an unsatisfactory position.  It was based practically entirely on the Act of 1900, and experience and the evidence given before the committee have shown that it did not provide sufficient safeguards.  Moneylenders had to apply for the licence and, provided they paid the fee, the Revenue Commissioners had no power to refuse a licence. There were no special grounds that would enable a licence to be refused provided the necessary fee was paid. In addition, the licence had not to be renewed for three years but, under the provisions of this Bill, it is provided that a moneylender must apply to the Revenue Commissioners, and if the period of the licence is less than a year, expiring on 1st July, the fee is £10, and for the whole year, expiring on 31st July, £15.  The fees to be paid are set out in the Finance Act.  Having got a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners, the moneylender has to go before a district justice and various grounds on which he can refuse a licence are set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy in the Dáil put forward certain amendments&mdash;he suggested them on Committee Stage and moved them on Report Stage&mdash;but those amendments could not, in the form in which they were at the time, be embodied in the Bill without consequential amendments.  I, however, undertook to have them embodied together with the necessary consequential amendments.  These amendments, which dealt with the question of Irish nationals, are now embodied in the Bill. The amendments had relation to the grounds on which a district justice could refuse a licence.  There is also provision in the Bill for suspension and <Col N="649" /> the forfeiture of moneylenders' certificates, and it provides that particulars must be furnished to any person who has had a loan setting out the interest due, the principal, and so on.  The Bill imposes restrictions on moneylenders advertising and, in that connection, I might mention that before the Moneylenders Bill was first introduced, a Bill dealing with the question of canvassing and advertising by moneylenders was introduced by the late Deputy Bryan Cooper.  That is being embodied in this Bill, which also sets out the form in which moneylenders' contracts must be made out. I do not think there is any other matter to which I need refer at this stage, but if any Senator would like any matter cleared up I can deal with it at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Bill generally will be acceptable.  I query the 39 per cent. as being too high but as it was recommended by the Committee I am not sure that we ought to go very far in the direction of reducing it.  There are two small points to which I would ask the Minister to direct some attention between now and the Committee Stage.  It has been submitted to me&mdash;I cannot say by responsible organisations of any kind but by individuals&mdash;that it has been the practice of moneylenders in Dublin, and, perhaps, some other towns, to use the Sunday as the day on which to go down to the wife and press for their instalments, having a better chance of catching the husband at home on that day and, in that way, coercing the wife into paying up.  I have been urged to get an amendment inserted to make it an offence not merely to carry on business in the sense of lending out money but to collect or to attempt to collect money on a Sunday, Christmas Day, Good Friday or St. Patrick's Day.  I have also been asked whether it would be possible to make an offence the deduction of the first instalment of interest at the time of the lending of the original principal.  That is a device&mdash;in fact, a trick&mdash;whereby borrowers are led to believe that they are paying a certain rate of interest when they are, in fact, paying a much <Col N="650" /> higher rate than appears on the surface.  I have no very definite amendments in mind in regard to these points but I raise them as requested for the Minister's consideration as to whether it would be possible to amend the Bill to prohibit these practices.</P>

      <P>I will have the matter inquired into but I think that the practice of calling on Sundays would be open to the interpretation of carrying on business.  Collection is as much a part of the business as the actual lending of the money but I will have the matter looked into.  As to the question of the high interest, the rate of 39 per cent. is given to the court only as an idea and it does not bind the court to allow the 39 per cent.  As the law stood under the 1900 Act, the court could not interfere unless it was satisfied that the transaction was harsh and unconscionable and that the interest charged was excessive but the court can still hold, in the circumstances of any transaction, that although the interest was under 39 per cent. the transaction is harsh and unconscionable and the interest charged is excessive.  I think that meets the point that Senator Johnson has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago I appeared before the Seanad on the question of setting up a Pig Industries Tribunal.  There was a fairly long term of reference submitted to the tribunal in connection with pigs and bacon, but before proceeding with that business they took one of the matters submitted to them and issued an Interim Report which has, I believe, been distributed to <Col N="651" /> Senators and Deputies.  That report deals with the necessity for setting up machinery to control exports to any country in which a quota is adopted in relation to exports from this country. The matter became urgent, particularly on account of the action of Great Britain in dealing with the entries of pigs into the country for conversion into bacon and pork.  It is expected that these quota regulations in Great Britain will come into operation about the 10th September. It is stated that Great Britain will not allot a quota to any country that has not machinery set up to deal with the situation. The machinery necessary is that the Government of a particular country would be in a position to take a global quota and sub-allocate that quota in any way that the regulations might permit in the country concerned. The quota will apply to pigs for conversion into bacon and to pork carcases for conversion into bacon.  It will not apply to pork exported, or to pigs for conversion into pork.  That is as far as our information goes at present.  They mean, I understand, to restrict the supplies of bacon on the home market to somewhere about 10,500,000 cwts.  That figure is somewhat lower than the consumption in Great Britain in 1932.  They will commence by finding out what is the probable supply of bacon by home producers for the year.  I believe that forms have been circulated in Great Britain to the factories and to suppliers asking them to register, for the coming year, the number of pigs they may wish to supply for bacon for the year 1934, and also, of course, for the last quarter of this year.  As soon as they have got definite information as to what the home supplies are likely to be, they will then allot quotas to importing countries of quantities based on imports into Great Britain over a number of years.</P>
      <P>The Pig Industries Tribunal, in their Interim Report, recommend that special consideration be given to the following points:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That powers be taken to make the necessary sub-allocations of the <Col N="652" /> quota allotted to the Saorstát and to regulate exports accordingly; that exporters of bacon and live pigs should be registered; that, for the purpose of tendering advice to the Minister on all or any of the matters concerned, a consultative council or councils should be set up and that there should be power to re-allocate sub-quotas from time to time in the event of individual exporters failing to utilise their sub-quota in full or within some reasonable tolerance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not possible, unfortunately, to anticipate the full scope or extent of any system of restriction at the moment.  We are, therefore, in the position that we cannot draw up what we would like, perhaps, to do.  The Bill is to meet every emergency.  The sections in it are intended to cover the various situations that may arise under this quota system.  We are compelled, therefore, to bring in a Bill which gives to the Minister rather large powers to do all those matters by Order.  This is to be regarded as a temporary Bill, to be replaced by a more comprehensive Bill as soon as we have some experience of the working of these quotas.  In order to ensure that adequate control can be kept of the situation it is proposed to issue Orders from time to time dealing with all the matters that are mentioned in Section 2 of the Bill, so that the Dáil and Seanad, if they have not the opportunity of dealing in anticipation with the measures that may be taken, the members of both Houses will at least have the opportunity of discussing any particular Order that may be made.  Nothing can be done under the Bill without an Order and that Order must be placed on the Table of both Houses.  Therefore, any Senator or Deputy will have an opportunity of voicing his objection to any Order that may be made or to anything that may be done under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Power is given under Section 3 of the Bill to the Minister to go into the bacon and pig trade if he thinks necessary. That provision requires, perhaps, a little explanation.  This Bill covers the position of quotas being given by any country for any product.</P>
    <Col N="653" />
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not apply to pigs only?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It would apply to any agricultural product and to any country that may have a quota system for that particular product.  The urgency of the Bill is due to the bacon quota being brought in by Great Britain.  As Senators are aware, where a country allots a quota between various countries, if any one country fails to fulfil the quota over a certain period&mdash;the periods are generally stated in these regulations&mdash;then that country is permanently and definitely cut down in its quota to the quantity that it had been supplying over that period.  There would be grave danger, for instance, if the matter of the export of bacon and pigs were left to traders alone that due to some adverse circumstance, say to price when they might not be inclined to export during the period&mdash;we do not know what it will be yet, whether it will be a fortnight or month or quarter &mdash;what was the quantity that was allotted.  If that happened then we in this country would be in danger of losing the quota.  In view of that, it is felt that the Minister should have power to come in and fill the gap himself in case the traders were not doing it.  It is only in these circumstances that he would use that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill gives power to the officers of Customs and Excise to deal with any contravention, or attempted contravention, of an order. It was thought at one time that the period for a quota would be a fortnight. If that were the period there would be very little time to find out whether the quota was being fulfilled each fortnight or not.  We would have to make arrangements with exporters to send daily returns of their exports to the Department of Agriculture.  If, say, in the last two or three days of the period we found that the quota was not being fulfilled certain steps would have to be taken.  These two or three days would leave very little time to do anything.  We think the best check we can have on these returns is the information to be obtained from the officers of Customs <Col N="654" /> and Excise at the ports or at the border as the case may be.  We are, therefore, giving these officers power to get the necessary information.</P>
    <P>I have met representatives of the trade.  In fact every known exporter of bacon and pigs was asked to attend a conference in the Department of Agriculture.  This matter was discussed with them and I think that the Bill in every respect meets with their wishes.  I also undertook, in consultation with them, to set up two advisory councils, one for bacon and one for live pigs.  The representatives of the trade are submitting panels to me, and from these panels the names of the members of the advisory councils will be selected. Nothing material at any rate will be done under this Bill without consulting the members of the trade with regard to the various provisions under the Bill.  We feel that a Bill of this sort could not be worked except in the closest co-operation with those in the trade.  We have, therefore, given them that undertaking: that these advisory councils will be set up, one from amongst bacon exporters and one from amongst the exporters of live pigs.</P>
    <P>As I stated a moment ago, in answer to Senator Wilson, this Bill gives powers to deal with the agricultural products of any country where a quota has been imposed.  We would have been very glad, for instance, to have had this Bill last autumn to deal with the export of butter to Belgium, but on that occasion we were lucky in getting all the exporters to agree to have the butter exported through the one source.  If we had not got that agreement there is no doubt but that there would have been a cutting of prices, and that this country would not have got the advantages which we did get in the case of Belgium on account of that agreement.  In future, if we fail to get agreement of that sort we will have power under this Bill to allocate quotas to those in the trade who would at least give some undertaking to get the best possible price where a quota is being imposed against us.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is very much to say on this Bill.  As the Minister pointed out, it will be necessary for him, in present circumstances when this quota system comes into operation, to have the necessary powers to deal with it.  It is a very serious matter.  It is desperate to contemplate what the results will be if we reach the condition when we shall have a quota system for our live stock.  These quotas are all the result of the Government's policy.</P>

      <P>I am not going to go into that.  I just want to say this, that last week in this House the Minister for Finance tried to justify the attitude of the British Government in putting on those quotas.  He said that the first duty of the British Government was to preserve the home trade for their own nationals, to try and get the British farmers into a better position than they are in, and that no matter what happened, whether we had an economic war or what Government was in power, that these quotas were bound to come. I want to say that it is not the informed opinion of the majority of the people of this country that these quotas would have ever come except for the attitude of our Government.</P>

      <P>At all events, if we were living in normal times and such a thing as a quota system was attempted in this country there would be such an agitation, with every class in the country backing up the Government, that it could not succeed.  Under Section 3 the Minister is taking power to fill the quota if the exporters fail to do so. That is becoming a rather regular thing with our Government now.  I thought <Col N="656" /> in view of the experience which the Minister had recently as regards buying and selling live stock and interfering with the trade&mdash;it was not very successful&mdash;that he would not venture into anything of the kind again.  With regard to the setting up of consultative councils, I think that is desirable. The Minister told us that the members are to be selected from a panel submitted by the trade.  I think the Minister should not reserve power to himself to keep those consultative councils in existence at his pleasure.  These people may be inclined to insist on their opinions, and therefore if the Minister disagrees with them he need not invite them to meet again.  I think the Minister should agree to accept an amendment to that section so that the members of these consultative councils will be independent of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill astonishes one and rather terrifies one, too.  We know that the present Government propounded the policy that we should be self-supporting and should consume our own products.  We were also told frequently that our export trade was not of vital importance; that, in fact, what they were aiming at was that we should make everything we wanted ourselves and be a self-supporting country and that we should practically bar out of this country the imports of other countries.  Now, a Bill is introduced by that same Government who say that we shall have to pass it to enable them to assist our exports.  As far as it goes it is decidedly gratifying, but it is a very far-reaching Bill. Section 1 states:</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;agricultural product&rdquo; includes any product of agriculture or horticulture or any article of food or drink wholly or partly manufactured or derived from any such product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That covers practically every produce in the Free State, although the Minister only referred to pigs and such like things.  I believe that the provisions in some of the sections in this Bill are such as we have seen in operation in Russia.  For instance, it suited the Russian Government at one time when they wanted to pay for manufactured <Col N="657" /> articles which they were buying from other countries, to take hold of the wheat, which was their great article of export, whether it was needed in the country or not, and to sell it abroad and leave themselves with a shortage of wheat simply because the Government thought it was right.  Exactly the same provision is in this Bill.  The Minister can purchase and export and sell agricultural produce.  We are told that the object of that is to keep up the quota so that our future exports will not be diminished. Probably it will be known to the people who own that produce that they could sell it at home at a better price.  Look at the interference with trade that can come from such a clause as that.  Supposing we had our milling system and everything else regulated, it might be possible to foresee a shortage of wheat in this country and various other things which are needed not only for food purposes but for many other things.  If the Minister proceeded to keep up a quota and sold out of the country agricultural material which was really required by the trade, say, of the country, he might create a very serious situation indeed, not merely in regard to the food supplies but in regard to manufacturing.</P>
    <P>The whole point of the Bill seems to be to meet the question of countries putting up quotas against us.  We are steadily, and as hard as we can, putting up tariffs and even prohibitory conditions against importations from other countries.  We will not allow them in at all.  Here comes the retaliation that we saw ahead of us.  People in other countries are beginning to object to imports into their countries of something that we are making.</P>
    <P>The Government, I think, is at last beginning to awake to the fact that we cannot exist without exports.  I wonder if this is the right way of dealing with the matter.  Why do we apply to practically everything that is made in the Free State the conditions which are applied to bacon and pork? I think we ought to have a much more confined description of what the Bill deals with than is contained in the definition in Section 1.  It deals with <Col N="658" /> everything manufactured out of agricultural produce.  It seems to me to be far too wide.  The Minister can come along and take practically everything we have got.  For instance, in my own industry I believe that if he came to the conclusion there was too much whiskey in the Free State he could take away our supply, if he were a temperance advocate, and leave us none at all.  I am only pointing to that as an example.  If there is any motive in it, why does it go beyond what we consider agricultural products and why is it applied as it is here, to manufactures?  I think the definition in Section 1 is far too wide for the purposes of the Bill.  There is power to regulate and control the export of agricultural products.  I would rather leave that to be dealt with by the actual producers of the products.  I think that a Bill such as this, which gives the Minister power to do these things, even with a consultative council behind him, if it becomes an Act, will be an Act that may do serious injury if it is not watched very carefully.  There might be tremendous interference with freedom of trade and freedom of production and what people would want to deal in.  We are now coming to the point that the whole of our business is regulated by tariffs.  We have retaliation on the other side by the imposition of quotas.</P>
    <P>This Bill, and everything connected with it, is an absolute denial of the idea that countries should try and relieve each others' burdens and help each other out of the difficulties of the day.  All these quotas and tariffs are direct acts by one country in making war upon another, instead of countries trying to co-operate to help each other out.  America, of course, is practically the standing instance of the whole thing.  The whole world is at present crippled because of one or two countries collaring all the gold. America adopts the principle which, apparently, is the Free State principle of doing business for itself and by imposing quotas and tariffs, importing nothing from other countries and producing all it requires.  I really think this Bill should receive very serious <Col N="659" /> consideration before we pass it.  This gives the Minister power to buy up what he considers is necessary to keep up the quota, which might be a very large amount, of any product in this country, not knowing&mdash;he could not possibly know&mdash;the various things that happened in regard to the purchase of any particular article produced in this State.  Various people who deal, say, in one particular article may have calculated that there was a balance of that article lying there which would put them over a temporary shortage, and that there was a supply for all their needs.  The Minister wants to keep up our quota.  He comes in and buys what is necessary to keep up the quota and ships it out of the country. He may buy a large quantity and he may upset every calculation that anybody who knew the stocks of agricultural produce in the country had made.  It will certainly enormously complicate business.  It may be necessary, but it is an extremely dangerous measure.  What sort of a council is going to know enough to be able to deal with such matters as I have been referring to?  There are certain stocks on hand.  Every man is buying and selling because he has a very fair idea of the stocks in the country.  He is balancing his business accordingly and knows what he ought to give for the product.  The Minister steps in, because there is not enough going out of the country to keep up the quota which he wants to keep up, rightly I daresay.  He ships all that out of the country and upsets every man's private calculations.</P>
    <P>Business, of course, both in this and other countries is every day becoming more difficult and a Bill such as this only makes it extremely more difficult, because you have to get a licence to export this or that.  I suppose it will come to this, that if I have a dozen head of cattle to sell, unless I have gone through the procedure of sending to the Minister for a licence, I cannot sell them in the Dublin market.  An exporter cannot export them, and goodness knows where the cattle market or anything else will go if it depends on that procedure.  In our <Col N="660" /> business we use a large quantity of agricultural products and the very article that we make may come under this.  That is why I am talking about the definition.  You are giving the Minister, or the Consultative Council, control over the products of this country.  There is only one idea that makes the Bill worth talking about and that is to preserve our quota in the country that has imposed this quota on us.  That is the whole purpose of the Bill.  I hold that the Bill goes far beyond what is required to deal with the situation in front of the Government.</P>

Senator Jameson may make up his mind that there will be <Col N="661" /> no exports of wheat, notwithstanding the Act the Minister got passed because there are only 15,000 or 16,000 acres grown this year.  We export oats.  A quota might be placed on potatoes.  That is a very urgent matter because the Dublin market is over supplied at present.  It would be a good thing if we could get a quota for potatoes.  We export butter and cream.  If the Senator is anxious about the definition of &ldquo;food or drink wholly or partly manufactured or derived from any such product&rdquo; he should put in whiskey or beer.  Probably the Minister would agree.  I am sure that Senator Jameson would be glad to export whiskey.</P>

      <P>If the Minister can help I am sure he will put in something reasonable.  I am afraid there may be a quota on cattle.  That is a serious item for this country.  We must export 700,000 head of cattle every year.  We have 1,000,000 calves every year of which the home trade requires 300,000, and the rest have to be exported.  If the quota for cattle is fixed lower than 700,000 and if we cannot get an outlet we would have to cut the heads off the calves.  There is no use producing calves when meat is so plentiful that even the poorest people in Dublin will only buy the hindquarters of lamb.  The rest of the mutton is considered not to be suitable by the people.  I have that information from a butcher in Dublin.</P>

Meat has become too plentiful.  If that happens in the cattle trade, where will we be and where will Senator Counihan get his dividends?  We will be in an awful state.  Whatever quota is set up for cattle, I hope it will not be lower than 700,000 head per year.  If we can get that quota, no harm will be done. <Col N="662" /> Our main exports are cattle, pigs, horses, sheep, potatoes, butter, cream and eggs.  There is no question of a shortage of food and there never will be in this country.  We will always have to import wheat and in case we do not and are forced to substitute something for wheat, the farmers will be able to feed the people with potatoes and salt, buttermilk and eggs and I suppose we will be as well off as we were in 1846 and 1847.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to a few matters in connection with the pig trade.  What is the quota for the export of pigs based on?  In the last three months of last year, there was a surplus of pigs owing, in my opinion, to the policy of protection.  Rearers and feeders began to regulate supplies until we arrived at the time when there was a shortage of supplies.  In the fall of this year, when the trade for young pork opens, there will be a bigger shortage of bacon for export.  Before we give the authority that has been asked for here and before the shortage becomes serious, I would like to know if the Minister proposes to regulate the quota that is anticipated.</P>

      <P>There are rumours, but they may be only rumours, as to what is proposed to be done with home-cured bacon&mdash;that there is to be a levy to maintain the export trade.  It is unnecessary to point out how objectionable that would be.  It would raise the price of bacon to the home consumers and make it difficult for the producers. The other point has been mentioned by Senator Wilson, that we would have arrived at such a tragic position that we would have to import bacon to fill the quota.</P>

      <P>A serious shortage of supplies is likely to occur in the fall of this year.  That would seriously affect consumers and producers here.  I would like to know whether the proposed quota will be equal to that given to other Commonwealth countries or foreign countries and how the Free State would stand in <Col N="663" /> the matter?  I know that it is objectionable to mention the economic war and I am not keen on doing so, but I believe that we are doing a lot more harm and destroying the trade in the export of pigs by protection. I happen to be interested in the co-operative industry in Waterford and we feel that that is the outcome. I would like to know whether co-operative production and curing will be placed on the same footing as proprietary institutions.  The object of co-operative methods was to do the best that was possible for the producer and, at the same time, put bacon on the market as cheaply as possible.  It is to the interest of the proprietary concerns to buy as cheaply as they can and to sell as dearly, in other words, like good businessmen, to make a profit.  We would like to have a little more enlightenment on these matters, and as to how the quota is to be filled having regard to the harm that has been done by protection.  I suggest that serious harm has been done and that difficulties have arisen which have created uncertainty with regard to price.</P>

      <P>Senator Jameson gave utterance to one principle that I welcome from him and I would ask the Minister to take particular note of it.  It was the doctrine that it is wrong to allow food to go out of the country so long as there is a need for it within the country.  I am glad to have that doctrine from Senator Jameson, because it is one I have enunciated for a long time and have endeavoured to have effect given to.  I do not think the Senator need be seriously alarmed about the dangerous menace of this measure.  He built a good deal of his case upon the definition of the expression &ldquo;agricultural product&rdquo; but if he had gone further and had read the first two lines of Section 2 he would have found that the danger which he seemed to discern in that definition was very much minimised that &ldquo;agricultural product&rdquo; could mean any agricultural food or drink.  He will also see that, as far as this Bill is concerned, it will only <Col N="664" /> have effect on any country to which any agricultural product is usually exported which establishes a system of restriction on the exports of that product. It is only when that restriction is imposed by another country upon a particular product of this country that any action is to be taken.  Supposing this Bill does not pass and supposing that the Seanad is convinced that it is an extremely dangerous measure, what is the position? A country imposing a quota can make that quota any figure it likes and the Ministry here has no power to assist the normal trade of this country in maintaining that quota.  A country may export at one period of the year an unduly large amount and fill the quota in six months, thus destroying its chances at a later period of the year. The whole business of the export of this particular product may be utterly destroyed by the action of a few people who may have a particular interest or who may misunderstand their own interest by exporting excessively at a certain period and destroy the remainder of the business in that particular commodity.  All the powers that the Senator seems to think are implicit in this Bill will only be applied to meet the probable consequences of the action of another country.  I suggest to the Senator that unless this Bill were enacted, the dangers of the use of the quota system by other countries would be very much greater indeed than any possible risk involved in passing the Bill.  It may be true that the quota system, the tariff system and the restrictions that countries throughout the world have adopted are all damaging to international trade, but it is not what the Minister or this House is asked to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Wilson said that this was not an international conference.  I take it we are bound to consider the situation that has been created in the absence of an international agreement.  I would remind the Senator and the House that this quota idea was pressed upon the British Government by the representatives of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and in respect of the pig <Col N="665" /> trade particularly to which this is immediately applicable, the British quota system is directed, if against any country at all, against Denmark and not against this country, because the Danes export to Britain 12 to 15 times the quanity of bacon this country exports to Britain. If British pig rearers and bacon curers have any interest in the matter of protecting their own industry&mdash;and anybody who has followed the course of events in Great Britain agriculturally latterly will know that they keen on increasing the supply of British bacon&mdash;they will be concerned not so much with the Irish trade as with the Danish, the Polish, the Chinese and probably the Russian.  Certainly Ireland has a small proportion of the British trade in pig products.  I anticipate, it is almost inevitable, I think, that in fixing quotas the British Government will take into account the imports from the various countries for the past years.  Let us take the bacon trade as an illustration.  Unless it is considered desirable by the bacon trade that the quota, based as it will be on the export of previous years, is to be allowed to get below that figure, then it is incumbent upon the Minister to take some action, in the interests of the trade in future years, which will maintain the level as far as possible that will be fixed by the Governments concerned.  Unless the Minister has such powers as are given in this Bill it means that the organised action of the buyers in Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, or other countries is to be met by the unorganised action of the sellers of these products in this country.  On the one hand you have a highly organised Governmental control for the protection and the assistance of the producers of these commodities in Great Britain and other countries, and that has to be met by organised action in the exporters' country.  If that is not so, you will have the disadvantages that will always ensue from the unorganised, the inefficient and the irrational as opposed to the organised, the efficient and the rational.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be the essential case for this Bill, that some power <Col N="666" /> should be given to the Minister to assist whatever trade is in question.  It should also be remembered that it does not come into effect until some action is taken in respect of the particular product by the country concerned.  If the Senator is afraid of whiskey or beer, let us say, the provisions of the Bill will only apply in case the British Government or a Continental Government apply a quota to these particular products.  Even in that case I think the Senator would agree that it would be desirable that the various interests concerned in the export of these commodities should act collectively and in some kind of unison, so that one firm would not be able to destroy the interests of the whole trade.  I think that there can be no question not alone of the desirability but of the necessity of a Bill such as this.</P>

      <P>I desire to mention one instance that came to my notice in relation to what Senator Johnson has stated.  It happened that some time ago there was a meeting of representatives of different countries in Berlin to settle the quotas which were to be allowed into that country.  These representatives had a good deal of bargaining when settling the quotas.  It happened that about that time a very small quantity of butter had been sent into Germany from this country.  There was no one there to look after our interests and the result was that the Free State quota was reduced to about one-fourth of the amount that had been allowed in previously.  All the other nations represented there got the advantage of the arrangement, but the Free State lost three-fourths of its quota.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I dislike very much this system of quotas, but it appears the world is passing through a phase in which each country now regulates the import of commodities from other countries.  There are quotas in operation in Germany and in France.  I think that while this system of quotas continues it is essential to give the Government of this country power to control its exports.  If the imports of France, Germany and other countries are controlled I think it is absolutely essential that the exports of the particular commodities from this country should be also controlled.  If you refuse to pass this measure you will be depriving the Minister of the only weapon by which he can meet the quota systems of other countries and you will be leaving exporters open to the calamity of competing with each other in a controlled market without any regulation whatever of the supplies. I sympathise very much with some of the observations which Senators Jameson and Wilson have made.  As I understand Senator Wilson's speech, he is not opposed to the measure.  He considers it a necessity in view of the evils which are foreseen, evils resulting from the restriction of our exports to other countries.  I certainly think it is a reasonable measure.  It does not go beyond the necessities of the case and I think the Minister ought to get the powers which he has asked for in this measure.</P>

      <P>Senator Wilson was much concerned with regard to the exportation of cattle.  I think he said it was necessary for us to get rid of 700,000 per year.  Increased tillage, of course, implies the raising of large numbers of cattle.  I do hope that if an agreement is made, it will be made in terms of live tons, and not in terms <Col N="668" /> of numbers.  I do not know the numbers of very heavy cattle that are exported, nor the numbers of lighter stores, but I should imagine there would be a margin between them.  If an agreement were made in regard to live tons we would probably get rid of a very much larger number of animals in that way by finishing them off earlier.  I hope that if the Government consider that it is possible to make an agreement, as far as cattle are concerned, on these lines, they will endeavour to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think perhaps I did not make it very definite in my opening statement that we have been almost compelled to bring in this Bill if we want to carry on a trade with Great Britain or in fact if we want to export any other product to any country. Every agricultural product will soon be quotaed in Britain.  One of the provisions of their regulations is that the exporting country must have machinery set up for the purposes of this quota.  If the Government of the exporting country does not set up machinery, no quota will be given.  We had therefore to bring in this measure to set up the machinery.  Senator Jameson was glad, as he said, that this was more or less a departure from Government policy.  I think that statement is not quite justified.  I have always stated, both in Opposition and since I became a member of the Government, that our efforts should be directed towards maintaining our exports and, at the same time, stopping our imports.  We have always felt that exports were necessary if we want to import anything.  I do not see how we can pay for our imports of certain things such as steel, rubber and tea, which we cannot produce here, if we do not export something.  We have said over and over again that we should be as self-supporting as possible and produce everything that we can here and that on the other hand we should increase our exports if possible. Circumstances have forced us to bring in some measure of this kind and we brought in this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to follow Senator Jameson's arguments a little further. <Col N="669" /> I think that Senator Jameson is under the impression that I am setting up only one consultative council under the Bill.  If we take the rather far-fetched example of whiskey, if some country were to quota our whiskey, say Great Britain, the first thing I would have to do would be to make an order that whiskey came under this Bill, and the next thing I would have to do would be to issue an order setting up a consultative council for whiskey.  Nobody would be a member of that consultative council except those who knew something about whiskey, not those who knew something about pigs.</P>

      <P>We all know a little about the trade of whiskey.  Senators have said here that the Minister does not know all about these things.  Of course, the Minister does not know all about all these things.  In fact the less one knows about some of these things the better, but the Minister has his advisers in the Department.  Furthermore he is going to set up an <i>ad hoc</i> consultative council on which there will be members having expert knowledge of the matter to be dealt with. He would have to set up a consultative council for Britain, another for France, and another for Germany in respect of each product.  He would have to set up a consultative council for each country.  These councils might consist of the same people in the case of particular products, but they would still be separate councils.</P>

      <P>I might give the example of pigs.  I am setting up one for bacon and another for live pigs, although the two appear very much alike.  Senator Jameson also said that the Minister may, in certain eventualities, buy against a shortage.  That may be, but there would be no question of leaving our home consumers short.  In this matter of pigs, it might be that our pigs could go across to England free of any quota for pork or that pork carcases could go across free of quota, and the Minister might say: &ldquo;I will buy a few hundred of these, which would otherwise go for pork in order to maintain the quota.&rdquo; There are certain cases, such as those, in which the powers might be used. Senator Counihan objects more or less to the Minister engaging in the trade but, as I have already explained, the Minister has no intention of doing so except where it is absolutely necessary to fill a quota.  I got the highest approval in the other House for going into business in this case, so that I have at least some backing behind me in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dillon spoke about the present export of pigs and bacon.  I have some figures here which go to show that although exports are down, production is not down.  For instance, taking the first five months of this year as compared with the same period last year, exports of bacon are down from 87,000 cwts. to 72,000 cwts.; exports of pork are down from 49,000 cwts. to 37,000 cwts., and live pigs, in <Col N="671" /> number, are down from 121,000 to 31,000.  Taking the conversion figure of so much bacon and so much pork to a pig usually taken in these statistics&mdash; so far as I remember, it is something like 1.05 cwts. to a pig&mdash;the figures would be 257,000 pigs exported in 1932 and 141,000 exported in 1933.  On the other hand, however, we had an import for this period of 1932 of 134,000 and, in 1933, only 1,000 so that, deducting imports from exports, our production would appear to be about 17,000 pigs higher in the first five months of this year than last year and the reports would go to show that we reached the lowest point in pig production about three or four months ago and that they are on the up-grade again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The quota will be based on these reduced exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not sure yet.  The British Government has not said on what figures they will base the quota&mdash; whether it will be on the figures for 1932 or 1931 or a period of three years &mdash;but, in any case, I think that whatever they may base the quota on, it would be high enough for us because our exports would naturally be lower as we are not importing any bacon at all.  Senator Dillon also raised the question of a levy on production in order to give a bounty on exports.  I have heard that referred to before, but the suggestion certainly did not emanate from either the Government or the Department.  All such suggestions as that would, of course, be considered by the Pig Industries Tribunal.  The suggestion was made, I believe, by some of the people in the trade and it is a suggestion that will be considered, I take it, by the Pig Industries Tribunal, but it would have nothing whatever to do with the present Bill.  Senator Dillon also said that the co-operative factory in Waterford had felt adversely the protection policy of the present Government.  I have a recollection of seeing the report and balance sheet of last year in the public Press and it said that they had done quite well and better than they had done in the previous year so that <Col N="672" /> the balance sheet did not show the adverse circumstances the Senator speaks of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but the factory has done better as a result of protection.  Senator Johnson was quite right in saying that this quota system was practically forced on Great Britain by the Dominions.  At several meetings at Ottawa, the question was discussed and Great Britain offered to put tariffs on meats, butter and several other things coming into Great Britain, but the Dominions of Australia and New Zealand in particular, and some of the others also, insisted that, unless this quota system was adopted, it would be no use to them, and Great Britain finally agreed to adopt the system, so that if any Senator thinks that the other Dominions are going to get off under this and that we are not, he is mistaken.  I gather that all the Dominions are being treated on the quota system just the same as Denmark or any other country.  They may, perhaps, get a little more favourable treatment with regard to getting the full quota at the start off and it remains to be seen whether we are going to get it or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, requires that every order made under that Act shall be confirmed by Act of the Oireachtas within eight months.  There were a number of orders made and the majority of them were from time to time repealed.  The principal order was the No. 1 Order, which was subsequently repealed by the No. 5 Order. The No. 5 Order removed a number of the duties imposed by the No. 1 Order, confirmed some of the other duties and made changes in respect of a further number of duties.  That order has now to be confirmed before 22nd August, 1933, because it was made on 23rd December, 1932.  The No. 11 Order was an order which was concerned with the repeal of duties only.  A number of the duties imposed by Emergency Order were confirmed in the Finance Act of this year and the No. 11 Order repealed these duties so that they would not be chargeable twice.  It is necessary, however, to confirm the No. 11 Order because we are advised that if the No. 5 Order were confirmed alone it might be deemed to be in force in the form in which it was originally passed and the amendments subsequently made by the No. 11 Order might not apply. That is why the two orders have to be confirmed by this Bill.  The No. 5 Order affected the duty on boots and shoes.  It reduced the maximum rate of duty and increased the preferential rate of duty so as to ensure that one rate of duty only would apply.  It effected the same change in respect of <Col N="675" /> men's and boy's suits, overcoats, hats and caps.  In that case, the preferential duty was increased to the full duty. It imposed a duty on apparel made wholly or mainly of fur and, in doing so, rectified a mistake in the Finance Act which was rectified permanently this year.</P>
      <P>In respect of motor cars, it reduced the full rate to the preferential rate so that only one rate would apply and it made a similar change in respect of fabricated steel and certain cast iron articles and confirmed the duty on coal and coke and on cement.  The duty on cement will, of course, be revoked when the Cement Bill becomes law as that Bill provides for the regulation of imports in an alternative manner.  It imposed a duty on apparatus operated by electricity imported to Great Britain and confirmed the duty on sugar and saccharine.  It repealed the duty on all articles of steel and iron which had been operative under the No. 1 Order and substituted instead a duty on certain enumerated articles &mdash;bars, rods, angles, nails, barbed wire and the like.  The No. 11 Order was, as I have said, concerned entirely with the repeal of duties imposed by the Finance Act of this year.  This Bill, therefore, does not involve any change in the existing duty on any article.  It merely preserves the present position.  The total revenue collected under Emergency Orders to date is £424,000.</P>

      <P>I see that in the Schedule there are mentioned two emergency impositions of duty&mdash;the No. 5 Order and the No. 11 Order.  I have not got the No. 11 Order here so I cannot talk about it, but I notice, at the head of page 15 of the No. 5 Order, a duty of 5/- per ton on coal.  In the last discussion, we have been talking of quotas and arrangements to deal with quotas enforced by Great Britain.  This duty of 5/- per ton is a direct challenge to the trader in Great Britain to keep out his coal and to introduce coal from other countries.  This duty of 5/- a ton imposes a very serious handicap on a great many of our industries. <Col N="676" /> The Minister may be able to show that it has some other bearing, but so far as I can learn the effect of it has been to drive Irish manufacturers off the use of English coal and on to German coal or other coal.  As long as we persist in that attitude what is the use of talking about such questions as quotas?  It is only a short time ago since we discussed a Bill brought in by the Minister for Agriculture dealing with a quota system for our agricultural exports.  If we persist in the policy which this Bill expresses then the British will put on quotas against us.  If we put on a tax of 5/- a ton on English coal and penalise our own manufacturers to that extent, can we expect the British to sit down and deal with us in a favourable way so far as their quota system for agricultural imports is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are supposed never to talk of the economic war.  The first item in this Bill is an act of economic war against what is a very friendly nation to us, one that will be greatly to the detriment of our citizens here who are using coal.  I do not propose to labour that point.  All that I do want to say is that if we persist in doing such things, then our quota Minister will have plenty of employment due to the action which the representatives of the British people will take to answer us.  The Minister for Agriculture told us to-day that he wants to be able to export our agricultural produce; that it was necessary for us to export if we wanted to live our economic life in any sort of a correct way.  What is the attitude of Great Britain going to be if we proceed to put 5/- a ton on the output of one of her biggest industries in which huge masses of her people are engaged?  As we know there have been great complaints in Parliament and outside of it in regard to this particular duty.  If the people on the other side continue to bring pressure of that kind to bear on their Government, how can we expect that Government to make reasonable arrangements with us about quotas? Surely it is foolish to try to fight people and at the same time expect them to be reasonable in such matters as quotas.  I hold that the first item <Col N="677" /> in this Bill is nothing but provocation and that it will result in damage to our people.  It will seriously handicap our Minister for Agriculture when he tries to get decent treatment for this country under the quota system.  Measures such as this will put him out of court altogether.  Our enemies on the other side will urge their Government not to give this country decent treatment under their quota system, they will use this Bill as an argument against that.  They will say that by this Act we are barring out of this country the products of one of their biggest industries. You will have every miner in Great Britain urging the Government not to give us a decent quota system.  Why we should do what is proposed under this Bill beats me altogether.  We talk here of the necessity of being able to export our agricultural produce, but we are not doing a single thing to make friends with the people on the other side.  On the contrary, this Government is doing everything it can to have quotas enforced against our people instead of doing everything it should do to get good treatment for our people under the quota system operated at the other side.  I consider that this Order dealing with the coal duty is of a most provocative and damaging nature so far as this country is concerned.</P>

      <P>It seems to me a most extraordinary thing that Senator Jameson should be always repeating in this House the tale of the wolf and the lamb.  He tells us how nice we ought to be so far as the British are concerned, but he does not take into consideration at all the fact that we made no attack on the British until they made an attack upon us.  They were the first to attack.  I happened to be at the other side at the time they brought in their Bill imposing special duties against this country.  These were declared to be special and antagonistic duties imposed against this country.  They have been exercising ever since the powers that they took under that Act.  What does Senator Jameson mean by saying that we should be so agreeable to them? Is that the way one fights a battle; <Col N="678" /> that immediately anybody slaps you in the face you bow down and say: &ldquo;I will be your obedient servant?&rdquo; Senator Jameson is a reasonable person and I am surprised that he should take up that attitude.  Does he mean that we should not retaliate when we are attacked?  He says that the English miners will demand that even stronger retaliatory measures will be enforced against us but the exact opposite is happening.  If the Senator read the debates in the British Parliament he would see that day after day the miners as well as the railway interests on the other side are pouring in complaints to the British Ministers responsible, asking, first of all, the Labour people, the Liberals and the Government itself to try and settle this question.</P>
      <P>We are perfectly ready to settle this question.  We have offered terms and done everything that we could to be agreeable to them so that matters might be settled easily.  We offered them arbitration but they refused it. Why did they refuse it?  I would like to see Senator Jameson going over and urging Mr. Thomas to accept the proposal with regard to an arbitration tribunal to settle this question.  Why does not the Senator do that instead of coming here with the tale of the wolf and the lamb, declaring that the poor lamb is attacking the wolf, the wolf being Britain, and the lamb, Ireland?  I wish the Senator would explain because it would be interesting to know what he wants.  There is not a person on any side of this House who would not be delighted to see the question settled by agreement between the two countries, but the Senator's attitude is &ldquo;we are to blame always, we are fighting these unfortunate English people who want to be friendly to us.&rdquo;  I wish the Senator would explain that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow Senator Colonel Moore in his analogy as to whether this country can be perfectly likened to the lamb.  I am a little bit doubtful about that.  I rather think, too, that the Senator's reading of Senator Jameson's views was not altogether correct.  Senator Colonel Moore's remarks were rather <Col N="679" /> typical of an attitude which personally I think is an absolutely wrong attitude. There is no use at any stage in a war, economic or any other kind, of wasting words as to who started it.  That is the commonest form of futility that any one could engage in.  It is natural, I suppose, to laud people in England who urge that steps should be taken to end this and to run down anyone on this side who suggests that steps should be taken to end it.  There is one thing that is more obvious now than ever before and that is that there is a very genuine desire on all sides of this House to see an end to this.  The speeches on the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill delivered from the other side of the House indicated that clearly.  During the course of the discussions on that Bill there was a good deal of reference to the economic war, and what I have said was certainly made clear on that Bill. Senator Moore knows very well that his suggestion that Senator Jameson should go over and see Mr. Thomas is simply all nonsense.  I do not think it is enough to sit down and say that we have made certain proposals: that we are watching every opportunity to try and find a way out of this; and that it is in our interest, as well as that of Great Britain, to see an end to this. For my part, I think something more than that is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill deals with certain Orders, mainly with coal, and to a certain extent with steel and electrical apparatus. It also deals with certain duties on motor cars that have been repealed.  Personally, I hope, in connection with specific duties which are part and parcel of the economic war, that we will not get into the habit of imposing ordinary duties by means of this particular Act.  That was more or less inevitable up to the present, but I think it would be much better if these duties were imposed by an ordinary Act in future.  That procedure, too, would make it much easier for the public to follow them. The duty on coal is the outstanding one.  It was put on as a retaliatory duty because of action taken by Great Britain.  If you get into an <Col N="680" /> economic war, then, undoubtedly both sides will attempt to take retaliatory measures, measures which will hit the other side as much as possible.  I am not satisfied that in choosing coal our Government showed a great lack of wisdom, but when they did choose coal I think it was their duty to take steps to see that, as far as was humanly possible, any action taken to hit Great Britain would not hit ourselves at the same time.  If you are in an economic war it is clearly your duty to help large firms at home which are carrying on an important export trade.  I am in a position to know that such firms have been definitely and seriously handicapped&mdash; many of them&mdash;by this duty on coal. I think the Government, when satisfied that foreign coal can only be got at a higher price, should refund to an exporting firm the difference between that price and the price at which they could get their coal from Great Britain.  If the coal required is of a kind which cannot be procured at a foreign port, then I think the British coal should be allowed in free to firms carrying on an export trade, because such firms are unable to pass on the duty of 5/- so far as their foreign trade is concerned.  Firms doing an internal trade can pass on the 5/-, and most of them are doing it, but the firms doing an export trade are unable to do that.</P>
    <P>One firm that is doing a big export trade, a firm of which I have intimate knowledge, uses about 6,000 tons of coal a year.  The duty amounts to £1,500.  There are very few firms that can afford to pay £1,500 in additional tax, particularly when they cannot get back any of it in view of the character of the trade they are doing.  They may get back a portion of it by having a different price for the Saorstát on such articles as are protected, but as a matter of fact this particular firm has not adopted that policy.  So far as its foreign trade is concerned it has to compete against Great Britain and Northern Ireland, whose manufacturers are able to get coal at the old rate. Without going into the general question of the economic war, I do urge on the Government that if they put on <Col N="681" /> a duty as a retaliatory duty they ought to take steps to see that it does not hit their own people, particularly those carrying on an important export trade. I think it was a mistake to put on this duty on coal, that it was done hastily and without the matter getting full consideration.  I am not satisfied that it has worked to our benefit at all. Personally, I think the disadvantages of it are greater than the advantages.  I am not competent to say what effect it is having in bringing England to her knees.  It may be nil, and I think it is. I do know definitely that it is hitting a number of people in industry here. I suggest to the Government that this coal duty requires further investigation: that it requires some adjustment and amendment so far as our own industries are concerned if it is likely to continue as a retaliatory duty for a considerable time.  I do not propose now to make any serious reference to the other duties except one, which is rather an important matter, but which is hardly strictly a criticism of the duty, because I am not able to suggest a remedy.  One of the duties was on certain articles of men's clothing which was increased to 60 per cent. and 40 per cent., I think.  In that case I came across reliable information that men's overcoats are being imported either from Russia or Poland to be sold to the retailer at a price of 9/9, 60 per cent. duty paid, a price at which it would be utterly impossible to produce them here and pay any wages at all.</P>
    <P>I also understand from the same source that men's trousers are coming in at a cost of 1/6, or 2/2 duty paid. They could not be produced at that price here.  Even 100 per cent. duty would not keep them out.  It is not a matter that can be dealt with by the ordinary method of tariff.  At the same time, if these articles continue to come in&mdash;they are not good articles, but they will serve their turn&mdash;the price is so extraordinarily attractive that the poorer people will inevitably buy them and it is bound to lessen the trade here.  I happen to know a number of retailers who, for the present, have refused to buy these articles, but I have no doubt that somebody will buy them and, therefore, everybody else <Col N="682" /> will be forced to do so also.  In that case, the importation might be very considerable and it might be a very serious matter for traders here.  No matter what you do under this particular order you could not remedy that, but it is a serious problem at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>With the principle stated by Senator Douglas I am in agreement.  If there are exporting firms in this country seriously handicapped by the emergency tariff on coal the case ought to be considered and I am sure there is nobody more keenly alive to that position than the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Senator Jameson has made a very remarkable speech.  In listening to that speech I remembered what he said three or four days ago referring to a loss of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 He said that the loss of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 that we were sustaining as a result of the economic war was more than this country could bear, and that in the end it would lead to exhaustion. I agree that a loss of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 will lead to exhaustion.  But the contribution of £5,000,000 per year which we were paying before this economic conflict started was leading to exhaustion and the events of the last 12 months convince me, at all events, that it was impossible for this country to pay the £5,000,000 per year which we had been paying&mdash;whether there was law for it or not, that it was impossible for this country to do it.  I do not blame Senator Jameson for giving us the rub, but I would urge a man of his influence, a man of his well-known ability, a man of his business reputation, that something might be said to those on the other side of the Irish Sea in reference to what is called the economic war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, as Senator Jameson said, in all essentials a war&mdash;a very bad war and a very destructive war for both countries. It is a war which has, I think, made the two countries, particularly Great Britain more than the Irish Free State, the laughing stock of the nations. What is the position in which we are at present?  Great Britain has, with us, two departments&mdash;a peace department <Col N="683" /> by which quotas are settled on an understanding of perfect peace, and a war department whereby retaliatory tariffs are put up against us and by us against Great Britain.  I do not like this tariff on coal.  I would not like to have it in the ordinary legislation of this country.  It is an emergency tariff and it was put on, I think, by our Government simply as a measure of protection against the special tariff that was put on Irish cattle.  You may say it is all wrong.  It is certainly very ridiculous that on the one side, in one department we are striking each other and defending ourselves against the other; and, in the other department, we are arranging in the most amicable fashion possible for quotas.  The thing is certainly ridiculous.  But I would advise Senator Jameson, with the influence which he possesses, to represent to the great State on the other side of the Irish Sea that for them it is much more ridiculous than it is for us; and that we certainly cannot afford the payment of £5,000,000 per year, or even one-half of £5,000,000 per year which has drained the resources of this country and exhausted this country. Having said so much, I think I would differ from Senator Douglas when he said that this tariff ought to be incorporated in the general law of this country.  I hope it will not be part of the general law of this country.</P>

In regard to these special duties, when they were first imposed I was strongly of opinion that they should be sanctioned by Parliament as early as possible.  I should like to have them in a separate category&mdash;in the category of retaliatory measures, just like the British special tariff against Irish cattle.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with my friend Senator Comyn <Col N="684" /> when he says that he does not like this tariff on coal.  Various other Senators also seem not to like it.  I must say that I for one cannot see anything terrible in this tariff on coal.  I do not want to follow the lead given by practically every speaker to-day in dragging in the economic war into the question.  Even if there was never an economic war, it would still be necessary to put a tariff on coal.  Senator Jameson said something to the effect that the only good it could do was to give employment to our quota Minister. I am sure our quota Minister&mdash;if the Minister of Industry and Commerce is meant&mdash;has plenty to do without that and so has every other Minister. I suggest to Senator Jameson, or any reasonable man, that there are several other people in the country who may be provided with employment as a result of the duty on coal.  We all know that we have considerable quantities of coal in this country at present which have to be worked up if we are going to do what any sensible people would do in this or any other country&mdash;utilise our own resources.  We have also a practically unlimited supply of turf at our disposal.  There are various reasons why we should protect those industries as well as we are protecting any other industry.  One thing which has pleased me in this debate was the admission of Senator Douglas that Senators on both sides of the House are anxious to have this economic war finished.  I think that it is a considerable change for the better. We on this side of the House have been referred to up to quite recently as the aggressors in this dispute.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> I would refer some of the Opposition Senators to a statement made by Senator Wilson last week.  He said he was talking to an old friend in the cattle market who came from one of the mining districts in England.  He said to Senator Wilson: &ldquo;Is it not too bad that this thing could not be settled?&rdquo;  Senator Wilson, of course, agreed with him that it would be a good thing if it could be settled, as any reasonable man would agree.  Then, according to Senator Wilson, this man said to him that in the mining district near his place there were thousands of men out of employment and that the people in his part of the country at least were more than anxious to have the matter settled.  That is the sort of story that would be inclined to do a little bit of good&mdash;stories like that which go to show that the people in England are suffering as a result of this fight which they started themselves. I am sure nobody in this House wants to see the workers of Great Britain and their families, or the workers of any other country, suffering, if it could be avoided.  It is rather satisfactory to see that the boomerang has fallen at the feet of the people who first threw it&mdash;the people of Great Britain.</P>

He could not be sitting so near Senator Wilson every day without taking a little of the virus that Senator Wilson has apparently taken about with him in recent weeks.  In any case, I cannot understand the attitude of people who try to prevent any defensive action, as I might term it, being taken by the Government of this country.  It is a well-known fact, as Senator Moore put it, that we have been slapped on the face, and no reasonable man could suggest that the Government, representing the people, should just turn the other cheek and ask them to slap it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it was inevitable that on the Second Reading <Col N="686" /> of a certified Money Bill Senators should express their views over a very wide area when dealing with this subject.  I had not intended to do so but some of the statements made it impossible for me to avoid doing so. I cannot understand the attitude of mind that contends there is nothing in the duty on coal.  Of course there is, if it hinders many Irish industries which cannot do without imported coal. What is the fact?  If these duties do great injury rather than good, in the way of employing Irish pitmen, the thing is wrong and as I and a great many other people firmly believe is a mistake.  These firms are told to use Irish coal.  I know something about the use of coal, having been employed for many years by one of the largest users of coal in this country.  It is impossible for a great many concerns to use Irish coal in their furnaces and locomotives whether stationary or otherwise, because they are not equipped for its use, and because Irish coal cannot do their work.  What is the good of making statements to the contrary?  We may do it eventually. We are talking about it long enough. We may make people convert the whole of their furnaces to use inefficient fuel, and thereby do themselves and a great many employees a great deal of harm, in order to benefit other people in an artificial way.  The less of this we have the less danger there is, and the less mess we will get into. Another statement made here was to the effect that hardly any Senator could deny that Great Britain started the economic war.  I deny it.  Let those who started it by refusing to pay this country's just debts take the blame for the mess we are in, and for everything else.</P>

      <P>I do not think any useful purpose will be served by discussing the origin of the dispute between ourselves and Great Britain.  Everybody will have their own view on that matter, and nothing that is likely to be said will alter that view.  However, the fact is that the dispute is there, and that, arising out of it, certain penal duties were imposed on Irish produce sent to Great Britain.  The Free State retaliated by imposing certain duties upon British goods consigned to this country.  The duty upon coal is one of the retaliatory duties.  We are not anxious to maintain that duty one moment longer than we consider it to be necessary.  We are willing to remove all the Emergency Duties to-morrow if Great Britain will do the same.  We might go further, and say that we will remove the duties if we get an indication that Great Britain proposed to do the same within a reasonable time afterwards.  It is quite obvious that any action to remove the barriers to trade between the two countries must be reciprocal. We cannot do it alone.  If the British Government considers it necessary to impose these restrictions upon our exports, we consider it necessary to maintain the restrictions upon British exports to this country.  But we are anxious to end that situation as quickly as possible and, if the British Government are willing to take the obvious step in the matter, we are willing to follow them.  We do not suggest that the British Government should fail to take any action it considers necessary for the protection of British industry and British agriculture.  It is, I think, in consequence of the policy of the British Government in that respect that the importation of agricultural produce into Great Britain is being, or will be, restricted by quota arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the fuel <Col N="688" /> resources of this country may necessitate a quota arrangement in respect to coal after the emergency duties have been removed.  The removal of the emergency duties may mark the end of the economic war, or a phase of it, but the desire of the Government on each side to protect industries will continue, and any action taken by either to that end is, of course, something about which the other cannot complain. The British Government are maintaining special duties on our agricultural produce in consequence of the dispute between us.  They are proposing to restrict, generally, imports of agricultural goods in consequence of their desire to encourage agricultural production there.  By the removal of the emergency duties it does not necessarily follow that the situation in respect to the quota arrangements will be modified.  Nevertheless, the removal of the emergency duties will do much to facilities trade between the two countries.  Similarly the removal of the emergency duties by us would encourage the purchase of British goods, where they have to be imported.  Any other action taken by us would be to protect our own industries and to secure the development of our own resources.  Amongst these I would mention the fuel resources.</P>
    <P>Whatever the origin of the duties I do not think the result has been wholly bad.  I refer particularly to coal. As Senators are aware, there was an arrangement in Great Britain by which the price of coal internally was artificially inflated, in order to make it possible to sell coal on the export market at lower prices.  For the purpose of that arrangement we were regarded as a &ldquo;home county,&rdquo; and we had to pay a higher price, even though we got none of the benefit of the arrangement in the form of employment. The imposition of these duties has at least terminated that system.  I do not think it is correct to assume that these duties are being paid by industrialists and consumers here, entirely.  In many parts of the country the duties have not been paid at all by our citizens.  They <Col N="689" /> are being paid by the exporters, and have been met by a reduction in the price of coal, or in the freight for transhipment of coal here.  That is not true, to the same extent, in other parts of the country.  On the whole, I think it can be stated coal is cheaper here at present than before the duties were imposed.  We have got coal resources which we are anxious to develop.  I disagree with Senator Bagwell when he says that it is impossible to use Irish coal for industrial concerns.  The quantity of Irish coal now being produced is, of course, totally inadequate for our requirements, but industrial concerns that have used it have, I think, considerably reduced their manufacturing costs, in consequence, and have given public testimony of that fact.  The coal resources of this country can be developed to a much greater extent than at present, and action to that end will, I expect, be taken, and arising out of that action some artificial restriction on the importation of coal may be necessary.  Of course, in that eventuality we would be fully prepared to consider giving preference to those countries which are prepared to give similar preference to Irish exports.</P>
    <P>It will, perhaps, be interesting to Senators, who are not aware of it, that the net result of these emergency duties has not deprived us of our position of being Britain's best customer in Europe, and, except for India, Britain's best customer in the world. The figures for the first four months of this year, during which the duties were in full operation, show that we have retained our position by a long margin in that respect.  We are still buying more British goods than any country in Europe, than any member of the British Commonwealth, and than any country in the world, except India.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas referred to the handicap which the emergency duties on coal imposed on certain industries with an export trade.  In certain industrial groups, where it was shown that the importation of British coal was necessary for efficient production, a licence for the importation of coal has been given either in respect of all <Col N="690" /> the requirements concerned, or in respect of that portion of their requirements which had some relation to the total as their export trade had to their total production.  It may be that in certain industrial groups a similar concession has not been given.  I am fully prepared to consider any representations made in that regard.  We would not be prepared to give that concession to firms doing an entirely internal trade except under very exceptional circumstances. We are not desirous of imposing any new difficulties in the way of those who are maintaining an export trade in industrial products.</P>
    <P>The Senator also made reference to the importation of overcoats and men's trousers from Poland or Russia at a remarkably low price.  Certain representations have been made concerning these cases and I am having them examined.  It may be that one consignment of these goods has arrived.  It is not, of course, unusual that a sale of a bankrupt's stock or something of that kind might produce temporary importations, at a very low price of goods subject to duty.  If, however, the evidence is that these goods are being sold at low prices, as part of the industrial policy of the countries concerned, and that importations are likely to continue, then we will not hesitate to stop these importations entirely.  I think traders who might be tempted to purchase these goods, because of the low prices at which they are offered, should bear in mind the fact that the Government has got power to impose duties by Emergency Order, and will not hesitate to use it if the industrial life of the country appears to be threatened by these uneconomic imports.  I agree that the use of the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act for the purpose of promoting Governmental protective policy is not desirable.  At the same time, in view of the rather abnormal trade conditions now existing throughout the world, it is necessary for the Government here to have what Governments in most other countries enjoy, and that is the power to act speedily in the matter of imposing emergency duties to restrict imports, subject, of course, to the early ratification of their action by the Legislature.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> I do not think that we can contemplate depriving ourselves entirely of the power to take speedy action, even if the immediate cause for the enactment of this Emergency Imposition of Duties Act were removed.  Only quite recently we had occasion to use these powers for purely protective purposes when the ordinary power of imposing duties might not have been effective. Our proximity to Great Britain, and the fact that we ordinarily speak the same language as Great Britain, usually result in the diversion to the market here of any goods which are excluded from the British market by duties imposed by the British Government. In this year the British Government imposed certain duties on different classes of goods, and that resulted in the diversion of the goods prepared for the British markets and labelled or packed in containers printed in the English language, to this country.  The size of our market is such that one decent ship-load of a particular article might easily flood the market here for years, and consequently it is necessary that we should have power to move quickly as soon as we realise the danger that threatens our industrial stability.  However, these are questions that we might more conveniently discuss on another occasion.</P>
    <P>The immediate purpose of the Bill is to confirm the duties imposed by Order No. 5.  For Senator Jameson's information I might explain that Order No. 11 was confined to the repeal of duties.  It is necessary, however, to confirm that, because these duties were included in the original Order No. 5, although it was subsequently varied by Order No. 11.  It does not alter the situation.  That can only be altered by the return to sanity of certain members of the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill will not cause any difficulty.  The Finance Act <Col N="692" /> of 1921 gave the Revenue Commissioners power to exempt from income tax certain superannuation funds. That Act operated in Great Britain, as well as here, as it was passed before the establishment of the Free State. The British Revenue Commissioners were proceeding to give effect to it when they found that the trusts of certain funds appeared to be contrary to the rule of law against perpetuities. It is a rule of law that no property can be disposed of or transferred in such a manner as to delay the period in which it would pass into the hands of an absolute owner, by more than a life or lives and 21 years afterwards. The principle is that it is desirable that the period during which the property would be in the possession of a limited owner, such as a tenant for life, should be as restricted as possible. Certain of these trusts were perpetual trusts and consequently appeared to be invalidated by this rule of law against perpetuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A British Treasury Commission was established to examine into the matter and on its report the British Government introduced an Act for the registration of these funds, a proposal almost similar to the Bill now before the Seanad.  The Revenue Commissioners were, of course, unable to give the income tax concession to these funds because of the fact that they had been invalidated by this rule of law.  There was a test case in Great Britain and it confirmed the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, that these funds had been invalidated by the rule of law.  They are mostly funds established by industrial concerns out of which superannuation allowances are paid to their employees when they retire.  It is necessary that we should validate these funds here.  We propose to do that by the enactment of this measure which declares that these funds shall not be invalidated by this rule of law. The Bill provides for the setting up of a register of the funds under the control of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  If the funds conform with the conditions set out in Section 2 and if the rules conform with the conditions set out in the Schedule, <Col N="693" /> then the funds are registered by the Registrar and consequently become perfectly legal, and entitled to the income tax concession.  These are the important points that arise.  We have deliberately kept the Bill in very close accord with the corresponding legislation in Great Britain, because a number of the funds are associated with concerns that operate both inside and outside the Saorstát, and it is desirable that there should not be any considerable difference in the law in both countries affecting these funds.</P>

      <P>The Trustees of the Clare Castle Pier became an illegal organisation because they allowed their membership to fall below that which constituted a quorum and they then proceeded to fill up the membership by co-option.  The fact that the number of members present when the co-options were made were less than the quorum invalidated the co-options. It has been found impossible to make the body a legal organisation except by the introduction of a Bill.  This Bill is for the purpose of setting up the Trustees as a legal organisation. The names of the Trustees are set out in the Schedule.  Most of them are existing Trustees and the others are persons whom we persuaded to act in that capacity after considerable difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators are no doubt aware of the circumstances under which the Cork tramways ceased to be operated.  The tramways were owned by the same company that was responsible for the supply of electricity to the City of Cork.  The electricity undertaking was acquired by the Electricity Supply Board, but the tramway company was not.  The Cork company was under an obligation to maintain the tramways only so long as it had the business of selling electricity. Consequently, when the electricity undertaking was transferred to the Electricity Supply Board, the company proposed to terminate the tramway. For a period the tram services were taken over by the Irish Omnibus Company, but they were afterwards closed down.  At the present time there are no trams in Cork, the local transport arrangements being in the hands of the Irish Omnibus Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of persons employed by the tramway company lost their employment, and they were not entitled under the terms of the Electricity Supply Act to compensation such as the employees of the electricity undertaking were.  Representations were made to our predecessors that these people should be given compensation of some kind, and when this Government came into office these representations were repeated.  I went into the matter in considerable detail, because I was not at all anxious to establish the precedent that persons who lost their employment as an indirect consequence of the setting up of a national undertaking, were entitled to compensation. I examined it for the purpose of seeing whether there were any special circumstances which would justify unusual action in this case.  I found there were such unusual circumstances in that persons employed on the tramways for any length of time became thoroughly unfitted for any other class of work.  The work was of <Col N="695" /> such a nature that those who undertook it became incapable of any other work for a considerable time afterwards.</P>
    <P>I found on inquiry in Cork that those who had been employed on the trams and who had not succeeded in getting employment on the buses, were still in the main unemployed and were not regarded favourably by Cork employers as workmen.  Consequently, they might remain unemployed for some considerable time.  I felt then that these circumstances justified us taking special action in this case.  There was also the fact of the close association between the tramway company and the business of supplying electricity in Cork.  It might be argued that the loss of employment was therefore a direct consequence of the inauguration of a national electricity scheme.  Legally it was not so, but morally it might be so held.  Certainly it was a case which, because of the close connection between the two undertakings, justified special action.  We examined the proposals made to us which involved the provision of pensions which it was suggested should be charged in part against the rates in Cork and in part against the consumers of electricity. We found however, that the charge was likely to be so heavy that it could not be realised, certainly in the case of the electricity consumers&mdash;in other words that the increase in rates which would be necessary in order to bring in the money would be so great that the consumption of electricity would fall considerably, so that we would have no chance of getting the money in that way.  We then considered the possibility of compensation by other means and finally we reached this arrangement; to pay to each of the employees the equivalent of one month's salary for each year of service with the company, the total capital sum to be advanced by the State and to be repaid to the extent of one half by the Cork Corporation and one half by the Electricity Supply Board out of its general revenue.  The Cork Corporation unanimously agreed to the striking of the rate and the position is now that only the enactment of this legislation <Col N="696" /> is required to enable the men to get compensation.  There is to be set up under the Bill an advisory committee which will examine the applications for compensation.  I do not imagine that their task will be very difficult but it is of course possible that there might be bogus applications even from Cork. It is the duty of the committee to insure that a list of <i>bona fide</i> applicants will be prepared, and the amount of compensation determined in each case. As soon as that is done payment will be made.</P>

Most of them were for 30 years associated with the service in Cork and I think it would be very wrong, if after that period, because of a change in the fortunes of the tramway company, they would be thrown on the scrap heap.  I do not want to delay the House but I think that if the E.S.B. had not come along, the Cork Electric Lighting Company, if they wanted to make their concern pay, would have had to maintain the Cork tramways.  I think also that the Government were very wise indeed, and, shall I say, generous, in doing what they could to facilitate a settlement with these men who certainly were most deserving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really a very minor Bill, although it looks somewhat imposing.  Its main purpose is to rectify what was quite clearly a mistake in the Shannon Electricity Act, 1925.  That Act gave the Minister for Industry and Commerce very wide powers for the acquisition of land and premises, fishing rights, water rights, way-leaves, easements, etc., and also empowered him to restrict or interfere with any easement, way-leave, water right, fishing right or other right or with any public or private roadway, bridge, canal, artificial waterway or artificial water-course.  Reading <Col N="698" /> the Bill, one would think that the Minister was fully empowered to do everything, but he was not empowered to interfere with lands or premises.  It was quite clearly an oversight, but he did, in fact, interfere with them as if he had the power to do so and, presumably, under the impression that he had power, and it was only when the task fell to me of paying compensation for that interference that it was discovered that, in fact, there was no power to do this and, consequently, no power to pay compensation.  The amendments now proposed in this Bill will permit of the payment of compensation to persons whose lands and premises were interfered with.  The interference took place a long time ago, and it was all in connection with the construction of the scheme and not with the operation of the scheme.  The persons affected have been waiting for their money for a considerable time, and I am anxious that they should be paid as rapidly as possible and, consequently, this defect in the Bill should be rectified.</P>
