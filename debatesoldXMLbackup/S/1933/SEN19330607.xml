      <P>Before this Bill passes, I should like to voice one final word of what might appear to be futile protest against certain provisions in it.  I intend myself, from the point of view of record, to vote against the measure.  The proposals I referred to are those connected with the capital reconstruction which are so manifestly unjust that I do not think they ought to be passed by the House without protest.  As I understand those provisions, the effect is definitely to limit the earning power or to limit the surplus revenue of the company to a sufficient quantity to pay a reasonable return on that reduced capital so that, whatever may happen in the future, however much conditions may improve and the monopoly of transport improve the earning power of the company, no increased benefit on those earnings may come to the present shareholders, and the effect, furthermore, will be that, if fresh capital is required for the purpose of development and can be obtained, as, presumably, it can, if things improve, it will earn reward on the full amount subscribed, whereas the old shareholders who have built up the undertaking and borne the burden and heat of the day will be pegged down to these monstrously low reconstructed values.  It is because the thing is so unjust and pays so scant regard to the rights of property and is, in fact, virtually confiscation that I propose to vote against it.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to say anything in connection with this Bill but, as Sir John Keane has opened the discussion, there are some points, however unpleasant they are, I must refer to.  This Bill gives the railway a practical monopoly of the carrying of the country.  It is the only possible chance that we have seen of giving the railway an opportunity of rehabilitating itself, but it will not do so if it is managed as it has been managed in the past and if regard, in the matter of promotions, is going to be had more to the social and the religious views of a person rather than his proficiency and competency for the position offered.  Nobody in this country can reasonably object to any man getting a position, no matter what his religion is, but he should not get a position, as he used to in the past, because of his religion.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to another matter equally unpleasant.  A railway strike took place recently on the Great Northern Railway.  Everybody who knew anything about it knew that, from the word &ldquo;go,&rdquo; that strike was doomed to failure.  It did fail after some very wrong things had been done&mdash;I am not going to say they were done by advice&mdash;but, when that strike was practically finished, an unauthorised strike broke out on a small section of the Great Southern Railways.  It inflicted considerable hardship, inconvenience and expense on a number of people and it had no justification whatever.  I would not refer to it but, recently, a so-called labour leader, who must know how hopeless these attempted strikes were, sent around a message to railwaymen: &ldquo;Be ready.&rdquo;  If the public are to be held to ransom by irresponsibles of that type, who know that, if railwaymen went out on strike, in all probability, a considerable number of them would never get back, the authority that gives a monopoly to the railway will have to reconsider its position and consider the public, and give the traffic the alternative transport facilities the chance that is being taken from them by this measure.</P>

      <P>Probably I also would not have said anything but for <Col N="1671" /> this matter being raised.  I agree with what Senator Dowdall has said that, unless the railways are managed differently in the future, they will not pay.  I will give an example of what I refer to.  About a fortnight ago, a ship came into Galway Bay from New York.  It had had a beautiful passage, with perfect weather, but it was 12 hours late.  It was scheduled to get into Galway on Saturday, early in the morning, but, as a matter of fact, it arrived at 12 o'clock at night.  There was no fault on the part of the Irish officials; my information is that everything that could be done was done by them.  The tender went out when the ship came in and occupied an hour transferring baggage, which was reasonable enough.  Some 200 passengers, who intended to land in Galway, were put into the tender. They remained for four or five hours in Galway Bay unable to land because the tide was out.  Everybody must have known perfectly well that the tide was out and they should have been kept on the ship until the tide came in or something else should have been done.  They were tossing about Galway Bay for some four hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot give the exact time they were kept in the tender, but they eventually did get to land in Galway and found that there were no trains because it was Sunday, and I am told, but I am not quite so sure about it, that there were no buses.  At any rate, there were no trains, and some 200 people were left wandering about, not knowing where to go or what to do or where to get food. One and all, they said that they would never travel by the Galway route again.  Surely some arrangement could have been made by the railway company, at all events&mdash;they were to blame in this case&mdash;to have a train ready to take these people up.  They must have known about it and, meanwhile, the ship people ought to have known that it was not right to put a number of people into a tender at midnight and leave them in the Bay for a number of hours.  The Irish officials did their business quite all <Col N="1672" /> right and helped as far as they could, but what could they do?  That is all I will say about the management. There are more instances of extraordinary behaviour on their part, but I do not propose to refer to them now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to what extent the railway company are responsible for the fact that the tide was out when a certain boat landed in Galway.  There is an old saying, that &ldquo;Time and tide wait for no man.&rdquo;  Even a railway company cannot overcome a difficulty of that kind.  I fancy if there was any delay in that respect, the main portion must have rested upon the shipping agency, in the first place, for putting people on a tender and leaving them tossing about in the Bay; and secondly, probably for not having informed the railway company that passengers were likely to offer, when, probably, if they did not put on trains, they would put on buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators have referred to an official stoppage of a minor extent that occurred on the Great Southern Railways, and to the issue of a &ldquo;Be ready&rdquo; circular.  I do not know what the reference was, or who the labour leader was, but it should be sufficient for the Seanad to know what the official attitude is with regard to it.  No one can control unofficial action, either in a trade union or in a political party, except to a limited extent, but one can quite understand the impatience and the resentment of the men, when, in addition to many previous reductions, they have to submit now to an additional 10 per cent.  from what are very meagre earnings, when one considers the amount of talk and noise that has taken place on the part of debenture holders who, for the first time, are asked to submit to a reduction of 15 per cent.  It is all very well for Senator Sir John Keane, Senator Jameson and others to talk of principles which are sacred and inviolable, but principles which have no relation <Col N="1673" /> to the effects on life are not worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>It reminds one of the story of a man after being married, to whom his wife said as they were leaving the church: &ldquo;Now, John, on principle you and I are one but, as an essential proposition, I suggest that you order dinner for two.&rdquo;  The same applies to the question of debentures.  There are certain hard facts which cut across this principle, and we have to recognise them.  An attempt is being made here to preserve the railways so that they can pay debenture holders their interest, or portion of it.  A reduction of 15 per cent. has been effected, so that the remaining 85 per cent can be paid.  All other types of shareholders have had to make colossal sacrifices, from the point of view of cutting down capital, and workers have had to give up a very considerable portion of their earnings.  In fact, from the peak period, they have given, in some cases, over one-third of what they were earning.  All this has been done, not because it was considered they were too highly paid, but because the facts of the situation demanded that reductions should be made, in order that the railways could continue to exist.  It is a rather deplorable condition to find this cry, this whine about these sacrifices or so called sacrifices on the part of debenture holders.  One would imagine that capital was the one thing that could not be tampered with.  The late William Jennings Bryan of America in a presidential address asked: &ldquo;Must humanity be sacrificed on the cross of gold?&rdquo;  It would look, as far as the Great Southern Railways was concerned, that the workers must be sacrificed and bled white in order that the debenture holders may get their 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>No one wants to do anything calculated to damage the credit of the country under the existing system, but it is too far-fetched to suggest that, in the present exceptional circumstances of the railways, and in a supreme effort to try to save them, when interest has been reduced by such a small amount, the credit of the nation is going to be irretrievably <Col N="1674" /> ruined.  This Bill is entirely without prejudice to anything that may happen.  I cannot imagine it being taken as a precedent at all.  In the long run the debenture holders&mdash;when it would be too late&mdash;would have to agree to a far bigger writing down than has been the case.  As a result of the prosperity which we hope will come to the railways following this measure, they will gain more in the actual market price of their stocks than they are going to lose as a result of the nominal writing down.  While saying that in regard to the effects of the Bill, I am not very optimistic regarding the immediate recovery of railway prosperity.  The Bill has certain limitations which, I think are going to retard that recovery considerably. We must look for the recovery of general prosperity before we can hope for prosperity for transport.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out by previous speakers, there will have to be greater attention on the part of the management controlling the destinies of the railway system if we are to have a recovery of prosperity. The practice of selecting people merely because of the extent of their holdings in any industry, or the amount of influence and voting power they can command, as the management of a complicated system like that of rail and road transport, is fatal.  Until it is drastically altered&mdash;and it is not altered in this Bill&mdash;and until control is given into the hands of people who know the industry, we cannot look for anything in the nature of permanent prosperity.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the reply given me last week by the Minister, I wish to say that the property of the debenture holders has been confiscated, contrary to their wishes.  The Minister said they were agreed, to some extent, at any rate. That is not true.  A meeting was held in Dublin at which all the debenture holders who could be got together were present.  They were unanimously opposed to that part of the Bill which dealt with their property.  Everybody knows that a number of these <Col N="1675" /> debenture holders are not people who could be brought together.  A number of them are trustees and nuns in convents, and people who could not attend such a meeting.  So far as I have been able to find out, the debenture holders are unanimously against this proposal.  Notwithstanding all that Senator O'Farrell said, I regret that this House did not make at least a formal protest against this confiscation no matter how it is sugar-coated in the Bill.  We are told that the action now taken will not affect future legislation, but we are promised a Bill for the wholesale confiscation of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>The tide is always in in Cobh.  With regard to this Railways Bill, I think that it is only right to congratulate the Minister on this&mdash;that, on the Fifth Stage of the measure, nobody, apparently, has any question to raise on what we all know is a very delicate and thorny subject&mdash;the railway problem&mdash;except in regard to the question of capital. There was a gentleman in Cork some years ago, Mr. Foley who took up the packet office boats when they were <Col N="1676" /> in a worse condition than the railway is to-day.  That was, perhaps, as hopeless a proposition as anybody ever tackled.  Yet, he was able to make that one of the most prosperous steamship companies in any part of the two islands.  That gentleman writes to me to-day to point out that there is no reason why the railways should not recover in the same way as this cross-Channel line did; it will take a little time, perhaps, and it will take a great deal of hard work, but there is no reason why these railways should not be once again as successful as they were in the past.  I cannot understand why this question of capital should be inextricably mixed up with the success of this measure.  He suggets that the capital clauses in this measure should be treated separately, that they should be examined by experts and that, if necessary, a course should be adopted which, I am afraid, a lot of us feel should not be adopted&mdash;that is, confiscate, if you like, the property of the shareholders that, at the moment, has no value.  I think that it would be very wise for the Minister to withhold, if possible, that portion of the measure which deals with the reorganisation of capital until the matter is more minutely examined and, perhaps, more equitably dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to support the motion, as I supported the Bill in all its stages, but I must say that I am not very happy as regards many of the provisions of the Bill.  I am sure that they will lead to loss, inconvenience and expense on the part of the farming community and those interested in live stock.  The railway company are to have a monopoly.  We are giving them that monopoly so that they may be able to rehabilitate themselves.  If they use that monopoly in any harsh or improper manner, I should like to warn them that the powers that gave them that monopoly can take it from them.</P>

      <P>Senator Crosbie should remember that this House passed an amendment doing exactly with this Bill what his friend suggests <Col N="1677" /> should be done.  The amendment we passed a couple of weeks ago took out of the Bill the proposals as regards capital reconstruction and left the Bill to be judged on its merits outside these considerations. In its wisdom, the Seanad in the following week reversed that decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Farrell has dealt with this measure largely from the point of view of labour.  Years ago, when he and I used to meet on the Seanad at first, he used to impute motives to me which he does not impute now and, I dare say, I imputed to him motives which I do not impute to him to-day.  If Senator O'Farrell thinks that the classes engaged in industry, the classes who have capital employed in industry do not recognise to the full the position of labour in the present state of affairs in this country, he is greatly mistaken.  None of us raised the slightest objection to the State providing the money which prevented a strike on the Great Southern Railways.  All of us, looking at the conditions of the country, believed that that was a wise proceeding on the part of the present Government. We believed that if a strike took place on the Great Southern Railways, as it had on the Great Northern Railway, the railway industry of this State would have been practically wrecked and might never recover.  We knew that the people who would suffer in that case would be the labouring classes.  The Senator knows that if any mighty catastrophe had happened to the railways, it is labour of every quality that would suffer.  If the Senator thinks that those who are talking about the interests of the debenture holders have no thought for the men who would be thrown out of employment if the railways ceased to operate, he is quite wrong.  I do not suppose he thinks that at all.  Nobody knows better than the employer that this is a marriage party, if you like. We are tied up together.  We cannot get on without labour and they cannot <Col N="1678" /> get on without us.  One of the reasons we are speaking so much about these debenture holders is that labour cannot get on unless there is capital to pay for its employment.  The railway company would never have been established if its promoters had not been able to get some millions of money by way of debentures.  That was a cheap method of getting money and it had this great qualification, that the railway company could never be called upon to pay the money back.  That has been mentioned by the Minister as one of the disqualifications of the debenture holders.  It was a Godsend to the railway company, and it was the result of mutual agreement between the debenture holders and the company.  The debenture holders could not call for their money but, if their interest was not paid, they could put in a receiver.  These rights are now ignored in this Bill.  The amount of that capital, which was a debt due by the company and did not represent shares in the company, is being arbitrarily written down by order of the Oireachtas.  The unjust steward in the parable called his master's debtors and told them to write down 100 measures of wheat to 20 and, in another case to 80.  Most debenture holders wonder why the Minister stops at 15.  The human mind is an extraordinary thing.  Why should the Minister have made up his mind that it was quite honest to cut down debenture stock by 15 per cent. and the interest from 4 per cent. to £3 8/-?  He might have followed the unjust steward.  He might just as well have gone to 25 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator realise that it was the actuary appointed by the Company who suggested that cutting down and not the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>You are touching a very difficult matter which I should rather you had left out.  What the Board did and what representations they made to the Minister are doubtful matters to which I do not like to refer.  I shall only refer to one remark made by a Senator after the division last week.  He said he <Col N="1679" /> asked the solicitor of the company whether the Board were interested in this matter and whether it was in the interests of the company that my amendment should be carried.  He was told that the Board of the company did not represent the debenture holders, and that, practically speaking, they were not interested.  I am trying to quote the Senator who said that, and as far as I can make out there has been no contradiction of it. It may be taken for granted in this House that the railway company did not leave the Minister under the belief that they would actively oppose the cutting down of the capital of the debentures.  That is a very serious thing, probably one of the most serious things connected with the whole matter, because if the directors of a big company do not think that its creditors are part of the interest, which they as a Board should look after, we are coming to an extremely perilous state of affairs.  What I really tried to tell the House was that what we have been fighting for is the rights of the debenture holders. In a Bill like this, where the Oireachtas steps in, and without the consent of the creditors of the company arbitrarily takes away a certain amount of the money which they had a right to claim, you are establishing a precedent which will make it practically impossible for any company to raise money on debentures. This should be remembered, especially in connection with public utility companies. The moment public utility companies, although privately owned, can go to the Oireachtas, and get its debenture debt reduced, following the example of this Bill, there is a big principle involved and that is one reason why we are fighting this point. It is just as important to the Labour Party, because if capital cannot be got for public utilities and for new industries&mdash;which is a cheap method of getting capital&mdash;you are going to stop money coming to the Free State, almost for a certainty.  That is the cheapest and the safest way in which money can be advanced.  In a matter like this Labour should be helping, <Col N="1680" /> and not opposing us.  It is as vital for them as it is for us that capital should come to this country.  We know what the present Government is doing in trying to establish industries, and we know from past experience that it is nearly impossible to get Irishmen to put their money into Irish industries.  We had evidence again and again at the Currency Commission that it was nearly impossible to get Irishmen to put money into Irish ventures.  This measure is nailing down the lid on the coffin.  These are the principles for which we are fighting here, and the Government could have dealt with the situation perfectly easy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going into the question that Senator Miss Browne dealt with. I was sorry to hear it said that what was put before the House regarding debentures had been settled.  The Minister has minimised all through the position of the debenture holders. He minimised the size of the meeting they held.  If you can have trustee stock of this nature, representing holders of 2¼ millions of capital, which sent a deputation to him, I think the Minister knows probably by this time&mdash;after receiving Mr. Maxwell's letter&mdash;that they would neither suggest nor have anything to do with the the reduction of the capital of the debenture stock.  Such proposals were never put forward.  Senator O'Farrell said that the debenture holders were never asked to do so.  I have heard the Senator and other Senators on the Opposite benches talking about asking the debenture holders to agree to such proposals.  It is like meeting a man with a big club going down a lane at night.  The way the Oireachtas is dealing with debenture holders is as if they had not clubs. They are taking it by <i>jorce majeure.</i> Again, that is another extremely bad precedent to set up.  The Seanad decided by two votes not to do what Senator Crosbie's correspondent suggested, to leave over for further consideration the question of the capital. I did not think any good would have been done in leaving over the ordinary shares.  I am not adverse to backing the Minister in that part of the Bill. <Col N="1681" /> The Minister dealt with a matter about which there was no question, stocks on which dividends were being earned.  He took them out.  The one blot in the Bill has been that dealing with debenture holders.  The Minister has ignored the importance of these in this Bill.  Unfortunately, before the advice was taken, he stated that a deputation which had discussed the matter with him gave away rather on the question of the amount of the capital.  No one was here to contradict that.  I have reason to know that Senators when voting were influenced by that statement which, coupled with the representation of an official of the company, that the Board was not interested is, to my mind, the main reason why the Seanad in one week reversed by two votes a decision that they had previously given by a considerable majority.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I wish to refer to on this stage of the Bill.  That is the position of trustees. I looked up what the Minister said in answer to an opinion that I read out about the trustee nature of the stocks as to what protection trustees who were going to buy stocks in the railway during the next two or three years would get.  Senator Comyn thought I referred to holders of these stocks.  He knows quite well that as long as the stocks were bought before these revelations there is no necessity for trustees to sell out.  They are not under any legal liability.  In this Bill there is a clause from which, on reading it one would think there was security if stocks were bought, and if there was a fall in value, of which the beneficiaries might complain, or eventually take action on.  What the Minister stated was: &ldquo;It was thought undesirable that the trustee status of the company should be imperilled during that period.  The section gave the trustees the necessary protection for the time named in the Bill.&rdquo;  I doubt if there is a single stockbroker in the Stock Exchange who would endorse that statement.  Every dealer knows that if trustees chose to buy stock that they know &ldquo;has been blown&rdquo; they take the risk.  No clause in the Bill would protect trustees <Col N="1682" /> from action being taken by beneficiaries for investing in stock which they ought not to have bought.  The opinion I mentioned to the Minister was given in the interests of everyone. It was not a controversial matter.  If there is a clause in the Bill which leads future trustees to think that they are perfectly safe to act in that way, and if they afterwards find out that they have not been safe, but have been misled, and accordingly lose their money, I think that is a very dangerous clause to come into the Bill. The Minister did not say anything about it here.  I do not expect him to say anything now.  If there is any weight in the opinion of two of the best lawyers, I say we should consider it, and when the Bill goes back to the Dáil the Minister would be well advised to alter that clause and not to have people believe that in a Bill of this kind they have security when, as a matter of fact, they have not got it.</P>

      <P>May I ask Senator Jameson a question?  Does the Senator believe that the railway company, without interference, could go on earning sufficient to pay interest to the debenture holders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>All that I can say in reply to the Senator's question is, that I do not think the House has a bit of evidence to show that it can, though there are people who believe that it can, and also think, what we all hope is true, that the company in the future is going to be greatly benefited by this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pretty well satisfied that without this legislation the company could not go on.  The point I want to make is that listening to some of the speeches made one would imagine we were living in the moon. Some people seem to be thinking all the time of the debenture holders. There is no notice whatever taken by some of the sacrifices that railway employees have been called upon to make.  All that some people think about is the earning of dividends for the debenture and other shareholders. The earning of these dividends must <Col N="1683" /> be maintained although the employees starve.  Senator Jameson gave what, I think, was a very selfish example. He referred to the unofficial strike on the Great Southern Railways.  He congratulated the Government on their intervention and on paying money to prevent the thing going on.  He had no objection whatever to the money coming out of the pockets of the general community to safeguard the interests of railway shareholders. He thought it was a noble thing for the Government to come to the rescue of these shareholders.</P>
      <P>If the passing of this legislation means, as I am told it does, a saving of upwards of £50,000, then that sum so saved will be available for distribution in other directions.  The Government is giving a monopoly to the railway company under this Bill. That will give the company an opportunity of developing their business.  I do not profess to know very much about finance or the ramifications of what is called capital.  I know enough, however, to understand that when a firm or an industry becomes bankrupt the creditors are called in, and of the available assets a division is made. Sometimes the arrangement represents a payment of 5/- in the £, and sometimes only half a crown.  At any rate, there is an arrangement come to to divide up whatever assets are available. The railway company had almost arrived at the point of being bankrupt.  The arrangement made in its case under this legislation is certainly a very much better one than the creditors of an ordinary commercial concern, for instance, would get.  In addition, the company is getting a very valuable monopoly to carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator O'Farrell pointed out, the railway employees to the extent of thirty-five per cent. have had to make sacrifices.  Railway workers to-day are earning less than £2 a week.  Great numbers of people entered the service of the railway company in their youth. They believed that they were entering <Col N="1684" /> not only lifetime, but pensionable, employment.  Many of these have been thrown out on these streets.  We have heard no protest from Senator Jameson or Senator Sir John Keane against that.  Now when an attempt is made to re-establish the railways on sound business lines all that some Senators are concerned about is the dividend-paying end.  They do not trouble at all about the workers who have had to suffer.  I think the Government are to be congratulated on taking this step to safeguard the future of the railways and, let us hope too, to ensure a decent standard of living for those employed on the railways.</P>

      <P>Senator Jameson has upheld the cause of debenture holders with a degree of perseverance that has surprised me.  He threatens the most serious consequences to this country as a result of writing up to £85 debenture stock that now stands in the open market at £37.  Senator Foran asked a very impertinent question.  It was this: if the Government had not intervened at this stage to give the railway companies a virtual monopoly what would be the value of the debenture stock?  Would it be £85, would it be even £37, would it be saleable at all?  I do think that Senator Jameson has made rather too much of this question of the writing down of the debenture stock without the consent of the debenture holders.  I do not think it is, in the circumstances of the case, an invasion of the rights, a real substantial invasion of the rights of creditors, and I do not think it called for the Senator's paraphrase of the Parable of the unjust Steward.  I find it extremely hard myself to see the application of that Parable in the present case, except indeed that the people who are hardly treated in his legislation are perhaps the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jameson asked for the co-operation of the Labour Party.  In all the clauses of this measure and in all the debates that have taken place on it he has got the intelligent co-operation of the Labour Party.  But there <Col N="1685" /> is another party to be considered. There is the person who uses the railways and the person who uses the roads; the people for whom these utility services are required.  A virtual monopoly is being created here over road, rail and in the air itself.  The Government have done well for the Great Southern Company. The Minister is quite right in saying that there is the possibility that, as a result of this legislation, the debenture stock and the ordinary stock will rise and rise sharply.  Not alone have the railway company got a monopoly of transport, but they have got the right, with the consent of the Minister, to close the guaranteed lines that were so useful in the backward parts of this country.  I hope that right will not be availed of to a very great extent.</P>
    <P>What I would say before this Bill is passed is this: that the railway companies have got a chance, and a splendid chance, from the Minister of making good.  If they do not use that monopoly prudently and efficiently, if they think merely of their dividends, I would not be surprised to see a serious agitation for the repeal of this measure.  When Senator Jameson asked for the co-operation of Labour I want to tell him that there are other interests in this country as well.  The Senator referred to a very useful section in the Bill, put in by the Minister, dealing with trustee securities.  That is a very well-thought out section which apparently shows that the Minister has foreseen a situation that might arise.  If that section were not there and if these stocks ceased to be trustee securities at any time and by reason of any non-payment of dividends they were all thrown on the market, then indeed the stock would be &ldquo;blown upon&rdquo; as Senator Jameson said. These stocks have been very considerably blown upon in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the Seanad.  I would be the last in the world to attribute to Senator Jameson any motive whatever except the highest motive in regard to these stocks, but I do think that the value of this property has been very considerably <Col N="1686" /> enhanced as a result of this legislation.  I would have expected from Senator Jameson some statement that would show his appreciation of that fact.</P>
    <P>I join with the other Senators in congratulating the Minister on the skill with which he has framed this measure in both its parts because this measure consists of two parts: reconstruction and financial help by means of a monopoly.  One cannot be enacted without the other.  It would be impossible to allow this company to go on without reconstruction and, at the same time, to give it the wide monopoly over the transport services of this country which this Bill proposes to give it.  Those who represent the country interest, the travelling public and the small farmers of this country, wish well to this monopoly. We hope that the railways will succeed.  We even hope that the flat rate will succeed although, indeed, that flat rate, unless it is administered with an absolute sense of justice to the small people and unless it is carefully watched by the Minister, it will be the cause, I should say, of great bickering and great discontent. Taking the whole measure under review I think that the criticisms of Senator Jameson are not at all justified. The Bill was introduced to deal with an emergency.  It is only a great emergency that could have justified the wide monopoly that has been conferred upon this railway company. We are willing, some of us, to give that a trial, but I can tell Senator Jameson, whether he talks for debenture holders or for ordinary stockholders, that unless this monopoly is carefully guarded so that injury will not be done to the public he will probably find an agitation for the repeal of this measure.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to say anything at this stage of the debate as I did not think it would serve any useful purpose, but statements have been made in the course of the discussion this afternoon which make me feel that I should say something.  I am one of those who are opposed to the reconstruction of capital proposed <Col N="1687" /> in the Bill, particularly that part of it referring to debentures.  I am not against that part of the Bill merely from the point of view of the debenture shareholders.  I do not happen to be one of them and I have no special associations with that particular class of stockholders.  I am against the proposals purely in the interests of the country as a whole because I believe if debenture holders are treated in this way it will be very difficult to raise debentures to finance any Irish endeavour in future.  The allegation has been made that those who attack these proposals do so from the point of view that dividends must be paid even though railway workers may starve.  That is a sort of statement that does not impress me in the slightest degree.  I know that it is entirely a misrepresentation of the true position.  The real position is that railway workers are a specially favoured wage earning and salary earning class in the country.  They are far better off than any other class of a comparable size.  Compared with their position in pre-war times, they are very much better off than they were.  They are paid twice or more than twice as much as they were in those days, whereas the shareholders' income&mdash;and many shareholders are very poor people&mdash;has diminished from five or six per cent. to nothing at all.  That is the real position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about a monopoly.  It is true that there is a very large element of monopoly in this Bill.  It is one of the features of the Bill, but it has been spoken about as if it were a thing that could come about in a few weeks. It should be remembered that it is merely a potential monopoly and it is a thing which is going to be very difficult of realisation.  The realisation of that monopoly will be the means whereby the railways can be pulled out of the difficulties in which they find themselves at present and put on a paying basis again, but that very realisation is not going to be made any easier and, in fact, in my opinion, will be made more difficult by the proposals regarding reconstruction <Col N="1688" /> of capital in the Bill.  It is not going to be an easy thing to raise the money to make that potential monopoly an effective one.  On the whole, as I have made clear in a previous debate, I realise the great difficulties of the position and I think that the Bill is in the main a most excellent endeavour to put it right. I am not in favour of the reconstruction proposals.  A good deal of that part of the Bill does not actually affect anything in the way of saving money.  That part of it which does, namely, the part dealing with debentures, is, I think, a very bad thing for the country at the moment.  I am afraid these are proposals which are likely to come home to roost.</P>

      <P>Senator Jameson told us again that his particular insistence in this debate has been on a matter of principle, the principle of financial probity, straight dealing with capital and so on.  I suggest, that, looking beneath the surface, it will be found that the principle that Senator Jameson in particular and Senator Sir John Keane, Senator Miss Browne, Senator Bagwell and others have really spoken of, is the principle that where capital is invested in a concern there should be a recurring perpetual income by right available to that capital.</P>

      <P>I am tempted to quote an article which was written in <i>Studies</i> in September, 1932, on this question by the Rev. J. Coyne, S.J., M.A., and I should like to draw the attention of Senators to the points Father Coyne made in the course of that article.  He stated: &ldquo;First and foremost, in my opinion, the financial facts of the Irish railways should be faced.  There are a considerable number of years of Irish railway financial history which should be investigated on behalf of the community by some firm of auditors.  The facts and figures that should be faced are: (i) The total amount of money distributed as interest or dividend since railways were introduced; (ii) the total amount of money distributed to the actual workers of the railways in <Col N="1689" /> salaries and wages for the same period; (iii) the total amount of money actually earned by the railways (i.e., not the original or fresh capital issues) which was applied to renewals of fixed capital, permanent way, rolling stock, etc.  It should be possible to secure these figures without much trouble.... Above all, it should be clearly settled who in equity has paid for the railways as they stand to-day, for the present rolling stock, buildings, permanent way, etc.  It is generally taken for granted that the shareholders, the owners of the railways, have paid for all these&mdash;not only at the commencement, but even up to the present day. It may be so.  An investigation might clearly establish this fact.  But on the other hand it may not be so.  It might be found that in equity a great portion of the present fixed capital of the railways should be put to the credit of the users and the workers of the railways for the past 70 or 80 years.  Before any final solution of this problem is decided on, the whole of the accounting side of the question from a moral, social and economic point of view should be gone into.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I was hopeful in the course of this discussion on the Railways Bill that some of these figures and the finances of railways might have been presented, but they have not been.  I intend just to put forward one or two figures I have, within the last few hours, found and which I think are worthy of notice, touching these questions which Fr. Coyne raised in his article in <i>Studies.</i> I have not got the figures for the Free State railways, except as regards the existing capital stock which is contained in the Schedule of this Bill, an amount of £25,701,000.  I have the figures up to 1921 for the whole of the Irish railways and the capital then invested was something about £47,000,000.  Senator Jameson spoke of the shareholders, the old shareholders, who bore the burden and the heat of the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon. <Col N="1690" /> Senator Sir John Keane stands by the old shareholders who bore the burden and the heat of the day.  £25,000,000 odd was the amount that is invested capital, or raised by loans and debenture stock up to 1864.  The figures before that are not available.  So that more than half the total of the present capital of the Irish railways, taking the country as a whole, was invested so long ago as 1864 or earlier and the amount, which was paid in dividends to all classes of shareholders, ranged about 4 per cent. for many years.  In the few years following that there were additions to the capital.  Between 1865 and 1880 another £8,000,000 had been added&mdash;53 years ago.  In 1889 another £4,000,000 had been added&mdash;44 years ago.  In 1900 another £3,000,000 had been added&mdash;33 years ago.  Up to 1921 the dividend which had been paid on this capital ranged round 4 per cent. Those people who put their money, their hard earned savings, into the railways 80 odd years ago, in the hope of getting 4 per cent., let us say might have put their money into British Consols and got 2½ per cent. or 3 per cent., but they preferred to put it into Irish railways and take a certain amount of risk.  Presumably they did not then see the coming of the internal combustion engine.  That was one of the risks they took.  It came, but, according to the arguments we are now hearing, there was to be a perpetual claim to a dividend round about 4 per cent. for these people who put their money into Irish railways 80 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that looking at the thing as a real matter-of-fact affair, not merely as a financial accounting matter, if a man put £100 in rolling stock and permanent way 80 years ago, and got for 50 or 60 years, 4 per cent. on that money he has no reason to complain if eventually he loses it completely.  Father Coyne asks how much of the fixed capital of the company had been actually provided by the users and the workers of the railways.  Here again one cannot get detailed figures in regard to the Great Southern Railways, but one can get this figure, that for all the railways in Ireland in 1913 the proportion of expenditure which was <Col N="1691" /> devoted to the maintenance and renewal of ways and works, and the maintenance and renewal of rolling stock, was 39 per cent. of the total expenditure.  The figure for the year 1921, which was just after the war and might have been an exceptional period, had risen to 45 per cent. of the total expenditure.  One sees the position that the railways were provided out of the capital savings of certain people.  As years went on, of course, almost every year there was renewal required and the amount expended on renewals each year was over one-third of the total expenditure and at the end of 56, 70 or 80 years the railways, owing to renewals out of earnings were a better property, from the point of view of mere physical efficiency, than they were during any intervening period. So in fact the railways were renewed out of the annual takings of the company.</P>
    <P>The proposition seems to be that money having been invested, lines having been laid, rolling stock having been provided, all that has to be expected is that the wheels of the finance shall go on perpetually, and that the dividends shall be always forthcoming.  I dare say the Minister will not be a supporter of the doctrine I am prepared to preach, that there should be a limit to the number of years during which capital is going to be recompensed, that dividends cannot go on perpetually and that there is no justification in equity that capital should go on perpetually paying dividends to shareholders who are merely waiting to receive them&mdash;&ldquo;bearing the burden and the heat of the day&rdquo;!  How much of the burden and the heat of the day does a man who has his name in a book suffer or share?  None at all; he is simply receiving what other people earn.</P>
    <P>I think that the railway shareholders are, by this Bill and by the Bill that has been running in harness with it, the Road Transport Bill, in fact, receiving a gift from the State. They are being presented with a <Col N="1692" /> property and assured of an income which, without these two Bills, would not be theirs and I wonder what would be the value of this permanent way and rolling stock if the community was not there to use it and to pay for its use, and if the State were not coming forward to help it to withstand the competition of the new and more modern and, apparently, more popular form of transport?  My view in this matter is that the State is very generous to the railway shareholders and while it is a desirable and a necessary thing that the railways should be kept in actual activity, the shareholders ought to be thankful and not complaining of the action of the State in coming to their assistance as they have done in this Bill.</P>

      <P>These loans and debenture stock are the one thing, and if the Senator will look into the Act that established that, he will find that to be so.  The loans and debenture stock are on one side.  The capital of the company is a totally different thing.</P>

I was dealing with the rights of people who had lent money to the company, and I think the Senator will admit that, if you lend money to anybody, you can surely claim the right to get it back.  If you are going to suggest that anybody who lends money should be faced with the prospect of getting nothing when the time comes for his loan to be repaid, we get into a sphere into which I do not like to move.  The man who lends money expects to get it back.  That is the principle I am acting on, anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House unduly, but I should like to deal with some of the remarks made by Senators in the course of this discussion.  I noticed that some Senators used the word &ldquo;confiscation&rdquo; in relation to this Bill and, although I think it is possible to use that word, those who did use it, misapplied it.  To a certain extent, there is confiscation, but it is confiscation for the benefit of the railway company, and that fact appears to have been ignored by a number of the Senators who addressed themselves to this measure.  We are going abroad into the country; we are going to every person in the country, rich or poor, whether he is a debenture holder, an ordinary stockholder, or one of that large and respectable body who never owned any stock, and we are taking something from them for the benefit of the railway company.  Let us get this fact straight, because every member of this Seanad seems to have discussed this Bill as if the only people who are being asked to make a contribution to the new transport scheme were the owners of railway debentures or railway stocks.  It is not so.  On the contrary, they are being asked to make a smaller contribution than many other classes of the community. We are going to the taxpayers; we are going to the users of the transport services; we are going to the owners <Col N="1694" /> of competing transport services, and we are taking something from everyone in order that the railway position might be strengthened, and that the debenture stockholders might get what they have not got now&mdash;some security for the continuity of their interest payments.</P>
      <P>If the debenture holders are being asked to accept a lower annual return in the future than they have got in the past, they are getting good value for it, They are going to get the certainty of that payment continuing which they have not got for many years past. Senator Foran asked Senator Jameson if there were any people in this country who believed that, without this legislation, the railway company could continue to pay the debenture interest. Senator Jameson replied that he knew many people who believed that the railway company could continue to pay the debenture interest.  If there were many people who had that opinion, they must not have been very anxious to risk their own savings on the opinion.  The prospect of the railway company continuing to pay the debenture interest is adequately reflected in the price at which debenture stock was quoted on the market.  I do not think that that argument is contested.</P>
      <P>If there was any reasonable certainty that the interest on these debentures would continue to be paid, not even permanently, but for a considerable time to come, that stock would not be quoted at its present price.  Those who can get 4 per cent. for their money, at the present time, consider themselves lucky.  A 4 per cent. gilt-edged stock will be quoted at par, if not above par, on the stock exchange here or anywhere else and the fact that these £100 stocks are being quoted at £36, is a fair measure of what the capital owners of this country thought were the prospects of the railway company being able to continue to pay debenture interest for any time to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill have been attacked from many points of view, but I do not think that anybody seriously suggested, before to-day, that they were unfair.  They have been <Col N="1695" /> attacked on the ground that it was bad policy, taking into account general considerations, to interfere with the nominal values of the debentures of a public utility company of this kind. They may have been attacked on the ground that information which would justify a fair allocation of a new value is not available, but to attack them on the grounds that it is unfair to do it, having regard to everything that is being done for the benefit of the railway companies, is, in my opinion, ludicrous.  Senator Sir John Keane said it was unfair to do it, but he backed his argument as to unfairness with a new contention, something which was not advanced in any previous discussion on this part of our transport proposals.  He said that persons will put money into the railway company in future and will be getting a higher rate of remuneration on that money than those who did so before.  Senator Jameson, I think, has a different point of view from Senator Sir John Keane in this matter.  He not merely thinks that nobody will ever again put a penny into the Great Southern Railways because of this measure, but that nobody in this country will ever be able to raise money on debentures. Senator Sir John Keane, on the other hand, thinks that the railway company will have no difficulty in getting new capital, but he points to the unfairness of the fact that new investors will be remunerated at a higher rate than the old investors.  He is forgetting, however, that the assets which will be created by the new capital will be revenue earning assets.  I refer him to the assets that were created by the old capital and ask what percentage of them are capable of earning any revenue now.  Surely, there must be some consideration of the actualities of the position and not merely the theories that might be advanced in relation to it.</P>
    <P>Railway lines have been built and have been closed down.  As I said here, on a previous stage of the Bill, there are workmen at present employed, in certain parts of the country, taking up lines, dismantling signalling boxes, and scrapping other <Col N="1696" /> apparatus that is used in connection with railways.  Is it seriously contended that we should take out of the transport organisation in this State, in the way of higher charges or some other way, the amount required to remunerate the capital invested in these lines now abandoned?  Money was invested in railway stations and other equipment throughout the country, a large part of which is now an unnecessary burden and expense on the company, much less a source of revenue.  In so far as the old capital has been expended on assets the utility of which is gone, it is right that that capital should be written off.  In so far as new capital may be raised, it is only to be expected that it will be utilised to create assets capable of earning revenue for the company to remunerate the capital and, even, perhaps, to help to remunerate some of the old capital as well.</P>
    <P>One other argument has been advanced during the course of this discussion and it is that the actual reductions carried out in the different classes of stock have very little to justify them in so far as it is not possible to produce all the information that should be available before one could say what the reduction should be with mathematical precision, and Senator Jameson asked why did we reduce the debenture stock by only 15 per cent.  I cannot answer that question.  I think it is much too small a reduction.  I think that anybody who has regard to the known facts of the revenue of the company since the amalgamation and to the present value of that stock on the market can only come to the conclusion that 15 per cent. was too small a reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I, however, felt that we could afford to take the risk of erring in the direction of making the reduction too light than of erring in the opposite direction.  We have been told that the debenture holders have not agreed to this reduction.  There is nobody here, or anywhere else, has any right to say that.  It has been <Col N="1697" /> suggested that I misled the Seanad with regard to the views of those whom I met and who represented one-fourth of the debenture holders of the company.  That is a rather serious allegation and I will deal with it in a minute.  Nobody here has a right to mislead the Seanad as to the views of the remaining debenture holders.  They have not expressed their views.  No Senator or no member of the Dail or of the public has any more right than I have to come in here and say that the debenture holders do not agree to this reduction.  The debenture holders have not got an organisation through which they can express their opinions.  Certain debenture holders held a meeting.  They invited, through the public Press, all debenture holders to come to that meeting for the purpose of considering their views on these proposals and representing them to the Government and the meeting was held.  It is preposterous to say that the meeting was only representative of 25 per cent. of the debenture stock because most of the stock was held by trustees.  The majority of those who attended the meeting were trustees.  I should say that, of the deputation I met, three out of every four members were there in the capacity of trustees&mdash;not holders of debenture stock in their own names but representing organisations and bodies of one kind or another&mdash;and it was as trustees they spoke.  The full meeting represented one quarter of the debenture stock and the representatives who came to me expressed their willingness to make a contribution to the reduction of the charges on the Great Southern Company by reducing the interest payable on the debentures for a limited period of time.  I think that is what I said in the course of the discussion on the Report Stage on this matter.  The report of the debate is not yet available, but I intend to examine it to see if any word I used on that occasion could have misled anybody into believing that I meant anything different from what I have now said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to prolong this <Col N="1698" /> discussion but there are a couple of other points to which I want to refer. As regards the section dealing with the trustee status of the prior stocks of the G.S.R. Company, if Senator Jameson is right, no harm is done by having the section in the Bill.  The section purports to protect trustees who invest trust moneys in the stock of the company.  If that section were not there, it is quite clear that trustees could not invest trust moneys in these stocks.  Senator Jameson says that the insertion of the section does not give them the right to invest in these stocks.  If that be so, the section is doing no harm.  We can either leave it in or take it out.  If the Senator's views are correct, it makes no difference which course we adopt.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might interrupt the Minister.  This is merely an exchange of opinion.  A trustee might easily be misled by that section. If he is misled, he has no remedy. That is the real trouble.  A trustee who reads the Bill and who reads the Minister's statement that he believes trustees will be protected by that section from any action the beneficiaries might take, might buy that stock and yet the section will give him no real protection whatever.  So long as the Minister is considering the matter, I do not want to say more but a trustee who, on the strength of that section, finds himself mulcted in costs will not say &ldquo;thank you.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The only angle from which that contention can be put forward is that a trustee is under an obligation, in any event, to invest trust moneys to the best advantage and that that obligation remains whether certain classes of stock are classified as trustee stock or not.  We are not altering the trustee's legal obligation in that respect.  We are merely preserving the nominal trustee status of these stocks during the period of reorganisation&mdash;until the 31st December, 1935.  It has been suggested that this action has had adverse effects on the credit of the country.  The only answer I can give to that is that it has not had such <Col N="1699" /> adverse effects.  In no way has the credit of the country been affected.  If Senators look at all the possible indices to the credit of the country, they will find that it stands higher to-day than it did when this Bill was introduced.</P>
      <P>Many Senators spoke about the management of the company.  It is quite true that no legislation that human wit could devise could preserve the company if the management was incompetent or if those responsible failed to take advantage of any opportunities provided.  I have no reason whatever to believe that the G.S.R. Company's management will not rise to the opportunities provided by this measure.  If they do not, there is a new situation&mdash;a situation that will have to be dealt with.  I cannot say that I share the view obviously held by a number of Senators, that the management of any concern by private owners of the concern must necessarily be efficient and that the management of a concern which is publicly owned must necessarily be inefficient.  My own experience has generally shown things to be the other way round but if we find that, under private ownership, we cannot get efficient management of our transport organisation, we shall have to get it in some other way.  I am quite certain that, on evidence of incompetence being produced, very few in this House would object to the State interfering for the purpose of securing efficiency.  The prime consideration&mdash;the provision of adequate, efficient and cheap services for the public&mdash;will override all other considerations.</P>
      <P>I should like, in conclusion, to express appreciation of the manner in which the Seanad has given consideration to this Bill and to the Road Transport Bill.  The discussions we have had here have been particularly useful and the amendments inserted in both Bills have considerably improved them.  It is my intention to recommend the Dail to accept all the amendments.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to be able to ask the Seanad to give a Second Reading to a Bill which can be properly described as non-controversial.  This Bill was originally drafted many years ago&mdash; when, I am not quite sure.  The first historical reference to it that I can find is in the report of the InterDepartmental Committee on Coast Erosion, which sat in 1930.  Apparently, the Bill was in an advanced stage of preparation then because a draft of it was submitted to that Committee.  The Bill, as introduced, in so far as it deals with coast erosion, is that draft, as amended in the manner recommended by that Committee, the report of which was published two or three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, perhaps, desirable that I should indicate briefly the general purport of the Bill.  The foreshore of the Saorstat is, generally speaking, the property of the State.  Certain stretches of it are either privately owned or are in the hands of local authorities but, in the main, it is State property.  I have been asked on two or three occasions in the Dáil to define &ldquo;foreshore&rdquo; and it is well that we should get the definition clear in the beginning.  It is: &ldquo;The part of the shore below a line on the shore to which the tide flows at high water on a calm day when the height of high water is midway between the height of high water at ordinary springs and the height of high water at ordinary neaps.&rdquo;  That line is usually shown on maps under the description of high water mark of ordinary tides, the mystic letters used being &ldquo;h.w.m.o.t.&rdquo; All the land below that line is the foreshore and it is proposed to take powers in this Bill to exercise certain authority in respect of it.  Power exists, of course, at present in this regard, but it exists under statutes passed a long time ago and it is rather difficult to make use of it when necessary.  Under this Bill, we take power to license people to remove <Col N="1701" /> beach material&mdash;sand, gravel or stones &mdash;from the State-owned foreshore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCostello" hpid="Mrs. Costello Mrs. Costello">

      <P>What about seaweed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Seaweed is covered in the Bill.  I shall mention it later. In so far as the State-owned foreshore is concerned, we take power to permit people to remove these things.  Where it is necessary to prevent coast erosion, where damage is being done to the land adjoining the shore, we take power to prohibit the removal of these materials whether the land is privately owned or not. There is, of course, power to do that at present but it is power which we find it difficult to utilise because the practice has been to allow the interested parties to move in the matter and, if they do not move, the local authority.  Generally speaking, considerable damage is done before either of these parties moves and usually the State has to interfere.</P>
      <P>The removal of sand for manurial purposes around the coast has been going on from time immemorial and, whenever an order prohibiting the removal of beach material is made, there is generally a concession given to farmers in the adjoining townlands in respect of the removal of sand for manurial purposes.  Since cement became such a popular building material and since roadworks have been undertaken on their present scale, the removal of sand and stone from the beach for sale has grown up in many districts.  In a number of cases, but not in all cases, that is highly injudicious.  The natural action of the tide builds up heaps of stones around the coast which protects it.  If these stones are removed, the coast is left unprotected and very frequently serious erosion results.  The county councils are usually the worst offenders in that respect although, under existing legislation, they have very direct responsibility for the protection of the coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another part of this Bill deals with the right of the State to control the erection of works on privately-owned foreshore or to oppose the removal of works which are necessary for the protection of the shore or for the protection of navigation.  I think that these <Col N="1702" /> sections are self explanatory.  The Department of Industry and Commerce has certain definite obligations to protect waterways and to see that navigation is not interfered with.  We are merely giving ourselves the power it was recommended we should take in order to prevent people, by erecting works on the seashore on their privately owned property, from interfering with navigation or acting in such a manner as to cause the destruction of property elsewhere.  We go further in this Bill than has heretofore been the case as regards the protection of public amenities.  There are sections which prohibit the deposit of rubbish or dirt of any kind upon the seashore. Power is taken to prosecute people responsible for such offences.  The idea is to ensure that the seashore will be kept clean and suitable for persons desiring to use it for bathing purposes or holiday purposes and to prevent developments such as have taken place in the vicinity of Dublin where a very considerable stretch of popular beach has been made very obnoxious by the deposit of rubbish.  There, again, the local authority is responsible.  When this Bill goes through, we shall be able to deal with the local authority in that particular case.</P>
    <P>Other sections of the Bill are largely technical and can be discussed in Committee. They are designed to secure that the title of the State to the foreshore is preserved even though it is not quite clear at the present time&mdash; even though there may be some ambiguity about it.  One section provides that, in cases of doubt, the benefit of the doubt will go to the State.  Sometimes it is claimed that the right to remove beach material or seaweed over a number of years gives a right of ownership over the foreshore. It is made clear in the Bill that that is not the case.  A person engaged in the removal of material or sea wrack may be owner of the foreshore, but the mere fact that he or she has been removing the material does not in itself constitute title, without further proof.  There is power taken to purchase, lease or rent privately owned foreshore wherever the same becomes available and make it State <Col N="1703" /> property in the future.  These are the main provisions of the Bill.  It is a non-controversial measure and, to some extent, a technical measure.  It is very largely the production of the inter-Departmental Committee which met in 1931 and the report of which was published a couple of years ago.</P>
    <P>Any points that arise can be dealt with.  Senators will find it is so technical that, apart from one or two general questions, it is a rather difficult Bill to deal with, without having made a very comprehensive study of previous legislation on the matter.  The main purpose of the Bill is to give power to prevent erosion, power to protect the amenities of the seashore and power to ensure that works on the seashore will not interfere with navigation or involve the destruction of property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>To use a common expression, this measure supplies &ldquo;a long felt want.&rdquo;  I know a case in which an agreement for a lease of a foreshore for 21 years was made in 1917.  It appears that between the Woods and Forest Department on one side, the Department of Industry and Commerce on the other side, and the Department of Finance at the apex of the triangle, it was impossible to make a lease of the foreshore.  About 16 or 17 of the 21 years have now expired. It is a good thing, even at this late hour, that we have a measure which makes clear once and for all what authority it is that has a right to grant a lease of the foreshore, either for the <Col N="1704" /> purpose of getting sand or stones, or getting seaweed for kelp, or black weed, which is used by farmers for manure.  Senator Miss Browne is quite right in saying that this Bill is a very important measure so far as it relates to seaweed right.  Very few people who live inland or in cities, understand how important the seaweed right is to farmers, who have tillage land or even grazing land near the seashore, where seaweed grows.</P>
      <P>As Senator Miss Browne knows, seaweed does not grow on every shore.  I would like to know from the Minister how he proposes to deal with farmers, each of whom cuts weed on the seashore in connection with his farm, and further how he proposes to deal with groups of labouring men who have no shore rights but who very frequently earn a fair livelihood at certain seasons of the year by cutting and selling seaweed.  There are great numbers of these people in the west of Ireland.  Will they be granted leases or will they be granted licences by the Minister?  Only a fortnight ago I had a communication from labouring men in Ballyvaughan. They complained that a gentleman who owned land adjoining the seashore sought to prevent them taking the seaweed.  After searching through the records I found that he had absolutely no rights whatever.  I am glad to say that when the members of the Gárda Síochána went and informed him that he had no private rights in the foreshore, or in the seaweed, and that he should allow the labouring men to cut the seaweed wherever they liked, they were enabled to earn a good livelihood for a month or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The south side of the Gaul Island portion of that bay belongs to the State, but adjoining it are other tracts of foreshore which are in private ownership, and in respect of which the working men of the district have no right whatever to cut seaweed. This private right to ownership in the foreshore is very extensive throughout Ireland.  It arises in this way, that the Landed Estates conveyances that were made at the sale of encumbered estates very frequently included the foreshore in the <Col N="1705" /> map, and, of course, the purchasers under the Landed Estates Courts conveyances had statutory title to the foreshore as against the State.  That is a very frequent occurrence.  I am glad to see that the Minister has taken power to purchase foreshore rights in the interests of working people; in the interests of farmers who need manure for their tillage, and also in respect of shell and oyster fisheries which we hope to see developed in the near future.  The Minister stated that in case there is a question of a dispute as to whether the State owns the foreshore or whether it is the property of a private individual, the onus of proof shall lie on the individual who claims as against the State.  I cannot see that in the Bill.  In any case, it is right and I think it is not an innovation, because in all cases where a person claims foreshore rights as against the State, he had to show something more than mere usage. Therefore, no real harm has been done to private individuals.  I cannot imagine any private individual successfully asserting a right to the foreshore unless he had a Landed Estates Court conveyance, or something with a map, giving him the foreshore.  There are other provisions in the Bill which are extremely useful, including the taking away of sand and other material from the foreshore.  In County Kerry sand is frequently taken from the shore and brought several miles inland for manure.  Of course that will not be interfered with, but there are other cases in various parts of Kerry, Cork and elsewhere, where people have been allowed to undermine cliffs by taking away sand and doing great injury to the public.</P>
    <P>There is a prohibition against using the foreshore as a dumping ground, which is a very proper thing.  Finally, there is what I think should be in every Bill dealing with public property, a provision that notification must be given of any lease proposed to be made.  That is a very proper provision to include in the Bill.  I would suggest to the Minister that when considering the question of <Col N="1706" /> leases, or rules or regulations which will guide the Department in making leases of foreshore rights, or easements or profits such as seaweed, shellfish and matters of that kind, that he ought to have regard to the fact that there are great numbers of labouring men who benefit greatly by the licence they have had up to the present of taking seaweed.  It is a great advantage that they are not stopped.  It would be a still greater advantage if they could be told, or if the public could be told, that certain big people living along the coast have really no rights to the seaweed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister has had any conversations with the officials of the Fisheries Department regarding this measure, as questions will arise concerning the oyster beds.  I take it that the Fishery Commissioners have seen the Bill and are aware of the questions that will arise.  I have property in Sligo and I had to go to the Fishery Commissioners about the rights to the oyster beds and to seaweed.  I wish the Minister luck when he is handling some of the situations that will arise with regard to the seaweed.  I might mention that people in Rush and Malahide come and take seaweed from almost in front of houses in the vicinity of residences in County Dublin.  The Minister will want great luck when he tries to limit the taking of the seaweed in the immediate neighbourhood of the shore.  People come long distances to take it.</P>

      <P>I was wondering what reason there would be for prohibition. I notice people from Rush coming to the County Dublin foreshore, and if an order for prohibition is made there is going to be trouble, especially where there are oyster beds.  The Fishery Commissioners should go through the Bill and say if they have a right to give licences.  I imagine the same rights would come in if the Department intends to do what Senator Comyn said, to purchase the foreshore and to establish oyster beds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid something I said must have given rise to misunderstanding. There is power at present to make an order to prohibit the removal of beach material from any portion of the foreshore where in the public interest it is deemed desirable that removal should be stopped. In all cases that I know of the order was limited to the removal of sand or gravel.  I have no recollection of an order being made prohibiting the removal of seaweed, and I doubt if such an order will arise, except the State was proceeding to develop the production of seaweed of some particular form on a stretch of foreshore. In such a case an order prohibiting the removal of seaweed may be made with a licence given under Section 3 to persons to remove seaweed or particular kinds of seaweed.  Ordinarily speaking, an order made at present under an Act that is about 120 years old, the Harbours Act of 1814, prohibits the removal of sand or gravel <Col N="1708" /> generally from within a defined distance from the base of the cliff.  It is in connection with such an order that a concession is given to local farmers to remove sand for manurial purposes in their own area.  Ordinarily, there is no restriction on any one to remove sand, gravel, seaweed or anything else except an order is made, and that position will continue.  If no order has been made anybody can enter the foreshore and remove sand or seaweed.  If, however, after a local enquiry has been held, it is determined that in the public interest a prohibitory order should be made and that such order is made, it will then become illegal for anyone to remove the beach material specified in the order without a licence issued under the Act.  That, I think, answers the point made by Senator Miss Browne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Then in the ordinary way no licence will be required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, unless a prohibitory order is made and that will not be made except public rights are being prejudicially affected, or where there is damage to property, buildings, wall, pier or other structure, etc.  That rarely applies in a case of seaweed. Any order made, except in very exceptional cases, will prohibit only the removal of sand or gravel.  In such cases it is not expected that licences will be issued at all except to give permission to local farmers to remove sand for manurial purposes outside the defined areas.  There was one point that, I think, Senator Comyn misunderstood. I did not say that in every case of dispute as to the ownership of foreshore that the onus of proof was being put on other persons than the State. In certain cases of a kind which have led to disputes in the past the benefit of the doubt has been given to the State.  In other words, the type of contention that has been relied on to proof title to the foreshore is declared insufficient without further proof under Section 15.</P>

      <Col N="1709" /> Question proposed: That this Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will recollect that the original Trade Loans Act was passed in 1924.  It had a life of one year only.  Each year since a Bill has been introduced at this period to continue it for another year.  I think I can say that on each occasion the continuing measure was introduced the Minister then responsible announced that it was the last time he was going to continue it, but at the end of the year he changed his mind and proceeded to introduce a continuing measure.</P>
      <P>The Act has been continued from 1924 to date.  The question arose for consideration whether it should be continued for another year or whether it should be allowed to drop at this stage.  When, last year, I had the responsibility for the first time to move the adoption of the continuing Act I indicated that we had under consideration the question of the future of the Act.  We had been examining the operations carried out under this legislation in the past, and the relationship of that legislation to the present position. I announced during the course of the year our intentions concerning this Act for the future.  We established a committee consisting of officers of the different State Departments who had practical experience in the administration of these Acts since 1924.  To a large extent the Bill now before the Seanad is based on the committee's recommendations, recommendations with which, of course, the Government is in full concurrence.  We came to the conclusion that these Acts are still of very definite value, but that they should be amended so as to widen their scope somewhat; also that certain changes in the manner of administration should be effected&mdash;changes which do not require legislation, but which have an important bearing on the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal changes effected by this Act are, first, that the Act is to be continued for a period of five years. <Col N="1710" /> It will cease to operate at the end of that time if not renewed.  Secondly, it is proposed to enable loans to be given for other than capital undertakings. There was a section in the original Act which had a limited scope in this way: that a guarantee could only be given for loans, the purpose of which was to acquire or erect fixed assets of one kind or another.  If any portion of the loan to be raised by the applicant was to be devoted to working capital purposes a guarantee could not be given.  Cases of this kind came before me on two or three occasions last year: certain people proposed to engage in industry, or, perhaps, to extend their industrial activities, and proceeded to acquire buildings, purchase and instal machinery.  Frequently they took advantage of a particularly favourable opportunity to buy machinery at a very low price.  When they had done that they came seeking the facilities available under these Acts for the purpose of enabling them to get the balance of the capital required so that they might go ahead with the undertaking.  On each occasion we had to tell them that if they had come to us before they erected the buildings and purchased the machinery, we could have given them a guarantee for the loan, but that as they had spent all the money they had in that particular manner we could not give them any assistance.  It is proposed, therefore, to delete the section from the original Act so that in future loans for working capital purposes will be available.</P>
    <P>The purpose to which the loan is to be devoted is of much less importance than the security behind the loan.  It would, of course, be very serious maladministration if we were to guarantee a loan without having what would seem to us to be fairly reasonable security behind it.  If the assets of an undertaking were already seriously encumbered and the loan was required merely to solve a difficult financial position, without increasing employment or otherwise improving the industrial position here, then in my opinion it should certainly not be given.</P>
    <P>Therefore we are retaining the <Col N="1711" /> requirement in the original Act that the loan must be calculated to increase employment in the Saorstát.  The fact that some existing concern would be eased of its difficulties and enabled to carry on will not qualify it to get assistance in this way unless it can be shown that the operation of the loan is going to increase employment here. It was advanced in the Dáil that there were certain dangers in amending the Act in this manner.  Personally, I was not convinced by the arguments put up in support of that and for two reasons: The first is, that in the past the limitation imposed by the original Act was found very irksome and various devices, more or less simple, were found for getting around it so that, in fact, the limitation imposed by the original Act was more apparent than real.  The second reason is that the real safeguard which the State has is the nature of the enterprise itself. The particular purpose to which the money secured by the guaranteed loan is put is of very minor importance if those associated with the application for the guarantee are themselves interested to a large extent, have their own money substantially invested in the undertaking and there are behind the loan assets of reasonable value which might be regarded as security for the loan.</P>
    <P>We have worked on this principle: that the amount to be secured or guaranteed by the loan should not exceed the amount put up by the other parties to the enterprise.  I do not say that that principle has been insisted upon to the last penny, but, as a general principle, it has been applied in all cases.  Where the amount to be secured upon a guaranteed loan was substantially in excess of the amount which the applicant himself was putting into the enterprise, we have generally refused the application or postponed it until the applicant made another effort to get new capital subscribed for the enterprise.</P>
    <P>In fact I may say that is the principal change which we are effecting under this Bill.  We are making other changes. One of these is very largely an administrative <Col N="1712" /> one.  The other is really only a notional change.  Under the original Act there was an advisory committee consisting of business men who acted without remuneration.  That committee examined all applications and made recommendations on them to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In the majority of cases the recommendation of the advisory committee was not accepted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In every case where the committee rejected an application then the application went no further.  The position, therefore, was that if the committee rejected an application it stopped there, but if they recommended it it did not necessarily go on.  We have found that the work under these Acts has increased considerably. The time required from the business men who are members of the committee has been so considerable that they have, in fact, on occasions asked to be relieved from it, because they have discovered that it has been taking up a greater part of their available time than they are prepared to give.  It is intended to amend the Act by inserting words that different committees may be appointed for the purposes of the said section in respect of the different matters, or for different occasions.  In other words, it is proposed of the said section in respect of the different matters, or for different occasions.  In other words, it is proposed to have not one committee, but perhaps two or three committees.  The intention is to appoint a permanent chairman who shall be a civil servant. His work will be to prepare everything relating to the application and have it ready for consideration by the committee when it meets.  It is proposed to associate with the chairman a panel of business men from which committees will be drawn to consider applications when made, so that conceivably we could have two or three applications under consideration at the same time.</P>
    <P>One of the main complaints, I think, made concerning these Acts in the past is the long time an application took before it could get through.  I think it is quite true to say that in certain cases firms have gone out of existence before their applications were decided on.  We are trying to reduce the period of delay, while at the same time <Col N="1713" /> not diminishing the safeguards which delay undoubtedly created or the opportunities for the careful examination which it is very desirable should take place.  The provision in the Bill is the method proposed to achieve that, namely, the constitution of this panel and the appointment of a permanent chairman.  It is also proposed to permit of loans in certain cases to be given to individuals.</P>
    <P>Under the existing Act loans can only be given to companies.  Ordinarily, when this Bill goes through it will be the practice of the Department, in every case possible, to get applicants to constitute themselves into companies and make their applications on behalf of companies rather than as individuals, because there are certain obvious advantages in that.  A company continues in existence but an individual may die.  A company can give a charge over its book debts; an individual cannot.</P>
    <P>In certain cases where very special considerations would exist, we found that it was undesirable that we should not have power to give loans to individuals where the assets of the individual were obviously good security for the loans and where there was a difficulty in carrying the proposal of the Department that the business should be handed over to the company instead of being continued in the ownership of the private individual.  It is desired to amend the Act in that respect, even though as I have said the practice will be to require applicants to make their applications on behalf of companies rather than on behalf of themselves individually.  These are all the alterations which are made here.  One other alteration it is intended to make which does not require legislation, that is, to make the loan on the security of a debenture deed instead of a trustee deed, as at present.  The present procedure is very slow, involves legal difficulties and is highly costly.  We are quite satisfied to accept debentures in an industrial concern as good security for a loan we guarantee.</P>
    <P>Section 5 requires a little explanation. At the present time there is an arrangement in existence by which trade loans guaranteed by the State <Col N="1714" /> under these Acts are taken up by one or other of the joint stock banks on terms which are considered satisfactory. Up to recently the banks did not take up trade loans, but there was another organisation, the Industrial Company of Ireland, which financed them.  That organisation is not now functioning.  There was for a short period a difficulty arising out of the fact that a person might get a State guarantee for a loan which he required to raise and that still he might not be able actually to negotiate that loan. That was a most unsatisfactory position, but it was ended by the arrangement which is now operating, an arrangement which I think will continue. It was felt also that there was a weakness in the working of the original scheme in so far as the State could only guarantee and could not make loans.  There is not, of course, any difference in the State's liability in making or in guaranteeing loans. It was recommended and we agreed that a section should be inserted which gives the Minister for Industry and Commerce power in any case where he could guarantee a loan to make a loan instead if the occasion seemed to necessitate it.  We do not anticipate that that occasion is likely to arise in any circumstances that we can foresee at the moment.</P>
    <P>The other sections of the Bill are of no particular importance.  They merely carry over into the new Act provisions regarding the publication of quarterly and annual returns and the like.  I do not know whether it is desirable that I should attempt to give any review of the working of the Act. As most Senators are aware, the history of the Act has not been altogether satisfactory.  It was operated until 1931 to the extent that some 16 or 18 applicants got State guarantees.  The total amount which was guaranteed was £340,000.  Of that a very considerable portion was lost in the sense that the companies concerned were unable to make good and the State had to make payments on foot of its guarantee in respect of interest or principal.  There were six firms concerned in these losses.  All that amount had been lost in 1931 and for <Col N="1715" /> the whole of that year, and in fact for the year previous no new guarantees were given.</P>
    <P>The Act in fact did not come into operation again until after the change of Government last year.  Some four or five guarantees have been given since and there are at the present time under consideration a number of other cases, some of which are likely to go through and some of which are likely to be rejected.  None of them have any direct bearing upon the Bill before us. The total amount guaranteed under the Act since 1924 was £340,000 and the total amount issued out of the Central Fund in respect of the guarantees was £215,000.  However I feel that these cases cannot be taken into account in determining one's attitude towards these Acts.  These losses might have occurred under any circumstances.  In each case some definite cause could be assigned but it has no particular bearing on the Bill before us because none of the changes it is proposed to make in the law under the Bill, has any relation to these cases nor would it have made any difference if the law had been originally introduced in the form in which it is now proposed to make it.</P>
    <P>I said in the Dáil that the Act could be administered well or badly.  If it is administered well the possibility of loss is minimised.  It is administered badly losses are almost bound to occur, but I do not think that the losses could have been avoided in some cases.  I mentioned that in one of the cases the circumstances which produced a loss could not possibly have been foreseen when the loan was guaranteed.  There was a very considerable fall in the price of the commodity.  The bottom fell out of the market entirely and the industry had to close down and the loss had to be met.  In other cases, the circumstances might have been different but it is not necessary that we should go into details concerning them.  In these cases the safeguards that were considered desirable in 1924 were evaded or did not prove of any avail.  The removal of provisions which did not prove any safeguards but merely <Col N="1716" /> restrictions are desirable if the Act is to be any use in the future in facilitating industrial development here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that this Act if it is well administered is meant to fulfil a good and useful purpose. The Minister is now in the position of the Chief Secretary at one time.  These are the kind of applications which were made to Mr. Balfour in many parts of Ireland some years ago.  What the Minister is trying to do is to assist the financing of industries in various parts of the country where sufficient local capital cannot be found to get them going. That has always been the case in Ireland.  The Minister has told us of the very disastrous experience we have had in the last few years in some cases in which money was advanced in this way.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that he is going to get the assistance of an experienced civil servant to examine the various applications made.  I am sure the Minister will lay down for the guidance of that civil servant various conditions which will make it as nearly certain as he can that when the money is advanced certain principles of safety are observed.  I presume that the loans will not be given out in the manner to which Senator Johnson previously referred, for very long periods, but that there will be a sinking fund arrangement applied which will allow a loan to be paid off gradually in a reasonable period.  If you leave it out for too long the Senator may object to paying it at all.  If proper restrictions are laid down and if a proper supervision is carried out, the scheme may work quite well.  There is the additional safeguard in publicity which I think should be applied.  I think it is well that where public money is going to be advanced, the particulars of these transactions should be known, and that the conditions on which repayment is going to be made should be fully made known.  If these precautions are not taken there is a great danger of things going on as they apparently have gone on in the past. There are many references in this Bill to Acts which have already existed and the contents of which I personally <Col N="1717" /> and I daresay many other Senators have not read at present.  I think anybody who desires to help the Minister should make himself familiar with these provisions so that we may be in a position to give the Minister the benefit of our views and advice.  I have no doubt that if this Bill is properly worked the money advanced under it will be well spent and that eventually the Bill will turn out to be a useful one.</P>

      <P>I do not know that it would be wise to rake up all the transactions of the past.  Certain very serious things did happen.  Half the money was squandered, unquestionably squandered.  I do not know whether we can take steps to prevent such a thing happening again.  On the other Committee the Minister for Finance was represented by two members who were supposed to give him advice, and he was supposed to know both sides of the question.  That plan apparently did not work at all.  I am not going to make any accusation against these people because I think perhaps it was their misfortune rather than their fault.  The provision of loans in this way is a very dangerous thing indeed and it will require very careful supervision if the same thing is not going to happen again.  Lots of money was squandered by people to whom it was advanced and the people who were responsible left the country.  I hope steps will be taken to ensure that such things cannot happen in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that it was inevitable that some money should have been lost at the beginning when we had probably an inexperienced Government and when an apparition, as the Colonel said, floated across the stage with black hair and a red whisker, a wholly unreliable man.  The money was lost, but I do not anticipate that there will be any recurrence of that, because now we are going to have the security of a permanent civil servant as chairman and are going to have an Advisory Committee which is to be selected <i>ad hoc</i> in reference to any particular scheme brought forward. Senator Jameson is, of course, with his usual prudence, quite right in saying that there should be certain restrictions, <Col N="1718" /> but you can have too many restrictions.  This expenditure of money is frequently made with a dual object.  The first object, I should say, would be the giving of employment and the second would be to promote, if possible, an industry that is likely to succeed.  I would think that the main object of the schemes to which Senator Jameson refers, in the time of Mr. Arthur Balfour and Mr. Gerald Balfour, was to give employment without any great expectation that a permanent industry would result from the expenditure.  This Bill is a great improvement on the system which was then followed because this Bill, and the idea behind it, envisages the establishment of industries that will be able ultimately to succeed as a result of the assistance which will be given out of State funds.  That assistance is given not alone, or even not mainly, for the sake of the persons who carry on the industry but, as I should imagine, mainly for the sake of the working men who are out of employment in the various parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is wise for the Minister to take power to make a loan not merely for capital expenditure but, also, if he sees proper, for working expenses as well.  The Minister himself has quoted a case where people who were starting industry, or trying to continue or to expand industries, made purchases of machinery which was regarded, of course, as capital expenditure and, thereby, depleted the fund available for working expenses.  That, of course, is a proper case in which the Minister should take power to make a loan for working expenses.  There are other circumstances which might very well also be imagined.  I think that this plan of making advances for industrial development is a good plan and, while it should be carefully watched, it ought not to be absolutely bound up, like a mummy, in official tape.  There must be risks in industry and I should say that there would be rather a high percentage of risks in industries in localities which are not highly industrialised and these are probably the localities in which State assistance will be mainly required.  I do think that this Bill is a great improvement <Col N="1719" /> on the other measures in that it gives the Minister a freer hand than he had and I think he ought not to be discouraged by the failures which have taken place.  Many things stumble at the beginning and then go well and, even on the racecourse, I think a horse can stumble and yet win.  I hope that the Minister, by means of this measure, may be able to do something for the revival of industry, particularly in places where that revival is much needed and where unemployment is, and must be, a great source of worry to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister indicated that there had been guaranteed under these Acts from 1924, £340,000, of which £215,000 had already been lost.  The amount of the loss is not quite so startling, heavy as it is, as the rapidity with which the collapse of the firms which got these loans came about.  It seems extraordinary that, in such a short time, practically half of the firms which were assisted should have collapsed and that the State should be let in for more than two-thirds of the total amount guaranteed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events, the amount is really an exceptionally high proportion of the total and it would look almost as if there was not sufficient investigation made as to the stability of these firms.  Nobody wants bankrupt firms to be subsidised.  There are, in this country, any amount of people who are full of plans for development, but they have no money at all.  They could make this country flow with milk and honey in regard to various schemes, but somebody else has to provide the money and there will <Col N="1720" /> be a tendency to develop that spirit. We are now out for industrial development and anybody who says that he is going to build up Irish industry is rightly looked on as a hero, if he is serious, but, if he is only going to do that at the expense of the taxpayer and at the sole risk of the taxpayer, I cannot see much risk about his heroism. I am afraid that there has been a certain amount of local political influence brought to bear in the past in regard to some of these grants.  The local patriotism, the local enthusiasm that develops around a firm, often has an influence of a very detrimental character to the State as a whole.  We had a tremendous amount of enthusiasm about a firm here which, after getting a grant, was found to be employing only 21 people.  It was guaranteed for a very substantial amount, but the amount was lost very quickly and, obviously, the firm was in a state of potential bankruptcy at the very time the money was being advanced.  That certainly is not the way to develop industry or to encourage employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be interesting to know if any of the firms, any fair proportion of them, has shown any tendency to develop and expand and to give increased employment as a result of any of the grants made under these Acts.  The extent to which they have developed and to which additional employment has been given as a result of these grants will be the best test as to their efforts.  We have tariff walls here with the sky as their limit and these, in themselves, should be ample encouragement to any body who wants to invest money and develop industry without giving grants at all under this Act.  I agree that the guarantee of loans is a very necessary thing at times under our existing system and I certainly would not oppose the Bill, but I do suggest that there should be far more care given to the examination of applications in the future than has been the case in the past.  The Minister is taking more freedom under this Bill than was given under previous Acts and, to that extent, he may find himself up against <Col N="1721" /> even greater difficulties and bigger political problems than his predecessor. He will have political influences of all kinds brought to bear on him and he will not have the same powers of resistance, the same legislative protection, as his predecessor had.  There are a £1,000,000 to play with under this Bill and there are possibilities of extending it later on and I would suggest to the Minister that he apply the acid test to the business capacity of those who make applications in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister is making one very vital mistake and that is, in proposing to assist only limited companies.  I would put it to the Minister this way : Can he point out to me a single case of an industry that has been made and kept going prosperous by a limited company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator misunderstands. That is the position at present.  We can only give loans or guarantees to companies, but we are proposing in this Bill to enable loans to be given to individuals as well, but it is not intended that we should use that power very extensively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I was quite under a misapprehension.  I thought it was proposed only to advance money to public companies.  In my experience, at all events, I have never known any case of a public company that has made a success of any project it undertook, with the exception, of course, of these big public utility matters that can only be handled by a limited company. The test of whether a company or an individual is likely to succeed is that he should have expert knowledge of the business he undertakes and character.  These are things that are essential and I would point out to the Minister that the amount of money that was lost by 18 firms is very large. Personally, I am very small-minded.  I should like to see smaller and successful industries.  As Senator O'Farrell says, there are tariffs on everything but, apparently, they are not being much utilised by enterprising people.  Take, for instance, <Col N="1722" /> our leather industry.  Ireland imports practically all the leather that is required for boots.  So far as I know, there is no reason in the world why Ireland should not be to-day as successful at tanning as she was when I was young and when, in one factory in Cork, there were 500 people employed. That is an industry which I think would be very well worth the Minister's while to look carefully into and see what are the prospects of it.  On the Continent, they make practically all their own leather in the various countries.  The objection, I am told, here is that our beasts are killed at too early an age to render the hide valuable for leather.  I may be wrong, but my impression is that, on the Continent, beasts are killed at a much earlier age than ours.  That would be a very important industry and it seems to me that, if we have to lose money, it might be very well worth the Minister's while to chance some thousands on the project.  I should like to hear from the Minister what the £125,000 that still remains good on the books is doing&mdash;how many people it is employing, what prospects there is of expansion in these various factories and, above all, whether we are likely to find, in the future, that that £125,000 is paid back into the public exchequer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">

      <P>I merely wish to congratulate the last speaker on having discovered an industry which, apparently, is not protected.  The Minister will also be most grateful to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator opened up very alluring prospects.  He suggested that the reason that that industry has not succeeded is that the animals which provide the hides are not allowed to grow to sufficient age. I see an admirable use to which subsidies to farmers might be devoted&mdash; to keeping the cattle alive until they reach an age to provide suitable hides. I can see great employment being given in providing feeding for these animals until they reach the correct <Col N="1723" /> age to furnish proper hides.  The speech of Senator O'Farrell gave me tremendous hope.  I feel inclined never to say anything unkind about the Labour Party again.  But I should like to be assured that the Senator represents the Labour Party.  If he does not, I hope to have an opportunity of welcoming him to these benches, because I never heard a speech so packed with sound common sense.</P>
      <P>After my rather conspicuous attitude on the Railways Bill, I do not propose to divide the House on this measure, but I cannot say that I support it or welcome it with any enthusiasm whatever. The Minister, in attempting to justify certain relaxations of the earlier measure&mdash;the abandonment of precautions&mdash;referred to the case of working capital.  I do not know whether he was pleading specially or whether he was attempting to make a genuine case.  But he gave us this picture: A firm invested its own money in fixed plant.  It came along later and said: &ldquo;We now require working capital but we cannot get it because our money has gone in fixed plant.&rdquo; If that is the situation, it can be easily met.  It could be met by reconstruction. The company might be allowed for the money already invested in fixed plant.  I should consider that a fair use of the provision but the Minister has given no justification for the new provision, that working capital, as well as fixed capital, shall be eligible for guarantee. I thought that the Minister, instead of seeking to make the thing easier, would come to the legislature and would ask to be protected from his friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can imagine nothing more embarrassing than a Minister with £1,000,000 to dish out to all and sundry and all the political importunity and wire pulling he would have to face.  I should have thought that the precaution of an advisory committee would have been of untold value and that the more exhaustive and deliberate the investigation the better, because anybody with elementary knowledge of business knows how impossible it is to forecast <Col N="1724" /> the success of industry.  If you imagine it possible to forecast the success of industry how, may I inquire, do banks make the bad debts they do? Banks make the most exhaustive, dispassionate and unprejudiced inquiries as to the possibility of repayment. They never lend money except they consider the security ample.  They allow no political considerations to enter into their determinations and, yet, they lose money.  Contrast that with the position of the Minister under this Bill who, apparently, need not even have recourse to the advisory committee, as I read the measure&mdash;a Minister with the aboundant optimism of the Party politician that no member of a Government can divest himself entirely of, with, possibly, his eye on a rather troublesome constituency.  All these things we know perfectly well will exist.  There is no use in trying to hide our heads in the sand.  With all those temptations, how the Minister or his advisers can possibly escape making a bad debt I fail to see.  People who take every precaution make bad debts every day.  I suggest that the allocation of such a large sum of money to such purposes is highly dangerous and I further say that, being so dangerous, on the basis of the experience by which two-thirds of the money already provided has been lost, provision of 50 per cent. for losses should have been made in the Budget.  These losses are almost certain to occur in the future. It is not sound to wait until the losses occur.  No business does that.  Every business with a record of conservative finance and solvency makes provision in advance for losses likely to occur. Anybody in this House who thinks that these losses are not likely to occur has, I suggest, no knowledge whatever of business and the risks that business entails.  Then, again, there is this consideration of increased employment. That seems to be an entirely wrong attitude.  Employment should be incidental to development or to the expenditure of capital.  The object of the expenditure of capital should be to make articles that people want and to sell them not at a luxurious price&mdash; I see Senator Johnson's eye upon me&mdash;<Col N="1725" /> but at a profit which will return interest on the money invested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Employment should be incidental.  If, by the proper use of efficient methods and machinery, employment is lessened, that should be taken as an unfortunate incident in the transaction, but to set out deliberately to give employment without regard to earning power, competition or public demand is, to my mind, nothing but asking for your money to be lost.  The Minister has referred to the question of the applicant's capital.  I think it is most dangerous to allow money to be given to any applicant-company or private person who wants to extend his business unless he is going, as the Minister said, to put in at least 50 per cent. of his own new money into the undertaking.  That the Minister will be able to work on those lines when the time comes and pressure, which he knows better than I do, is applied, I very much doubt.  I doubt if he will be able to insist on this particularly in the cases where it is most necessary.  The Minister has told us that two-thirds of the capital has been lost in the past. To the extent that this measure is risking three times as much as the previous measure, so I feel that it is three times more dangerous than the last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to correct an impression which might be deduced from what Senator Sir John Keane has said.  He spoke of political pressure and of the temptation to assist a troublesome constituency.  Now, I do not usually go out of my way to say anything very polite of the late administration but, time and again, I approached the Trade Loans Committee on behalf of industries in Cork and time and again, even when I felt convinced that the case was good and even though the applicants were supporters of the then Government, the applications were turned down.  It is quite easy to talk about two-thirds of these capital advances having been lost.  We all knew at the time that most of that <Col N="1726" /> capital was invested in two rather large concerns.  With regard to one of them, at least, I think that the Government and the Trade Loans Committee knew that they were taking risks&mdash;that was in the case of the glass bottle industry.  Whether or not they were justified in taking that risk is more than I can say.  As Senator Sir John Keane has said, the banks which make the most dispassionate, careful and judicious inquiries make losses. Speaking for myself, in respect of the only concern in which I had a personal interest that I approached the Trade. Trade Loans Committee about, I succeeded in getting sanction for a loan of £50,000, but I considered the restrictions so onerous that I turned it down, went to a bank and borrowed the money there.  There, again, I had recourse to the much-maligned debenture. I feel that it would be a mistake to let the impression go that this money was lost by reason of political influence.  I am convinced that that is not the case.</P>

      <P>I, like Senator Dowdall, have to say a word in justification of my own support of this series of Acts in the past.  No Senator has indicated his opposition to this Bill, but Senators are doubtful about the series of Acts that have gone in front of this measure.  Some of those who support this Bill suggest that it is a much better Bill and that there is less risk about it.  Whatever limitation of risk may be brought about by change of administration, there is no less risk in the Bill than there was in the existing Act.  There is greater risk in this Bill than there was in the previous Bills and I am very glad there is.  I do not know what firm to which this £250,000 has been lent is charged with having squandered it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that any of this money found its way to the London Stock Exchange.  I am sure it did not.  These were moneys guaranteed by the State for the development of Irish industries.  The money lost was lost by the failure of the companies which had been guaranteed <Col N="1727" /> these moneys and had nothing to do with losses on the London Stock Exchange.  If the lending company went into London Stock Exchange transactions and lost money, that has nothing to do with these guarantees; it is an entirely different question. Two-thirds of the money guaranteed has been lost.  That is a very large proportion, especially having regard to the short period.  What was that period like?  It was a period of recovery from civil war, at a time when the world situation, industrially and economically, was in a state of rapid decline.  If examined individually I think it might be found that these cases do not reflect so seriously upon those who had the administration of the Acts and gave the loans, as at first sight might appear.  I know from my own personal knowledge that two or three of the cases, at any rate, in which failure occurred were very closely examined into, and were very rigidly opposed by the Department of Finance for a very long time, until it was shown that there was a danger of a very great increase in the amount of unemployment that would have accrued had there been no loans sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In taking stock of the losses, one, at least, must put against the losses the savings in public expenditure of any kind that were made by the keeping alive of some of these industries.  At the time the first suggestion was made about this method of Trades Loan Guarantees, I remember I was speaking on the matter and it was explained that the scheme then projected would have brought to the funds, out of which the loans were to be made, the advantage of the gains as well as the disadvantages of the losses.  As it finally turned out, and as this Bill proposes to continue, it is only the losses are coming before the Dáil and Seanad as a report of progress. The gains and the advantages are not brought to our notice at all.  It would be well worth while if the Minister, having regard to the possibilities of the scheme for financing industrial development, if he would bring the <Col N="1728" /> benefits and the profits into the public fund, as well as the losses.</P>
    <P>I was hopeful that Section 5 of the Bill was going to be the germ of something very much greater, until the Minister spoke rather diffidently, as though he was not very enthusiastic in the matter of making loans direct.  I was hoping that this section would be the germ of a development fund, and a development commission, which would have the administration of that fund, whose business it would be to seek out the kind of industry which ought to be established, and which could be established for the benefit of the country, but which private investors will not touch.  I dissent, as very often I do, from what Senator Sir John Keane said.  In this case the Senator appeared to be referring to what Senator O'Farrell said.  I do not think this country is going to progress industrially on private investments by individuals.  I think if we are going to wait for that kind of private investment we are going to have a very long wait for industrial development.  Eventually, something in the nature of Section 5 will have to be put into effect, and moneys raised on the security of the State utilised for the purpose of financing that industrial development which private investors will be slow to take in hand.  I am not going to say that the prospect of 63 per cent. losses will be a desirable one, but I hope it will not be the cause of holding in the reins, or of delay because of fear of losses.  There will be losses, a great many losses, if the country is ever going to establish itself as an industrial community.  I hope that the risks that have been taken in the past, and the losses incurred, will not frighten the new industrial Commissioner or the civil servant chairman of the Committee.</P>
    <P>Again, in reference to Senator Sir John Keane's remarks, I say that he is pretty far astray if he thinks that those of us in the Labour Party who speak in terms of employment think that industries should be established for the purpose of giving employment. Undoubtedly it should be incidental, if there was anything like an ordered <Col N="1729" /> conception of communal powers, rights and responsibilities, but unfortunately the system that the Senator so heartily supports, and which has been maintained, leaves the situation such that unemployment would mean starvation, and, therefore, as a consequence, people are forced to have industrial development in terms of employment. If we were living in a reasonably organised community we would say that the object of industry is to provide the means for life, and when less employment is required and less human muscular energy involved the better.  But when the livelihood of the people is dependent upon the employment that is given in the development of industry, naturally people are going to think that this kind of industry should be developed, simply for the purpose of giving employment.  I believe that is a mistaken conception but unavoidable in the circumstances of the social system which Senator Sir John Keane so heartily supports.  I think this is a good Bill, a better Bill than the previous ones, because it involves, at least, as many risks and gives the opportunity to the Minister to take more risks.  I hope the Bill will be well and carefully administered.  I hope its utility will not be impaired because it may involve risks.</P>

      <P>As the House seems to be developing into a sort of mutual admiration society, I would like to join with Senator Sir John Keane in complimenting Senator O'Farrell, not so much on his good sense, but because he exploded many old theories to-day. He exploded the old theory that a man cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.  It was not the first time that happened, and I would like to compliment the Senator, because of the fact that he has done so and got away with it.  I refer to the matter because Senator O'Farrell made the statement that all over the country there were thousands of people with wonderful ideas for developing industries and starting new ones.  I was rather surprised when the Senator was applauded from both sides of the House.  It was not much of a surprise <Col N="1730" /> to me to hear Senator O'Farrell make that statement.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, one of the greatest advantages of this Bill is that it makes provision for the cases of men who were born, so to speak, without silver spoons in their mouths.  There is an old saying that it is not all the big men reap the harvest.  Neither have rich men all the brains.  It is an admirable thing that in this Bill provision is made to give a chance to men with more brains than money.  It does not follow, because a man happens to be a worker, and if he had certain ideas in his head which, if developed along proper lines, would be the foundation of a great industry.  That has happened in other countries, and I dare say it will happen here if things are kept going along the lines they are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Sir John Keane's attitude that no man should benefit by State action unless he was prepared to put down at least 50 per cent. of his own money, that coming from the Senator does not surprise me. It would be a regrettable thing if the Minister in this Bill should stick to any such advice as that given by Senator Sir John Keane.  Within the past 12 months since the protective policy of the Government began to take effect, I was approached by various people with certain schemes which to my mind&mdash; and I do not pose to be any great authority&mdash;at least, merited serious consideration.  I approached the Minister and the Department of Industry and Commerce and I was told that according to the provisions of the Trade Loans Acts these schemes could not be considered and that there was no use doing so.  The new Bill provides that a loan can be granted to an individual, so that I believe a great many of the difficulties experienced in every part of the country in the past will be eliminated.  In the past a committee of three was supposed to deal with the various schemes.  That might have been justified, to some extent, because there was comparatively little development, but at present, as Senator O'Farrell suggested, people are very anxious to start industries.  It is a great thing that the Bill provides <Col N="1731" /> for an extension of that committee, because with a greater number of people available to deal with schemes, certain delays will be cut out, and it will be possible to get industries started within a reasonable time.  It will not be a case, as in the past, of people growing old before they know whether a scheme is going to be turned down or accepted.</P>
    <P>If the attitude of the banks here had been what it should have been and, what it has been in other countries, there would not be, perhaps, the great necessity for this Bill.  Owing to the attitude of the banks and the attitude of certain individuals who, to a great extent, controlled the finances of the country, it is of the utmost importance that this Bill should become law with all possible haste.  I believe the Bill will lead to an increase in the production of the necessaries of life for the people, and will certainly increase employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any special point arising out of the discussion which it is necessary that I should deal with at any length. Senator Jameson referred to the necessity for publicity in relation to activities under the Bill.  There is adequate provision for such publicity at the present time, as a quarterly return of all loans guaranteed, and the circumstances of the loans, is published for the Dáil and Seanad.  There is also an annual return of the position in respect of each of these guarantees, particularly when advances from the Central Fund have to be made on foot of guarantees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane suggested that the widening of the powers which this Bill contemplates may leave the Minister for Industry and Commerce open to political pressure in relation to applications for trade loan guarantees. It has been my experience that pressure of that kind is very rarely exercised in relation to these applications. Even if it were exercised it would probably be of very little avail because no Minister can arrange by <Col N="1732" /> himself for the issuing of a guarantee. In the first place, the application has to be considered by the advisory committee, which we assume is immune from political influence and is, I think, likely to remain so.  If the application is rejected by the advisory committee, that is the end of it.  Of 163 applications referred to the advisory committee only 65 were recommended by the committee.  Almost 100 were rejected by the committee, and having been rejected by it they stopped there.  It has been the practice in the past, and it will certainly be the practice in the future, that where an application is not recommended by the committee the Minister for Industry and Commerce will not take it up against the committee's recommendation.  Of the 65 which were recommended by the committee, only 18 got to the point of having the guarantee given which is, I think, an indication that the recommendation of the committee is not in itself sufficient to get the guarantee. There is a long, weary stage to be travelled from that point before the guarantee is given.</P>
    <P>In the first place the Minister for Industry and Commerce has to be satisfied that the industry is likely to be a success, that the information furnished is accurate and that the proposal is in accord with his general policy.  If, for example, the industry proposed to be established were of a kind that there was no need for a new development in it then, presumably, the State would not take the responsibility of guaranteeing a loan to such an industry.  Even if the Minister for Industry and Commerce were satisfied the applicant has not yet got to the post.  His application has to go before the Department of Finance, which naturally looks at it from the financial viewpoint.  It would cause surprise if the number of applications which fail to get over that stile were made known.  Even after the application has been before the Department of Finance and the loan has got the sanction of the Minister there, it is not yet finished because in the course of its travels through State departments it has had conditions attached to it.  In that form it goes back to the applicant. <Col N="1733" /> He may not like the conditions that have been attached to it, and consequently he starts all over again with a new application which goes to the advisory committee.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned when introducing the Bill, firms have been known to have gone bankrupt or to have disappeared altogether before a decision on their applications was given.  My impression is that there were so many safeguards inserted in these Acts that the possibility of success in relation to an application was very remote. The possibility of a firm succeeding in getting a guarantee for a loan and of making good under all the conditions and limitations associated with the guarantee was very remote indeed. Of the £215,000 lost by the late Administration, £170,000 was lost on three applications: the glass bottle works, the fresh meat factory, and Alesbury Brothers.  It is my opinion that if the Act under which the guarantees were given in each of these cases, contained the provisions in this Bill&mdash;if the Minister dealing with the applications had the power which I propose should be conferred under this Bill&mdash;then not one of these three applications would have been handled in the precise manner in which it was handled, and I think that the prospects of failure would have been obviated. At any rate a considerably smaller amount would have been lost.</P>
    <P>It was the absence of powers to deal with these three cases in the precise manner in which they should have been dealt with that, in the long run, produced failure.  The merits of these cases were discussed in the Seanad before.  They were certainly discussed in the Dail and before the Public Accounts Committee so that it is not necessary to go into them now.  In matters of this kind it is very much better to have freedom to deal with them in the manner in which they should be dealt with than be tied up with all sorts of limitations like a man who gets caught in heavy traffic.  If the engine of his car has a governor on it limiting its speed, then he is much more likely to be involved in an accident than if he could get out of a difficult corner rapidly.  In what we <Col N="1734" /> are proposing here&mdash;widening the powers available under the Act&mdash;we are reducing the risk rather than increasing it.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson referred to Section 5 and expressed himself as rather disappointed with the interpretation I gave of it.  One of the principal objections to giving loans instead of guarantees is that we could not possibly lend money at as low a rate of interest as a person could borrow it from a bank on foot of a State guarantee.  In any event, there is no precise reason why a loan should be given rather than a guarantee if there is no difficulty about financing a guarantee.  It would only be in the event of a difficulty arising, in very special cases, that the section would come into operation.  I agree fully with him that it is necessary that steps should be taken by the State to ensure that money will be available for investment in Irish industry.  Irish industrialists require financial accommodation of three kinds: the ordinary day to day accommodation which is ordinarily provided by the joint stock banks.  We have no reason to think that the banks will not continue to give that type of accommodation for the financing of industrial processes. Then there is the long term loan provided under the Trade Loans Act. It is repayable at the end of a fixed period, and is subject to a definite rate of interest.  That is an entirely different type of accommodation from that which is given in the case of overdrafts. The money there can be recalled, and the rate of interest may fluctuate.  Certain industrialists will require for development purposes long term loans repayable over a fixed period, and at a fixed rate of interest. They will be expected to have the loan wiped off at the end of the period fixed.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other industrial concerns that require more particularly to have capital invested in their undertakings, such capital to be remunerated out of profits and in proportion to the profits made.  There is a great reluctance on the part of the average private investor in the Free State to invest in an industrial company here unless he happens to be personally acquainted with the persons <Col N="1735" /> associated with it, or to be in some way himself directly associated with it. If he has no knowledge of the undertaking except what he learns from the prospectus he is very reluctant to invest in the industry.  A prospectus about a gold mine in China would be more likely to attract him though he would generally lose more on that.  In order to get over that particular difficulty, the difficulty which arises when there is no effective way by which a private investor can be brought into touch with an industry requiring capital, certain steps will have to be taken.  That, however, is a matter that may involve legislation and can await discussion until it comes before the Oireachtas.  This measure merely provides for long-term loan accommodation, the accommodation required by a particular concern without involving any change in the ownership of the concern&mdash;such accommodation as may be required, for instance, to finance extensions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Quirke it has been the practice only to give guarantees in respect of loans where these loans amounted to not more than 50 per cent. of the total capital to be invested in the undertaking.  That has been the practice.  It is a practice that can be departed from on occasions when circumstances seem to justify it, but it would definitely have to be the policy to ensure that those seeking loans would themselves have a definite financial interest in the success of the enterprise.  The State cannot put in money and simply trust to luck as to a particular thing being a success.  Neither can the State put in people to ensure that it will be a success, to take a practical day to day interest in the management. We have got to rely on the other party to make it a success.  The State cannot place that reliance in an enterprise unless it feels that the other party stands to lose at least as much as the State if it turns out to be a failure.</P>
    <P>I am told of all the individuals having brains, but no money, who cannot <Col N="1736" /> get assistance under this Bill.  If there are any such in the country they have got to consider whether they cannot get money, first by becoming national school teachers, joining the Labour Party, or winning a prize in the Sweep.  They will have to consider some of the numerous ways by which fortunes can be accumulated. At all events, they will have to make a start in accumulating a financial interest in a concern before they can get the assistance they require under this Bill.</P>

      <P>The necessity for this Bill has arisen from the unsatisfactory financial position of a number of the approved societies which are administering the National Health Insurance Acts.  There are at present 65 of these societies one of which is subdivided into 19 branches.  Each <Col N="1737" /> society is a separate entity entrusted with the administration of health insurance for its own members.  It has its own income derived from the contributions of its members and from the interest on any funds it has accumulated and from the State grant which is two-ninths of its expenditure on benefits and administration.  It has on the other hand its own expenditure&mdash;payments of benefits to members and payments for cost of administration.  The amount which can be expended on administration is limited to 4/5 per member per annum.  Every five years each society is valued by a valuer appointed by the Minister for Finance and the Acts contain provisions for dealing with any surplus or deficiency which may be disclosed.  If there is a surplus which the valuer certifies as disposable&mdash;that it can be spent without endangering the power of the society to provide enough to meet the disablement and maternity benefits, then that surplus can be expended on additional benefits during an ensuing five years period under schemes sanctioned by the Minister.  Benefits given in this way are, for example, dental, optical and hospital benefits.</P>
      <P>If on the other hand the society shows a deficiency the position is more complicated.  It has in the first instance a reserve fund to fall back on known as its contingencies fund. Each society has a contingencies fund which has been accumulating during the five years covered by the valuation from a small fraction of each contribution paid in respect of its members.  The society's contingencies fund is used as a first reserve to meet the deficiency.  If this is not sufficient there is a second reserve fund known as the National Health Insurance Central Fund.  This fund has been derived partly from State grants and partly from a fraction of each contribution paid in respect of members of all societies, but no contributions have been made to it in recent years and it actually stands with accumulated interest at about £120,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This fund is available to meet a <Col N="1738" /> deficiency still remaining in any society after its own contingencies fund has been exhausted, if the society can show that the deficiency is due to any special cause beyond the control of the society, e.g., abnormal sickness among the members due to their employment or environment or other physical condition, or any epidemic disease.  If a deficiency still remains which is not met by the society's own contingencies fund or by a grant out of the central fund, the Acts provide that such deficiency must be met by increasing the contributions for the members of that society or by reducing the benefits.  The latter could be effected either by reducing the amount of the payment or by reducing the period for which the benefit is payable.</P>
    <P>With these facts in mind we can now examine the results of the three valuations which have so far been held, the valuation dates being 31st December, 1918, 31st December, 1923 and 31st December, 1928.  The 1918 valuation does not give a clear indication as regards the position in the Free State, because at that time many Irish insured persons were members of British societies and <i>vice versa.</i> After the Treaty, however, a clear cut as regards funds and membership was effected and the valuations in 1923 and 1928 show the results as they affected all Free State insured persons. In 1923 there were 79 societies and 20 branches.  72 societies and 20 branches showed a surplus amounting in the aggregate to £626,811, and seven societies showed a deficiency of £13,613.  There was, therefore, a net surplus of £613,648.  At first sight this looks a very favourable result, but in fact a sum of £370,000 had been carried forward from the previous valuation period and some societies, which prior to the separation from Great Britain had been international, profited more from the division of funds which occurred when the sepration was effected than the claims experience of their own members would justify.  On making allowance for these items the actual surplus earned in the five years period 1919-1923 was only £50,000.</P>
    <P>At the 1923 valuation, 55 societies <Col N="1739" /> showed a surplus of £513,626 and 10 societies were in deficiency to the extent of £51,268.  The net surplus was, therefore, £462,358 and as there had been a carry forward from the previous valuation which with interest amounted to £510,000 it followed that there was a loss on the five year period 1923-28 of £50,000.</P>
    <P>The Irish Insurance Commissioners, who were then in office, were, therefore, faced with a position which was obviously deteriorating, a profit of £50,000 in the period 1918-23 had been converted into a loss of £50,000 in the period 1923-28.  The expenditure on benefits had also been increasing to a somewhat alarming extent; it had risen from £439,000 in 1923 to £686,000 in 1928, and in the circumstances the Commissioners felt that the next valuation due at the end of 1933 might disclose a position which the existing reserve funds would be insufficient to meet.  They decided, therefore, to ask the actuary for a forecast of the position and they put before him all the available figures.  These figures were unfortunately, borne out by the actuary's forecast.  He estimated that certain societies will show surpluses aggregating £335,000, while other societies will show deficiencies aggregating £510,000.  To meet this deficiency of £510,000 in these societies there are their own contingencies funds, which will amount to £110,000 and the national health insurance central fund of £120,000, so that there would still be a deficiency of £280,000 unprovided for, and yet if all the funds were available for all the members the national health insurance scheme as a whole would be solvent because against the ultimate deficiency of £280,000 there is the surplus of £335,000 in the other societies together with their contingencies funds, which amount to £70,000, leaving a balance on the right side of £125,000.</P>
    <P>Under the existing provisions of the Acts, however, there would be no remedy for the societies in deficiency except to raise the contributions or reduce the benefits for their members. In other words, although the scheme as a whole would be solvent at the 31st <Col N="1740" /> December, 1933, it would be divided into two groups of societies, one of which would have more than was required to pay the statutory benefits, whilst the other would have to impose reduced benefits on its members.  This anomalous position has entirely arisen from the grouping of insured persons into a large number of separate approved societies.  These groupings have no relation to national health insurance as such.  They vary very much in size, ranging in membership from 90 to 90,000.  They also vary very much in character&mdash;insured persons being grouped according to trades, skilled and unskilled; professions, religion, temperance, and so forth. The membership of very few societies is representative of the general body of insured persons, and the whole scheme, instead of being a national scheme, is composed of a number of separate units, differing widely from one another in their experience as regards the two main factors of insurance, i.e., contribution income and sickness experience.</P>
    <P>Those societies which are composed of members with steady employment producing a good contribution income, and with healthy occupations, resulting in a small sickness experience, naturally show much better valuation results than those where employment is uncertain and the conditions of employment detrimental to health, and the divergence between the two classes of societies has gradually become marked until the present stage has been reached.  The Bill proposes to set aside this anomalous grouping by providing that all insured persons will be members of the same society and that the existing societies will cease to function.  This proposal of unification is not new.  It was one of the recommendations made by the Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance and Medical Services which was appointed in 1924.</P>
    <P>The advantages of unification are two-fold.  In the first place, it will produce a really national scheme in which all insured persons will be on precisely equal terms.  If a surplus is disclosed on valuation they will all share alike in any additional benefits <Col N="1741" /> provided.  Secondly, it will be possible to have a more efficient and more economic system of administration under one society with one central staff instead of 65 societies, each with its own officials.  The administration of benefits will be uniform and governed by the same standards for all insured persons. The small part-time agency system will be reorganised so as to allow of a large number of whole-time agents, permitting better supervision of and closer and earlier attention to members. In the cost of central administration substantial economies will accrue not only in the headquarters staff but also in allied services, including audit and valuation.</P>
    <P>With one small exception the Bill is confined in scope to the provisions necessary for bringing about this change.  It establishes a unified society to which the engagements of all the existing societies and branches will be transferred, and of which all insured persons will be members.  During a transitional period of not more than three years the society will be governed by a provisional committee of three persons appointed by the Minister, and to them will fall the duty of setting up the society and taking over at convenient dates the assets and liabilities of the various societies.  It will not be practicable to take over all the societies at once, and different dates will be fixed for different societies. They will arrange for the acquisition of premises which will be the headquarters of the society, and will appoint a secretary and treasurer subject to the sanction of the Minister.  They will also draw up rules for the administration of the affairs of the unified society, and will provide for the election of representatives of insured persons on the committee of management which is to succeed them in the government of the society at the end of the transitional period.</P>
    <P>As soon as the unified society is in full working order the provisional committee will hand over the administration of the society to a committee of management composed of 15 persons, namely three trustees appointed by the <Col N="1742" /> Minister, nine persons representative of insured persons and three persons appointed by the Minister to represent employers of insured persons.  The next valuation is due to take place as at the end of the present year, and although it will not be possible to have all the existing societies transferred to the unified society at that date, the Bill provides that the valuation will be made on the same basis as if the transfers had been effected.  In other words, the members and the assets and liabilities of all societies, whether transferred or not will be deemed to be assets and liabilities of the unified society at the date of valuation, and any surplus or deficiency disclosed will be dealt with as a surplus or deficiency of the unified society.  As regards societies which have at present additional benefit schemes, the rights of members to such additional benefits are preserved until the date at which the schemes will ordinarily terminate.  In the process of unification certain officials of existing approved societies will necessarily be displaced.</P>

      <P>Apparently the Senator is bent on having the last word.  The Bill enables the unified society to pay compensation on reasonable terms to persons so displaced who fulfil certain qualifying conditions and who are not taken into the employment of the unified society.  The compensation will be by way of gratuity and will be payable to all secretaries of approved societies, all whole-time employees and all part-time employees who are mainly dependent for their livelihood on their earnings from health insurance.  Qualified persons who have less than five years' service will get one-fifth of their annual remuneration for each year's service.  Those who have five or more years' service will get one-sixth of their annual remuneration for each year of service.  In calculating the years of <Col N="1743" /> service in the latter case, and addition of one year will be made for each two completed years of service with a maximum of ten added years.  The payment for compensation will be a charge on the administration account of the unified society.  The amount required may be borrowed from the health insurance fund and repaid, with interest, by instalments over a period of years.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains clauses of a technical nature dealing with St. James's Gate Health Insurance Society and with the Dublin United Tramways and Omnibus Employees' Health Insurance Society which were approved as Employers' Provident Funds and which require special treatment in view of the fact that the employers were responsible for the solvency of the societies' funds.  It is proposed that health insurance will, in future, be entirely divorced from all forms of commercial insurance.  The unified society will deal with no business other than that of health insurance, and the Bill requires that all persons connected with the society, whether as members of the Committee of Management, as officers or as ordinary employees, will transact no insurance business of any other kind.  It is to the best interest of insured persons that those who are directly dealing with their health insurance should give undivided allegiance to that business and should have no occasion to further the interests of commercial insurance.</P>
      <P>The only other matter dealt with in the Bill is a change in the powers given to referees who hear appeals under Section 67 of the National Insurance Act, 1911.  Under that section the referee appointed is given power to hear and decide any appeal submitted to him.  It is proposed that in future the power of decision shall vest in the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry that the present Administration has sponsored this Bill.  It is a direct violation of everything they said during the elections about their Christian social aims.  I am positively amazed, when <Col N="1744" /> I hear the figures from the Parliamentary Secretary, and I will ask Senators to bear this in mind: The Parliamentary Secretary told us that this recommendation arose out of a Committee of Inquiry set up in 1924. A valuation had taken place, I think, up to 31st December, 1923.  Is that right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures, at that time, revealed a surplus.  Another valuation was taken in 1928, and 53 societies&mdash;I am not quite certain that the figures are absolutely accurate, but I think they are substantially accurate&mdash;showed a surplus of £513,625, and ten societies showed a deficit of £51,286, leaving a surplus of approximately £463,000, but by reason of certain other considerations the Parliamentary Secretary tells us that if you took all the figures into consideration that £462,000 surplus would really mean a deficit of some £50,000.  He told us, however, in the next sentence, that during the period from 1923 to 1928 benefits had risen from £439,000 in 1923 to £686,000 in 1928 so that, in fact&mdash;and let the Parliamentary Secretary and his bureaucracy disguise this as they like &mdash;the effect of this is to curtail the benefits.  The benefits were accruing too largely and too quickly&mdash;that is what is behind this Bill.  Those figures will be in the Official Report, and anybody who is capable of understanding figures will see that the figures the Parliamentary Secretary has given us blow all his pretentions about efficiency and economy sky high. If you put it as a business man would put it in figures, it means that the insured persons have got, in the interval from 1923 to 1928, £247,000 increase of benefit at a cost of £50,000. Let the Parliamentary Secretary try to reply to that when he comes to answer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be perfectly ready to admit that it was a pity, in the first instance, when national health insurance was established, that there were so many small sectional societies approved but when, on the Parliamentary Secretary's <Col N="1745" /> own figures, 53 of them, on the last valuation, have shown a surplus as against ten showing a deficit, the disadvantages are very much less than I had anticipated.  I cannot help contrasting the difference as between giving benefits to insured persons and collecting income tax.  There is no unification there, you know.  They want efficiency, and real efficiency, there, so they have inspectors and collectors all over the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>There is practically one management at the present time but, from all the reports that I hear, you can take it that the local inspector of taxes reserves to himself the right of private judgment to a very large extent.  I submit, however, that there is no justification, on the figures, for this Bill.  In fact, if you examine the figures closely, you will find the exact opposite.  I have no doubt that the fund will be kept in credit and in surplus for the future, but at a loss of benefit to the insured persons.  I had one example of how those things were done.  We are told here, and the public are told, that there are pensions for blind people but there is one doctor to examine all the blind people in Ireland.  There is one referee from the Department&mdash;the Minister himself told me, because I went to him with a case in which a certificate had been given by the local medical person.  It was in cold print and it was approved, but he said that, if the person who alleges he is blind, did not get it, he could appeal, but if, on the other hand, it is the Ministry or the local authority who appeals&mdash;I do not know exactly which it is does appeal&mdash;the appeal is to be adjudged by a doctor appointed by the Local Government Department.  I can see that cases of that sort will arise very frequently in the administration of this Act where you have a really bureaucratic control in Dublin and the local agent in a very subordinate and uninfluential position in comparison to his position now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, of course, likes to use nice kind words, <Col N="1746" /> but when anybody finds his position summarily terminated, I call it dismissal. He can call it displacement, if he likes.  He has given the House a certain scale of so-called compensation which is to be paid.  If it is efficiency to create unemployment by throwing on to the scrap heap any person who has been for ten or twelve years in such an occupation and who has reached the age of 40, the less of that sort of efficiency we have the better.  We have a number of business people in this House.  I should like to know how many private firms could not dismiss, or displace, or supersede, if they are nicer words, one, two or three employees with a little gratuity and go on as at present but, thank God, business people are not so soulless. This, to my mind, is a negation of everything the Government spoke of and advocated at the last election.  I sincerely trust this Bill will be defeated.</P>

      <P>I think we could have done without this Bill.  It is rationalisation. That was popular a few years ago, but it is not popular now.  I should like to know how many persons are going to be superseded and how many gratuitants will we have, as a result of this measure of rationalisation? I wonder does the Minister realise what a hardship it is to a person, who is in employment, to be suddenly thrown out of employment with a gratuity of one-fifth or one-sixth of his salary for each year of service?  I should also like to know if there is any provision to be made for giving employment to those people who are to be put out of employment?  I think rationalisation has gone too far and I think we could do very well without this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must differ with the two Senators who have spoken.  Personally, I would hate to see anybody put out of employment, but when a Senator says that the beneficiaries under this Bill feel, when they are paying their instalments, the same temper that we all feel when paying income tax, I think there is something wrong with the existing measure. After all, you must bear in mind that <Col N="1747" /> the State and the employer have to make similar contributions to the funds of any society as the beneficiary under the Act pays, and it should, therefore, be a very good bargain for any member of an insurance society to be connected with one of them.  I do not think that that feeling exists amongst these members.  I do not think that they believe they are getting the full benefit and I think the Minister will be able to tell us how many dismissals or displacements are likely to take place because of this measure and in what direction added benefits will be given to the people who are insured under it.  Of course, sometimes these amalgamations turn out very differently from what is expected. Most people thought that, when the railways were amalgamated, it would be very helpful to the community, to the shareholders and to the employees.</P>

      <P>It may happen that this may turn out to be such an amalgamation as the railways amalgamation proved to be, but, on the face of it, it certainly looks to be a great attraction for the beneficiaries under the insurance scheme.  I think that Senators who opposed this measure ought to be able to show us where the benefits to the insured contributors will be curtailed in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us is being opposed by those who are nominally and usually supporters of the Government on the ground that it is bureaucratic and that it runs against the policy of decentralisation which the Government is said to have advocated at the last election and ever since.  I think that it is a fair charge that the Bill runs against the trend of policy which the supporters of the Government advocated up and down the country in various walks of life and in various aspects of public affairs.  I venture to say that, as time goes on, such advocacy will be belied by actual experience in most other affairs, as in this affair.  I think that it is inevitable in modern life that with the inter-communication <Col N="1748" /> and economy due to centralisation of administration both in industry and in the administration of social affairs, the tendency will be towards centralisation. It will be very hard to resist, even if it is desirable to resist, that tendency.  The experience of a few years will show the supporters of the present Government that they will not be able to resist that tendency. It would be wiser to take that fact into account and guide the affairs of State with the knowledge that that will be a tendency which it will be impossible to prevent.</P>
      <P>I remember the initiation of this scheme very well.  Many of us in the Labour movement were very doubtful and very critical of the proposal to have large numbers of different societies of varying class and character. We were in favour of a centralised system.  I remember one man, who later became a national hero, saying it was very clever and astute of Mr. Lloyd George, who was then promoting the scheme, to throw the onus of refusing benefit upon the societies, particularly the societies working through local officials, and to take all the kudos himself. The way that scheme worked out was to throw into one, two, or half dozen societies large numbers of what might be called &ldquo;bad lives,&rdquo; and to reserve the good lives for selective societies.  You cannot call that a national scheme of insurance.  If Senator Dowdall could confine himself to a particular class of risk in insurance he would, undoubtedly, do well.  He could make very low offers of premiums if he could select good lives and low risks.  But in this scheme, supposed to be a national scheme, there was a tendency to segregate and to convert it into a non-national scheme&mdash;to throw the bad lives into a few societies, and reserve the good lives for the other societies.  That was the negation of a national scheme of health insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Crosbie made an analogy with the railways.  I should like to remind him that, from the point of view of management, consolidation of the railways led to a very large saving in administrative expenses.  Because of that, I think that the way the Bill proposes to deprive large numbers of <Col N="1749" /> those who have been partially earning a livelihood, of the opportunity to earn that livelihood, is unfair and unwise. If they are, in the railway phrase, &ldquo;proved to be redundant,&rdquo; they should be reasonably compensated.  However, that is a matter on which we shall have discussion on more than one occasion between now and the Final Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that Senator Dowdall and others are right in criticising this Bill as leading to a bureaucracy that does not at present exist.  Doubtless, there are local societies and trade union societies, run locally, in which there is a certain amount of personal contact and knowledge of the members by the management.  But much the larger number of people insured in health insurance societies are just as bureaucratically managed to-day as they will be under this scheme.  Let Senators consider the position of the health insurance societies attached to big friendly societies, and find out where they are managed from and what kind of bureaucracy exists in these societies. Is it an improvement on the bureaucracy which we can anticipate under a national scheme, as proposed in this Bill?  I am still doubtful whether there is anything in the Bill which inevitably prevents the establishment of local advisory committees.  I do not say that that is contemplated, but I see nothing in the Bill to prevent that.  That brings me to the point that I think it would have been very much better if the Minister had submitted to the Oireachtas, in presenting the Bill, the proposed rules of the society which, I have no doubt, are already in type but which, under the Bill, are intended to be made by the provisional committee and, presumably, imposed on the new membership.  At the initiation of the old scheme, there was a great cry raised regarding the fact that the membership would control the society. We know how that has been done in respect of the large societies.  Some societies are governed by the members at aggregate meeting.  Matters affecting the constitution of the management committee, changes of rules and so forth, are dealt with at aggregate meetings of the members. <Col N="1750" /> Other societies are managed by delegate meetings.  Imagine a society of 90,000 persons being governed by aggregate meetings!  In other countries there is a very much larger membership than that.  Senators will realise that the pretence at democratic management in these cases has gone by the board.  There is no reality in it.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is the intention under this scheme as regards the management of the society by the members.  The provisional committee is to make rules for the election of a management committee.  Presumably, the rules may be altered in the dim and distant future when the society is finally established.  The Oireachtas should have before it the rules under which it is intended to govern the society, in the first instance, and it should not be left to the provisional committee to make and impose the rules upon the new membership.  We ought to know what scheme is in mind in regard to the government of the society by the members.  Nominally, the members are to govern the society but how is that going to be effected? Is it to be effected by local elections or by the pretence of aggregate meeting? Surely, we ought to have that information when dealing with the Second Stage of the Bill.  We ought to have some idea of the intention in regard to this matter, because I have no doubt that the Minister or the Committee has clearly in mind what is proposed to be done.  If that is not so, I do not think that the society should come into operation until the provisional committee has formulated its proposed rules and laid them on the Table, so that the House can discuss them.  I think that it is unfair and unreasonable to take the present members of the health insurance societies, many of whom have a distinct part to play in the election of their management committees and in the governance of their society, and deprive them of that power and responsibility, imposing upon them the obligation to be members of a new society as to the rules of which they know nothing and will know nothing.  As to what powers they will have in the future, they know nothing and will know nothing until the <Col N="1751" /> change over shall have been effected. I think that that is a fault in the presentation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I think, too, that we ought to be provided with much more statistical information as to the financial position of the various societies.  The Minister has given us figures as to the position in 1928.  We are told also that the present position has been submitted to actuaries and that the actuaries have reported.  It is fairly well known within the societies that the actuarial position has greatly deteriorated since 1928, mainly because of the generally bad position regarding unemployment and the sickness which accompanies unemployment.  Anybody who knows anything about this business knows that a man will decline to go on health insurance for a long time after he should have ceased work.  He would much rather work in sickness and earn his full wages than go on to health insurance and lose the difference between the benefits and his wages. Consequently, men work on when they ought to be under the care of the doctor.  With the growth of unemployment there has been a great increase in the number of sick cases.  We also know that many men&mdash;and perhaps more women&mdash;find their way almost automatically, when unemployed insurance benefit has ceased, on to health insurance benefit, so that the so called prosperous days from 1928 to 1931 did not preclude very great growth in unemployment and loss to the health insurance societies.  The deterioration took place in those years but that does not prove bad administration.  I do not know to what extent people suggest that the societies are suffering deficiencies because of bad administration. I think they are suffering to a very small extent, indeed from that cause.  Rather have the societies suffered because they have fulfilled their statutory duty.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that there has been in many cases generosity on the part of the medical profession, probably due also, in the main, to their human sympathy and knowledge <Col N="1752" /> that a man or woman actually needs health insurance benefit, and the doctor's aid that would be forthcoming. But too often, also, I think doctors have been rather remiss and careless in the way they distributed their certificates.  I do not know what way that would be remedied under the new scheme.  To a considerable extent it will probably be remedied. In the formulation of rules, to some extent, provision might be made for local committees, which would be able to maintain that personal interest and knowledge that some societies have been so proud of and have done so well.  I see nothing in the scheme as presented to us yet that would prevent that.  On the whole the position that Senator Dowdall deplores could not have been remedied without some kind of centralised organisation.  If this scheme, or some other scheme of the same nature, had not been brought forward you would have some societies &mdash;considerable societies&mdash;having to increase contributions or to reduce benefits and, to that extent, done damage to their membership, which comprises a very considerable share of the total membership in the country.</P>
    <P>The clauses relating to compensation for disturbance and for redundance will have to be examined critically and closely, and I hope the Senate will express a view that there should be more reasonable consideration given to the position of these men who are, by an Act, being deprived of the butter for their bread.  While 5/-, 7/- or 10/- a week may not seem much to lose, it is a very great deal to people earning 30/- or £2.  These men are going to be deprived in considerable numbers of that earning.  I hope something will be done, at least, to remedy their cases.  Senator Dowdall stated that we could have done with out this Bill.  We could, but I do not know for how long.  I think for a very short time.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of this <Col N="1753" /> question of health insurance that I think the new society should take greatly to heart.  It is a complaint in the great English societies as well as in the societies here, that too little has been done with that part of the scheme which contemplated the preventive side of health insurance, the prevention of sickness through sanatorium treatment and convalescent homes.  That kind of work ought to have been done to a very much greater degree than it has been done, and I think that State health insurance might, at the beginning, do it with very much greater effect, and with better results, by a unified society, than by a large number of smaller societies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill &ldquo;the appointed day&rdquo; may be fixed by the Minister at a date not more than three years after the passing of the Act.  That means that during that period the unified society should be worked and administered by a committee of three trustees appointed by the Minister, so that for three years, if he takes full advantage of the time at his disposal, the whole business of health insurance shall be worked by three people without the subscribers having any voice whatever in the administration of the funds.  The period seems to me to be excessive, and quite too long and unnecessary. I think an earlier period than that should be decided upon.  The powers entrusted to the provisional committee are very far-reaching, and as far as the Oireachtas is concerned there is no control over the rules, regulations and arrangements they make.  The well-being of the members will be to a large extent governed by what they do during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to centralisation, I think that would be rendered necessary in the long run by the force of circum stances, but I hope, as a result, that there is not going to be a hardening of the attitude of the societies towards members applying for benefit. The general experience has been that the bigger the society the more difficult has been the task of members <Col N="1754" /> generally entitled to benefit getting it. Delays, objections, and very unnecessary restrictions have been, in many cases that came under my notice, imposed on members, and a considerable amount of hardship has resulted.  I am afraid that the tendency will be towards a development of that hardness.  Considered from that point of view it is not going, to that extent, to benefit the individual member.</P>
    <P>At this stage I want to say a few words with regard to the question of compensation for the employees of existing societies.  Presumably this Bill is brought in in the interests of the insured members, and, to that extent, in the interests of the community. Employees who have worked these societies, some of them exceedingly well and efficiently, have certain rights to compensation for the livelihood that is being torn from them.  In the Bill the Minister has decided on a form of compensation that I, at all events, have never seen embodied in any Bill.  It is a complicated and meaningless form of giving compensation, and takes the form of a gratuity of a limited sum, irrespective of the services.  Let us see how it works out. Take the case of a man who has 20 years' service with an approved society. If his average salary was £200 for the last five years, the total amount he is entitled to is a lump sum of £1,000. He cannot very well hope to get employment outside in the present state of industry, so he must try to live on that £1,000.  If he invests it in present-day conditions, he will be very lucky if he can get £35 per annum upon which he will have to live.  Take the Railways Act, and the Railways Bill which we passed to-day, where compensation is given to a man with the same service and with the same salary.  He would get if rendered redundant a pension of £100 a year for life.  No member of this or the other House will say that that is an extravagant amount of compensation.  Moreover the railwayman will have his compensation based on his salary for the last year, and rightly so, because it is what you are depriving him of, and not on what a man had three years <Col N="1755" /> ago or five years ago that compensation is given.  The salary ought to be that during the last year, and presumably that is a salary that would continue to increase.  Under this Bill it is proposed to take the average salary for the last five years, so that although a man might retire on £200, the actual salary upon which his compensation would be based might be £170 or £180. There is no arbitrator.  If the man is not satisfied, or if he raises any question regarding compensation, the Minister is to decide.  For very obvious reasons that is a most unsatisfactory type of arbitrator.  Under these circumstances I do not think due regard has been had to the rights of the men, some of whom have given the best part of their lives to this type of employment, who are now being deprived of that employment in communal interests, and left pretty well to starve. The majority of them will have just enough to get on for a couple of years and then must fend for themselves. Instead of doing what was done in most amalgamations, the whole of the employees of the amalgamated unit becoming in the first instance employees of the new authority, in this case everyone is dismissed the moment the transfer takes place.  The wording of the section is:</P>
    <P>the services of all persons engaged in the administration of health insurance business carried on by such society shall be terminated.</P>
    <P>A start is made by dismissing everyone immediately on transfer and then considering taking on some.  In relation to amalgamation what happens is this, that every employee of the old company becomes automatically an employee of the new company, until the management looks around to see what staff is required.  They know the most suitable of the existing staff they had working under them and what they were able to do.  They retained as many as they found necessary and discharged and compensated those for whom they had no work.  On general principles that would be a more satisfactory line to go on than this drastic method of dismissing everyone and <Col N="1756" /> then letting them go and fight for compensation. If there is a dispute they can go to the Minister from whom there is no appeal on a question of law to the courts.  I think this is an exceedingly drastic way to deal with men who have just the same rights as railwaymen or anyone else.</P>
    <P>There are a number of part-time employees, however, for whom there is no consideration, unless they can show that their income from this business was their principal means of livelihood.  In other words if a man was drawing £80 from some employer, and drawing £75 from a national health insurance approved society, he could get no compensation because insurance work was not his principal means of livelihood. Some people have been able to carry on with what they got from the insurance society, and from other employment, but neither salary alone was sufficient to enable them to make a livelihood.  If a man loses one employment now he gets no compensation.  I agree that some secretaries of societies could very well afford to live on the salaries they got from some other employment.  Presumably it is in order to get at those people that some very worthy employees are going to be hit. It would be better and it would make it easier in other directions if the deserving were not punished in order to get at the undeserving cases.  I hope that when amendments are tabled the Minister will receive them more sympathetically than he did in the other House.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I was not here for the opening of this debate.  I was engaged elsewhere. I gather that Senator Dowdall suggested that the Bill was unnecessary, and that national health insurance could very well have gone <Col N="1757" /> on as it was.  If I may say so, I think the Senator can hardly have realised the position in which a considerable number of societies were.  It is certain that if the present system continued a number of societies would have found themselves in the position that they could not pay benefits and, for all practical purposes, they would go bankrupt.  They could not meet their obligations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but as the Senator is aware, the figures since 1928 have not improved.  Since 1928 the tendency has been for societies in deficiency to get worse and worse, and for other societies unfortunately to join them.  The anticipation was that by the end of this quinquennial period, when the next actuarial valuation was made, the societies in deficiency would be more numerous and that the whole condition would be bad.  We were faced with such a position that we had to take steps to secure that everybody entitled to go into national health insurance and who wished to do so would be secured the benefits they are entitled to under the Act.  We had to do that&mdash;any Government that would be here would have had to face that position.  I frankly admit that I have not had very considerable experience of national health insurance myself, but anyone in my position has to take the advice of those who are and have been from the beginning closely associated with national health insurance work.  We debated this matter over a long period with the officials concerned.  This Bill is the result of our discussions with them.  We had a full investigation into the whole circumstances.  We decided first of all that it was absolutely necessary that a step of this kind should be taken. <Col N="1758" /> Then we discussed the lines on which we should go, and these are set out in the Bill.  No doubt on the Committee Stage Senators will suggest amendments.  Perhaps they will improve the Bill, but that remains to be seen.  I myself think that the Bill as it stands is as good a measure as we can get, but that does not preclude me from saying that every amendment put forward will receive my earnest consideration.  I will be happy to receive any suggestions that may improve the Bill in any direction and make it a more useful instrument for doing the work of national health insurance in this country and of ensuring that everybody entitled to it will be secured their benefits.</P>
      <P>We have not, as was suggested by Senator Johnson, yet drafted the rules.  There have been rough drafts made of the rules but they are by no means complete.  As Senator O'Farrell suggested, the unified society will not be brought into existence for three years after the passing of the Bill.  It will take considerable time to bring in all the societies. During that time there will be a provisional committee.  It will be one of the duties of that committee from the time it is appointed to give consideration to the question of the rules that will govern the societies.  Of course societies that have not been taken in will continue to be governed by their own rules until they are taken over.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister was not present to introduce the Bill I think, sir, that your ruling is too stringent.  I think Senators should be allowed to ask questions so that the Minister may be able to answer some points enunciated by the Parliamentary Secretary when he was speaking.</P>

      <P>The procedure on the Second Stage of a Bill is that the Minister in charge of the Bill opens and closes the debate.  After the debate has been opened, each Senator can speak once; and any Senator who has given proper consideration to the Bill beforehand should be in a position to embody in his speech such questions as he desires to raise, so that the Minister may reply to them in his closing speech.  This procedure is designed to obviate endless questions being put to the Minister on any stage of a Bill.  Procedure of that kind would lead to a great waste of time in the House and would tend to the unsatisfactory conduct of debate.  As regards Senator Dowdall's point that there has been a change in the handling of the Bill: it was introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister is closing the debate.  If the Senators see that any inconvenience is caused by that procedure, then certainly as far as my powers go I will allow questions to be put, but the position is that I am bound by rules of the debate.  These rules are very explicit. A Senator may speak only once on the Second Stage of a Bill.  I am bound by that.  If the rules are to be broken indiscriminately by Senators standing up to ask questions every time they occurred to them it would lead to a great waste of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I wish to deal with is this.  The Minister said <Col N="1760" /> the unified society could not come into operation for three years.  I would like to have that confirmed, because it is laid down in the Bill that the Minister may by order appoint a day for that not more than three years after the date of the passing of the Act.  Three years is the extreme limit, and I hope that provision will be made use of.  I hope that this measure will not come into operation for three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator, by reading the Bill, can get that information for himself.  The Minister will please continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the unified society will not be complete until the last approved society has been taken over.  We have put in the limit of three years, but I hope it will not require three years to do that.  I doubt if anybody can say what time it will require.  I hope it will not be three years.  We had to put in some period and to allow enough time to the provisional committee to do its work properly so that there would be nothing to regret afterwards.  For that reason I am not in a position to satisfy Senator Johnson, who wishes to see the rules of the society before the Bill is passed.  It is not in the province of the Minister to draft these rules.  That will be the duty and the responsibility of the provisional committee. We certainly have rules in draft, but we cannot say that these will be the rules of the unified society until they have been adopted by the competent authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson also raised a question about the local committees, and pointed out, and rightly so, that there is nothing in the Bill to prevent that.  It is quite possible that local committees will continue their work. We have an idea of having whole-time agents, men of experience in the work, in all parts of the country whose duty it will be to know every individual on their list.  They will be given just as many people to look after as they can properly look after as whole-time people.  They will have personal knowledge of every one in their areas.  They will be in intimate <Col N="1761" /> touch with them.  The agents will be in convenient places for the people, and will do the work probably as well as, some would think better than, the local committee.  At any rate, there is nothing against the local committee. If the unified society and the members of the committee of management think well of it, we certainly would not put any obstacles in the way of local committees doing similar work to what they have been doing in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose that the Seanad even could produce an absolutely perfect organisation.  There were complaints, and it was not for nothing that the Committee of Inquiry was set up.  I think it is generally agreed that the general unemployment that has developed in recent years has had a very bad effect on national health insurance: that people have <Col N="1762" /> been making use of national health insurance for unemployment purposes when their unemployment benefit had run out.  That, possibly, is one of the causes of the very heavy drain on the resources of quite a number of societies. Then there is another aspect of the case that I think was bound to come to a head sooner or later, and that is, that it is the belief of many people of experience even in insurance matters&mdash; I speak with respect to Senator Dowdall&mdash;that this manner of dealing with national health insurance is not a national way of dealing with it.</P>
      <P>As Senator Johnson said to-day, you have here a system which allows individuals to be insured by dividing them into classes, and that makes it entirely uneconomic and improper from an insurance point of view.  You have them divided into classes and communities, a system that must be uneconomic, and cannot ever be put on a proper financial basis.  That is so with regard to a certain number of the approved societies that are now working the national health insurance. We are almost bound to have a very much heavier drain on some classes of the community because of the nature of their occupations, and because societies can select the lives that they insure under the national health system.  That is a wrong system, even judged from the purely insurance point of view, and the principle that governs all ordinary life insurance and ordinary fire insurance.  The risks are selected in a way that makes certain classes of lives entirely uneconomic.  It is to remedy that state of affairs, as well as to face the difficulty caused by the financial failure of some approved societies, that this Bill was introduced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a Select Committee of seven Senators, of whom four shall <Col N="1764" /> form a quorum, be appointed to consider and take evidence upon the National Health Insurance Bill, 1933, with power to send for persons papers and records and to report its opinion for the information and assistance of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I think that the debate fully justifies this motion.  The matter is distinctly complicated.  Senator Johnson has asked for a lot of figures.  Senator Dowdall has challenged certain figures given by the Parliamentary Secretary, and further figures have been given by the Minister.  The whole matter is far too complicated for the ordinary full Committee of the House.  I, accordingly, move the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I second.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Seanad not require notice of this motion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may say so, I think the motion, if carried, would probably mean a very considerable delay in passing the measure.  If the Seanad were to set up a real thoroughgoing committee to inquire into this matter, the committee could easily spend six months or a year investigating it.  I do not know how long this body would occupy in investigating national health insurance, generally, and the conditions of the various approved societies, but a considerable time might be spent, perhaps some would think spent with advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that those who have had charge of this matter since the foundation of national health insurance, who were actually in control of it, as far as some of the individuals were concerned, all the time, have already investigated it. There was a committee appointed in 1924.  We have had the officials, who have been in charge ever since, watching the progress of the scheme and it is as a result of close investigation and a close watch on the trend of <Col N="1765" /> events, in so far as national health insurance is concerned, and of the untoward development, financially speaking, of certain societies that this Bill has been brought in.  We do not say that the matter is immediately urgent but it is fairly urgent and one that requires handling at the earliest possible date.  We think that the sooner the unified society is brought into existence, the sooner national health insurance will be put on a sound basis for all parties concerned. The longer the matter is delayed the greater the risk will be in so far as quite a number of societies are concerned. I would urge the Seanad to assist us in putting national health insurance on a proper footing at the earliest possible moment.  I do not think the Senator's suggestion would help towards that end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept a time limit but really the Minister has told us that it is going to take three years to carry all these provisions into effect.  Many of them do not require statutory sanction at all and surely concurrently with this investigation the Minister could make these arrangements.  I think we shall require a committee in order to satisfy ourselves in regard to all the details of this measure which is so involved.</P>
