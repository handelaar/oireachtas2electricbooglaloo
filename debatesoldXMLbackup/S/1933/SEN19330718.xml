      <P>A reply has been received by the Clerk from the Private Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to a letter sent by the Clerk to the Minister by my direction and at the request of the House, with reference to the misreporting of the debate in the Seanad on the wireless news from Athlone Station last Tuesday night.  Before reading the reply, I propose to read the letter sent by the Clerk, in order that the reply may be better understood.  The Clerk's letter is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad to draw your attention to a statement which was contained in the wireless news broadcast from the Athlone Station last night and which, no doubt by inadvertence, was inaccurate and misleading.  The statement in question was contained in the account of yesterday's debate in the Seanad on the Constitution (Amendment No. 19) Bill, 1933, which is the Bill which proposes to reduce to three months the period of suspension accorded to the Seanad by the Constitution.  The House was <Col N="290" /> informed of the matter to-day by Senator Douglas at the commencement of public business and the Cathaoirleach was directed by the House to communicate with you with reference to it.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the broadcast account contained a statement that the Committee responsible for the drafting of the Constitution in 1922 submitted three reports, two of which recommended that the Seanad should have power to delay legislation for six months and one of which recommended a delay of only four months.</P>
    <P>A statement to this effect was made by the President of the Executive Council in the Dáil during the progress of the Bill in question and was repeated yesterday by the Minister for Justice in the Seanad.  But it was pointed out in the course of yesterday's debate that it was incorrect to state that one of the reports of the Constitution Committee had recommended a delay of only four months, the fact being that the recommendation was that, in the case of a non-Money Bill held up by the Seanad, the Bill should be dead after four months unless a referendum had been held on it and the result thereof was favourable to the Bill.  In replying to the debate, the Minister for Justice agreed that this was so.</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the Cathaoirleach a statement made in a House of the Oireachtas which is contradicted, and the untruth of which is admitted by the person who made the statement, should not be reported, either in the wireless news or elsewhere, unless the contradiction and subsequent admission are also reported.</P>
    <P>In the case under notice, the statement that one of the reports of the Constitution Committee suggested that the Seanad should have its power limited to a delay of four months is likely to mislead the people in forming a just opinion on the merits of the Constitution (Amendment No. 19) Bill now before the House; and in the opinion of <Col N="291" /> the Cathaoirleach it would be desirable for the statement to be corrected in the broadcast news as early as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to your letter of the 12th instant relative to a news report of the proceedings in the Seanad, broadcast on the 11th instant, I am directed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to express his regret that the report in question should be regarded as having given an incorrect impression. I am to explain that all news must, of necessity, be broadcast in an abridged form and that it is impossible, therefore, to include in the summaries all points of Oireachtas debates.  The Minister agrees, however, that in a case of the kind now in question where a statement made in the early part of a debate is later amended or corrected the relative broadcast news item should be in such terms as to give a correct impression of the debates by covering the essential points thereof. The Minister has, therefore, arranged for suitable instructions to be given to the staff responsible for the preparation of the news reports and he hopes that any similar cause for complaint will not arise in future.</P>
    <P>As regards the request contained in the final paragraph of your letter, the Minister is inclined to the view that the course suggested would create a precedent which he would like to avoid, and which might involve the staff of the Broadcasting Station in future difficulties, and he trusts that the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad will share the view that in the circumstances it would be undesirable to advert now in the broadcast news to the report in question.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I want to express regret at the death of the father of the Public Hospitals Bill, the late Deputy Sir James Craig, who in face of great opposition took up the promotion of a Bill to permit sweepstakes. The name of Deputy Sir James Craig, and those associated with him, gave prestige to the project abroad, as a result of which the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes have become the biggest thing in that line in the world.  Imitations of the Irish Sweepstakes have been attempted and they have failed.  The standing of the sweepstakes here is supreme.  That being so, it is to be regretted that some of the discussions that took place on the Bill rather tended to create a certain amount of suspicion.  I hope that is finished with now.  The success of the Irish Sweepstakes is the envy of the world and we should not lend any support to anything that would encourage that suspicion. My real reason for intervening at this stage is to remind the House of a proposal that was made that housing should be included in the benefits of the Act.  The proposal was not pressed, because those who were in favour of it believed that the hospitals which originally took the risk of going into this business were entitled to benefit. I hope the Minister for Local Government, and those responsible for the sweepstakes, will now devote some attention to the housing aspect so that it might be included in the benefits of the Act.  Housing and hospitals are very closely allied.  If the slums were abolished the work of the hospitals would be very much lighter.  At the earliest possible opportunity the Minister should take advantage of the sweepstakes to provide cheap housing in order to have the slums done away with.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I should have to intervene at this stage, but that is entirely owing to the remarks that fell from the last speaker.  He suggested that the speeches in the debates on the Bill would be inclined to cast suspicion on the integrity of the <Col N="293" /> sweepstakes.  That can only be directed against me because, I think, I was the only person who made any suggestion in that respect.  I wish to deny that my remarks were, in any way, directed against the sweepstakes, or against the manner in which they are conducted.  I say now, as I said before, that I do not believe for a moment, if the full expenses were shown, and if the money now paid as commission was put as an outgoing on the opposite side of the account, that an increase of 3 or 4 per cent. would in any way affect the popularity of the sweepstakes.  I think that would be a much more satisfactory transaction.  I suggested that before, and I say it now again.</P>

      <P>Section 9, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;unless&rdquo; in line 14 to insert the words &ldquo;for the purpose of biological or scientific research and unless.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any information I have about musk rats I got in the newspapers, and from the statement made by the Minister regarding the damage these animals do.  Considering that we have some very valuable works, such as the Shannon scheme, convenient to where these rats were found, they should not be allowed into the country, except for the purpose of biological or scientific research.  There appears to be great danger in allowing them into the Zoological Gardens or other places.  I think the Seanad might agree to allow these animals in for the purpose of biological or scientific research.  The Minister and his Department will be saved a great deal of worry if, when people seek licences to bring them in he could point out that the law had been changed and that these rats were only allowed in <Col N="294" /> for research purposes.  Consequently I move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>From what I have heard, there are a number of these animals loose about the country. They are a pest and a great danger and, under no circumstances, should they be allowed in.  They should be barred from the country.  I know that the Minister will do his best, by regulation and otherwise, to keep them under strict control but I do not believe that that is possible.  If they are brought into the country, they will get loose somehow, as they have got loose in other countries.  No country has been able to keep them locked up.  I should go further than Senator Counihan and refuse to allow them into the country at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that this amendment will not serve the purpose the Senator desires.  If the section is retained as it stands, there is the possibility, as the Minister pointed out on the last occasion, that musk rats will be allowed in for the purpose of studying means of excluding them effectively and of destroying those that are here.  To insert the amendment would not add anything to the strength of the section because anybody could bring in musk rats provided he said they were for biological research and got a licence. A boy who breeds rabbits could maintain that he was engaged in biological research.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Counihan and Senator Colonel Moore are perfectly right.  What we want to <Col N="295" /> do is to keep the musk rat out of the country altogether.  To effect that, I think it would be necessary to take out a whole of the first part of Section 9 and make it an offence to keep any musk rat.  I do not think that anybody wants the musk rat brought into this country for any purpose whatever. Senator Counihan's motion does not go far enough.  We ought to alter the section so that nobody can bring a musk rat into the country under any conditions.  If science maintains that it is going to be terribly injured by that course, let the scientists put up a case and let the Minister bring in a special Bill under which musk rats will be admitted for scientific purposes.  So far as this Bill is concerned, we should do everything possible to keep musk rats out of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the view of Senator Jameson.  I happen to know the district in which these musk rats have appeared and there is a strong objection on the part of the people there to their being allowed in under any circumstances.  The way to prevent the danger is to prevent these rats coming in.  A good deal of the talk about their being allowed in because of their valuable fur is moonshine. We have enough industries with which to engage our attention without bringing in musk rats.  I entirely agree that they should not be allowed in in any shape or form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can secure his object very easily.  He says that musk rats should be admitted only to enable certain experiments to be carried out with a view to the extermination of these pests. The easiest way to secure that is for the Minister to get a few of his trappers to catch a few of the live musk rats in the country.  He can then have experiments carried out as to the best methods to be adopted for their extermination.  When all these rats have been exterminated, the problem will be ended and there will be no necessity to bring any rats in. I think that, under no circumstances, should musk rats be admitted.  In that <Col N="296" /> I agree with Senator Jameson.  I think that Senator Counihan should withdraw his amendment and have another amendment introduced which would produce that result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>What I explained on a previous occasion was that we intended only to licence the keeping of musk rats for the purpose of scientific and biological research, as mentioned by Senator Counihan, and, secondly, for the purposes of the Zoological Gardens.  In that connection, what I had in mind was that people might be anxious to know what a musk rat was like. Unless people know what they are like, we cannot get the proper help in exterminating them.  I have heard since that it is doubtful if the Zoological Gardens would keep these rats, even if we asked them.  I do not think they are anxious to have them. I should be quite willing to accept, in principle, Senator Counihan's amendment. The intention was to keep the rats for the purpose of experiment with a view to extermination.  I had a letter to-day from a firm in Denmark giving what they say is a certain cure for the musk rat menace.  It is something on the virus principle.  It may be necessary, at some future time, to try to trap some of these rats alive and keep them with a view to seeing whether this method could be improved upon.  I think we should at least get the power to keep them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section we are dealing with at present gives power to licence the keeping of musk rats.  A different part of the Bill deals with their import.  Senator Counihan has a later amendment to deal with that.  I do not think that there will be any necessity to import these rats.  I think that we could trap them alive and carry out experiments in that way.  We were anxious to carry out an experiment on one of these rats and one was caught in Nenagh.  However, he did not thrive well in confinement and, by the time we sent for him, he was dead.  As time goes on, we may gain experience in dealing with them. If the Seanad were satisfied with the restriction that Sentaor Counihan proposes, I should be prepared to <Col N="297" /> accept it but I would ask the Senator to withdraw it and let me bring in an amendment on Report Stage.  The section which really should be amended is Section 11, which deals with the granting of licences.  An amendment to that section would cover the keeping of rats and the import of them. Under Section 9, we could not deal with the import question.  If we amended Section 11, it would settle the whole affair and restrict the giving of licences for the keeping of musk rats except for the purposes stated by Senator Counihan&mdash;biological or scientific research.  If the Seanad is agreeable and if Senator Counihan's amendment is withdrawn, I shall bring in the necessary amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 3, which stands in my name and that of Senator O'Farrell.</P>
      <P>Section 6 sub-section (1). To delete sub-paragraph (i) of paragraph (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with public servants, who are classified.  My amendment is designed to delete from this section a commissioned officer or a chaplain of the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann. I think that it is very unwise for the <Col N="299" /> Government to be interfering with the public service in the manner proposed in this Bill.  I think it is true to say that, generally speaking, the public service of this country is one the people ought to be proud of.  I think, in order to ensure that faithful service will be given by the employees of the State, whether they be commissioned officers in the Army, chaplains or people employed in any capacity, it is essential that they should receive a salary sufficient to enable them to keep themselves in a proper position, and so that they will be able to perform their duties properly.  I do not think it can be said that Army officers are extravagantly paid.  They are expected to maintain a certain standard.  For instance, if they are going to the theatre they cannot queue up in the streets for the gallery or the pit.  I think there is a regulation dealing with that.  Army officers are obliged to go to the most expensive parts of the theatre.  Many of these men have adopted the Army as a career.  They would, perhaps, have done far better for themselves if they had gone in for some other profession.  In view of all that I have said, I do not think the Minister is justified in taking a substantial slice off their salaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that this Bill was originally conceived for the purpose of exacting sacrifices from all in certain grades in the public service, irrespective of their salary or wages. So far as the Army is concerned it is only the officers and the chaplains who are being attacked.  I take it that when the rates of pay for the Army were being fixed, all the facts of the situation were taken into account, and that a certain margin of salary was preserved between, say, the non-commissioned officers and the officers; that a lieutenant got more than a sergeant-major, a captain more than a lieutenant, a commandant more than a captain, and so on.  The rates of pay were, I expect, built up in this way, with the rank and file of the Army as the basis &mdash;with a bare proportion of adjustment between the various grades.  Why, in those circumstances, attack the commissioned officers as is being done in <Col N="300" /> this Bill?  Surely the relationship in regard to pay, which is in respect of responsibility, is disturbed thereby. The whole relationship, from the viewpoint of responsibility, is disturbed, so that payment for responsibility must inevitably be disarranged.</P>
      <P>Senator Farren has very rightly stated that, having regard to the pay which Army officers receive, perfectly ludicrous social obligations and observances are imposed upon and required from them.  I doubt if there is any other section of the community that is required to comply with the same social observances as Army officers, having regard to their rates of pay.  I think this must be based on the assumption that, like the old British Army officers our Army officers are people of means who are not at all dependent upon their Army pay for a livelihood, and, thereby, are expected to observe social standards altogether out of keeping with the amount of money they draw for their military service.  Anybody who has any acquaintance with our Army will know that a very large number of commissioned officers have an exceedingly hard time in trying to make ends meet at all.  Many of them are obliged to live in an air of make-believe, pretending to the public they are pretty well-off when, in fact, they certainly are not.  In these circumstances it is really too much to ask them to suffer the deductions proposed in this Bill. As regards the chaplains, I have heard of some who are only being paid £100 a year.  On the whole, I think, they are paid scandalously low rates of pay, and it is certainly carrying the farce too far to say that they must give up a share of the little they have.  I hope, in view of the small saving that would be effected, and having regard to the peculiar circumstances attaching to these cases, that the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that all the arguments which have been expressed in favour of this amendment are arguments which could properly be directed against the Bill as a whole.  In all the services, the rates of remuneration appertaining to <Col N="301" /> the various grades and ranks are relative to each other.  It is clear to every person, I am sure, that where a generous sacrifice is called for there are some grades and some ranks which can better afford to make that sacrifice than others.  In the case of the Army, the non-commissioned officers and men have been excepted from the cuts, because, speaking now from recollection, the highest paid non-commissioned officer does not draw very much more than £90 a year and, of course, the pay of privates is considerably below that.  In the case, however, of the officers of the Army we find that the most junior commissioned rank enjoys a salary, when allowances are taken into consideration, of not less than £300 per annum.  That is paid to the youngest officer in the Army, to a person just entering upon his career.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scale was first fixed in 1923 when, I think, the cost-of-living figure was considerably higher than it is now.  In fixing that scale, apart altogether from its relation to the cost-of-living figure, consideration was given to other relevant circumstances; first of all, that possibly the officers of our Army might not be drawn from the wealthier section of the community and would be, in the strict sense of the word, professional soldiers, men who adopted the Army as a profession in order to make a living out of it. Taking every factor into consideration, the scale was first fixed in the year 1923, at a time when the cost of living was much higher than it is to-day. The cost of living has since fallen, and, therefore, the real rate of remuneration of Army officers is considerably more than what it was when it was first fixed.  In view of that, it seems to me when the financial position of the State is such that there has to be a general temporary revision of these scales of pay, no case can be made for excepting the Army from the operations of this Bill.  If a case were made at all for excepting the Army, it seems to me that that case could be made with equal force in regard to the other services.  The logical consequence of accepting the amendment proposed by Senators <Col N="302" /> Farren and O'Farrell would be the rejection of the Bill.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I would ask Senators to withdraw the amendment.  If they are not prepared to take that course then it seems to me, in view of the fact that the Seanad, on the Second Reading, having accepted the principle of the measure: that in the present circumstances rather than to impose taxation economies must be found in the public services, it ought to reject the amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 6, sub-section (1).  To delete sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>In view of what the Minister has said in regard to the last amendment, I think that a special case can be made for this amendment, which deals with the Gárda Síochána.  In view of the Minister's statement, I think that if he is logical he will agree to accept this amendment.  The special plea that he made to the House to reject the last amendment was on these grounds: that the salaries of the officers in the Army were fixed in 1923; that since then there has been a considerable reduction in the cost of living, and that, therefore, the position of commissioned officers in the Army was very much better now than it was in 1923.  The Minister cannot put forward that argument in regard to the Gárda Síochána.  When dealing with the last amendment the Minister said the Government did not propose to interfere with the non-commissioned ranks and privates in the Army, but, if one may put it so, this Bill does propose to interfere with the rates paid to non-commissioned officers and privates in the Gárda Síochána.  I think I will be able to show in this amendment that the Minister is not logical in the attitude he is taking up. The rates of pay for this force were first fixed in 1922.  Since then they have suffered a reduction of 17 per cent. in their salaries.  First of all, they got a reduction of 14 per cent. in 1924, and a further reduction of 3 per cent. in 1929.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> Now, I think the Minister will agree that already the members of the Gárda Síochána have suffered substantial cuts.  They have also suffered through the operation of the cost-of-living figure.  The Minister made the case that, as regards the Army, it was only the officers who were being cut, but here it is proposed to cut the rank and file of the Gárda Síochána. I think it is most unfair.  The members of the Gárda Síochína are a most efficient body of men.  They have very responsible duties to perform in the interests of the community as a whole. They are a body of men for whom, I think, every citizen has the greatest respect and admiration, and they have very heavy responsibilities indeed placed on their shoulders.  I think it is to their credit that, during the years that have elapsed since the Gárda Síochána were brought into existence, and considering the onerous duties they had to perform, they have come through with honour to themselves and the country as a whole.  If there is one thing at which we ought to aim in this country it is to have an efficient disciplined police force.  I never want to see here the methods that we hear and read are adopted in other countries by the members of police forces who are reported, in many cases, to have been in collusion with wrongdoers and breakers of the law.  I do not think that, speaking as a whole the slightest breath of suspicion can be directed at the Gárda in this country in that respect, and if you want to maintain that position, and if you want this force to continue to render the service to the community that they have rendered so faithfully and so well, they are, at least, entitled to be paid a wage on which they can live.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill are going further to reduce the standard of life of this force and I think it most unfair that these men should be attacked in this particular manner.  If we make comparisons with any other class in the service, it will be seen that the Gárda Síochána have contributed more than their share to any economies that have to be sought.  It is particularly <Col N="304" /> unfair in view of the specific declarations made on the last occasion when the Gárda were asked to accept a reduction in their salaries to the effect that it had reached bedrock. Those were the words.  They were not to be asked to make any further sacrifices than those they were being asked to make at that time.</P>
    <P>I think that when a responsible Minister, no matter what Government is in power, makes a deliberate statement of that nature to a public service such as the Gárda Síochána, the country as a whole should honour it. In view of that statement, I think it is most unfair that the Gárda should be asked to accept a further reduction. If you compare the rates of pay of the commissioned and non-commissioned men of the Gárda with those paid to men in other occupations of the same type you will find that the latter are in receipt of higher salaries and wages than the members of the Gárda.  Further, people in outside occupations, if they so desire, can, in their leisure hours, enter into other occupations, but a Gárda cannot do that nor can his wife do it.  He is compelled by the State to live on the bare amount he receives as salary, and in view of all these circumstances I suggest that it is most unreasonable and unjust to inflict a further cut on these men.  I think they are the only police force in the world whose boot allowance has been taken away.  I made play during the February election of last year, when we made that subject a live topic as to the last Government taking the boots off the Gárda, and I said that I was not so sure that if the other Party got in they might not take the stockings off them as well, and my words have come true.  God knows these men are not being paid too much.  If they were being paid a salary in excess of that which they were entitled to receive, there would be some justification for it, but considering that the Gárda on appointment gets 50/- a week and, after 22 years, rises to 83/- per week, I do not think that the rates of pay are extravagant for men with such responsibilities.  I want the House to remember this: that the <Col N="305" /> Gárda are not like the old police force we had in this country, the members of which had nothing to do except to stand about the barracks all day and make trouble for some of their neighbours. These men have a lot of additional duties to perform.  They administer the School Attendance Act and various other Acts, and in order to carry out these duties satisfactorily a man has to maintain a bicycle at his own expense.  He is not provided with a bicycle, and in view of all these circumstances and in view of what the Minister has said with regard to the last amendment, I appeal to the House to support this amendment and prevent this injustice being done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, in my opinion, unquestionably one of the most important amendments on the Order Paper, and I would ask for it the earnest consideration and support of the House.  The Gárda, for this particular purpose, fortunately, have no votes and, to that extent, I hope, the House can approach this in a more judicial and impartial spirit than they will, perhaps, approach other amendments on the Order Paper.  On the merits of the case alone, this cut is not justified.  The rates of pay of the Gárda were fixed in 1922 and, according to the statement which the Gárda made to the inquiry which was set up, they had really no relation to the cost of living at all, but, even if they had, the Gárda, since their rates were fixed in 1922, have suffered a cut of 17 per cent. 17 per cent. since 1922 is a very substantial slice off the pay of the Gárda.  What are these rates of pay?  A man has to have ten years' active service before he receives 78/- per week.  He remains seven years on that figure, at the end of which he gets an additional 2/6 per week.  He then remains a further five years on that figure in order to reach the maximum of 83/-.  The Gárda have themselves set out the rates of pay for various types of tradesmen which, in practically all cases, are higher than the maximum to which the Gárda can go, but there is this important difference, that the tradesman, once he serves his time, which would be at the age of 20 or 21, immediately gets the maximum <Col N="306" /> rate attaching to his particular trade, while the Gárda has to wait 22 years before he reaches his maximum.  He is then 43 or 44 years of age and, during that period that he is working up laboriously to the maximum, his fellow worker, the tradesman, is drawing a higher rate of pay and is, consequently, able to command a bigger purchasing power and to expend more money not only on necessaries, but on social amenities, education for his children and so forth.</P>
      <P>The tradesman is not expected, and never has been expected, to keep up the same social standing.  Nobody denounces him; they may pity him if he lives in a very poor habitation, but he can do it and it does not damage his prospects of promotion or his relationship with his employer. The Gárda cannot live in poor quarters. He is not expected to mix with everybody, because he has to maintain a certain standard of independence in order to discharge his duties impartially. He is open to all sorts of temptation in the administration of the law.  The licensing laws are an outstanding example.  A well-to-do publican might not be above offering a very substantial reward to a Gárda in order to save his business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody behind says &ldquo;Shame,&rdquo; but the Senator who says it knows that these things are done.  One of our objects should be to place the Gárda reasonably above temptation in any case.  The administration of the betting laws, the Weights and Measures Acts, and so on, all require that he should be placed reasonably above temptation.  The Gárda who entered in 1922 saw a prospect at the end of 22 years of getting up to 95/- a week, which was the maximum then.  Now, he can only get to 83/- per week, and 2/6 is to be knocked off this in the case of single men.  The Minister may justify that on the ground that a single man is well able to afford it, but it would be a great mistake to proceed on the assumption that all single men, or even the majority of single men, have only themselves to support.  Many <Col N="307" /> men are single because they cannot afford to get married, because they have dependants such as aged parents, or younger brothers, or sisters, or other people whom they feel conscientiously compelled to support, and to proceed on the assumption that they have no other domestic responsibilities other than their own support would be entirely erroneous.</P>
      <P>The commissioned and the non-commissioned officers of the Gárda have also had their cuts and they are to-day paid at a very much lower rate than the corresponding units in either Northern Ireland or Great Britain. The Gárda statement sets out:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It might be well to mention here that an inspector while of non-commissioned rank&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>that is, in the Free State</P>
      <P>&ldquo;with a lower rate of pay than a station sergeant in the British police is called on to perform the full duties of an officer during a period of four to six months per year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspector is paid at a lower rate than the station sergeant across the Border, but he still performs, although he is a non-commissioned officer, a comissioned officer's duties during four to six months of the year.  They have no regular hours of duty.  They can be called upon at all hours and on all days of the week.  It is a case of work while there is work to be done and they have not got the encouragment in the discharge of their duties that police forces in other countries have.  They have had to labour against rather extraordinary difficulties.  Even Deputies and others have indulged in sneering remarks regarding them from time to time. That has made their position very difficult and rendered the discharge of their duty very much more onerous than it would in other respects be. Speaking on the Gárda Estimate in the Dáil on 1st November, 1928, as reported in column 1,394, volume 26, Official Debates, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. <Col N="308" /> Lemass, used this amongst other statements:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are rather glad that we have got 7,210 people&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>these were the Gárda</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;in this country who can go about in dress suits.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Not then, evidently.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Five or six years ago, we could not parade that number of people in dress suits.  We have them scattered throughout the country to give a tone to the social life of our towns and villages.  That is rather satisfactory but, unfortunately, the members of the Civic Guard do very little else except to give tone to the social life of our towns and villages.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A statement like that coming from one of the responsible leaders of the Opposition of the time&mdash;and Mr. Lemass was by no means the worst offender&mdash;must have a very discouraging and irritating effect on the Guards and certainly does not help these men in discharging the very difficult duties which they are called upon to discharge. Many of the present members of the Government Party, including some who are members of the Executive Council, opposed any further cuts in the Guards' salaries and opposed the removal of the boot allowance. They are the only police force, I understand, in the civilised world that are not allowed a boot allowance.  We all know that a Guard is practically the whole time on his feet, always walking about in the normal discharge of his duties.  By the reduction of the boot allowance a saving of £27,000 was effected, while the reduction in the bicycle allowances from £5 to £2 10s. 0d. effected a saving of £13,200. The reduction in the allowances to inspectors effected an annual saving of £4,000.  It will be seen from these figures that their allowances have been pared down to the absolute limit. Speaking on the reduction of the boot <Col N="309" /> allowance in the Dáil on the 24th May, 1929, as reported in page 355, Volume 30 of the Official Debates, the present Minister for Justice, Mr. Ruttledge, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the Minister seeks to make economies and when the Department tries to effect some economies, they tackle it in a method not approved of by this side of the House.  They tackle it by what we say is a rather mean method, they attack the allowances. When these men joined the force the Minister at the time was satisfied that the allowances were only commensurate with the positions they occupied.  The Minister, this year, in a wild drive to secure economies, was supposed to take the boots off the Gárda.  We all had experience of the Gárda prosecuting unfortunate people all over the country for not keeping shoes on the donkeys.  The Minister thinks he can take the shoes off the Gárda and also deprive them of some of their cycling allowance as a means of effecting economies.  I suppose we on this side of the House should be glad that something has been done to bring things down to a proper level, but we do not think it is a genuine effort or a decent means of effecting economies to act in this way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Minister went into these matters he would not have to cut down the boot and bicycle allowances of the Gárda in order to effect an economy of £29,000.  It is a very easy way to effect economies&mdash;it is a very simple and crude way&mdash;instead of cutting the pay, to take certain items away so that it does not appear that it is a cut in salary or in wages.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And yet the Government, of which Mr. Ruttledge is now a member, has decided that the Gárda are to be cut further.  In this respect I think I can claim the support of the supporters of the late administration.  I heard numerous Cumann na nGaedheal Senators declare at the time when it was rumoured that the Gárda's salaries <Col N="310" /> were about to be cut a couple of years ago, that to whatever extent they could prevent it they certainly would prevent it and vote against any such proposal.  The circumstances have not changed since.  The arguments against the cuts are at least as strong and as impressive as they were two years ago. The Minister states that the rates of pay in the Army were fixed in 1923 when the cost of living was higher than it is now, and he will say that the rates of pay for the Gárda were fixed in 1922 and that a similar argument applies.  I think I can answer that argument by pointing out that 17 per cent. of the remuneration of the Gárda has since been taken away, and that, furthermore, these rates of pay were fixed when the prospect of balancing our Budget was even worse than it is this year.  We were then in the midst of a civil war and there was then no knowing what was to be the outcome of that war.  Yet rates of pay were fixed which were supposed to be the minimum that could be fixed if we were to have an efficient and well-conducted force.  Seventeen per cent. has been deducted from these rates already.  In these circumstances, I think it is very unfair to introduce a proposal to bring them within the present scheme of economies. The total amount to be saved by the cuts in the Gárda salaries is £33,000.  If we cannot find other means of balancing our Budget than by getting this £33,000 from an already underpaid police force, then the country must be in a very bad condition. The Gárda can easily by a quite justifiable discontent and resentment as a result of that cut cost the country 20 times that £33,000, not by corruption but by mere slackness and inefficiency, I suggest to the House that it is a negation of statesmanship to bring forward such a proposal as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="McGillycuddyReeks" hpid="The McGillycuddy The McGillycuddy">
      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister in regard to the question of the remuneration of the younger Army officers.  They are an extremely well-paid force considering what they do, but the circumstances are quite different when one comes to deal with a uniformed force such as the Gárda. I wish to support this amendment, <Col N="311" /> because whatever the urgency for getting this money&mdash;I will admit right away that the Minister wants the money and that we must help him to get it&mdash;I do not think that the Guards should have been included in the purview of this Bill at all.  The money should not be got at the expense of the Guards.  I base this contention firstly on the theoretical principles which are generally accepted as governing the administration of a police force, namely, that they should be apart from, and should be unaffected by political changes or considerations, so that the law should be upheld without favour or affection, and in the interests of all the citizens of the State.  It is an accepted principle, not only in normal countries, but which has been developed amongst those special international police forces which have been brought in in various areas in order to overcome the veniality of the police in those districts. This is a matter about which we should be very careful.  It is for that reason that a man on entering the police force is debarred from exercising the franchise. That particular fact immediately makes him, before the members of this House, an entirely defenceless person.  He cannot go to the poll to register his disapprobation; he has got to do it by circulating the various documents which Senators have received.  Personally, I have not considered these circulars very seriously. The facts are, no doubt, all right, but I tried to form my conclusions entirely apart from these circulars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point to be considered is that the Guards have been cut already and this latest effort makes them much worse off than the police either in Great Britain or in Northern Ireland. Then there is the Border where you have our Guards meeting a force which is treated on quite different terms.  These are matters that we should consider very seriously.  I have had considerable experience of disciplined forces and I will say this about our Guards that, taking them all round, all over the country, they are without exception the best type, mentally and physically, that this country <Col N="312" /> could produce.  Look at any Gárda and you have to admit that he is physically a fine fellow.  He is alert, intelligent and, above all, very kindly and fair to everybody.  I think that, notwithstanding the very many things said about them&mdash;I have heard myself extraordinary statements about Guards by responsible people or people who should be responsible&mdash; they have in my experience done their duty, under provocation very often, fairly and impartially towards both political parties.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that, in addition to ordinary police duties, they carry out an enormous amount of work for the various Departments of Government, even for such a Department as the Ministry of External Affairs.  That means that they must have a fairly high standard of education and it costs them something to get it.  You have the irresponsible critic, who likes to say that most of the Guards' time is spent sitting in the station while the civilian is working with his hands, but that is really the most irksome part of the Gárda's existence.  It has to be remembered too that this inertia is varied at a moment's notice by unpleasant and often highly dangerous duty.  Let me give you a simple instance of that. Two Gárda were walking quietly about at a public function at Galway last week when one of these emergencies arose.  If the House had witnessed how these two men went absolutely fearlessly right into a wildly fighting crowd, a mob of some 50 half drunken people, without any thought for themselves, I believe that instead of trying to pass these cuts they would pass round the hat and raise a subscription for them.</P>
    <P>There are also more serious occasions when, in times of civil excitement such as occur after an election, great bitterness is aroused, and again, here, the Gárda do their duty fearlessly. The individual Gárda goes out at night, very often alone, without any help, well knowing from warnings he has had that he is in danger of assassination from somebody.  We are all aware that events like that have occurred within the last few months. <Col N="313" /> That, I think, again puts the Gárda on quite a different plane to the ordinary wage-earner in this country.  Two speakers already have dealt generally with the question of the duties which the Gárda have to perform.  I would like to compare their duties with the actual work of artisans and labourers. The Gárda has to do, as a minimum, seven hours' duty, divided into two periods, one of which is at night.  One day every week the Gárda has to do orderly duty for 24 hours on end.  In the towns every Gárda does one month's continuous night duty from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.  No matter what the weather may be like, he has got to do his beat.  For this the Gárda who has passed his probationery period gets £3 per week, but from that&mdash;and this is a point which the other speakers have not made&mdash;there is a deduction of 2½ per cent. in respect of his pension.  It takes him five years to reach a salary of £3 9s. 0d. and five years more to reach a salary of £3 18s. 0d.  He formerly had a bicycle allowance of £5, but that has been reduced to £2 10s. 0d.  What does that mean?  It costs between £7 and £8 to get a really solid bicycle suitable for work in country districts.  That bicycle lasts him about two years.  At the end of two years it is practically worn out, and although it costs him at least £1 per annum to keep it in repair during the two years he has had it.  At the end of the two years he has received only £5 as bicycle allowance, but he has to buy another bicycle then.  That is the way this allowance is worked.</P>
    <P>The case for the cut in the married sergeant's pay is equally untenable. He has got to keep up a very special appearance in public.  If he has got money on Saturday he cannot go to a football match with a scarf round his neck.  He must be tidy or people will say: &ldquo;Well, the way the Guards are dressing nowadays is certainly strange.&rdquo;  He has got to clothe himself and his wife and family decently and to live in a better house than the ordinary artisan or labourer.  He gets 10/- a week in the small towns as a house allowance.  I have ascertained several cases where station sergeants <Col N="314" /> are paying 22/- for decent houses for their families, while guards are paying 10/- or 12/-.  That charge puts them out of pocket right away.  A sergeant's fuel and light bill is heavy compared with that of an artisan or a labourer.  I do not think the public is aware that when Guards go on leave they have to transport their families and themselves at their own expense no allowance whatever being made by the Government.  The railway companies have given a half-fare concession, but that was not obtained by this Government, or by the previous Government, but the Guards' Association. When a guard is transferred, at his own request, because he may wish to live near his relations, he gets no allowance.  The married guard or sergeant gets no dispensary allowances and no free medicine.  If he goes to hospital he has to pay his expenses. As he does not get dispensary treatment for his wife or family all these things reduce the pay.  Compare that with the position of an agricultural labourer or a bricklayer's labourer who has 30/- weekly.  In my part of the world the bricklayers' labourers struck until they got £2 2s. a week.  As a rule, the labourer has a house and an acre of land for a small rent, vegetables and potatoes for his family, and probably milk for nine or ten months. The labourer has a very small bill to meet for fuel and light, while he gets free dispensary treatment for his family and himself, and the old age pension without making any contributory payment.  The labourer works only eight hours daily and has not to maintain the same standard of living as the Guards.  As the House will see, there can be no comparison between the position of the Guards and labourers.  The labourer has not to have the same standard of education, yet he has the trade unions behind him to insure that his wages are maintained. In some cases artisans earn from £4 to £4 12s. 6d. weekly, but they get free medical treatment and eventually the old age pension.  In addition to having everything found for him, the soldier gets a free house and other perquisites.</P>
    <P>I have some experience of handling <Col N="315" /> disciplined forces, and I say without hesitation that the type of men of which our Guards is composed is mentally and physically the very best this country produces.  I am satisfied that there is nothing more dangerous than to mess about with the pay of a uniformed force.  You can make unrest and dissatisfaction in the finest force in the world by doing that.  We are not yet a Communistic country, is it right or wise to make a differentiation in the various types of service in the country?  Without the services that the Guards have rendered, and are loyally rendering to whatever Government is in power, I have no hesitation in saying that the ordinary citizens would not be free to go about their business.  I urge the Minister to consider this matter and to leave the Guards' pay as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment, which I think is one that should commend itself to the House. Considering the conditions that existed in Ireland it is wonderful, in my opinion, that we have been able to set up a force to maintain order about which there has been no adverse comment of any kind.  Personally, I hate economies because no one believes that any permanent advantage can come to any country or to any business by economies.  I am perfectly satisfied that they are hateful to the Minister. It is, perhaps, difficult to make a comparison amongst the people who are to make sacrifices under this Bill, but, I have no hesitation in saying that of all those whose salaries are being cut the Guards are the least deserving of being asked to make a sacrifice.  The amount to be saved is trifling.  It is only £30,000.  The Guards are comparatively the worst paid of any of the classes affected by the Bill.  In our cities and towns there are plenty of unskilled labourers drawing as much money as the Guards.  The Guards are specially qualified for their duties.  They are highly educated and are men of exceptionally good character.  It should be remembered that their vocation is not without risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> I remember on one occasion driving to Dublin on a very bad night.  As we say in Cork, &ldquo;it was snowing and raining,&rdquo; the light was bad.  At one stage of the journey my companion shouted: &ldquo;There is someone in front.&rdquo;  I found that I had very nearly run down a guard in the dark.  When I stopped and apologised he said: &ldquo;That has happened to me six times to-night, so it does not make any difference.&rdquo; Recently, when attempting to rescue a lunatic in Cork a guard lost his life. Two or three other members of the force also lost their lives performing acts of bravery.  These things should be taken into consideration when we are dealing with the Guards. In Cork the Guards have shown themselves to be friends of the poor.  In former years benevolent citizens promoted an entertainment at Christmas for the poor children of the city.  For some reason that custom fell through until last year, when the Guards provided a substantial meal and an entertainment for about 300 children. Some of the citizens intimated that they were prepared to take part in the entertainment, but the Guards pointed out that they could only get a hall to accommodate 300 and that they would not take any subscriptions from outsiders. We know that all over the world a policeman's lot is not a happy one.  We know that policemen are subjected to more temptation than other men, and that unfortunately they have succumbed to that temptation in other countries.  I do not think any of us ever heard it suggested that any member of the Guards has done anything that was not in keeping with his uniform.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment, which only represents £30,000 throughout the Free State.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  I want to lay stress on this, that no Government has a right to get away from its contracts, that these young men joined the Guards under certain conditions and so decided their future course.  We have no right to alter those conditions now.  If we are so hard up that we must save money is it to be got from generations of guards yet unborn?  In <Col N="317" /> future we must ask people to join under different conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to give a silent vote on this question.  Senators should remember that the Guards have a bare living wage.  They should also remember that the majority of the population do not help the police. That has been ingrained in the people for generations as a result of foreign rule or, if you like, British misgovernment. We were taught to hate government, and to hate preservers of the peace.  I felt that when an Irish child was born its cry after birth was: &ldquo;To hell with the Government; to hell with the police.&rdquo;  If a burglary can take place in Dublin, in daylight, by some of those gentlemen who go around the streets watching people to leave their houses so that they can break in, that is the explanation. That could not happen in most other countries.  It happens here and it makes the Guards' lot all the harder. Then we have the Oireachtas passing Acts of Parliament mechanically, and even invoking the guillotine.  That makes more work for the Guards, although recruiting for the force has been stopped.  When a Department or a commercial firm run on business lines, finds that work is accumulating, additional help is brought in.  In the Guards, more work is being piled on every day but recruiting is stopped.  A quarter of the work that policemen have to do now should be charged to Departments of State other than the Department of Justice.  I am not accusing the Government of deliberately helping Communism in any way, but I say that Communism is growing here.  That cannot be denied.  As proof of that we had unofficial strikes within the last few months on the railways and at the ports.  That has meant a great deal more work for the Guards.  If it continues what will be the end?  The soil of Ireland is well ploughed for the seeds of Communism.  This Bill is harrowing the soil for the weed known as Communism.  The Bill is setting a headline to other employers to reduce salaries and wages.  That will fertilise the soil for the growth of Communism. I ask you to remember that the only <Col N="318" /> thing between this country and ruin is a contented police force.  If this cut is put into operation you will not have a satisfied police force.  You will have a dissatisfied force.  If this generation is not prepared to pay the police force what they are entitled to&mdash;every labourer is worthy of his hire&mdash;then our children and our children's children will pay for it in the years to come.</P>

      <P>I feel that I have a special responsibility to the Gárda Síochána, for the reason that I was the founder of that force.  I was Minister of Home Affairs when the Gárda Síochána Force was first established. I presided at the first meeting of police officers in the Gresham Hotel to make recommendations to the Provisional Government as to the form the force should take.  The first commissioner of the Gárda was my friend, Senator Staines.  I know probably more of the Gárda Síochána than do most people. I know what their responsibilities were and the difficulties we had to encounter when we were trying to form that force.  Scores of young men were taken out of the train at wayside stations and beaten when they were being brought up for training.  At the time, we had not a depôt.  The recruits had to sleep on the floor in the Exhibition Hall at Ballsbridge.  They were fired on at night and had to defend themselves with machine-guns.  It was months before we could get a place that could be called a depôt.  All these were men of great courage to join the force at the time they did.  As I said, I was Minister for Home Affairs at the time and my friend, the present Minister for Finance, was engaged in a different form of activity at that time. I appeal to him in all seriousness to accept this amendment.  The Guards cannot afford this cut.  I know several of them personally.  Walking around, I get talking to them and I know their domestic circumstances.  With the cuts they have got already, they cannot afford this cut.  As some Senator has already stated, the Gárda when he goes into plain clothes has to be fairly well dressed.  He has to keep his wife and family in a decent place.  How can he afford a further cut and live in the <Col N="319" /> circumstances in which he is supposed to live while&mdash;and this is an important thing&mdash;not placing himself in a position in which he would be liable to accept bribes.  The Gárda must be independent. He must be able to keep his wife and family and himself in such a position that he will be able to do his duty independently according to his lights.  The amendment will be carried, I know, but I appeal to the Minister to accept it and not to let the matter go to a division.</P>

      <P>Looking at the Minister, I have a shrewd suspicion that uppermost in his mind is a feeling of gratitude that he has a Seanad to take him out of some of the dilemmas he has been placed in in connection with these cuts and, in particular, the cut we have before us.  I am also satisfied that many Senators who are objecting to these cuts now would, if another Government were in power, be supporting them.  We heard Senator O'Farrell speak of the allowances to the Gárda for boots and bicycles being reduced.  Now, we have crocodile tears shed by some of these people because there is a further cut in connection with the Gárda.  I have a shrewd suspicion that some of the arguments used by those opposing the cuts are not sincere when I remember the shilling a week, or £2 12s. a year, taken off the old age pensioners by some of these gentlemen.  I have the greatest sympathy in the world with the Minister for Finance and with all Ministers for Finance, because they evidently can please nobody.  They are placed in a very invidious position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us that the economic condition of the country demands these cuts.  If that be so, let us be fair.  What is he to do?  We have the economic war.  We have trade depressed.  We have the shopkeepers in the City of Dublin and in many cities throughout the country almost on the verge of ruin.  I am told that there are more writs in the hands of the sheriffs in the different towns and cities in this country than there ever were before.  Is it too much that men in Government positions, with fairly <Col N="320" /> decent salaries, should bear a share of the poverty, if you like, which we have around us?  Having said so much, I am conscientiously of opinion that the Minister and the Government are making a mistake in reducing the pay of the Gárda.  I do not, for a moment, suggest that the Gárda should be pampered but I really think that all Governments should go out of their way to have them contented.  Senators O'Farrell and Farren dealt with the question in a much better strain than I could deal with it.  Many temptations are thrown in the way of the Gárda.  When Senator O'Farrell said that a moneyed public could do a great deal I was the one who said &ldquo;Shame.&rdquo;  All men with money, whether they are on the commercial register or not, can do a great deal of harm with their money.  Although I am prepared to support the Minister in every one of the cuts contained in the Bill, a contented Gárda Force is a great factor at the present moment.  I am not going into the question of the wave of Communism pictured for us by my old friend Senator Staines.  The pay is, undoubtedly, not over-generous, and if the Minister could see his way without cutting up this Bill to let this economy remain inoperative he would be doing a good day's work for the country because, as I explained already, a tremendous amount depends on a contented Gárda Force.  For that reason I am going to vote for the amendment and I suggest very respectfully to the Minister that he might consider allowing it to pass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there is a great deal of misapprehension as to what exactly is the position of the Gárda in relation to pay and, particularly, in relation to the deductions which are imposed by the Bill.  Senator General Sir William Hickie based his support of this amendment upon the principle that no Government has a right to get away from contracts.  I do not wish to argue that but I think that it could be said that, whenever a contract became unduly burdensome upon the general body of the people, any Government in discharge of its duty to <Col N="321" /> the people would have to seek a release from or a modification or amendment of that contract.  Apart altogether from that&mdash;I do not ask the Seanad to agree with me in that view&mdash;I ask the Seanad to consider whether, in proposing the deductions we do under this Bill, we are getting away from contracts. Senator Duggan has recounted for us the circumstances under which the Gárda Síochána was formed. Senator Staines has spoken in support of the amendment but neither of them has told us the circumstances and conditions under which the prevailing scales of pay for the Gárda were fixed. They were fixed by a Pay Order in the year 1924.  Accompanying that Pay Order was a memorandum.  I am sorry that Senator General Sir William Hickie is not here to listen to its terms.  The pay of the Gárda was related to what was known as the Desborough scale and in the memorandum these words were used:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The scales commonly referred to as Desborough scales must be regarded as applicable only during the period when the increase in the cost of living over pre-war varies from 100 at the lower limit to 130 at the upper limit.  The cost-of-living figure has for a considerable time past been less than 100 above pre-war and is at present&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>in the year 1924</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;about 80 to 85.  The Desborough scales have accordingly been adjusted to meet this reduction in the cost of living.  This adjustment has been made on the basis upon which the remuneration of civil servants is adjusted to meet variations in the cost of living.  The scales of pay proposed for chief superintendents, superintendents and inspectors are based on the scales now being paid and are broadly equivalent to the rates fixed in 1919 for county inspectors and district inspectors of the R.I.C., similarly adjusted. It is not proposed that the rates of pay of the force should be subject to variation to meet trifling or temporary fluctuations in the cost of living and the rates now proposed are based on a cost-of-living figure of 85 above pre-war and are intended <Col N="322" /> to be applicable while the cost-of-living figure varies from 70 at the lower limit to 100 at the higher limit above pre-war.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These rates&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>this memorandum accompanying the Pay Order in 1924 went on to state</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;will, accordingly, be subject to readjustment if the cost-of-living figure passes outside that range.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now there was a contract, and there was a vital condition in the contract: that when the cost of living fell below 70 above pre-war, the rates of pay of all ranks of the Gárda were to be subject to adjustment.  That condition of the contract was never waived not even by our predecessors.</P>
    <P>A reference has been made by Senator O'Farrell to the statement that the pay of the Gárda was at bedrock, but that phrase was taken out of its context.  It was used during the debate which took place on the Gárda Síochána Allowances Order, this Order which deprived the Gárda of the boot allowance in, I think, the year 1929. If the members of the Seanad care to refer to columns 1660 and 1661, volume 29 of the Dáil Debates they will find that there the then Minister for Justice, now Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, used those words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have before me the memorandum which accompanied the penultimate order, and it is this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then went on to make the quotation which I have just given to the Seanad.  Having read this memorandum for the Dáil he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has not passed outside that range.  That is the promise made by my predecessor.  That is a promise, as I have told the representative body of the Civic Guard, that will be honourably observed.  The rates of pay of the Civic Guards will not be altered, and I take it that since that is a promise made by a responsible Executive, that promise must be binding on all future Executives.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position of the Government was more definitively expressed by the then Minister for Finance in the same debate.  Mr. Blythe said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But, obviously, if something occurred which caused the cost of <Col N="323" /> living to come down 25 or 30 points, a new situation would be created and the value of the pay on the present scales would be very considerably increased if that happened.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then went on to imply that the terms of the memorandum would be enforced.  That was the position that was taken up by the Executive towards the Gárda from 1924, and that it was maintained by them is clear from the fact that in December, 1931, when for the first time, the cost-of-living index figure fell below 70&mdash;to 65&mdash;a new Pay Order reducing the scales of pay of the Gárda was prepared.  It was ready for submission to the representative body of the Gárda when the members of that body sent in their individual resignations dissolving it, and so, for the time being, holding up the promulgation of the Order.  It is quite clear that there is absolutely no change, no modification of the Government's attitude as expressed in this memorandum of 1924; that is, that the pay of the Gárda as a whole had to be related to the cost-of-living figure.  As the cost-of-living figure in this country of primary producers, mainly agricultural producers, is a reflection of the national income, I cannot see how any Government, bearing in mind its responsibility to the people and to the general body of taxpayers can, at any time, in considering the pay of public servants leave this cost-of-living figure out of consideration. It is clear that was the view also of our predecessors.  It is the view of the Government to-day and, to some extent, it explains the reason why, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, we have endeavoured to take every circumstance into consideration; to relate the cuts to the fall in the cost-of-living figure which has taken place over the period that has elapsed since the scales of pay were first determined.</P>
    <P>I would like the Seanad to bear this fact particularly in mind, because it seems to me that most of the statements made to-day have been made on the basis that we were violating some contract with the Gárda.  There has been no violation of a contract.  The position to-day is that, so far from the <Col N="324" /> cost-of-living figure being 70 above pre-war it has now fallen to 50 above pre-war, representing, once again I would like to emphasise, a very substantial decrease in the income of the community as a whole, and, therefore, a very sound reason why the salaries or remuneration of all sections of public servants paid out of that general income should be reduced accordingly.</P>
    <P>First of all, I have made it clear that we are entitled to reduce the salaries of the Gárda.  It has been said that there is no margin for a reduction, but it is quite clear that as compared to the circumstances that existed when the original Order was promulgated there is some margin for a reduction in the circumstances that at present exist.  It has been said that the pay of our police compares unfavourably with the pay of police elsewhere.  I do not think that we can accept that.  It may be that the scales of pay here are lower than they are in Northern Ireland or Great Britain. If that be the case, the reply is that the resources of those communities are greater than ours.  They are industrial communities, and the demands upon the police in such communities are more exacting than they are upon ours. At any rate, they can afford to pay their police more than we can afford to pay.  Apart altogether from that, I would like to consider the position on its merits.  These scales of pay have persisted now for ten years.  We must assume that during these ten years they were more than sufficient, because there has been no demand for an increase.  There could not in all the circumstances be any such demand.  In any event, there has not been any demand from the representative body, nor from any responsible section of opinion in this country, to increase the pay of the police force.  There would have been such a demand if the pay of the police force had been reduced to that margin at which there would be any danger of widespread corruption, or any of the evils or abuses referred to in the debate to-day, creeping into the administration of the police force here.  Therefore, I am arguing that, in all the circumstances, the pay of the <Col N="325" /> Gárda hitherto has been more than sufficient to prevent these abuses from creeping in.</P>
    <P>It has been said by Senator Duggan that, notwithstanding this, the Gárda cannot afford this cut in addition, he said, to the cuts already enforced. What were the cuts already enforced? Senator O'Farrell said that they represented a reduction of 14½ per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>17 per cent. counting the cut made in 1929.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I wondered, in my own mind, how Senator O'Farrell arrived at that proportion.  I can only conclude that he arrived at it by taking into consideration the alteration in pay which occurred when the definitive scales for the force were promulgated in 1924.  The rates of pay in 1923, during the particularly trying conditions which existed at that time, when the force was being formed, were undoubtedly provisional scales.  They were scales which may have been inflated because it was necessary, in the particular circumstances of the period, to attract men into the Gárda. They were attracted into the Gárda, but at any rate, in 1924 the definitive scales of pay were promulgated and there has been no reduction in the scales of pay since 1924.</P>
      <P>These scales have been in force now for almost nine years.  There has been no reduction.  There has been, in the interval, a reduction in the subsistence allowance paid to the Gárda when they are away from barracks, or from home, but that cannot be classified surely as a reduction of scales of pay.  There has been a reduction of £2 10s. per annum in the cycling allowance, and the boot allowance of 1/6 per week has been abolished.  That is all that has happened since 1924.  These are the only alterations, so far as I can learn, in the scale of allowances paid to the Gárda since 1924.  They are not a reduction in remuneration.  They are a reduction in allowances which can be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of the cycling allowance, which was originally fixed in <Col N="326" /> 1924.  The cost of a bicycle was very much higher at that time than it was in 1929.  The purpose of this allowance is to allow a man to provide himself with a machine, and to maintain the machine in serviceable order.  If the price of bicycles declined between 1924 and 1929 was the State not to take advantage of the decline, and if the State does take advantage of such a decline is that to be referred to as a cut in the pay of the Gárda?  Surely the whole principle on which an allowance is based is this: that it must barely cover the cost of the service or expenditure which the particular person who enjoys it has to incur in the discharge of his duty.  It cannot allow any margin for private profit.  Otherwise it ceases to be an allowance and becomes a perquisite or remuneration. Senator The McGillycuddy has told us about the hard lot of the Gárda who has to provide himself with a bicycle.  I am not clear at the moment as to whether it is obligatory on every Gárda to provide himself with a bicycle or not.  Some do and, if they are on the strength, they get an allowance but, at any rate, I think it is a very poor bicycle that, having been purchased for £7 or £8, lasts only two years.  I do not know, but I think that the ordinary bicycle, if properly taken care of, might last eight or ten years and, in that circumstance, it seems to me that an allowance of £2 10s.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think that if he got an extra strong frame for a few shillings extra, it would carry him all right.  Bicycles have gone out of fashion nowadays, but I remember the time when very substantial business men of 12 and 14 stone had bicycles and kept them serviceable for ten or 12 years.  They did not care very much about appearances but they happened to be wealthy men so it did not matter. However, that is a mere by-point.  I say that, in considering this question, we have to leave out of account altogether any reduction in the allowances of the Gárda and bear in mind that, <Col N="327" /> since 1924, the Gárda remuneration has not been reduced and the question will then arise: &ldquo;Can the gárda afford at the present time any cut in his remuneration?&rdquo;  It seems to me that most of the Senators who spoke on this matter did not study the Schedule to the Bill, because they talked of the gárda, the married man with a wife who had to live in a decent house and maintain his family in comfort and decency.  They seemed to proceed on the assumption that, so far as the ordinary gárda was concerned, if he was married he was going to be cut in his remuneration also, but the salary of the married gárda under this Bill is not being cut.  The salary of the unmarried gárda is being cut, and the argument, therefore, narrows itself down to this: &ldquo;Is the cut which we are imposing on the unmarried gárda excessive?  The question immediately arises as to what is the average remuneration of the unmarried gárda. Most of the members of the Gárda have eight, nine and ten years' service, most of them having joined the force at its foundation, and the average pay of the gárda at the present moment is from 75/- to 78/- a week.  I am not quite certain of the figure but, at any rate, it is higher than 75/- a week.</P>

It varies according to the place in which he is stationed, but, if married, he has an average rent allowance of about £20, and if he is unmarried he lives in barracks and has no rent at all to pay.

      <P>On a point of correction.  Might I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the actual rent allowance for sergeants and guards is £13 per annum in rural districts.  Most of the guards are in rural districts and in small towns.  In the case of cities such as Cork, Limerick and Waterford the allowance is £26 per annum, and in Dublin, £30.  Perhaps that does work out at an average of £20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it quite clear that the allowance varied, and I think that even the Senator is not correct.  In rural districts the allowance is from £13 to £18 and most of them have the £18, but, in any event, the average rent allowance&mdash;and any person can check it from the figures given in the volume of Estimates&mdash;is £20 a year to a married gárda.  The whole focus of this amendment is the unmarried gárda.  The married gárda does not enter into it, because his pay is not being cut by the Bill at all. The pay of the unmarried gárda is being cut and the question which I think Senators have to ask themselves is: Can the unmarried man with an average remuneration of 75/- per week, and living in the circumstances which I have described, not afford, in present circumstances, a net cut of £5 18s. 2d. at the rate of 2/6 per week, or £6 10s. gross?  That is the point, and that is the question on which the Seanad will <Col N="329" /> have to make up its mind and vote.  I think also the House must take into consideration the memorandum issued in 1924, which definitely related the scales of pay of the Gárda to the cost of living and definitely announced that should the cost of living fall at any time below 70 these scales would be due for revision in accordance with the fall in the cost-of-living figure.  There is another important consideration which, I think, the Seanad must bear in mind in dealing with this amendment and it is that this Bill must stand as a whole.  We cannot pick and choose amongst the public servants. We have to assume that the salaries and remuneration of all branches of the Civil Service were fixed with due regard to the functions they have to perform and the responsibilities they have to bear.  To exclude the Gárda from the operation of this Bill would be, in effect, to say that, during the past ten years, the Gárda have been underpaid and, therefore, that if the present circumstances passed and the pay of all the services which had been cut were to be restored to its previous level the pay of the Gárda would not merely be allowed to remain static.  It would have to be increased proportionate to the exemption the Gárda would be granted if this amendment were carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that we have to assume that during the past ten years, taken as a whole, the pay of the public servants has been fair and that no section of the public service has been treated unjustly as compared with any other section so far as pay is concerned and that, therefore, when the necessity for sacrifices arises, all must bear their share and more or less in the circumstances in which we see it.  To exempt the Gárda now would mean that it would be exceedingly difficult for us to proceed with this Bill.  It would mean that we should have to fall back on some other line; it would mean, in effect.  I think, that we should have to come forward with fresh proposals for taxation and these proposals for taxation would naturally have to fall on the backs we thought best able to bear them.  There cannot be any alternative. <Col N="330" /> We cannot exclude one section of the public servants and expect the Government to proceed to cut the remuneration of the three or four remaining.  We feel that the burden, as I say, must be distributed over them all and, accordingly, on this ground and on the ground to which I devoted the earlier portion of my speech, namely, that we are not breaking any contracts and that the Gárda knew when they accepted these scales in 1924 that, when the cost of living fell, they were going to be subject to a cut, and that the sacrifice that we are asking from them is one which that section of the Gárda which will be most largely affected, namely, the unmarried Gárda, is one that he can make in the present circumstances, I ask the House to reject this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister intervened so early in this debate because I was greatly perturbed by the observation made by Senator Sir William Hickie.  He said that we are breaking our contract with the Gárda.  The Minister has explained and, I think, explained very satisfactorily, that there is no breach of contract. I would have wished that a different method of approach to this question had been adopted by the Government. In order to understand the realities of the present situation, it is necessary to consider what has been the increase in the value of money measured by commodities generally in the last ten years and to consider, as a second question, what has been the increase in the value of money measured by agricultural commodities in the last ten years or in the last four years.</P>

      <P>I think that the best way to deal with the situation which has arisen would be to keep the value of money in relation to commodities generally as steady as possible and to bring back the value of money to the proportion which it bore towards commodities in the years 1923 and 1924. If that were possible, it would solve a great many difficulties, and the greatest difficulty of all that I see is this: the salaries of public servants are reduced and why should not all salaries be reduced?  That is the question&mdash;if there is to be an effective method of dealing with this situation, why should there not be an income tax on all salaries, not merely the salaries of all public servants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I suggest that under the Constitution the Seanad has no right to deal with matters of finance.  At least, all they have the right to do is to make recommendations.  They have no power to reduce the Minister's financial proposals in any way.  They will be taking power, if they vote against this Bill, to reduce the Minister's Estimate and to force upon him the necessity, as he said himself, to find the money somewhere else.  In effect, voting against this Bill will be the same as if the Seanad voted against a Money Bill.</P>

In that respect, if I were the <Col N="333" /> Minister for Finance I would make the Seanad pay for the reduction.  Nobody likes to interfere with the Guards.  I could, from my experience, give as great a testimonial to their character, their perseverance and their rectitude as anybody.  Nevertheless the circumstances of the time require a reduction and I would ask the Seanad to bear in mind that their function is not to interfere in the financial provisions submitted by the Minister for Finance. The Constitution does not give them that power.  I would say to them: &ldquo;Do not interfere in what is really not your business, let the Minister for Finance carry out the policy he has enshrined in this particular Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The Seanad Bill.  I think that possibly Senator Wilson represents a certain type of mind in this country which looks simply at this question of reductions in cuts from what I might call an extremely narrow point of view.  I do not say that Senator Wilson takes that point of view himself but he represents that type of mind.  I have a shrewd suspicion that he is not fully satisfied in his own mind in regard to his attitude to this particular amendment because he did not argue against the amendment. He simply took the attitude that in effect this was a Money Bill and he had nothing to say to the amendment at all.  I took it from him that he at any rate has been influenced by the discussion that has taken place. I also took it from his speech that the vote in this case is going to be a non-Party <Col N="334" /> vote and that each member of the House has got to make up his mind for himself.  I do not believe that that applies to our friends opposite but as far as the majority of the House is concerned, it seems probable that we shall have a free vote.</P>
      <P>On the Second Stage of this Bill I stated that I did not believe the House ought to reject the Bill.  I think I also stated that I believed that if we inserted all the amendments we should like to see put in the Bill, it would simply mutilate it and it would have the same effect as if it were rejected on Second Reading.  There is a very large number of amendments down in the names of Senators O'Farrell and Farren.  If we were to pass all these amendments there would be practically nothing left of the Bill.  Some of these amendments, without doubt, I should like to support and some I am not so sure of, but I do not propose to support the whole list or even the whole of those towards which I would be favourable for the simple reason that I do not think that you should tear a Bill to pieces in Committee Stage after you have passed the Second Reading, particularly a Bill of this character.  I think the House has to consider whether in the case of this amendment there should be any exception to the general rule, whether there is anything in the case of the reductions in the pay of the Gárda towards which it may be claimed we owe a particular duty.  I am perfectly certain that when Senator Wilson suggested that the cost of this reduction, if the amendment were carried, might be defrayed by members of the House, he knew he was making it much harder for members to vote against the amendment.  Fortunately, or unfortunately, however, Senator Wilson is not Minister for Finance, so that some other way out will have to be found. Having given some consideration to this matter before, and having listened to the speeches which have been made in the course of the debate, I think this House is quite justified in voting in accordance with its own feelings in regard to these cuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am more convinced by the arguments <Col N="335" /> put forward by Senator The McGillycuddy than by any other arguments which have been made here to-day.  In particular, I believe the Senator was on very sound ground when he said that it was a very great pity that the question of the status of the Guards and their salaries should be brought into a general &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; Bill.  We all know that the question of the &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; has been and will be bandied around and has been one of the biggest issues a general elections.  Whatever arrangements may be made in regard to the Guards should&mdash;and this applies to the Army as well&mdash;deal with these services particularly, after discussion with representatives of these services, and they should not be brought into a general &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; Bill.  Most of the national teachers, for instance, have their representatives in the Dáil They are well represented there.  They have votes and they have a very considerable political influence.  Senator Comyn will say that the Guards have political influence also.  I do not say that they have no influence but I do say that both Parties would feel very aggrieved if at the time of an election that, influence was unduly or improperly used or if the Guards interfered in the election.  This fact makes it incumbent on this, as the Second Chamber, carefully to consider the circumstances in regard to these &ldquo;cuts.&rdquo;  While in the case of the national teachers, who have a very strong political representation, we may say this is a money matter and should be left to the Dáil, I say that in the case of the Guards, we are dealing with a non-political matter and we would be justified in sending forward a suggestion of this kind to the other House if we really believed that a case has been made for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech is very interesting.  It was to some of us a matter of considerable satisfaction to hear him defend the action of his predecessor with such vigour and obvious conviction.  That is all to the good.  I am not making use of that observation in any slighting way.  I think it is a good thing it should be so, but I was <Col N="336" /> very much surprised and somewhat alarmed at the general run of his arguments in relation to this amendment. I think they arose out of a remark by Senator Sir William Hickie.  His first argument was that this was a purely temporary Bill, but almost the whole of his argument was for a permanent cut.  The second argument was that you cannot in a Bill of this kind, pick and choose.  I have not got a very wide knowledge of the services of the State, but it seems to me that that is the very thing this Bill does.  There is a very considerable amount of picking and choosing.  I think that is to a large extent inevitable and I am not too critical in regard to it.  I regard the Government as being in the position of employers generally in that respect. They have to pick and choose and they have to consider the services rendered in deciding on the remuneration to be paid.  I believe that the importance of the services rendered by the Guards in this State is such that it it not desirable to pay them a substantially lower scale than is being paid in Great Britain, in Northern Ireland and in other countries as well.  The Minister states that the resources of Great Britain and, incidentally, those of Northern Ireland are greater than those of this State.  I know he is a loyal Ulsterman, but I doubt the statement in regard to Northern Ireland. Even if that were so, I am satisfied that in the building up of a new State in which we have had such unfortunate circumstances in the past&mdash;a State in which we have two large Parties which, for a period, have between them been responsible for the Government and the maintenance of order&mdash;the maintenance of a proper police force may be clearly regarded as one of the most important objects which either Government should uphold.  To bring this force into a temporary &ldquo;Cuts&rdquo; Bill is a mistake of the first order.</P>
    <P>Whatever may ultimately happen, I believe that this House would be justified in asking the other House if it believes this was a mistake to amend the Bill accordingly.  Personally I am not going to vote for any other amendment of a general character which would affect any large class of the community, <Col N="337" /> but on giving the matter consideration, I think an exception should be made, and that it can properly be made in the case of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I was interested in the Minister's speech to see how he argued from one angle only, that which included the cost of living.  From that point of view he made an extremely good case.  He failed to deal with the point that the pay of the Guards, all selected men, is being gradually scaled down to the pay and perquisites of labourers who have not to have the same qualifications. As to the question of rent allowances, the amount in rural districts and in small towns is £13.  The Accounting Officer for the Vote stated that there is power to increase that amount to a sum not exceeding a maximum of £18 in large towns to £26 in Cork, Limerick and Waterford and to £30 in Dublin.  That is an admission that one-half of the Gárda is concentrated in big towns.  Possibly I put the price of a bicycle somewhat high, but the other kind would be a poor type of machine.  Has the Minister considered what would happen in a country like Meath if these men refused to avail of the bicycle allowance.  If the Guards decided to walk, would not that mean an enormous increase in the number of Gárdaí that would be required? I do not suggest that the Guards would refuse to do the duty, but I draw the Minister's attention to the point that by taking the bicycle allowance and covering 20 or 30 miles a day there has been a saving to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to offer a few comments on the Minister's reply.  The Minister's speech was admittedly a very clever one, and he was probably impressed with his arguments.  The Minister would have the House believe that the beginning of the Guards, as far as pay was concerned, was in 1924 and not 1922.  The Guards were established in 1922 and had a great deal of dangerous and unpleasant work to do between 1922 and 1924.  Their rates <Col N="338" /> of pay were fixed on the basis of the Report of the Desborough Commission from which the following is an extract:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In considering the standard rate of pensionable pay which we should recommend, we have taken into account, not merely or even mainly, the rates of pay in force before the war and the percentage to be added in consideration of the increase in the cost of living, but we have endeavoured to appraise as well as we can the services rendered by the police to the community; the standard of qualifications required and the rate of remuneration which seem to us to be reasonable and proper in all the circumstances and likely to attract recruits of the right stamp.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be seen that they did not mainly consider the question of an increase in respect of the cost of living.  The rates fixed enabled a guard to start at 70/- instead of 50/- now, and to go to 95/- instead of 83/-, which is the present maximum. The late Government came along with the axe in 1924 and they hacked that down by 14 per cent.  The Minister would have us assume that the rate for the Guards was that of 1924. Moreover, if it was the original intention that the cost of living should figure in the rates of pay why was not a sliding scale established for them, as in the case of the Civil Service generally.  Why was not the pay of the police across the Border, and in Great Britain, whose wages were fixed in accordance with the Desborough Commission Report altered to meet the reduction in the cost of living?  It was only a mere assumption&mdash;a mere statement of the Minister for Finance in the Dáil&mdash; but a passing statement made by a Minister does not alter the facts of the situation.  The facts are that the Desborough Report, admittedly fixed the rates of pay, and that they have been very considerably cut into since. The Minister states that the Guards have made no application through their representative body for an increase of pay since 1924.  Because <Col N="339" /> they have not done so, that seems to be an indication to him that they are well enough paid, if not too well paid.  That is a very straight hint to the Guards that, in order to impress the Minister that they should not have their rates of pay cut, they must be sending in periodical applications for increases.  Similarly it is a broad hint to the civil servants.  He said that if they did not include them in the cut it would be an admission on their part that they were not paid high enough for the last ten years.  Why is it that civil servants with £350 per annum are free from any cut?  Is that an admission on the Minister's part that the Civil Service was not paid highly enough for the last ten years?</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of differentiation, as Senator Douglas pointed out, the Bill is bristling with inequalities. A teacher with £140 is cut 5 per cent. while a civil servant with £300 gets no cut.  The teachers can prove that since 1922 they have suffered reductions equivalent to what civil servants have suffered in the cost-of-living bonus.  The Minister made very light of the cut in the cycling allowance.  It may be a small thing as perhaps, in his opinion 50/- a year, or 1/- a week is sufficient for the maintenance of a bicycle.  Across the border the allowance is £3 per annum plus a mileage rate of 2d per mile, with a maximum of £1 per month, and a further maximum of £15 yearly.  All the change that has taken place there is that the maximum has been reduced to £14 per annum for a bicycle.  I cannot imagine that in regulating the maximum for the police force across the Border they were extravagantly generous and that there was not some real justification for making this allowance.  While the boot allowance has been reduced in other places the allowance made here has been taken away altogether.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Bill must stand as a whole and that everything goes crash if any amendment is made.  He might have made a similar argument in the other House.  Surely a Bill is never so watertight that <Col N="340" /> certain adjustments cannot be made. In view of the fact that it is bristling with differentiations and that some thousands of civil servants are escaping any cuts in salaries, we are not going to have a collapse of social order because the Guards are not compelled to make further contributions to national finances.  I do not think anybody need have any great terror of the fresh taxation that will have to be imposed in order to recoup the Minister what he will lose if the Guards do not have to pay.  No fresh taxation will be necessary.  In any case we heard about a loan that is to be floated to meet expenditure.  I do not say that it should be floated to pay the salaries of the Guards, but if a loan is being floated for some millions of money, the question of £30,000 should not debar the Minister from agreeing to what is an act of simple justice, and one which may have very vital consequences for the good order in this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his reply gave some quotations.  If I cared to give certain quotations from official statements issued by the Party of which the Minister is such a distinguished member, with regard to the rates of wages paid, and if I were to quote statements made by the President on a famous occasion with regard to what salaries should be, I think I would blow away his case.  The Minister referred to the position of single men.  It is well known that the bulk of the Gárda, about 97 per cent. of them, are sons of small farmers. Even though these men are single, very often they have greater domestic responsibilities than some married men.  Does not everyone know that they help the people at home?  If some of the guards are not married it is not their fault.  Do they not suffer from the disability that if they marry without the permission of their superiors, they get no marriage allowances? I think it is a bad thing to have an underpaid police force.  I do not think the Guards are overpaid. No one will admit that they are overpaid. I could quote higher rates of wages paid to men who do not require to have the same standard of efficiency, mentally or physically, as the Guards. <Col N="341" /> We ought to aim at getting a police force which is up to a high standard. It has been proved that our police force has been able to overcome the crooks and wrongdoers who come here from other countries.  I think they are doing their duty very well.  It is a bad principle to bring their pay below the level at which it now stands and, accordingly, I ask the House to pass the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been influenced in the least by the speeches that were made in support of the amendment. As the Minister pointed out it is absolutely impossible to pick out one section from the Bill and to let the position of the rest stand, because we would then reach the position that when conditions changed and when this Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill was no longer necessary the people who had been exempted under this amendment would be entitled to claim further increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to some of the speeches convinces me that many of the members of this House are not in touch, so to speak, with the masses of the people.  I could understand various members of the Opposition speaking in support of the amendment, but I find it very difficult to understand the arguments put up by the representatives of Labour in this House.  Various reasons have been put forward as to why this amendment should be accepted and as to why the Guards, of all others, should be relieved from contribution under this measure.  Somebody suggested that the Guards would, if they came within the provisions of this Bill, be a dissatisfied force and would not give the service they gave in the past.  I am sure that the Senators who made these statements know as well as I do that such a condition would not naturally follow as a result of the passing of this Bill.  Every day applications are being sent in by very desirable young men for admission to the Gárda Síochána.  I do not suggest that the men who are now applying are in any great measure, if at all, superior to the men in the force.  But I do say it is ridiculous to suggest that all the good men, all the decent <Col N="342" /> men and all the brave men in the country have already been drafted into the Gárda Síochána, and that if they got dissatisfied, they could never be replaced.</P>

      <P>I find it very hard to see eye to eye on this matter with the Labour representatives in this House. It was pointed out that if the salaries of the Guards were reduced it would cause great dissatisfaction in the country.  I do not agree at all with any such statement.  I believe that if the salaries of any section were increased, or even allowed to stand at their present level, while every other section of the community must suffer as a result of world conditions, or of conditions in this country, the people in the different localities would be a little uneasy.  They would be a little bit anxious if, while they were allowed to suffer to a very great extent, members of the Gárda Síochána, or any other section of the Government service were allowed to carry on as they had carried on when things were better &mdash;that they should be called upon to maintain such an expensive service while they were compelled to reduce their own standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason whatever for making a comparison with the police force in this country and the police force in other countries and arguing that the police here is not paid on the same basis as other forces.  That, to my mind, is absolutely ridiculous. Surely, the police force, or any other force of a country, must be paid in proportion to the capacity of the people who are paying them.  If we were to look up the history of other countries, we would probably find that a policeman in the pay of some such State as Butte, Montana, in the gold days would have been receiving a salary per day greater than that of a chief superintendent of the Gárda Síochána per year.  It would not be at all unreasonable to find that such <Col N="343" /> a thing happened.  I saw in the papers the other day where the gold shoes with which a miner shod his horse were now being thrown into the melting pot.  It is not unreasonable to expect that a ridiculous comparison could be dug up in this way whereby a man would be at liberty to suggest that the salaries paid to the Guards should be increased to some extraordinary extent.  I oppose the amendment and I support the Bill as it stands.  Regardless of what official Cumann na nGaedheal or of what the official Centre Party, the Farmers and Ratepayers' Party, or even the Labour Party may say to the contrary, I am perfectly convinced that this Bill, as it stands, is a popular Bill.</P>

      <P>The last speaker is surprised that the Labour Party should oppose these cuts.  Of course, the Labour Party oppose them.  They oppose them on broad principles and on the specific ground that the miserable amount obtained from the Guards in this way will not make for the objects which the Labour Party have in view.  On the contrary, I maintain that this £40, approximately, by which the salary of the unmarried guard is being cut will be a distinct injury to the most deserving class in the community&mdash;next to labour, perhaps. I refer to the small farmers, some of them in possession of uneconomic holdings.  It is from the small farming class that the force is largely drawn.  I know that many homesteads are kept from a state of penury by the contributions of the guards.  I know that the guards are at the moment assisting sisters and other relatives unable to get employment but who, at one time, occupied important positions, carrying substantial remuneration.  Apart from the general effect of the cuts upon these people, reference has been made to the dissatisfaction which will be caused.  Undoubtedly, the cuts will cause immense dissatisfaction.  Forty pounds will have been taken off the miserable salary of the lowest paid police in the world if this Bill comes into force.</P>

      <P>Yes, since 1922.  I was surprised to hear Senator Quirke speak of maintaining &ldquo;a most expensive force.&rdquo;  Will anybody agree with the Senator that, during the last ten years, the Gárda Síochána service has been an expensive service?  I am surprised that the suggestion should be made.  The Gárda Síochána gave good service to the community, irrespective of party.  In times of great difficulty, when political feeling ran high, the Gárda Síochána dealt out even-handed justice.  In such circumstances I cannot understand how any Senator can describe the service as &ldquo;expensive.&rdquo; The cut which is now proposed is having its effects in the country.  It is having the effect upon those who contemplated entering the service. They know that they will have no security whatever.  They have no guarantee as to what their position will be or whether these cuts will take place year after year.  Various grades of the public services have been left untouched.  There is a very wide field outside the employment of the Government which the Government could explore, and I say they should direct their attention to that field rather than to cuts in the salaries of the Gárda. I was very much impressed by the suggestion of Senator Douglas, that when it was proposed to rearrange salaries &mdash;I do not regard this as a mere cut; it is a readjustment of salaries&mdash;the proper course was to bring in a separate Bill.  After consultation with those authorised to speak on behalf of the Guards, that course could easily be adopted.  If there is one body of men in respect of whom the big stick should not be wielded it is this body. I suggest to the Minister that even at the eleventh hour, if he finds it absolutely impossible to exclude the Guards, he should deal with them through the medium of a separate Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 6, sub-section (1).  To delete sub-paragraph (iii) of paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>In moving this amendment, I feel that I am embarking on a more or less forlorn hope, mainly for the reason that the amount looked for in the way of economies from the teachers equals, I think, about 62 per cent. of the total economies contemplated by the Bill. One of the principal arguments against this proposal to include the teachers in the manner in which they have been included is the inequitable way in which they have been dealt with, as compared with the civil service.  A civil servant must have £400 a year in order to be asked to make any sacrifice at all, and then he is only asked to make a sacrifice of 2 per cent.  The teacher is cut 5 per cent. right from the lowest figure.  The justification for that type of inequality is that civil servants have made contributions, by way of reductions in bonus, that justify their exemption up to the figure of £400.  Well, I am not going to argue in favour of including anybody that is not in the Bill.  My anxiety is to have similar treatment extended to the teachers.  The teachers themselves point out that, in the case of a civil servant with a combined salary and bonus of £370 a year in 1922, and a teacher with the same salary, the contributions made since in the aggregate, over the ten year period, are £105 greater on the part of the teacher than of the civil servant, and they argue that the same principle operates throughout.  The teachers had a cut of 10 per cent. in 1923 or beginning of 1924.  In addition they have had cuts in their allowances since which brings their total aggregate cut to about 12 per cent.  That, spread over the period, means that they have, unit per unit, given up not only as much but more by way of income as the civil servant.  Why then should they be treated in the manner in which they have been treated?  They get cuts as high as 8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill I sought to prove, and I think I proved to the satisfaction of the House, that the cut in respect to the teachers involves a definite breach of faith on the part of the Government, as pledged by the President himself to the teachers.  The Minister was unable to counter that, but he stated: what was the position before the last election?  The teachers knew well themselves that the cut was going <Col N="347" /> to be imposed and they failed to make an issue of it at the election; they certainly had no doubt in their minds as to what was going to happen, and the Government indicated beyond all doubt that they intended to cut the salaries of teachers.  Well, I do not think that is the position.  The teachers state that the President himself told their members at Westport in January last, just prior to the election, that he would abide by the spirit of his declaration made at Rathmines previous to the 1932 election.  To make sure, the teachers in Mayo sent a deputation to two of their representatives in the Dáil&mdash;to Mr. Ruttledge, the present Minister for Justice, and to Mr. Cleary, who is a very vocal back bencher of the Government Party.  They reported back to the teachers' executive in Mayo to this effect: Mr. Ruttledge stated that there was no cut in contemplation, the whole trouble being the pension fund and that the teachers might be asked to contribute towards this fund.  In this connection, he said he could not oppose a contribution from the teachers to the pension fund.  Incidentally, I may say that they are contributing to it at present. He said definitely that he was against cuts in teachers' salaries and that if there were to be any cuts in the salaries of public servants generally his Party would begin at the top. His Party looked upon the money spent on primary education as money well spent as the majority of people get no other education.  Mr. Cleary stated that there was no intention of cutting teachers' salaries.  An assurance from the President himself together with an assurance given by one of his Ministers would normally be quite satisfactory and quite sufficient for any trade union.  They would not require every Minister to give an assurance because they would naturally assume that that might create some embarrassment politically. All that they wanted, and they looked upon it as a reliable assurance, was that the spirit of the original pledge given by the President was going to be observed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> I think these instances are sufficient reply to the Minister's statement on the Second Reading to the effect that the teachers were well aware that the cuts were going to operate after this election.  These cuts have been justified also on the ground that they are only of a temporary character, but the Minister made a rather alarming statement during the Second Reading of the Bill when dealing with the question of teachers' salaries and the proposals that he made to the teachers in June of last year.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I met the teachers and I put certain proposals before them which represented at that time the absolute limit of concession, a limit that will never again be reached so long as I have any responsibility for the national finances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does that mean that, if the Minister is in office a year hence or three years hence, these cuts will still continue because we were given to understand that this was just a temporary provision and the Bill itself so states?  Yet he states that the offer he made to the teachers last June was the best they will get while he is in office.  Another point that puzzles one is why he made worse the offer he made in June last. Would he, even at this stage, consider reverting to the flat rate cut of 5 per cent.?  Is he determined that because that offer was not accepted by the Fianna Fáil Executive, elected on a slogan of &ldquo;no cuts,&rdquo; which made it impossible for them to accept the offer, the teachers are going to be mulcted to the extent, in some cases, of 3 per cent. more?  I scarcely think he would like to be vindictive to that extent or, alternatively, is it because the national finances now are so much worse than they were a year ago?  The increase in the amount of the cut has been a puzzle not only to me but to the teachers themselves and to anybody who has considered the situation, and it would lead one to believe that a certain amount of vindictiveness or resentment at the failure of the teachers to accept what was offered to them has entered into the consideration of the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very pleasant thing to stand up here as the champion <Col N="349" /> of the various classes of the community, firstly, the commissioned officers; secondly, the Gárda Síochána; and, next, the national teachers, and it is a rather invidious thing to speak against the reduction of salaries of these various classes.  I should like to say for Senator O'Farrell's information that in the Government there is, so far as I know, no feeling of vindictiveness or ill-will against the national teachers, but there is considerable pressure from those who are farmers in this country and who consider that they represent the interests of the farmer that salaries should bear some sort of relation to the capacity of the people to pay.  I do not like to say one word against the national teachers, but when we are reminded that their salaries were so much in 1922, and that there has been a reduction, I would like to recall what their salaries were in 1917 and 1918.  There were considerable increases in salaries, I think, about the year 1919 and there have been some reductions since.  If this method, admittedly a temporary method, of helping out the finances of the country is the one to be resorted to, namely, reductions in the salaries of public servants, I certainly shall support it, because it is necessary in order to relieve the tax-paying community whose incomes have been very greatly reduced.  I would have preferred, I say again, another method of dealing with the question which would not have involved any reduction in the nominal rate of salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions of the present time are not normal.  There is in progress an economic war, or a dispute, call it what you like, with Great Britain involving penal tariffs on the other side and involving hardship to the great class in this country&mdash;the farming class, the agriculturists, and those whose livelihood depends on agriculture, whether they are farmers or country shopkeepers.  Are they to be the only people to suffer as a result of this dispute?  I would have imagined that all classes in the country would gladly bear their share of the hardship or inconvenience which undoubtedly results from the dispute now going on.  The effect of the dispute <Col N="350" /> has been that the value of salaries of all kinds has greatly appreciated.  A comparison between some of these gentlemen and the labouring man does not hold.  When it is said that the labouring man has 25/-, 30/- or 35/- a week, I ask is that permanent?  How many labouring men have been put out of employment in the country in the last six or 12 months as a result&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdmundJDuggan" hpid="Mr. Duggan Mr. Duggan">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the dispute and how very few labouring men have complained. No, they are patriotic.  The poor labouring men of this country are patriotic and they have made very little complaint.  Are they sure of permanent employment?  Is the farmer sure of the sale of his cattle?  Senator The McGillycuddy said that we were triyng to reduce police officers and teachers to the status of the labouring man, and he said, airily, that the labouring man gets 5/-, 7/6 or 8/6 a day.  He reminded me of a barrister whom I once knew.  He said, when he got a two guinea brief: &ldquo;Well, to-day I am living at the rate of £720 a year.&rdquo; Is Senator The McGillycuddy going to give the agricultural labourer 7/6 a day permanently or will he only give it to him while he is saving hay or digging potatoes?  He will not, of course, give it to him for digging potatoes. There are two classes in this community who are suffering and who are not at all inclined to be humorous about these salaries&mdash;the farmers whose incomes are reduced and the farm labourer whose employment is likely to be curtailed&mdash;and they ought to be considered. I feel that it is a very pleasant thing to join in a chorus of pleasant speeches and to speak for a particular class and to back them up and to be able to say later: &ldquo;I supported you against that terrible Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  It is a very nice thing to say, but the people who ought to be considered in this struggle, above all others&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator, evidently, holds the farmers entirely responsible for the cut in teachers' salaries.  I deny that his statement is at all justified by the facts.  As a matter of fact, the majority of the teachers come from the small farming class.  When the farmers were getting fabulous prices during the peak period, were the teachers jealous, or did they wish for a moment that the price of the farmers' stock would be reduced?  Did they suggest that it would help them in any way if the farmers got a lesser price for their produce?  We can argue from a similar standpoint in regard to the present relations as between the farmers and the school teachers of the country. Will it benefit the farmers if the teacher, after 35 or 38 years' service, suffers a cut amounting, if we include everything, to 22½ per cent., practically one-fourth of his salary?  Will it benefit them to have the spending power decreased in every locality where the teacher and his family live?  It is well known that teachers are not hoarders and that they spend their money in the locality in which they live, educate their families, and give their services to the nation, and that the money passes through their hands.  We do not see, in the records of deaths and legacies, teachers scheduled as being amongst those who leave enormous sums of money behind them.  I know of no teacher of my acquaintance&mdash;and I have a very long service&mdash;who is in possession of wealth. Their money circulates in the community in which they reside and not a penny of it goes out of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not fair, I think, to charge the farmers with this.  I know that we have farmers in this House who, unfortunately, cannot be convinced that the teachers have any case whatever. The picture is always present to their minds of the two married <Col N="352" /> teachers, but it is very often force of circumstances that brings about these matters.  I do not say that they are all love affairs.  There are conditions governing the life of the teacher in rural districts that very often make necessary an amalgamation of the heads of the male and female schools in a particular place, and if those things happen, surely they should not be taken as typical?  It is well known that married lady teachers are most efficient and it is well known that they earn their salary very dearly.  If she has to leave her home and carry out her work successfully she has to employ at least one servant, and, if the Almighty is kind to her in other ways, she has to employ two or three, so that money is paid out in labour. She is not a hoarder.  It is not fair, and I would plead with the farmers here on this matter.</P>
    <P>There are very few farmers, I am sure, who have not got associations with teachers.  The great trouble is the question of the dual salaries, together with the motor car which used to be looked on as an article of luxury, but which is now an absolute essential in the life of many teachers if they are to do their duty successfully. Teachers very often live long distances from their schools and their effectiveness and utility would be greatly decreased if they did not have this very essential means of transport to carry out their engagements.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the alarming statement referred to by Senator O'Farrell.  It has caused the very greatest alarm and very great disappointment. The picture which teachers conjured up of the Minister for Finance when he made his promise, when he attacked the late Minister for Finance for daring to interfere with the teachers' pensions, has been transformed. The idol has crashed.  The statement referred to was of a most alarming character.  Might I remind the Minister for Finance that he could have repeated the offer he made last June?  Things must have come to a deplorable pass in the country when the Minister was induced to make that statement.  Let us hope that it was merely through pique or for some other <Col N="353" /> unaccountable reason that the Minister allowed that statement to slip.  I do hope that he will have an opportunity of setting our minds right on the matter now.  The farmers may again get good prices for their cattle and I hope that the teachers will not then be excluded from their share in that prosperity and that, in these circumstances, the threat which the Minister issued on Friday week will not be carried out.  When the Vote on the teachers' salaries was taken in the Dáil there were only 93 Deputies present and in such a House there was only a majority of 27 in favour of the cut.  I maintain that that is not a strong mandate or that it does not represent a very large percentage of the people.</P>
    <P>On the question of equality of treatment, I think that most misleading statements have been made.  No other sections with such small salaries have been affected as the teachers have been. The case of the Guards is bad enough but what about the teacher, who after several years' training is paid a salary of only £2 12s. 6d. per week?  I maintain that it is almost impossible for a young teacher to carry on on that salary in the City of Dublin or to live in any decent locality on such a miserable pittance.  Everybody here knows that after he pays the cost of his board in a decent locality he has very little left.  He must dress above the average if he wants to maintain the decency of his position and to set an example of cleanliness and neatness to those under his charge.  I maintain that a man such as that is in very grave danger of financial embarrassment.  We all know that there are few difficulties which rack the mind so terribly or which have such a distracting effect as financial difficulties.  Any man in the City of Dublin who is compelled to live in a decent locality and who is compelled by force of circumstances to contribute generously to every charitable movement out of a small salary, is in very grave danger of becoming involved in financial troubles.  I maintain that it is very dangerous and that it is a wrong position in which to <Col N="354" /> place  who are entrusted with the care of 80 per cent. of the youth of the country.</P>
    <P>Is it equality of treatment when two-thirds of the £280,000 which the Minister requires is taken off the teachers?  By far the bigger proportion is taken from teachers with salaries of £300 and under because very few reach a salary of £400.  The percentage reaching a salary of £400 is very small.  I should say that not more than five or ten per cent., and they are very favourably circumstanced, reach that standard.  I say that no matter what effort is made to camouflage the treatment of the teachers, there has not been equality of treatment.  The result of these cuts will be fatal to education.  No young man of spirit would think of going into this profession under such circumstances. We may get the poorest of the poor into our colleges and train them for the profession, but will anybody contend for a moment that the poorest of the poor can compete in excellence of brain-power and broadness of outlook with the cream of the young men drawn from other walks of life?</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister said that the teachers were unreasonable men.  Unreasonable in what?  He alleged that he could not deal with them.  Was it unreasonable for the Minister at one period of his career to promise them with all the force of which he is capable that if he got into power there would be no cuts so far as he was concerned?  Was it reasonable for him to attack the previous Minister as a betrayer of the teachers' cause?  It was, in his opinion, a crime on the part of the late Minister to interfere with the educational machine by attacking the grants to the teachers.  After all this unreasonableness on the part of the Minister he states now that the teachers are unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I would ask anybody who has followed the course of events, followed the promises made by the President, <Col N="355" /> the Minister himself, and by prominent members of his Party throughout the country, where the unreasonableness came in?  The old Executive were thrown out of office largely by reason of the promises of the Minister and his colleagues.  Possibly the old Executive were too slow-going for the modern young man, buoyed up by enthusiasm by the promises of Ministers.  If the old Executive had remained, some of the arrangements the Minister offered would probably have been accepted.  One of them was actually accepted by the old Executive and it is here we have a strong grievance against the present Government.  The old Executive accepted a settlement offered by the late Minister and that settlement was condemned by the present Minister.  On the strength of that condemnation, the young members of our profession threw the members of that Executive out of office and brought into power a body who for the most part were sympathisers with the present Government.  These men could not believe their senses when they got into that position.  They could not believe that the Minister of to-day was the same man as last year.  They turned down his offer and surely there was some justification for it.  They could not believe that such a change could take place in the Minister's attitude. Even his own words would not convince them.  The settlement offered in June last year was turned down by that body, a body that was entirely sympathetic with the Minister when he was seeking their votes.  I suggest that the Minister should consider reopening negotiations with them before the Bill passes, on the basis of the offer of last June.  The small amount of money saved by the teachers' cuts will make nobody richer while you would make the teachers and those dependent on them very much poorer indeed and very miserable in their outlook.  It is pitiable.  I cannot describe it as other than a tragedy.</P>
    <P>Two-thirds of this £280,000&mdash;65 per cent.&mdash;is to be taken from the teachers. After all, considered in relation to the <Col N="356" /> total expenditure of the nation, it is only a small amount of money.  Why should all this disturbance, all these heartburnings, all this damping of enthusiasm of the people engaged in the educational work, be brought about for these few miserable pounds that we maintain could be found in other quarters?  It is a tragedy in the history of Education, unparalleled even under the British régime.  For 50 years the teachers of this country worked unselfishly at salaries that were a disgrace to any civilised community. They gave their services freely for the restoration of the language and I maintain that the restoration of the language to the position which it occupies to-day, is in a great measure due to their efforts.  We had teachers leading in the fight in 1916.  We had teachers taking a prominent part in every district in the country.  Has it come to this that the ideals which they set up for themselves, the ideals which they set in national education are to be scrapped for a miserable pittance? I would again appeal to the Minister, without any bitterness of Party spirit, to consider the situation on the basis of the offer made in June last to see whether a compromise could not be arrived at even, with some modification that might be agreeable to all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that some statements made by Senator Cummins ought not to be allowed to go unanswered.  I should like first of all to say this, that I did write some letters to the newspapers. They were written in December, 1931, and they related to one aspect of the settlement which had then been arrived at between the teachers and the Executive Council, but only to one aspect of that settlement, and that was the proposal to hand over to the Minister for Finance the Teachers' Pension Fund.  I never, at any time, condemned my predecessor for looking for, and the teachers for accepting, the cut of 10 per cent. in their pensionable salaries.  I never opposed at any time a settlement on these lines.  I never pledged myself to the teachers that if I came into office, I would not have consideration <Col N="357" /> for the financial circumstances of the country, and would not have to bring about whatever economies might be necessary in order to put its finances on a sound basis.  Personally I did not make that speech.  An undertaking was given in February, 1932, as to the manner in which the Government's proposals regarding economy would have regard to salaries and the general economic position of the individuals to be affected.  Naturally I was bound by that pledge.  In the circumstances in which it was given, and in the light of the defective knowledge which I and other members of the Opposition possessed as to the real financial position of the country, I was asked to accept responsibility as Minister for Finance for the country's finances, and it was clear to me that it would not be possible for us&mdash;no matter how heavily taxation was increased within reasonable limits; as any further increase would result in diminished yield&mdash;to secure a balanced Budget, unless we asked members of the public services to accept some reduction in their salaries for the year 1932-33, ending on the 31st of March last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked representatives of the teachers to meet me in regard to that matter, having already received from them a statement that at a meeting of their organisation held in April, 1932, they had gone back on the agreement which had been made, not merely between the Government on the one hand and the executive of the teachers' organisation on the other hand, but an agreement made by these two bodies and subsequently ratified&mdash; and that is the important point&mdash;by a special congress which was called in December, 1931, in Dublin by a majority of the votes cast, almost two to one.  After I had received intimation that the teachers did not propose in the new circumstances to honour the agreement I asked them to send a deputation to discuss the matter with me.  I pointed out then that in view of the gravity of the situation as disclosed to us when we came into office it would not be possible for me or any other Minister for Finance to carry on without asking the teachers, <Col N="358" /> in common with every other section of the public service, to accept some reduction in their salaries during that year.  After discussion an agreement was arrived at which I had reason to believe was acceptable to the teachers' organisation.  Certainly I thought it was acceptable to the delegates at the conference because the agreement was very much more favourable to the teachers as a whole than that which had been accepted by the special conference to which I refer in 1931.</P>

      <P>I know this, that no special undertaking of that sort was given by them nor sought by me.  I know that the conference between myself and the teachers' representatives broke up in the best of good humour.  As they went out the door the remark was passed that the settlement they had got from the Minister for Finance justified the action that had been taken in regard to the old executive.  What was the position? Here was a body of men, strongly organised and well disciplined, who in 1931 when the financial position was nothing like so serious as it was in June, 1932, had entered into a certain arrangement.  They had departed from that.  They came forward and an alternative offer was made to them which, it is admitted now&mdash;and no one cavils at it&mdash;would be a more advantageous settlement than the one they had previously accepted.  Would not anyone have thought, in these circumstances, that the new agreement would have been accepted with gratitude?  Instead of that it was flung back in my face. I was held to my promise, to the undertaking that there would be no reduction, and there was no reduction during the year that closed on March 31st, 1933.</P>

      <P>In the meantime, a general election had taken place, and it was clearly indicated to the teachers that I did not believe any Government could carry on without asking them to make some contribution.  The teachers asked the President of the Executive Council to renew the undertaking which was given in February, 1932. The President refused.  He stated that he could give no undertaking without consultation and agreement with the Minister for Finance.  No attempt was made, because my mind on the subject was perfectly well known, and no attempt was made to show that the teachers' organisation intended to keep the agreement if it was found necessary, in the circumstances, to ask them to accept the reduction.  I hope once and for all that I have killed the idea that I ever gave a pledge that the agreement of 1931 accepted by the teachers would not be imposed on them except in the circumstances I have related, that it might be considered a pledge as part of the general undertaking given by the President, or that I ever wrote to the newspapers criticising the teachers' organisation or the Government for imposing a cut of 10 per cent.  I did, in the interest of the teachers, as I pointed out, with a view to safeguarding, if I could, the pensions fund for the community as a whole, oppose handing over the pensions fund to the Minister for Finance.  That is all.  That is the only part of the settlement I criticised.  If my letters were produced and read in the Seanad I say that every line would substantiate what I am saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated in regard to this matter that the reductions which we propose to impose on the teachers are inequitable as compared with the reductions we propose to impose on the Civil Service as a whole.  The deductions to be imposed on the Civil Service in this Bill are not the first deductions that civil servants will have suffered since the 31st of December last.  Every member of the Civil Service, no matter what his pay or salary has been, has, by virtue of the cost-of-living agreement, suffered deductions of pay to the 1st of January last, and not merely January <Col N="360" /> last, but virtually every year since the State was established.</P>
    <P>What we propose to do in this Bill is to impose on that portion of the service which is in receipt of more than £300 inclusive a super cut. There is no necessity to bring the lower grades of the Civil Service into the Bill.  Their remuneration has been out already, and out continuously since 1922.  It is not possible for us to institute a natural comparison between the Civil Service and national teachers, on a salary of any given kind in the year 1922, because in the interim both civil servants and teachers would have received increases which would have altered the salaries.  We can take hypothetical cases.  Take the case of a civil servant receiving £100 on the 1st of April, 1922, and receiving no increment since.  That civil servant does not exist.  Take the teacher who had a salary on the 1st April, 1922, and received no increment since. That teacher does not exist either. We can put two hypothetical persons side by side, and see the alteration in salary which each has endured since the 1st April, 1922.  The teacher who on April 1st, 1922, had a salary of £100 would now, in virtue of the cut made in 1924, have only £90. The civil servant whom, according to Senator O'Farrell, we are supposed to be treating with partisanship in this Bill, who had a salary of £100 in April, 1922, would only have £78 1s. now.  If we take £200 the teacher would have £180 and the civil servant £157 3s.; taking £300 the teacher would have £270 and the civil servant £236; taking £400 the teacher would have £360 and the civil servant £322; taking £450 the teacher would have £405 and the civil servant £366. On civil servants with more than £300 inclusive we are imposing a super cut. In fact the position is this: that the operation of the cost-of-living bonus in relation to the Civil Service this year has cost nearly £800,000 less than it did in 1922. The teachers have not made any contribution commensurate with that, nor has any other section <Col N="361" /> of the service.  I do not want to get into the position that I am going to speak for one section of the service more than another.  I am merely concerned to refute the statement of Senator O'Farrell, that the treatment the teachers are receiving under this Bill is unfair, compared with that of civil servants.  I think I have fairly refuted that statement.</P>
    <P>On the question of the offer to which Senator Cummins and Senator O'Farrell have referred, I have detailed the circumstances under which the offer was made.  The first investigation we were able to make of the financial position made it clear that something had got to be done if we were to balance the Budget this year. I had certain proposals which I submitted then to the teachers.  I had certain proposals also for the other public services.  The proposals then made were made by me on the basis of an estimate as to what the probable position would be at the close of the financial year.  They were not given effect to.  They were not accepted by the teachers and, therefore, could not be imposed, because we could not secure acceptance of the agreement by any other section of the Service, and the whole of the economies were held up because of that fact.  A year went by and, at the end I was able to make some examination of what the position would have been if the proposals had been accepted.  I found out this, that leaving out of consideration all the expenditure due to the economic war, and all the special and abnormal revenue which accrued to us on account of that war, I should have a deficit at the close of the financial year of £214,000, approximately the £250,000 we are hoping to get from reductions in the salaries of public servants.  I think the position has not improved this year.  I am not sure that the position is going to improve next year, but, at any rate, I do know now what we must get from all sections of the community, if we are going to be able to pay our way, unless there is a radical change in the circumstances.  Therefore, in view of the information with which I am now armed, I could not in <Col N="362" /> conscience repeat the offer I made last June.  That offer is dead.  The teachers' executive put the proposals to the organisation as a whole and the organisation as a whole rejected them. The opposition to the June settlement was led by the people who accepted the settlement of December, 1931.  That offer is dead.  It has been killed and buried by the teachers' organisation itself.</P>
    <P>A problem still remains to be settled &mdash;the problem of the Teachers' Pension Fund.  It must be settled one way or another and it must be settled soon because the Pensions Fund is being gradually liquidated.  The deficit is growing heavier and heavier and somebody must step in to deal with the situation.  Ultimately, if the matter was allowed to drift, the responsibility for providing the teachers' pensions would probably be thrown back on the public Exchequer.  Therefore, if the teachers who are also a party to, and also vitally concerned in, this matter are not going to take any steps to assist us, the Government will have to deal with it itself.  If the Government has got to make a settlement in respect of the Teachers' Pension Fund, and in making that settlement is not going to have the co-operation of the teachers, then the settlement will have to be based, so far as we can see, in large part upon the proposals contained in Part IV of this Schedule.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to one or two remarks which the Minister made.  He professed to prove that he did not make any promise regarding the non-cutting of teachers' salaries. So far as I am concerned, I never suggested he did.  But I did quote the definite pledge given by the President and we must, of course, hold the President responsible for what the Minister for Finance does in a matter of high policy.  He admitted that he did write to the teachers regarding the suggestion that the pension fund should be handed over to the Minister for Finance, or, as he said, &ldquo;to the tender mercies of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo; Strange to say, his offer of June of last year to the teachers embraced an exactly similar proposition&mdash;that the fund should be handed over to his tender mercies.  His speech indicated that the delegates from the I.N.T.O. were rather agreeable to accepting the offer made by him, but that they were turned down by a majority of their organisation.  That, I think, is news to all associated with the I.N.T.O.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general inference was that the new Executive, which had been elected on the slogan of &ldquo;no cuts,&rdquo; could not possibly, and did not make, any recommendation to their people to accept a cut.  The teachers will, no doubt, be astounded to hear that their Executive were at all favourable to accepting this offer in view of the mandate which they received when elected.  The Minister suggested, too, that the opposition was principally composed of people who were willing to accept a cut from the late Government.  If that is the case it meant practically the whole of the teachers, because I do not think there was any support in the teachers' organisation, since the new Minister came into power, for a cut.  These statements, consequently, do not tally. The position really was that the old <Col N="364" /> Executive had, rightly or wrongly, considered a cut and suggested the acceptance of that cut to their members. That was accepted, but a revolt was started within the organisation&mdash; a revolt led by prominent supporters of Fianna Fáil and supported, outside the organisation, by members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  That revolt was successful.  The old Executive was thrown out and a new Executive, avowedly pro-Fianna Fáil, was returned and you have the result you have to-day.  You have the very embarrassing position of the present president of the I.N.T.O. being called upon by his branches all over the country to resign his seat in the Dáil, or his membership of the Fianna Fáil Party, and being called upon by his Whip to take other action.  He is torn between two loves and the Party Whip prevails. That is a very difficult position to occupy, but it is the child of the interference of politicians for political purposes in trade union affairs.  The politicians poked their noses into the affairs of the I.N.T.O. and thereby took away from the Executive of that organisation the power to negotiate with any prospect of being able to deliver the goods.  When politicians do that, they must not be disappointed or surprised when they become Ministers if they find the executive of the organisation they have helped to disrupt unable to act as plenipotentiaries or to negotiate a settlement with them. All that remains is the imposition by enactment, or force, of terms which the great majority of the members are not agreeable to accept.  That is the position of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation to-day, and I sincerely hope that, as a result of it, politicians will in the future mind their own business, follow the legitimate activities of politicians, and not try to disrupt trade unions for their own purposes.</P>

      <P>I should like to correct one statement which has been made.  All the blame seems to be thrown on the teachers' organisation in connection with the Blythe offer and other offers.  That is not correct.  At a special conference of teachers in December, 1931, the Blythe offer was <Col N="365" /> accepted.  That special conference was not the governing body of the teachers. The governing body of the teachers met at Easter in annual conference. Between December and that Easter meeting, the famous statement was made by the President at Rathmines, in which he definitely suggested that no cuts would be proposed by his Government if they got into power.  On the strength of that statement, congress rejected the Blythe offer in 1932.  There is no doubt whatever about that.  All this trouble had arisen by reason of the attitude taken by the supporters of the present Ministry and by the words of the President at Rathmines.  That was definitely the reason for the rejection of the Blythe offer in 1932 at the annual parliament of the teachers.  The teachers were misguided and, consequently, this unfortunate position has arisen.</P>

I am afraid the application of it will have serious consequences for a number of people who are not directly under the control of the State, whose remuneration has been fixed not as if they were State servants and who do not enjoy many of the privileges that State servants enjoy.

      <P>I would remind the House of the fact that, at the time of the transfer in 1922, the Provisional Government was in the position that it had to provide a civil service.  As I said before, my friend, the Minister for Finance, was engaged in a different form of service at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duggan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I said all that before, and I say it again.  It is true that while we were trying to create a civil service the Minister was trying to prevent our creating it.  That is a fact that nobody can deny, either in this House or elsewhere.  A number of civil servants decided to enter the service under us at the time.  We had no means of getting a civil service other than to accept the service of those who were in the service at the time.  We could not get a civil service by putting an advertisement in the newspapers just as one might put in an advertisement for casual labourers.  We had to take those who were in the service at the time.  We took them over.  I think that those who accepted service under us at that particular period, with whatever rights they had at the time as regards service and pensions, are entitled to have their rights protected by statute. I think my Friend Senator Comyn would agree with me on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out further that there were certain people in the employment of the State at that time who decided to exercise the right given to them and left the service. They had the option of coming over <Col N="367" /> under us, but they did not.  They left the employment they had in the State service and had to be paid their pensions.  In addition, we had to get other people to take their place.  The position, therefore, was that we had to pay twice: to pay pensions to those who went out on pension, and salaries to those who were appointed to fill their positions.  I suggest that, in the circumstances, the Minister should accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Senator has made any strong case for his amendment.  In fact, I do not think any person could make a strong case for it.  First of all, I would like to point out that there is nothing in this Bill that in any way diminishes the existing rights of transferred officers.  There is a good deal of misapprehension in the mind of the public as to what those rights actually are. A transferred officer had the option either to remain in the service and, remaining in it, at the date of transfer to serve in it on the same terms and conditions as any other officer in the service, or he had the right to elect to go out.  If he did elect to go out, then he had the right to have his pension and retiring allowance fixed according to a certain prescribed scale.  As against that, he had the safeguard that he could not be compelled to continue to serve under the Government of the Irish Free State unless his conditions of employment, as existing at date of his transfer, were to be continued to him.  If they were altered in any way to his detriment, he had the right, subsequently more exactly defined in the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act of 1929 to go before the Transferred Officers' Tribunal, and to prove there that his conditions had been altered to his detriment.  If he succeeded in proving that to the satisfaction of the tribunal, then he was entitled to retire upon the prescribed terms to which I have already referred.  Now there is nothing in this Bill which in any way diminishes the right of a transferred officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That point was not raised when that section was before the House.  There is nothing in this Bill that will preclude the transferred officer from going before the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Tribunal and making the case there that his salary has been reduced, and that consequently his conditions of service have been altered to his detriment.  I am not going in any way to prejudice the free decision of the tribunal in reference to that.  In any case the way is open to the transferred officer to go before the tribunal.  We are not stopping him.  That is the only right that the transferred officer has had since 1922: that in the event of the Minister for Finance not accepting the contention of a transferred officer that his conditions of service had been altered to his detriment, he has the right to go before this tribunal to get the issue determined between himself and the Minister.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, in view of the fact that the Bill does not take away from that right, that the House should not accept this amendment.  Apart altogether from that, there is the practical consideration which arises: that the transferred officers constitute almost one-half of the existing Civil Service. They are a section of the service which have very special rights and privileges.  They are safeguarded much more than the other section of the Civil Service.  If you are going to exempt the transferred officer, with the existing safeguard which he has from this Bill, it seems to me that the logical conclusion would be to exempt the whole Civil Service, and if you exempt the whole Civil Service, having exempted the Gárdaí, is it worth while to proceed with the Bill at all?  Now that seems to me to be a conclusive case against the acceptance of the amendment.  First of all the rights of a transferred officer are not interfered with in any way under the Bill; secondly, if you exempt him in the manner laid down in the amendment, then it would seem to me that you ought to exempt the whole Civil Service.  If you do that, then the Seanad should not have given a Second Reading to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to bring before the House a particular case I have in mind.  Take the Dublin Metropolitan Police.  They were taken over by us when we took control here in 1922.  A considerable number of them took advantage of Article X.  They went out and got their pensions under the Treaty.  We had to pay their pensions and, in addition, to pay the men who were employed to do the work they had been doing.  What I am interested in is to ensure that under this Bill we will not have to be doing that sort of thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate but for the statement which the Minister has just made.  I do not profess to have a very profound knowledge of law, but the statement of the Minister was that there is nothing in this Bill which diminishes the existing rights of transferred officers.  He went on to elaborate that point.  I think he insisted on the rights that transferred officers had prior to this Bill, and said &ldquo;We are not interfering with them by this Bill.&rdquo;  This, of course, is an amendment to Section 6, but in view of the provision in Section 5 I do not know how the Minister can maintain that position.  Section 5 seems to have been inserted in order to provide for the contingency that in the future one of those transferred officers may go before this tribunal and make the claim that his conditions of service have been worsened; in other words, that the conditions of the contract into which he entered with the Saorstát Government have been altered to his detriment.  Then Section 5 of the Bill specifically says that &ldquo;a deduction of salary shall not operate to terminate such contract.&rdquo;  I think it is common sense and fair play to assume that if an employee enters into a contract&mdash;in this case the employee being a civil servant and the employer the State&mdash; on certain terms, and that at a certain time the State says: &ldquo;We are going to alter those terms to your detriment,&rdquo; then I think the employee is entitled to say that that terminates the contract.  Here you have a section which expressly anticipates such action by the aggrieved party, and <Col N="370" /> precludes his making such a claim. In view of that how can the Minister maintain the contention he has made? Deputy Duggan's amendment is intended to avert such a prejudicial effect, in the case of a transferred officer taking place consequent on the operation of Section 5.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to think that it would be rather difficult for the House to pass this amendment as it stands because, if there is any truth in the Minister's statement&mdash;and I take it that there is no question about the Minister's statement being correct&mdash;it would cover nearly half the Civil Service. Having passed the Second Stage of the Bill, I do not see how we could carry this particular amendment.  The Minister's own statement contained a statement something similar to the words in amendment No. 20, which looks the same but which, as a matter of fact, deals with a totally different thing and which gives an assurance that nothing in the Bill should be taken to interfere with the rights of particular persons to appeal to the tribunal.  The Minister says that the Bill does not take away that right, and I take it that he has no objection to the principle. I would, therefore, urge the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I am. It goes to the root of the whole Bill.  If the Seanad would wish it, I am prepared to argue the point raised by Senator Milroy as to the effect of Section 5.  I think the <Col N="371" /> Senator is under a complete misapprehension as to the effect of that section as it is in the Bill.  First of all, it is not clear that Section 5 would apply to a civil servant at all.  It does more particularly apply to persons who might come within the ambit of Part III of the Bill, people who would have a definite contract of service.  I do not want to commit myself at this stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister insert some provision to ensure that Section 5 shall not apply to transferred civil servants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to do that either, because it has not been decided, in the courts here, anyhow, whether a servant has or has not a contract of service, and it seems to me that by deleting this section we might quite easily do an injustice to a civil servant, just as easily as we might by including it and I do not think that by including it we shall do an injustice.  It is included, to some extent, as a safeguard to the civil servant to ensure that whatever his actual relations of service are with the State, or whatever rights he may have under them will be preserved to him, even in the case of a transferred officer.  If he had a contract of service that contract would still continue to subsist.  Pension rights and superannuation rights might quite easily go if Section 5 were not in the Bill, assuming that a transferred officer has a contract of service&mdash;and I do not think he has.  My own opinion is that the transferred officer has not got contractual rights with this Government, but he has statutory rights, a rather different thing.  He might have had some rights in the nature of contractual rights against the British Government, but whether he has those rights against this Government or not, I am not going to be the person to determine.  The Transferred Officers' Tribunal will determine that, if they are called on to do so, but, in any event, whatever the bond of service the transferred officer has with this Government, it will be preserved to him under Section 5.  Section 5, however, <Col N="372" /> will not operate to say that if a man's salary is reduced during the period he is in service of this Government, his conditions of service have not been altered to his detriment. Section 5 cannot be argued to substantiate a case like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I think the Senator has misunderstood me.  When I was pointing out that the Bill did not in any way diminish the existing rights of transferred officers, Senator Milroy asked: &ldquo;What about Section 5?&rdquo;  I assumed from that that he thought Section 5 in some way would operate to prevent the transferred officers from going to the Transferred Officers' Tribunal.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  I do not see how the tribunal could be biassed against his appeal.  They have to hear and decide on it purely on law and on facts, and the fact would be that, while Section 5 would preserve whatever bond or agreement of service existed between the transferred officer and this State, it would not operate to say that if a transferred officer's salary were reduced his conditions of service had not been altered to his detriment. The tribunal would have to determine that matter for itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Section 5 simply protects the Government against any possible suggestion that a contract was being broken by this Bill and I think it is right to insert the provision. I do not see how you can avoid having some such section, but I think it is a most ingenious argument to suggest that it, in some way or other, protects the civil servant because when you have a two-sided contract and one side breaks it&mdash;assuming that there is a contract; I am not arguing that there <Col N="373" /> is&mdash;it does not thereby get out of all the rest of it.  I certainly think that you may create a considerable amount of misunderstanding by what I think is the very doubtful argument, that this in any way protects the civil servant.  It is more or less a necessary part of this Bill, where you are definitely authorising a cut, to provide that the court will not come in and say that there was a contract which binds you otherwise, but to say that it is protecting the civil servant is scarcely, I think, correct.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Stage of the Bill I made a reference to certain of its provisions which I thought might be held to break specific contracts quite distinct from any general argument of contracts which may be used in the debate.  This amendment of mine will, I think, affect only some eight, ten or, at the outside, a dozen people, but it seems to me that there is a definite principle involved which ought not to be <Col N="375" /> included in this Bill.  I should like to make it clear that this amendment does not refer to what are known as transferred officers, that is, persons who were transferred from the old British Civil Service in Ireland to the new Government and who have certain rights under the Treaty.  I do not want to refer to these rights at all and I want to make it clear that this amendment does not deal with them at all.  The position, as I understand it, is that there were a certain number of people who were invited in the early days of this State to give up professions and to become civil servants. Some of those gave up positions in which they may have been earning comparatively small sums and became civil servants on definitely better terms.  I am not concerned with them. They are, to my mind, in the same position as any other civil servant, but I have reason to believe that there are a few who, because their services were of a specialised character and because they were regarded by the then Government as almost indispensable, were invited to take up positions for which the remuneration was not any greater than what they were then obtaining, and it seems to me that where people came in in these circumstances&mdash;and I believe they are very few&mdash;they ought not to come under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The particular case which I regard as the least important is covered by (a) of the amendment.  Paragraph (b) refers to the person appointed subsequent to the 6th December, 1922, with a special agreement as to his remuneration and who, for the purpose of accepting such agreement, gives up an appointment in the service of any other country.  I understand there are some&mdash;I will not attempt to say the number; but I am informed that there are not over a dozen of persons&mdash;who come under that category.</P>
    <P>We know that, in the early days of this State, a number of civil servants were lent from another Civil Service. They were lent because no one trained in the particular work which they had to undertake was available here.  In <Col N="376" /> nearly every case they were Irishmen who happened to be in the British Civil Service.  Most of these men stayed for a period of three years&mdash;I am not quite sure of the exact period &mdash;and then returned to the British Civil Service, retaining their rights and position.  According to my information, a few who were regarded as indispensable were approached by the previous Minister for Finance and asked to stay here.  In doing that their term of loan having come to an end, they ceased to have any special rights in the British Civil Service.  Their service, of course, counted for pension here, but they transferred completely, giving up any claim.  They are not transferred officers under that particular section of the Treaty but simply men who joined the Civil Service from the British Civil Service.  I understand that some of these men did so on a specific agreement, some, I think, in writing and others not, that their remuneration would not be decreased.  If my information is correct&mdash;and I have it on fairly good authority&mdash;this is a matter of good faith.  Men who might have progressed &mdash;and most of them, I believe, would have progressed considerably in the British Civil Service&mdash;were asked by the State&mdash;never mind what the Government was at the time&mdash;to take up special positions and to transfer here because they were indispensable, on the promise that their remuneration would not be reduced, and that, I think is a pledge They are just exactly in the same position as I would be in my own business if I appointed a senior member of the staff or a manager on those terms and gave them to him in writing.  I would be legally bound by that contract.  If it was not in writing I would be only morally bound by it but in my mind there is no difference except in the matter of law. I would further urge that the amount is trifling.  I would urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  I personally am not a bit interested in the particular gentlemen who would be affected.  I am not sure that I know any of them.  I certainly do not know any of them intimately.  I do not know their names but I do think that there <Col N="377" /> is a principle involved which the Government ought not to include in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to conceal from the Seanad that there is a good deal of force in what Senator Douglas has said.  The principle is one which I, as Minister for Finance, would like to be in a position to accept. That is that when a Minister, in the case of a specific service of the State, because he thinks that certain individual servants are indispensable to the well-being of the State, invites them to enter the service upon certain terms and conditions, these terms and conditions should be honoured and observed by his successor.  I can see that any departure from that principle might make it difficult for any Government, requiring specialised services at any time, to procure those services from the individual whom they think can give them best.  Unfortunately it is very hard to disentangle the special cases which Senator Douglas has in mind from the rest of the service. People who come into the service of the State in response to an advertisement might be found in that category. I will confess that, possibly without being able to give verbal expression to the exact shade of difference, I can see that they are not in precisely the same category as, shall we say, the specialists to whom I refer.  Then, again, the question arises: what exactly is the definition of the agreement entered and who is going to be able to determine that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Under my amendment the Minister would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That places the Minister possibly in a somewhat invidious position in matters of this sort because it might be argued, and it would be argued possibly, by his colleagues in the Executive Council, that certain officers whom they had in mind, entered the service of the State in that way because they give specialised service and because they were invited. There might not have been a formal invitation.  Very often these matters are done by negotiation previously carried out and an agreement reached in <Col N="378" /> an informal way, and what would appear on the file would be merely an application possibly to enter the service, if it did appear on the file at all, or it might be a response to a specific advertisement.</P>
      <P>I am not disposed off-hand to refuse to deal with the cases Senator Douglas has in mind if I can see some machinery that will assist me.  First of all, I should like to know whether we are to take into consideration at all verbal agreements.  There we are travelling in an unknown country. There may be a number of officers in respect to whom we can say with certainty there were such verbal agreements.  That number might be fairly well known, but there may be a considerable number of other people who would come along claiming to have these verbal agreements.  Who is going, once again, to decide whether the verbal agreement existed or not? The case of the agreement, which is in writing, of course, from the point of view of determination, does not present any difficulty.  But if you grant a concession to the person who has an agreement in writing, are you going to do justice to people who have not fortified themselves with an agreement of that sort&mdash;persons who were prepared to put their trust in the mere word of the Minister for the time being who appointed them?  The position is bristling with difficulties.  I would ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment at this stage.  We presumably shall have an opportunity of dealing with it on the Report Stage. In connection with this amendment, I frankly recognise that there is a problem to be dealt with.  My point of view is sympathetic&mdash;at least I shall sympathetically consider the arguments which have been put forward by the Senator, but I just cannot see my way through the maze of difficulties that surround the question&mdash;as to how we are going to disentangle this from the rest of the service and what sort of evidence we are going to require as to whether an agreement was entered into or not.  Possibly some amendment might be put down on the Report Stage which would solve the difficulties as I have represented them to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I think we have undoubtedly to take what the Minister has said as the way out of the trouble.  Listening to the discussion, we have heard no names, but we have heard Senator Douglas state that there is quite a small number of cases affected.  His amendment is extremely carefully drawn as far as one can judge.  If he is right in his statement that the cases that come under his amendment are small in number, then, the Minister, as he has told us, can inquire into the matter and he will tell us later what is the justice of the case.  I take it that is what he will do on the Report Stage.  I am sure that we can rely on the Minister to look into the cases to which Senator Douglas' amendment would apply and give his opinion of them on the Report Stage.  It is undoubtedly the most satisfactory way of getting over the matter.  The Minister is undoubtedly protecting himself by his general remarks.  If he said too much now, a whole lot of cases, the position of which he is not sure of at present, might arise.  We have to wait to allow him to look into the matter and to see if he can carry out what Senator Douglas wants&mdash;that there will be no breach of faith by the Free State Government with any individual. That is all he desires and I am sure the Minister will look into it.  In these circumstances, Senator Douglas' best course would be to withdraw the amendment until the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

      <P>I am quite agreeable to adjourn this amendment to the Report Stage, and if the Minister introduces&mdash;he can do it on Report Stage; he is probably aware of the fact that under our Standing Orders a Government amendment can be introduced on the Report Stage&mdash;an amendment dealing with the matter, I shall withdraw my amendment.  It is not a case of threatening the Minister as I have no idea whether the Seanad as a body will agree with me in this amendment. I have not done any canvassing in regard to it, but I think this is a case where a little pressure on the Minister might do no harm.  I do not want to be left simply with the statement that the Minister will sympathetically <Col N="380" /> consider it.  I am very anxious that he should have an opportunity of considering any difficulties he may have in dealing with it but on the Report Stage if some other amendment to deal with the matter is not brought forward by the Minister, I shall press my amendment.  Senator Staines is not here but I should like to point out that he had put down an amendment of a somewhat similar nature.  Obviously there was no collaboration between us.  I felt his amendment went further than was absolutely necessary to meet the real cases of contract that I have in mind. I consulted him and asked him not to press his amendment and to allow me to move mine which is definitely more restrictive.  It is possible that it may not be sufficiently restrictive.  I should like to point out to the Minister and to the House that I have endeavoured to secure that my amendment should not be used for the purpose of costing the State any substantial amount of money.  Under the amendment suggested in the Dáil it seemed to me that it went far too far and it might have included a very large number of persons.  When I saw that amendment I recognised that and I deliberately altered mine so as to meet what might be a reasonable objection to it, while it would still cover cases where there might be a matter of good faith involved.  If the Minister can improve on the amendment and will cover cases where there is a contract I will accept his wording without question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to say that he is in a better position to deal with the difficulties or to appreciate them than I am.  The Minister said that it might place him in an invidious position but as the numbers are small, and as I have reason to believe that nearly all the persons concerned are responsible persons, I believe nothing of the kind, would place the Minister in a more invidious position than that in which he stands at present.  Where a man produces an agreement in writing, of course there is no question.  I recognise that in the case of a verbal agreement the Minister may have considerable difficulty.  I believe however that Party politics has not reached that <Col N="381" /> stage when you could not have a perfectly friendly consultation as to the <i>bona fides</i> of a claim where responsible officers are concerned and that Party politics would not enter into the question.  In the hope that the Minister may examine the question and introduce a more suitable amendment on the Report Stage I shall withdraw this amendment for the present.</P>

      <P>Section 7, sub-section (5) to delete sub-section.</P>
      <P>Though I am opposed to retrospective legislation, I recognise that the House has agreed to the principle of these economics with regard to the pay of people employed by the State.  In view of the fact that this is a temporary measure, intended to cover one financial year, and that the people concerned were made aware of this before the beginning of the financial year, I do not propose to press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Two things have surprised me in the last few minutes.  One was the withdrawal of his amendment by Senator Farren and the other was what, for want of a better phrase, I may call the benevolent mood of consideration which the Minister seems to be imbued with judging by his attitude on the last amendment, since he came into the arena of this House.  While that mood is upon the Minister I might be able to show him the error of his ways or of his Department in preserving this particular sub-section.  This is the worst feature of this measure which, it is regrettable, we have to consider. Sub-section (5) introduces a very pernicious principle into legislation.  The introduction of retrospective legislation in respect to the matter with which it deals is utterly indefensible, and is attended by elements and possibilities of far-reaching mischief, not merely to the services of the State which would mean a big thing, but by creating a headline for other aspects or phases of the economic life of the country.  I think the Minister realises <Col N="382" /> how indefensible the principle is.  I have gone as carefully as I could in connection with this Bill through the whole of the Dáil debates in the different stages and I find no defence by the Minister for the introduction of this principle.  Certainly, if the Minister did make a defence of it so far it has escaped my attention.  When this matter was raised in an amendment on the Report Stage the Minister had not a word to say in the matter. This is the Minister's reference when introducing sub-section (5):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I should like to call the attention of the House to sub-section (5) of Section 7, which provides that &ldquo;every deduction, made before the passing of this Act from salary paid to a person to whom this Part of this Act applies which would have been a lawful deduction under this section if this section had then been in force shall be deemed to have been made under this section and to be and always to have been lawful accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he continues:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is not anticipated, and it was not contemplated that the House would take all the stages of this measure in one day.  Necessarily, it is a measure which merits a good deal of discussion in view of the many interests which it affects.  It was not proposed, so far as discussion in detail was concerned, to limit that discussion in the House; but, at the same time, it is imperative, in view of the position which will confront the House next year, that economies should begin and be made at the earliest possible moment, and the most appropriate moment is at the opening of the financial year. Otherwise, if they are deferred beyond that, the Exchequer is going to suffer and the ratepayers and the taxpayers are going to suffer also.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I come to the point on which I wish to join issue:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;However, I should hesitate, even though this sub-section were in the Bill which would give me power to do so, to apply the Act now and would prefer to await full legislative sanction at a future date.  I <Col N="383" /> should hesitate certainly to enforce that section, desirable and all as it is that it should be enforced&mdash;essential almost as it is&mdash;I should hesitate to enforce it unless the House had first of all accepted the principle of this measure, and it is in order that the Department of Finance may feel itself at liberty to enforce this section that the House has been asked to accept the principle of this Bill to-day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was not a defence of that section or the principle of it.  It was something else, something of a novel and extraordinary nature.  It was an argument that the Second Reading of the Bill in the Dáil gave the sanction and force of law to this proposal.  Does the Minister question that?  He wished a Second Reading to authorise the giving of effect to the proposal. That is one of the most extraordinary requests ever made in any legislative assembly by any Minister who professes to act constitutionally.  At least, before a Minister takes action under the authority of a statute he should wait until the Bill that is going to create that statute has been passed by the legislature.  The Minister anticipates that.  Can he quote any precedent for such action?  It has been contended that the Minister has power to impose these cuts without legislative sanction.  My argument is not concerned with that.  I should like to see the authority, which I understand the Minister claims to have, for enforcing these cuts in salaries.  But that is not the point I am taking issue on.  The Minister may have power to enforce certain cuts on a certain date.  He may have power to impose them on the 1st April, the beginning of the financial year, but he did not exercise that authority if he is vested with it.  I say he has no authority now, having omitted to exercise it then, to endeavour by retrospective action to enforce these cuts in the period that has passed.  I wonder does the Minister contend that he has. I believe he contends that he has power to impose cuts by retrospective action. I should like him to answer that question. If so, what is the limit of that <Col N="384" /> retrospective power.  Is it three months, six months, 12 months or is it at the discretion of the Minister?  Has he any power by statute to-day to show that the requirements of the Exchequer indicate that a certain sum has to be secured, and that he can go back over the salaries of the Service and say &ldquo;I want three months', six months' or 12 months' deductions, and I am going to make them from the salaries given in the present year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister claims to have power to do that for three months I cannot see where a limitation to his power is placed.  That is one of the most pernicious principles to have embodied in legislation.  I contend that there is no such power of retrospective legislation. If that is so, why the necessity for sub-section (5) which is legalising the illegal thing the Minister proposes to do?  That is the express purpose of Section 7, sub-section (5).  The Minister is to-day clearly and manifestly doing an illegality and the illegality is something that he has no legal right to do. He has been guilty of that since the 1st April and he is asking the Oireachtas by the legislation in this sub-section, when the Bill becomes law, to indemnify him against the consequences of the illegal act which has been perpetrated since April 1st.  I am not professing to discuss law.  I am only discussing fair play, common sense and honesty in the administration of the Minister's Department.  I want the House to keep in mind that the issue I am raising now is not the volume or the nature of the cuts the Minister is making but the principle of retrospective legislation.  The amount that the Minister will secure if this Bill is passed may be required, but I am asking the Seanad to refrain from assenting to a principle which strikes at a very serious, an almost sacred principle, that should be the basis of legislation.  What I cannot understand is why the Minister should have found himself in this dilemma.</P>
    <P>In his statement in the Dáil on the 31st March last he referred to his own statement in his previous Budget speech and said, &ldquo;Last year in submitting my Budget statement on the 11th May, I said: &lsquo;I shall have to ask <Col N="385" /> for sacrifices from those who are engaged in public employment to help me to find the remainder.&rsquo;&rdquo;  The Bill we are discussing now was introduced in the Dáil on the 24th March, 1933.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was aware of the necessity for this on the 1st April&mdash;the beginning of the financial year&mdash;why did he not take time by the forelock and regularise the position, so that he would have statutory authority for taking the action which he proposes to do now in, to my mind, the most illegal and immoral manner?  This matter I am raising is on a higher plane than mere Party politics or what is going to be saved under this Bill.  It is a question of whether there is to be any fundamental basis of principle or morality upon which Ministers will act in framing their legislation, or whether those principles which should be the basis of any civilised State are to be cast aside because the exigencies of the Minister's circumstances render them inconvenient.  I am asking the House to take a serious and high viewpoint in regard to this matter.  The Minister quoted from his previous Budget statement one paragraph.  I want to quote another from the same speech, delivered on 11th May, 1932.  The present Minister for Finance referring to the prospects of the then coming year said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be a hard year, a year of self-denial for all of us, but it will be an honest year.  We shall honour our obligations to our people and we shall pay our way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be an honest year.&rdquo;  I want to ask if this is honest finance, if this is honouring our obligations to our people?  I presume that the servants of the State are citizens of the State and, therefore, part of &ldquo;our people,&rdquo; and I contend that we are not honouring our obligations to our people and that this is not an honest step.  I am not sure whether or not the Minister is conscious of the aspects of the matter that occur to me but, from my point of view, and from the point of view of any honest onlooker, it cannot be contended that this is an honest step.  It cannot be contended that retrospective legislation of this kind is honest or that it is dealing fairly with <Col N="386" /> the people concerned.  A rather prominent politician once said, in a rather hectic time, that there are some illegalities that are not crimes.  I have no doubt that the Minister knows to whom I refer.  If the Minister gets this Bill through, with this sub-section embodied in it, he will be able to say to the victims of this measure who reproach him for his action that this is one of the crimes which are not illegalities.  I ask the House to take a serious view of this matter.  It is not a question of the amount to be saved. It is a question of whether you are going to do violence to a serious moral principle.  I contend that that is what the Minister is doing by this sub-section and I ask the House to reject it.</P>

      <P>I am glad to welcome Senator Milroy to the ranks of the defenders of constitutional principle because I remember several occasions when I protested here against really retrospective legislation when I had opposed to me the eloquence and the vote of Senator Milroy.  Retrospective legislation of a criminal kind is always wrong.  My friend, Senator Milroy, will have to study the subject more closely before he knows all its intricacies. This is not retrospective legislation of a criminal kind, such as Senator Milroy voted for on more than one occasion&mdash;that is to say, making, by subsequent statute, a thing a crime which up to that was not a crime.</P>

      <P>What is being done here?  It was declared by the Government of the day, before the 1st April, that these cuts were necessary and that the amount of the cuts would be according to certain percentages.  Both the intention to make the reductions&mdash;I do not like the word &ldquo;cuts&rdquo;&mdash;and the extent of the amputation were stated before the 1st April.  The Minister proceeded after the 1st April, as he had before declared, to amputate a part of the salary legally payable to the particular civil servant.  I do not like to give an opinion on legal questions when I am not invited to do so, with the proper inducement appended to the <Col N="387" /> invitation, but it is my opinion that the deduction, before the passing of this statute authorising it, was not such a deduction as could be enforced in a court of law.  But that is not unusual in matters of finance.  We all know&mdash;nobody better than Senator Milroy&mdash;that taxes are imposed by Statute.  It is the Act of Parliament that legalises the taxes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very thankful to Senator Douglas for his reminder, but Senator Milroy and I are on a higher plane.  We are talking of constitutional principles, and I am going back to the time when these things were done under constitutional rule and precedent without any law to support them.  The moment a tax was announced a resolution was passed and the tax was collected by the Revenue Authorities without statutory authority until the Bill was passed.  The practice resorted to here by the Minister for Finance is hoary with age.  Something similar has been done for hundreds of years.  Why should Senator Milroy, with the zeal of a convert to constitutional principles, say that this is dishonest and unfair, that the Minister has committed all the crimes possible because he has done what, as Minister for Finance, he was absolutely bound to do?  Senator Milroy seems to find some hidden crime in the very words of this sub-section.  The sub-section is plain, honest, and straightforward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every deduction made before the passing of this Act from salary paid to a person to whom this part of this Act applies which would have been a lawful deduction under this section if this section had then been enforced shall be deemed to have <Col N="388" /> been made under this section and to be and always to have been lawful accordingly.</P>
    <P>Could words be more plain?  It is hard for Senator Milroy to sustain the idea until the end of that long sentence but, to a lawyer, it is perfectly clear.  I cannot help joining in the laughter of my friend, Senator Milroy. It is perfectly clear from this sub-section that the deduction was not lawful and will not be lawful until the passing of this Bill.  It is perfectly plain that this sub-section will legalise it.  That is all the sub-section means. What about Senator Milroy's vigorous defence of constitutional principle? There is nothing in it.  If Senator Milroy is going to become a real convert, he will have to learn the distinction between retrospective legislation of a criminal kind, which is always bad, and retrospective legislation in these matters of finance, which is as old as the English Constitution itself.</P>

      <P>There is a good deal more involved in this question than retrospective legislation.  It is quite obvious, from this clause, that the Minister for Finance knew he was committing an illegal act when he authorised these deductions to be made.  That is as clear as crystal.  At the time he issued instructions to make these deductions, he was guilty of an illegal act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been discussing what a Seanad is worth.  Now we do know that in cases like this the Seanad can probably not hold up anything of real importance for any length of time.  We are all agreed as to that.  If the Government, relying on a majority in the Dáil, can presuppose a decision of the Dáil and commit an act which is non-legal&mdash; Senators might not like the word illegal if I used it&mdash;there is no end to where that may lead to.  There are all sorts of things that can be done, and be justified afterwards by the use of a majority in Parliament. Now I always thought that until an Act was passed nobody could take action under it as if it were the law. I thought that was accepted as a general principle, but the Senator opposite shakes his head and, apparently, we are now facing this condition of affairs, that if a Minister brings a Bill into the Dáil he can proceed to act on it as if it had been already passed.  In doing that, he is undoubtedly relying on this: that he is quite certain of having a majority in the Dáil that will give him the Bill, and it will be there to whitewash him for certain things he has done before it has become an Act.  These questions are not really connected with the amount of money that we are talking about here.  They are really Constitutional questions, and I think Senator Milroy is perfectly right in drawing attention to them.  It is more important, I think, that attention should be drawn to them in the Seanad than in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> I think we should also consider very seriously the position we are going to get into&mdash;if Ministers, relying on a majority in the Dáil can proceed to act on Bills when introduced, being perfectly certain that these Bills will eventually become law in the form in which they are introduced and know that they are in a position to &ldquo;kill off&rdquo; any opposition there may be to such legislation in the Dáil.  If, in addition, they feel certain that they will not have to consider such problems seriously in the Seanad, then we are undoubtedly reaching a state of affairs in which a parliamentary majority is acquiring real power over the liberties of the people.</P>
    <P>It is to that problem that Senator Milroy is drawing attention.  I do not think that this debate is concerned with money at all.  That is not the question at issue.  The really serious question is that a section such as we are debating should be required at all: that the Minister should be able to presuppose a decision of the House and act on it by instructing the officers in his Department to make deductions which could not legally be made when he gave the instructions, and then to come along and ask this House to pass a section such as this.  I think that is a very bad principle.  We may have to agree to this.  I do not suppose Senator Milroy thinks there would be any use in getting a decision on this and sending the Bill back to the Dáil, because the Minister must carry the Dáil with him, but I do think it must make us all think very seriously that a Minister can presuppose a thing is law before the necessary legislation has been passed by either House and proceed to act as if it were the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Senator Jameson spoke, I asked the Minister if he would state whether he agreed with Senator Comyn.  My reason for doing so was that I wanted to draw a distinction, emphasised by Senator Jameson's speech, between two kinds of retrospective legislation.  We have on quite a number of occasions been approached&mdash;we have seen the same thing happen in England and other <Col N="391" /> countries&mdash;by the Government coming here and saying <i>bona fide</i> that they had been carrying out something which had not been technically correct. There was no secret about it, but as they might be liable to an action in the courts, they asked to have the thing made legal from a particular date. That is one class of case.  The other is the establishment of the principle whereby a Government announces that, from such and such a date they will make certain deductions of salary, and then at their leisure or at such time as they find it convenient, pass a Bill to legalise their action.  If we were to set out on a principle such as that I believe it would be disastrous and that we should protest against it.  I thought I read in the Minister's speech in the Dáil that he was not of opinion that the deductions were illegal, but that as the question was raised he wanted to have any doubt there might be removed.  Now we learn from one of the legal lights in the Fianna Fáil Party that these deductions were illegal all the time.  I thought the opposite was the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Senator Douglas is entitled to indulge in the practice, which is becoming rather too frequent with him, of asking the Minister whether he agrees with the legal opinion of Senator Comyn.  Now, on constitutional questions Senator Comyn's legal opinion is quite capable of standing by itself, whether the Minister agrees with it or not.  What I do submit is this: that no Minister is legally entitled to withhold payment of salary.  Now that is a simple proposition of law.  But, suppose he does withhold payment of a percentage of salary, what offence has he committed? He is simply indebted to the particular civil servant for the time being in respect of the portion of salary which he deducts.  If he says that he intends, as from 31st March or the 1st April, that those salaries shall be reduced, and if he does withhold that percentage of salary from the civil servant and gets statutory sanction for it, as he is seeking statutory sanction here, then the deduction <Col N="392" /> that he makes becomes a perfectly legal deduction.  Suppose you refuse to pass this Bill, what is the position then?  What wrong has he done?  If you refuse to pass this section, or to pass this Bill then the Minister becomes bound to pay to the particular civil servant that part of his salary which he has withheld.  Now I seek no confirmation for that law, and I will very kindly invite Senator Douglas when he makes reference to me in connection with a legal matter to please consider that as a lawyer and as a man I am speaking for myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should agree with a good deal of what Senator Jameson in a very thoughtful speech has said. I think that retrospective legislation as a class is to be condemned, but circumstances will arise in which Governments may have to legislate retrospectively, or in which they may have to seek legal confirmation for something which they have done over a period. For instance, if a Government is at war, at the conclusion of the war it finds that it may have done, or its servants may have done, many illegal things during the war, and therefore it passes an Indemnity Act.  This sub-section might be classed as an act of indemnity and if any member would like to take it that way I personally would not try to argue another view of it.  At any rate, the thing that does arise, in considering an act of indemnity, is that it should be considered on its merits, and that we should not reject a clause like this merely because of a general principle&mdash;merely because of the fact that we are opposed to retrospective legislation in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the merits in this case? The Minister for Finance had decided that, in order to make the Budget for the coming year balance, it was necessary that certain deductions should be made from the salaries of public servants.  He could have made those deductions in a number of ways. He could have proceeded, I suggest, under sub-section (3) of Section 2 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1924; he could have proceeded by way of special financial legislation which would have deprived the discussion <Col N="393" /> which has taken place in this House on this Bill of a good deal of its value. If he had decided to proceed by special financial legislation, he could have made every one of these cuts effective by the mere passage of a Resolution in the Dáil.  He could also have proceeded in a way that I think has not yet been adverted to: by an order under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act.  Therefore, there were three ways in which he could have proceeded: First, by a simple regulation; secondly, by special financial legislation and thirdly, by emergency order. Every one of these ways would have had great advantages from the point of view of the Minister for Finance. The demands upon his time and upon the time of the Government, would have been greatly reduced.  The right of discussion would have been considerably curtailed, but every one of these ways would have imposed certain disabilities on civil servants and, at least two of them, would have deprived the transferred officer of certain of his rights.  The effect of another one of them on the pension rights of individuals might have been very obscure, and would have been very difficult, at any rate, correctly to appreciate.  It might leave these pension rights in danger.</P>
    <P>The Minister, more out of regard for the rights of the persons affected under this Bill and for the rights of the Oireachtas, decided to proceed by way of a Bill.  He had a definite sum in his mind which he knew he must secure. The question arose then, in securing that, was he to spread the burden of sacrifice over the twelve months of the year, or was he to concentrate it in the last half of the year, or the last two-thirds of the year, thereby making it, possibly, more difficult for the people affected by this Bill to suffer the deductions.</P>
    <P>I think it will be conceded that he acted wisely and rightly: that since the Bill would inevitably become law or that, if it did not become law, some substitute would be devised by the Minister for Finance it was better to proceed to make those deductions at the opening of the financial year so as <Col N="394" /> to spread the burden of them over the 12 months rather than allow the Bill to go through before any deductions were made and then in order to make allowances for them, to draft the schedules in such a way that whether the Bill took three months, six months, or nine months to pass through the Oireachtas the amount of money which the Minister for Finance wanted would be secured in any event.  What was going to be the effect of that?  It might possibly have meant that, if the Minister anticipated the Bill was going to take six or seven months to get through the Oireachtas and made provision in the schedules accordingly for collecting the £270,000 in seven months, six months, five months, or even three months if the Bill went through in three months, the people affected by it would pay more heavily than they otherwise would if the burden had been spread over 12 months and the schedules drawn up accordingly.  A good many statements have been made here and it has been presumed that I have acted illegally throughout.  I do not think that the House has quite grasped that, even in dealing with the ordinary remuneration of civil servants, during the past ten years, deductions have been made in every year in which the cost-of-living bonus has fallen from the salaries of the civil servants without there being any statutory authority for it and that, in fact, no specific statutory authority is necessary in order to make the deductions from the salaries of civil servants.  The Estimates are submitted to the Dáil and a Vote on Account is taken at an early stage.  The Minister in determining what the salaries of the civil servants are going to be, during the period covered by that Vote, does not look to any Statute of the Dáil at all.  He looks to a figure that has been calculated by statisticians&mdash;the cost-of-living index figure&mdash;and he pays the civil servant accordingly.  There is no statute which empowers him to do that and there is no statute which debars from doing that and there is no statute which generally fixes the remuneration of any civil servant.  They are all of them fixed by regulation of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for <Col N="395" /> Finance, under the terms of sub-section (3) of Section 2 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act has this power:</P>
    <P>... there shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas ...to such officers and servants such salaries or remunerations as the Minister for Finance may from time to time determine.</P>
    <P>It is on that basis that these deductions in regard to cost-of-living bonus were made and they may be made from the preceding January and they may be made in June, but he does not come before the Dáil for a statutory confirmation in any way.</P>
    <P>The one reason why this section appears here is because we elected to proceed by Bill and the Minister did not want, having elected to proceed by Bill for a number of reasons which were as much associated and, possibly, I should say more associated, with concern for the position of those who were to be affected by the Bill and for the rights of the Oireachtas, so that the matter might be discussed here as fully as possible and the pros and cons ventilated and argued in the proper way, to find himself in the position that he was either to be debarred from securing the economy which he felt was necessary or to be compelled in the latter portion of the year, to impose an undue burden on the persons affected by the Bill.  Those are the merits of the case.  It may be argued that this is retrospective legislation. It does operate to give statutory effect&mdash;and that is not quite the same thing as legalising&mdash;to the course which the Minister has pursued. Once again, I should like to emphasise that that is not the same thing as legalising.  There was nothing illegal in what he did and nothing wrong. We could have done it without the Bill but we are simply giving statutory effect to what we have done in order, if you like, to exclude vexatious litigation of all sorts&mdash;litigation which we could, if it were to be initiated, quite easily spike by a number of powers which are vested in the Executive Council in regard to <Col N="396" /> these matters&mdash;but, leaving that aside, I ask the Seanad to come back to this fact: if this were retrospective legislation, it must be judged as all retrospective legislation should be judged&mdash;on its merits as applied to the particular purpose of this or any Bill.  I say that the section has been a beneficial section from the point of view of those affected by the Bill.  It has not damnified them or prejudiced them in any way and, accordingly, I would suggest that the Senator ought to do withdraw his amendment and the Seanad, if he refuses to withdraw, ought to insist on its withdrawal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one or two observations to make after the Minister's speech.  If I ever heard a plea of guilty in my life, it was the plea made by the Minister&mdash;guilty but with extenuating circumstances, and he throws himself on the mercy of the court.  What I think is astonishing is that behind the Minister's argument is the implication that it does not matter whether a Minister acts legally or illegally, it is all the same in the long run.  He challenges my statement that he has been guilty of an illegal act, from the 1st April, in making certain deductions from salaries.  He has drawn a fine distinction between statutory and legal authority&mdash;a distinction which I find it difficult to appreciate in this particular connection. He says that he might have made these deductions in another way under certain powers.  Why did he not do it? Because he did not exercise those powers and because he has omitted to do that, he proceeds to collect those deductions by a method for which he has no statutory authority.  To take money from an employee for the taking of which there is no legal or statutory authority is capable of being defined in the single phrase &ldquo;plain ordinary theft.&rdquo;  The Minister admits that there is no statutory authority authorising or empowering him to make these deductions since the 1st April and that, in order to be indemnified, he has inserted this sub-section. With all his stream of words, phrases and analogies, which seem to <Col N="397" /> have little application here, that is the one thing that emerges, and what I am mainly concerned with is whether this departure from fundamental principle is to be sanctioned by the Oireachtas and whether it is going to be regarded as a precedent for further inroads on that principle in future by the present Minister or other Ministers who may succeed him, because, in my opinion, it is a very serious and vital matter.  It is from that point of view that I have raised this matter and not for the purpose of any party manoeuvring or any attempt to indulge in captious criticism of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I think that an amendment of mine which follows and which deals with a similar principle will save time.  I will not run the risk of incurring the displeasure of Senator Comyn by asking the Minister whether he agrees with him or not, but I will ask whether he agrees with the principle that this particular section does apply to anyone other than civil servants, because I think they are the only persons to whom this part of the Act applies.  It really deals with civil servants and police and all the various people who come under Section 2 of the Bill.  Since I put down the amendment I have read the report of the debate in the Dáil, from which I gather that the attitude of the Government towards it would be entirely <i>non possumus.</i>  For my part I do not think there is the slightest use in either Senator Farren or myself taking up the time of the House at present with it.  When I put down the amendment I had not read the debate in the Dáil.  It is not a matter on which we should delay the House further and I therefore withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 9, and in Part II, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> 9.  Nothing in this Act shall take away, prejudice or in any way affect any right of any transferred officer, as defined by the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act, 1929 (No. 36 of 1929), under Article 78 of the Constitution or under the said Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act, 1929, or any powers or jurisdiction conferred by the said Act upon the Civil Service (Compensation) Board established in accordance with the said Act.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Seanad, in view of the fact that the officers referred to in this amendment are already covered by statute, we ought to ensure by this Bill that whatever rights they possess should be secured. They were transferred officers who had the right to opt out of the service if they wished and to get pensions. When we took them over in 1921 and 1922 we were faced with the position that we had to establish a Civil Service here.  We had to create a Civil Service somehow or other.  The civil servants already established had the right of opting out of the service and getting their pensions.  Those of them who went out have since been enjoying pensions.  We had to appoint others in their places and pay them in addition to paying these pensions.  I think those servants who were patriotic enough to take service under our Government are entitled to consideration, and that whatever rights they have should be preserved.  When I first took up duty in a native Government I was in a different position from that in which the Minister now finds himself.  I had to sit down in an office in the City Hall and I had no civil servants. I and those who were with me had to establish a Civil Service.  When the Minister came into office he found a Civil Service and a very efficient one already established.  Civil servants are not obtained by putting advertisements in a newspaper, or in the casual way that one fills other positions.  As I say, when the Minister came into office all he had to do was to hang up his hat.  He had the Civil Service already created for him.  We established that Civil Service and I think <Col N="401" /> the Minister appreciates that as well as I do.  I think these people are entitled to their rights, whatever rights they hitherto possessed.  The object of the amendment is to preserve these rights, and I think the Minister should accept it without putting the matter to a division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>On a previous amendment moved by Senator Duggan, which was either withdrawn or defeated&mdash;I forget which&mdash;the Minister argued in favour of the principle of this particular amendment.  At the end he expressed doubt as to whether he would accept it, though in favour of it, but otherwise he expressed the belief that this Bill did not, in effect, take away the rights granted under Article 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think members of the House want to be quite clear as to the distinction between the two amendments.  The last amendment took these particular persons out of the Bill, which meant that any cut would not be imposed on them. I think that would be grossly unfair to other civil servants, and it was a thing over which we could not stand. In this particular case there is a doubt expressed by responsible lawyers outside the House as to whether the Bill may not give rise to certain complicated matters under Article 10 of the Treaty.  If you insert this amendment you will remove that doubt, and the result will be that you will have no trouble at all.  If the cut is a temporary cut for one year, persons who have remained in the Service are not going to raise any trouble, unless they had previously intended to raise them before the tribunal, as to their rights for one year, but if you get uneasiness created as to how it affects them, you are almost certain to have a number of cases raised before the tribunal.  I would suggest to the Minister that if his own statement in the Dáil is correct, that nothing in this Bill does affect their rights, there should be no objection to inserting the amendment. If there is doubt in the matter, and that he agrees it should not affect them, then equally there should be no objection to putting this amendment in. Certain doubts have been expressed, and the last thing that the Minister or <Col N="402" /> anyone of us wants is to have uneasiness amongst these people.  The last thing we want is to have them going before the tribunal.  As the Minister does not think that the Bill affects them in any way, I think in the general interests that it would be far better to insert this section.  I am not supporting the amendment for any ulterior motive.  It is quite different from the other amendment, which I could not have supported.</P>

That is that I am not quite certain what the effect of the words &ldquo;under Article 78 of the Constitution&rdquo; would be.  I should also like to examine more carefully the general implications of the amendment.  I have already had it examined, and I have been advised that it is unnecessary from the point of view of the preservation of the rights which transferred officers have already.  There is, in the words of my advisers, a strong objection to putting a section into a Bill &ldquo;merely out of a superabundance of caution.&rdquo;  That is not my phrase.  I am not prepared to ask the Seanad to reject the amendment as it stands, but if the Senator would withdraw it until Report Stage I would have an opportunity of thinking over it.  I shall have the matter considered to see if there is any real danger to be created.  If there is, I am prepared to consider some method of preserving their rights.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 9.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(6)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing sub-sections of this section, this Part of this Act <Col N="403" /> shall not apply to medical officers in the employment of any board, commission, company or other body such as is specified in sub-section (1) of this section.</P>
    <P>The intention of this amendment is to exclude all medical officers, who are engaged in local services, from the operations of this Bill.  I should like to put before the Minister a few instances of the medical officers who would be affected.  There is, first, the county medical officer of health, who has a very important post.  These posts have been created quite recently, and, therefore, any contracts that have been made are quite recent contracts. In order to become a county medical officer of health it is necessary for a medical man to have a Diploma of Public Health.  He cannot take out that diploma until he has been qualified for two years&mdash;that is practically eight years from the time he starts his medical studies.  There is no service that I know of that requires such a long and such an expensive training as the post of medical officer of health.  Furthermore, such a medical officer has to obtain experience.  He gets this experience, perhaps, in England or Scotland, acting as assistant under a medical officer of health there for two or three years, or, perhaps, he becomes a school medical officer or something of that sort.  He, therefore, spends a long time in studying and in gaining experience before he starts on his life work.  That is a very serious matter for a young person starting in a profession.  When he does enter on his duties he has very responsible work.  He has to safeguard the health of his district.  He is continually engaged in work of supervision, to see that there is no unsound food or no contaminated food.  He is responsible for the prevention of infectious diseases.  He has to supervise child welfare work.  He has to supervise the medical inspection of schoolchildren and the maternity work of midwives in his district or in his county.  That is very important work, and I think there is clear evidence already that it is tending to reduce the maternal death rate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" /> For these reasons I think it is quite wrong to reduce the salary of a medical officer of health who has given up some post in England or elsewhere to come over here on the understanding that his salary should be so much.  Such a reduction would make very material inroads on his income.  Then if we take the medical officer, say of a county infirmary, he is a man who requires to have a long training in all kinds of operations.  He must have a specialised training in many of the different branches of surgery&mdash;internal operations, operations to the ear, eye and so on.  Although these medical officers have to be very skilled, they have not the opportunities of men who are practising surgery in a large city such as Dublin.  If there are well-off people in their districts, these people come to Dublin to receive surgical treatment.  Their fees consequently are very small.  The next service, to which I will refer is the dispensary medical officer of health.  Dispensary medical officers of health start at a salary of £175 rising to £350.  It takes a considerable time before he can reach his maximum.  Out of a salary of £175 he has to pay for a conveyance.</P>

      <P>(2)  Notwithstanding anything therein contained, the foregoing sub-section shall not apply to any university or university college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking recently the Minister stated that there was a disposition on the part of his advisers to set themselves out against the insertion of any section or sub-section which would make for superintendence of the universities. When the Bill came before the other House it was felt that under the section there might be interference with the autonomy of the universities, particularly the National University and its Colleges, and the Bill was amended by the Government, giving clear indication that it had not in mind to interfere in any way with the autonomy of the universities.  The wording of the section appears to rule out the idea of any interference with the autonomy of the universities on the part of the Minister, but the words &ldquo;or to a board, commission, company, association, or other body (whether corporate or unincorporated)&rdquo; create a difficulty because they certainly cover the university.  The Government having <Col N="406" /> denied any intention of interfering with university autonomy in the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill, and having amended Section 10 have allowed this difficulty to remain, I want to know what exactly is in the Minister's mind in that respect.  I would like him to be more explicit and to interpret this section not in the light of any Ministerial assurances but in the light of legal clarity.</P>

      <P>I am almost sorry that I have not the advice of some legal Senator in this matter.  We have not heard an expression of opinion from some of the legal Senators on it.

It seems clear to me, from the fact that we have to take special power in Section 13 to deal with grants to universities, that the sections must be consistent with each other.  I am advised that the insertion of the amendment now proposed is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is more in this than the Minister sees. Senator O'Hanlon was not present when I heard two lawyers debating this section, and they convinced me that the section was not clear; that it laid itself open to doubt.  That also applied to Section 12.  I think the <Col N="407" /> Minister's point in regard to having to insert Section 13 is not a good one. Without Section 13 and without these exemptions power would have been given to the Minister, or to the Government, to dictate to the universities the exact way they were to apply the particular cuts that were to be made. I understand now that under Section 13 the Minister may deduct up to but not exceeding 5 per cent. from the grants.  What we are anxious to achieve, as far as the universities are concerned, is that while they may suffer a deduction from grants, it is up to the governing bodies to decide how to deal with them, and that the Minister should have no authority. In Section 10 the Minister has power, in the case of an educational institution (not being a university, a university college or a secondary school) or a board, commission, company, association or other body (whether corporate or unincorporated). It was intended to take out universities. I think the words &ldquo;not being a university, a university college or a secondary school&rdquo; are in the wrong place.  They might be held to apply to other bodies.  There is something there requiring attention.  I have great sympathy with Senator O'Hanlon's point of view.  This is not a Party matter at all.  The people in the universities are extremely anxious to have it beyond doubt that, as far as the control of their body is concerned, they are not under Ministerial influence.  I should like to say that the Minister has not been attending this House very long, and has not had the pleasure of knowing what happened under the previous Government. If he did he would know that amendments were inserted where there was any doubt.  If the Minister looks up the debates he will be amazed at the number of amendments inserted in this House which, on further consideration, never came back.</P>

I met representatives of the University and of the constituent colleges <Col N="408" /> and had very long and frank discussions regarding our attitude towards the University, and what we had in mind when the Bill was drafted.  I indicated the manner in which I proposed to proceed and, on that basis, reached an understanding which I believe was satisfactory to them and satisfactory to me.  On the basis of that we put in an amendment to the Bill in the way I have described by inserting the words &ldquo;(not being a university, a university college or a secondary school)&rdquo; and I inserted a new Section 13.  I have not heard from the university since.</P>

      <P>This Bill empowers the Minister to cut the statutory grants to the universities.  Otherwise, the Bill deals with the question of salaries.  I wonder why this provision is reserved in a Bill dealing with salaries.  Would the Minister be good enough to explain that?  The proper way to deal with statutory grants to universities would be in a Bill for that purpose on which the merits of the matter could be fully debated.  The Minister is empowered in this Bill to cut the statutory grant to the universities to the extent of 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>That provides the Minister with a weapon which he can hold over the universities.  It gives him power to interfere with their autonomy.  It is the thin end of the wedge in introducing interference and I should like to know why that provision is there.  The Bill deals with the cutting of salaries. This section deals with the statutory grants to universities.  It may have no reference to the salaries of the professors; it may be spread over many other things.  I feel inclined to introduce an amendment on Report Stage, but I should like to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter.</P>

The title of the Bill recites that it is an Act to make or provide for the &ldquo;making of deductions from remuneration ... and also to make or provide for the making of deductions from certain classes of grants ... and to provide for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 deal with deductions from grants to certain classes of bodies and grants to local authorities. Section 13 deals with the specific case of universities.  As its short title indicates, this is a Bill to make temporary economies in the public services, including the service of the universities. There is nothing in this Bill which gives the Minister power to dictate in any way to the universities as to how they will carry out the retrenchment which reduction of their grants necessarily involves.  I do not see that there <Col N="412" /> is any point in the statement by Senator O'Hanlon&mdash;that we are interfering with the autonomy of the universities. The university authorities themselves, after a fairly frank and full discussion; are satisfied that we are no longer interfering with them&mdash;that, in fact, we never had in mind interference with the autonomy of the universities.</P>

      <P>Does not the Minister think that the whole question of university education is sufficiently important to warrant a Bill in itself?  That question has already been referred to in connection with the Gárda.  Surely, the question of university education is one that should be debated on its merits.  The Minister should not interfere with a statutory grant to the universities except by means of a specific Bill.</P>

      <P>What would be the advantage?  We should have to make the deduction in any event.  This Bill has had a fairly stormy passage through both Houses.  It was fully discussed. A large part of the discussion on Committee Stage and on the Fourth and Fifth Stages in the other House related to the universities.  From the point of view of the universities the Bill was adequately discussed.  If we had decided to deal with the universities in a separate Bill we should have had the same discussion. There would be no advantage.  There would, in fact, be a great disadvantage, because we should have wasted twice as much Parliamentary time, and other and more important measures would, consequently, have been held up.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 44:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Part IV.  Before the word &ldquo;artizans&rdquo; in paragraph (b) to insert the words &ldquo;scale payment sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.  As everybody knows, the allowance made to these people is ridiculously low and inadequate, and I suggest to the Minister he should exempt them altogether from the operations of the Bill.  I do not know whether this economy will mean much money.  I do not think it can, because the allowances are very small.  It was demonstrated in the Dáil that in many cases the allowances these people get can hardly cover expenses, allowing for rent.  They have even to supply paper and ink and accommodation for the public.  Except to the extent that this office gives the holders a little standing in the locality, it is of no consequence at all.  I am sorry I have not the rates here showing what the allowances are.  They are astonishingly low, and I suggest that the Minister should consider this amendment favourably.</P>

      <P>It may be true to say that the amount of money involved in this amendment is small, but the question of principle arises.  I do not see how we could exclude these people <Col N="414" /> from the Bill and not exclude other part-time officers who may be receiving payment from the State on a considerable scale.  In some cases, the scales for these sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses reach as high as £400. At the other end of the scale, payment is conparatively small&mdash;down to about £18.  We are only regarding one-third of the payment made to them as salary: we are taking it that the other two-thirds covers expenses&mdash;rent and other things.  While the practical effect of accepting the amendment would not be very great, the question of principle involved would be great.</P>
      <P>If I accepted this amendment, I should find it difficult to exclude part-time employees such as medical men, lawyers&mdash;I see that I am getting support for the amendment now&mdash;architects, engineers and others who receive considerable part-time payment and who, consequently, should suffer a &ldquo;cut.&rdquo;  On the question of the smallness of the remuneration, I ask the Seanad to remember that the smaller amounts are paid as a sort of rental for counter-space.  That is really what it amounts to.  The fact that the post office is situate in a certain shop and that the occupier gives portion of the window and counter space to the post office is a decided attraction to the premises.  It is a good advertisement. If we were to put these places up to tender, I am certain that instead of having to pay people for keeping them, people would pay us for the privilege of having them.  On its merits, there is very little to be said for this amendment.</P>
