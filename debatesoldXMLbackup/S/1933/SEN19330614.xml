    <Title>National Health Insurance Bill, 1933. - Local Government (Dublin) Bill, 1933.&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That this Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to amend the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930 which, among other things, set up a special franchise in the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commercial franchise, as it is generally called, which it is the object <Col N="1771" /> of this Bill to discontinue, was created by the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1923.  In the course of the debate in the Dáil, the then Minister repudiated very definitely the suggestion that the demand for this special franchise came either from the Chamber of Commerce or from any organisation of business people in the city, and in this House, he stated that the object of the franchise was to integrate into the general administrative council a class of persons and, supporting the provision, an extraordinary comment was made to the effect that, &ldquo;on the whole, the higher the valuation the better the brains because the greater the amount of success.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I opposed this franchise at every stage of the Bill of 1930.  It is wrong in principle to create from among the people a privileged class and we do not admit that votes should be given according to the size of a bank account.  The proposal was indicative of the distrust of the ordinary people by the Executive and just merely a despairing attempt to attract a particular political element in a bid for the retention of political power and to render the representative of the ordinary people impotent on the City Council.</P>
    <P>We desire that there shall be in our municipal councils competent representatives including businessmen, but those men are no use who will not do ordinary duties of a citizen unless they have a special franchise and rights.</P>
    <P>One might infer that but for the commercial franchise, business interests would have been unrepresented on the City Council, but that did not prove to be the case.  The ordinary members of the Dublin Corporation are drawn from a wide variety of business professions and classes.</P>
    <P>It was admitted, as I have said, that the demand for this franchise did not come from businessmen, and subsequent events showed the truth of this admission.  If the franchise were the valuable concession it was claimed to be, every qualified person would surely have claimed his vote.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1772" /> During the period between the passing of the Act of 1930 and the Corporation elections, there was not sufficient time available to permit the making of a house to house inquiry to find out particulars of all electors entitled to the commercial franchise. Instead, wide publicity was given and electors were invited to send in claims &mdash;and that involved a minimum of trouble in return for the right of entry into this privileged coterie.  Notwithstanding the drive made, only 1,048 entries appeared on the commercial register, whereas a complete register would have contained over 2,500 entries.  It may truly be said that the best comment on the franchise was supplied by the people the Bill sought to enfranchise, for more than half either did not want it, or were too indifferent or apathetic to claim it.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I submit this Bill to discontinue this system.  The total membership of the Corporation is not proposed to be reduced on the passing of this Bill and the Borough Electors Area Order, of 1930, will be amended so as to distribute over the existing borough electoral areas the five seats at present reserved to commercial members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>My delay in rising to speak was that I expected from some <Col N="1773" /> member of this House who has the same opinion in regard to this Bill as the Minister has some fuller defence of the proposal than has been advanced by the Minister.  We were all justified in expecting a more complete defence than that contained in the brief statement that the Minister has read.  That statement might get fairly good marks as a schoolboy essay on the subject of democracy versus autocracy, but, as a serious contribution from a Minister who is Vice-President of the Executive Council to a matter affecting the administration of the capital city, it is certainly disappointing.  That the Minister should treat the matter with such brevity&mdash;I might almost say levity&mdash;is astounding.  Those of us who have taken the trouble to recall what led up to this innovation of a commercial register for the election of a certain number of representatives on the civic council must realise that that proposal was frankly an experiment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A long period of undoubted dissatisfaction with the conduct of civic affairs in this city resulted in the abolition of the Corporation and the institution of Commissioners.  When the Commissioners had discharged their function, and it was decided to try to restore a popularly-elected body, a serious attempt was made to set up a council whose function would be to attend to the administration of the city and not to imagine themselves a kind of substitute for the national legislature and, undoubtedly, it was decided by those responsible for the drafting of the legislation for that purpose to give facilities, from the point of view of a certain number, for the introduction of procedure for the election of a certain element representing certain bodies and an element, not of the ascendancy class, as I think it was described by the Minister in his statement to the Dáil, but an element that was vitally concerned with the good administration of the city.  That was, I think, the object, although the Minister made the suggestion in his statement to-day that the introduction of that element into the Corporation of Dublin was a despairing effort on the part of a political party that was losing ground, to introduce an element <Col N="1774" /> that would render impotent the representatives of the ordinary people. I think those were the words used.</P>
    <P>Those of this House who recall the discussion on the original measure and know what the facts are will know that that statement is quite the reverse of fact.  There was no intention whatever, and no desire, to render importent the representatives of the ordinary people by the introduction of an element from what the Minister has been pleased to describe as the ascendancy class.  It was to secure the sympathetic co-operation, in the civic administration, of a certain class who were vitally interested, from their commercial position, but who were confronted by difficulties more than those that ordinarily beset candidates for municipal honours.  That was the object, as I understood it&mdash;an experiment to try to improve the administration of the City of Dublin&mdash;and if there was a case to be made to-day against that experiment that case should have been based, in my judgment, on this, that that experiment has failed, that the element introduced proved themselves incapable, that the element introduced proved themselves an obstacle to civic administration, and that there has been a popular demand for the abolition of this experiment. Not one sentence or one word fell from the lips of the Minister either here to-day, or in the other House, to demonstrate that the city has suffered from this innovation in civic elections or that the representatives elected proved to be incompetent or to be obstacles to civic progress or that there was any popular outcry for the abolition of this commercial register. I hope that this discussion will not terminate when I sit down, and I hope that those who are going to support the Minister will supply the answers to these queries which the Minister failed to give.  I hope they will not overlook the fact that tributes were paid to the efficiency and capacity of those commercial representatives by speakers in the other House who supported the Minister in this Bill.  One Deputy, who strongly supported the Minister in his proposals, said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1775" />&ldquo;I say without the slightest hesitation, that the men sent in on the business register were excellent men and splendid representatives.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am quite conscious of the fact that the nature of this proposal as embodied in the commercial register is repugnant to the democratic theories of many people and Senators here, including Senator Johnson, Senator Farren and others, when this Bill which is now being amended was before this House, very strongly presented their point of view.  Undoubtedly, from the point of view of sheer theory, their argument is strong, but this, in my opinion, is a matter upon which we can ride theories to the death, and the question is, if a particular theory happens to run counter to what the practical necessities of the moment suggest should be required, then, why not give the theory a rest and allow the practical realities of the situation the opportunity at least of being tried?  I am very much afraid that the proposal before us to-day is not a proposal to improve the corporate life of Dublin. It is not a proposal, in my opinion, intended to improve the personnel of the Corporation of Dublin and the slimy trail of petty political partisanship is over every line of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Last night in the City of Dublin Fianna Fáil appealed to the electorate for support of their candidates and the Minister for Education addressed one meeting, at which, I think, Senator Mrs. Clarke presided.  On what grounds did the Minister for Education appeal to the electorate for support? Was it on the grounds of civic administration? Did he put before the electorate the programme of the Party to improve the City of Dublin.  I read carefully through his statement and I could find nothing.  His appeal to the citizens of Dublin for the election of the Fianna Fáil representatives to the civic council was this, and I quote from that paper which is supposed to tell the truth, the <i>Irish Press:</i></P>
    <P>&ldquo;They had to develop the land, and during the next week or so, they would introduce a measure which <Col N="1776" /> would be a big step forward in the division of the ranch land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is, so far as I can see, an attempt to get into the civic council of this city a body of men whose main objective will be, not the scrutiny of the city's administration, not the custodianship of the city's interest but to get a body of men who, no matter how unfitted they are for such a position, will be people who will be, so to speak, &ldquo;Yes men&rdquo; to the people who run the Government of the country. We are told that these men elected on the commercial register can get representation in the ordinary way.  I do not think that the Minister or his supporters will deny that, if these representatives who have been elected to the Corporation on this special register do go forward for election in the ordinary way, all the forces of the organisation, all the influence of the Ministers, and all the efforts of the Party which the Minister stands for will be thrown in in an effort to defeat them in securing that representation. The Minister in the other House spoke in a strong strain.  He has been somewhat more restrained in his references here to-day but anyone who is not politically blind can see what the Minister is seeking, what this Bill aims at and what is foreshadowed in other measures which are to come before us shortly, is the political ascendancy of this political party regardless of its merits or its policy.  I have fought against ascendancy and I am as much opposed to the ascendancy of Fianna Fáil, which has a past which should, I think, make us pause and consider carefully how far we will trust people with that past in the conduct of affairs, as I was to the old ascendancy that is dead and buried and is not going to be revived.  I say that we stand to-day with the position that there is no question of ascendancy.  There is a question of common citizenship within this State and that every citizen who observes the law is entitled to equality of treatment.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the sudden vehement enthusiasm of the <Col N="1777" /> two Labour Senators unless it be that I have converted them to my point of view, but I do not know whether the age of miracles is past or not.  Seeing that Senator Johnson, however, has so strenuously intervened, I should like to recall a statement he made when this proposal was before the House.  On 4th June, 1930, Senator Johnson delivered himself of this:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think it is bad principle to put into the responsibility of public administration a certain type of men who have no interest in it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is precisely what the Minister and his Party are aiming at&mdash;to secure that these bodies shall be manned, not by people who have a sense of responsibility, a sense of the serious issues at stake, but by persons who have no serious interest in the conduct of affairs other than that of supporting the Party at present in power.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnson and Senator Farren seemed to think that I made a slip when I claimed equality of citizenship. I say, deliberately, that there is no outrage whatever of that principle in the commercial register.  There is one Senator who, I think, I can claim to have the support of if a vote is taken, and that is Senator Dowdall.  Speaking on the matter on June 4th, 1930, Senator Dowdall adverted to this proposal and said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have no strong feeling upon this particular point but, frankly, I cannot see the evils predicted arising from it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think Senator Dowdall made a further statement equally cogent and to the point.  But that was 1930 and this is 1933.  Surely if the evils predicted then had really eventuated, the Minister would be in a position to-day to show us where the proposals of the Act of 1930 have inflicted injuries, or produced evil results.  Again I say he has not adverted to the results of the Act of 1930.  In the Dáil he urged as one of the reasons for the introduction of this Bill the fact that he and his Party had opposed the Bill introduced in 1930.  On the very same ground he has equal justification for proposing the repeal of the entire Act of 1930.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the statement the Minister made on the Second Reading of the <Col N="1778" /> Bill in the Dáil, and one would think on reading his opening remarks that the Bill of 1930 was going to inflict on the citizens of Dublin something like what the Nine Plagues inflicted on the Egyptians.  We have to-day no suggestion of a proposal to repeal the Act of 1930.  Evidently the Minister and his Party have discovered that their judgment in regard to that Act was wrong; that their views have not been justified, and that they would not be justified in proposing the repeal of the Act.  I say they have just as little reason, as far as the facts and results are concerned, and as far as evidence is concerned, for proposing the abolition of this commercial register as they have for proposing the repeal of the whole Act.</P>
    <P>It is a pity, sir, that the Minister and his Party could not cease to think in terms of their own Party's interests. It is a pity they would not abandon the idea of justifying their political past, because I am afraid that if they live to be old as Methuselah they will not have sufficient time to succeed in accomplishing that task.  They have made their blunders, they have made their mistakes, and it is nearly time that they realised that these blunders, though the effects are still projected in the present, were caused in the past. They should finish with their political past, face realities and cease troubling the citizens of this State with proposals which are reactionary in the worst sense, and which will do no possible good, but which may inflict very far-reaching injury on the citizens of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this matter Senator Milroy expressed the hope that the debate would not close without some other speakers following him.  I question if I should have attempted to speak at all only for the covert and insulting attack that Senator Milroy has made on members of the old Corporation of Dublin.  Just as the Senator was brave in the past, he is equally brave to-day, but he gave the show away as to what is in his mind when he mentioned the question of equality.  This commercial register, or to give it its more correct term, this <Col N="1779" /> money register, was far more insidious in its character than the mere electing of five members to the Dublin Corporation. We heard the word ascendancy mentioned.  In my opinion that register was a revival of class distinction in public affairs by the very worst element, the element of money.</P>
      <P>As ascendancy has been mentioned, it brings back memories of ascendancy days with their bitterness, their bigotry and want of human kindness towards the lowly people of this country.  This money franchise is the foundation, the encouragement and the excuse for Communists to build upon.  It is an incitement to war between capital and labour, two factors that should run hand-in-hand and that no piece of legislation should disturb. Perhaps worse than all, this glorification of the moneylender, the profiteer and the combine make three factors which are generally conceded by everyone to have been a carse&mdash;an accursed curse of every country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to calm water, seldom, in my opinion, has the irony of fate been better exemplified than to find Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly sitting here as Minister for Local Government and Public Health, where Deputy Mulcahy formerly sat.  Fate has another innings when we find placed on the shoulders of a Minister who, for over a quarter of a century was a member of the old Dublin Corporation, the duty, which I am sure is a pleasant duty, of removing the stain on the character of the citizens of Dublin which was placed upon it by the infliction of this money franchise, which was so vigorously sponsored by ex-Minister Mulcahy. Aye, and I remember well that it was passed with great glee by a most obliging and willing assembly.  Is it not reasonable to ask why, and for what reason was this money franchise placed upon the City of Dublin?  Why was it placed upon Dublin, above all, if it was the wonderful and bold adventure claimed for it by many Senators and many Deputies?  Why were the other cities left out?  I notice Senator Crosbie looking at me, and that gives me inspiration.  Why were the business communities of <Col N="1780" /> Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Galway and other centres ignored?  Perhaps Senator Crosbie, for whom I have a loving regard, in conjunction with my old friend Senator Dowdall, will supply the answer as to why the business community of Cork was ignored.  What political sin did they commit that they were passed over? I am greatly afraid that some day the Senator will have a bad quarter of an hour with the business community and with the Press of Cork, led perhaps by the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, for not having taken a more lively interest when the Cork Municipal Act was going through and looking after the business community. Cork men may have their division, but there is one thing which stands to their credit: it is a case of Cork first and the rest nowhere.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that it would be the aim of every Government, and the joy and pride of every Minister to keep intact the dignity, the honour and the privileges of this old city, a city dating back for so many centuries which is still, always has been and always will be the capital of Ireland, instead of having this monstrosity of a money franchise placed upon it.  In my opinion the passing of this commercial register was a most unhappy piece of legislation, as it revived many putrid memories.  Previous to the passing of the Reform Act of 1840 no one was elected to the City Council except those who were grandiloquently styled merchant princes.  You will observe, a Chathaoirligh, that compared to the previous occasion we discussed this, I have mellowed in my description of them, but these sparking plugs of infamy, these thugs, and I say it advisedly, daylight robbers&mdash;the Minister will bear me out in this, as he knows it full well&mdash;pilfered the city's property, giving themselves long leases for 999 years, as the leases in existence to-day show. A favourite pastime with those who were on the money franchise at that time&mdash;the Minister again will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;was to amuse themselves by drawing lots for the citizens' property, the portion of the city which still retained that name, and then when their own evil designs were <Col N="1781" /> satisfied, they sliced out the citizens' property amongst their friends as in the case of the Pembroke estate, earning for the City Council the by no means prepossessing title of the rotten Corporation of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I remember an incident which happened close on 50 years ago, which proves I am no chicken now, and which I frankly admit completely soured me all through my life, private and public, against a money franchise.  There was a bye-election at that time in North County Dublin for a seat on the North Dublin Board of Guardians.  There were two candidates.  My father, God be good to him, took a passing interest in one of them.  A week before the election it was discovered that the result would be very tight.  The evening before the election, a gentleman, a real live gentleman, one of those gentlemen who show their superiority and their true blood by dropping the &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; and calling you by your surname, called into my father's office. He said: &ldquo;O'Neill, if you get me £20 you can have my six votes for your friend.&rdquo;  The money was not forthcoming, and the sequel to the election was that my father's friend lost by six votes.  I am not going to say that will happen now, but it might happen, and it could happen, and the best way to prevent such corruption from happening is to do away with the money franchise which is the purpose of the Bill the Minister has brought before the House to-day.</P>
    <P>In saying that I want to make it perfectly clear that I do not cast any reflection whatever upon the five men who were elected to the Corporation by this franchise.  They were five good, solid, broad-minded and true citizens.  I am not going to say they were anything better than the other members of the Corporation, but by their training they were well fitted to be members of the Corporation even though they were returned on this franchise.  The fact is that three of them had been members of the old Corporation, the connection of some of them with it going back for 40 years.  Two of them had been members of the Corporation when it was dissolved, but we have this startling <Col N="1782" /> fact that the great men connected with the commercial register had to fall back on the members of the old Corporation, with all its suggested imperfections, to represent them. Now does it occur to the sensible-minded members of the Seanad&mdash;I take it that we are all sensible-minded, including my old friend, Senator Milroy&mdash;what an anomaly this money franchise presents?  As I stated here before the citizens of Dublin as a whole, with all the citizens of the State, are considered good enough and honourable enough to elect members to the Dáil to legislate for the country, to help the State, to elect a Government and to make and unmake Ministers.  But now we have the startling fact, which for some reason has not been explained sufficiently, that the citizens of Dublin as a whole are considered not straight enough, not honest enough, and not capable enough, to elect the City Council as a whole.  Another anomaly that this money franchise presents to me is this: Heretofore the Dublin Corporation was elected by wardens. The Minister will remember&mdash;both of us entered the Corporation about the same time&mdash;that at my first election I stood for the Rotunda Ward in which there were only 2,000 voters. That gave one an opportunity of knowing the people and of doing something for them.  It earned for the Corporation the title of City Fathers.  The members were a kind of father over the wards they represented. Then the spirit of combines came along and there was an amalgamation of wards, with the result that when I had again to face an election I had to go before 15,000 voters.  At the last election, in the area which the Minister and I represented, there were 31,000 voters.  Just think of it, a man like myself belonging to no political party&mdash;I suppose my political views are not mature enough for the acceptance of any of them&mdash;going out and fighting on my own at an election and canvassing, if you will, 31,000 voters.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the object which this amalgamation of wards has achieved is this: that people, I will not say of <Col N="1783" /> independent means, but certainly of independent thought, have not the ghost of a chance in going forward for the Dublin Corporation.  That anomaly appears much bigger, as I have stated, in the Greater Dublin Bill.  The wards were turned into areas.  There were five areas.  I am not going to inflict on the House the number of electors in each area, but in the five areas there were 145,658 electors.  I am sure the Minister has taken note already&mdash;it is impossible for him to get together all the threads of Local Government affairs in the short time he has been in office&mdash; of the further anomaly that under the Greater Dublin Bill Pembroke and Rathmines are in the municipal area for voting at municipal elections, but for Parliamentary elections they are in the County Dublin, thereby taking us back to what was so well known in the old days as the true spirit of jerry-mandering. Out of 145,658 electors, the commercial or money franchise with all its boomeranging, battering rams, machine guns and everything else that it could call into play, was only able, as the Minister has told us, to muster at the last election a total of 1048 electors.  After all the talk of the great people they are, that the material and national salvation of the country would be destroyed if they were not returned, all they could muster was 1048 electors.</P>
    <P>One need not be a great mathematician to work it out.  On the one hand it takes 4,855 ordinary electors to elect a member of the Council, but under the commercial register a Councillor represents only 205 electors. That is, 4,855 ordinary electors have as much power as 205 electors on the money franchise.  I never like to use similes except they are classical, but there is only one phrase in my opinion that would describe that situation, and that is that it is the absolute limit. Again may I ask, and I shall still wait for an answer even from Senator Milroy or any Deputy of the Dáil, why was this money register passed for Dublin City and Dublin City alone?  I may get an answer later on, but one is always safe in remembering the opinions of the man in the street.  We do not perhaps <Col N="1784" /> care much about his opinion; yet those who are seeking election are very careful to get the opinion of the man in the street.  In saying this I do not wish to create any bitterness.  The general opinion of the man in the street at that time was that this money franchise was passed to mollify the continual wail of the Chamber of Commerce.  It was further passed as as a sop to the brotherhood with whose help it was hoped, as many expressed themselves at the time, &ldquo;to prevent that damn rascal de Valera from getting into power.&rdquo;  De Valera is now in power; the Oath has gone, but the money register has still to be removed.</P>
    <P>A great many peculiar and original arguments have been used in favour of this money register.  Some of them, in my opinion, step over the border line of decency, of tact, and of commonsense. I have here in my hand a circular from the Chamber of Commerce. I presume every other Senator has also received it.  In the choice language that is used in that circular we are told that if the money franchise is done away with &ldquo;such a position tends towards laxity and extravagance to the ultimate detriment of the city's business.&rdquo;  We are told that the business community are the be-all and end-all, the brains of the city.  We are told that by electing them into the Corporation, we shall have men who will be able to go to the banks, put a pistol to the heads of the Governors and Directors and make them give the Corporation everything they want.  I might recall that Alderman Cosgrave, as he then was, was chairman of the most important committee of the Dublin Corporation, the finance committee.  That was at a time of great danger when the British Government were at loggerheads with the Corporation, stopping grants and making the carrying out of corporative affairs almost an impossibility.</P>
    <P>As a retaliation Dáil Eireann at the period&mdash;I am sure the Minister remembers it&mdash;made an order that no police rate was to be struck and that no income tax was to be paid by the Corporation or the citizens, placing the citizens in a position between the <Col N="1785" /> devil and the deep sea.  If they paid their income tax they ran the risk of what was popularly known at the time as being &ldquo;plugged.&rdquo;  If they did not pay their income tax they found a gunboat waiting for them to take them away to lodgings in an English prison.  With this state of affairs, money in the Corporation was running very short.  In fact, there was a possibility of the public services being stopped.  It was suggested&mdash;the reason I am going into this is to show that even in the days of the old Corporation the members were trusted by the banks&mdash;that the Governors of the Bank of Ireland should be approached.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on record, to the credit of the Governors of the Bank of Ireland, that they acted a noble part towards the Corporation and towards the city at that particular period.  Alderman Cosgrave, as he then was, the Town Clerk, and myself as Lord Mayor, called upon the Governors of the Bank of Ireland.  My friend, Senator Guinness, if I might call him such, will correct me if I am wrong.  I think Senator Guinness was chairman at the time.  I do not know if my equally great friend, Senator Jameson, was a governor, but at any rate after hearing what I might call our wail of woe, Senator Guinness there and then said that the Corporation could have an overdraft of £100,000, with the addendum, which set me thinking and touched my vanity, that it was on the personal security of Alderman Cosgrave and me, as Lord Mayor of Dublin.  The reason I mention this little incident is to show that neither of us was a merchant prince; we were both men of small business.  But the Governors of the Bank of Ireland trusted the Corporation then and trusted the members then.  I am satisfied that they will trust the Corporation equally well now without the help of the money franchise.</P>
    <P>I regret keeping Senators so long but, as I said before, frankly I have had such hatred of this money franchise engendered into me in my youth that I would just like to say what I feel about it.  One of the most peculiar <Col N="1786" /> arguments used in favour of this money franchise was put forward by Senator Bagwell, who is just going out. Senator Bagwell, when this money franchise was considered before, used the most extraordinary arguments in favour of it.  They may not have been extraordinary to him, because men generally use extraordinary arguments who have extraordinary minds.  He said that the greater the wealth, the greater the brains.  I am sure Senator Bagwell will correct me if I am wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LaurenceONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the use of repeating it?  I mentioned it here before, when this money franchise was considered, using the very same remarks, and from that day to this Senator Bagwell has not contradicted me nor found fault with my remarks. I shall save myself the trouble of repeating them.  If Senator Bagwell looks up the debate on the occasion we discussed this money franchise before, he will find exactly what I did say.  The greater the wealth the greater the brains!  It makes one ask were Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins, Cathal Brugha and Austin Stack men of money?  Was Pádraig Pearse or Tom Clarke or many others who died for Ireland, men of money?  Yes, they were men of wealth, a great wealth of love of country, ignoring material considerations in laying down their lives for their country.  That is the kind of wealth that should appeal to us.  Another most peculiar argument in support of this money register was used by no less a person than the late Minister for Local Government, General Mulcahy.  I must say that when this Bill was last in the Dáil, Deputy Mulcahy discussed it in a fair and broad-minded manner, but always having present to his mind that this money franchise was his own child and, naturally, that he would stand by <Col N="1787" /> it.  When the Bill was discussed before in the Dáil, Deputy Mulcahy made the startling statement: &ldquo;Men engaged in business are too much immersed in their own affairs, and do not go in either for parliamentary or municipal honours.&rdquo;  In face of that, ex-Minister Mulcahy rattled his scabbard and, in a phrase which I think he used quite recently, sand-bagged his supporters into passing this Bill, although the presence of many businessmen in the Seanad and in the Dáil gave the lie direct to the statement made by the ex-Minister.  I did not agree with the ex-Minister's statement then.  I do not agree with it now because, during my time in the Corporation, going back over a quarter of a century, many businessmen were elected.  If they showed any ability&mdash;I am sure the Minister will bear me out in this&mdash;that ability was recognised and they were placed in positions of trust&mdash;some of them for a very long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the strong arguments used in favour of this money franchise is that it is not fair that directors of companies should not have votes. That argument was used before by Senator Douglas&mdash;a man whom I always listen to with respect, who is always clear, clever and concise. Senator Douglas said&mdash;I am in thorough agreement with him&mdash;that it was unfair that directors of companies should have no votes.  I agree with him.  I think it is grossly unfair that the directors of companies should not have votes.  They are human beings like the rest of us and they should have votes.  If they are as qualified as other members of the community, they should have one vote each but certainly not six votes.  We are told &ldquo;Look at Guinness's, with their tremendous valuation and the amount of money invested in the concern.&rdquo;  But I think that Guinness's is one of the biggest voting factors in the city either for municipal or parliamentary vacancies. The shareholders in Guinness's are many and they are scattered over the city.  It is only natural that they should vote in the interest of the undertaking in which their money is invested.  It is equally natural that the employees of <Col N="1788" /> a vast concern like Guinness's should. so long as principles have not to be submerged, vote in the interest of the undertaking in which they are earning their bread and butter.  Where is the hardship in not giving, say, the directors of Guinness's six votes each? Not alone have the electors on the commercial register a vote in respect of that register but they have a vote&mdash; the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;on the other register as well. They have a double shuffle in the game.  Consequently, I do not see&mdash; if I did I would conscientiously admit it&mdash;where the hardship comes in in giving directors one vote in municipal elections, the same as any ordinary person.</P>
    <P>Now, I come to, perhaps, a deeper and sadder side of this picture.  I have a son who went through war's horrors from beginning to end.  Many members of the Seanad, who may now be having a quiet chat in the writing-room, stood on recruiting platforms during the European War.  When doing so, did they ask a potential recruit what was his class, how many shares he held or what his banking account was like?  No.  It was one of the grandest features of that unfortunate European War that men of all classes, of all religions, rich and poor alike, stood shoulder to shoulder, fighting for what they believed to be a just cause.</P>
    <P>When Senator Milroy was speaking about equality&mdash;the Senator's bark is worse than his bite&mdash;I recalled that he took a noble part in recruiting for Ireland.  In recruiting then, did he say: &ldquo;Later on, I shall support a measure of class distinction&rdquo;?  No, he would not dare to say that.  It is only now that that becomes possible in this filthy, nasty political wrangle, with one side trying to down the other, with old friends at one another's throats, with the good-nature of men who would have died for one another, now, owing to the political dirt, their good nature has become warped.  What did the millions of men fight and die for at home and abroad?  Many of them we can see to-day going about shell-shocked, maimed and blind.  The bones of <Col N="1789" /> others were left to bleach upon the plains of Flanders or moulder beneath the waves of Suvla Bay.  Many of these men paid the toll at Mons, on the slopes of Gallipoli, on the sands of Egypt, in Mesopotamia and, in fact, wherever the battle line extended.  What did they die for?  Was it to sustain a class distinction now?  No.  I say, without fear of contradiction&mdash;we saw it on the walls, in the papers; it was pounded into us night and day&mdash;that the war was to make the world safe for democracy, one man one vote.  I shall be surprised if the members of the Seanad besmirch the memory of those who have gone, if they belittle the character of those who are left by voting to sustain this class distinction in public affairs.  Stripped of superfluities, that is what it means&mdash;class distinction in public affairs.  If those recruiters for England and those recruiters for Ireland are false to the memory of those they misled, I say with sincerity, I say in sorrow and not in anger, and not wishing to appear eynical, &ldquo;May God forgive them.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from Senator O'Neill's speech that he considers I should support this measure because I am a Pressman.  He is quite right in that because in the good old days that the Senator speaks of, the Corporation of Cork was always good for about five columns of extremely readable matter. But it was &ldquo;the flowers that bloom in the Spring.&rdquo;  It had nothing to say to the question of the rates and taxes in the City of Cork.  It had a great deal to say to politics.  I want to endorse what Senator O'Neill has said.  I do not, and never did, agree with the allegation that either the Dublin Corporation or the Cork Corporation was a corrupt body.  What I do say is that they were so occupied with matters outside the immediate interest of the Cities of Dublin and Cork that the business of both these cities was very seriously neglected.  In those days I had no vote for the Corporation of Cork.  I did not live in the City of Cork.  My firm were very large ratepayers but I had not a vote for the election of a single member of the Corporation. That may account for the very unbusinesslike way the business <Col N="1790" /> of the City of Cork was conducted.</P>
      <P>Now I have a vote for the City of Cork, and I can tell you that I believe there is not a solitary person in the City of Cork to-day who would want to go back to the old regime.</P>

      <P>He is not from Dublin; he is from Drogheda, I think. However, we can point now to a city where everything is being done for the working people of the city.  We have houses there which, I think, have not their equal in any city I know.  We have streets there that are almost too perfect, so much so that I always point out that there would be no labour required on them for a very long time.  To come back to the question of the old affairs and the new, were we not, all along, trying to get politics out of the corporations? The business of a corporation is to spend the rates efficiently, and to take no notice of anything outside the rates. This measure wants to bring back, in my opinion, the old bad system of introducing extraneous matters into the affairs of the municipalities and, on that ground, I certainly strongly oppose this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in exactly the same position with regard to this question as I was when the principle was introduced in the Bill in 1930.  We opposed, on that occasion, the principle that was instituted in the Bill that there should be a property franchise. We pointed out, on that occasion, that the people who had a property franchise had, in addition, the ordinary franchise.  I have heard a good deal of talk about the necessity for the introduction of the business element into the affairs of the Dublin Corporation, and, by the way, it is a most extraordinary thing that this has not been tried on anybody else but Dublin. Cork has not got a commercial register.  Galway has not got a commercial register, and no other city in Ireland has a commercial register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin is the only city in Ireland, or in these islands, with <Col N="1791" /> such a thing as a commercial register. The argument was put forward that, in order to get the business element to take an interest in civic affairs, it was essential that this commercial register should be introduced, and my only object in getting up to speak on this is to blow that argument sky high. Prior to the introduction of the Local Government Bill of 1898, it was practically all a commercial register.  The ordinary working man who occupied a small house, or who lived in a Dublin tenement, although he might have as much intelligence as the shopkeepers and property owners, had no vote, and the business community had absolute and complete control of the civic affairs of the city.  Anybody who looks up the ancient records of Dublin, and inquires into the antecedents and the carryings on of the business community, when they had that absolute and complete control, would never give them a vote any more.  The most corrupt body that was ever on a public authority in Ireland was the business community that sold the city estate to one of its pals.  The city estate was sold in the most corrupt and outrageous fashion by the business community, who were the people who then had complete control of the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and lots drawn for it.  After 1898, the franchise was extended to the people who paid the bulk of the rates.  The people who inhabited tenement houses in Dublin got the vote, which they never had before, and, when they did get that vote, a most extraordinary thing happened in that the personnel of the Corporation was composed, mainly, of the business community.  There never has been any period in the history of the Dublin Corporation in which the business community, as such, had not got a majority of the representation on the Dublin Corporation.  If that is so, what is the necessity for keeping up a commercial register for the purpose of getting business representation on the Corporation?  Senator Milroy spoke about equality.  That is all we want. We want equality, but we do not want <Col N="1792" /> class privileges.  We want every citizen to have the right to the vote for the election of the representatives who are to look after the local services.  I happened to be a member of the Dublin Corporation, and this I will say for my native city, no matter who may decry it, or what may be said about the Corporation&mdash;the Dublin Corporation can be proud of the essential services it has placed at the disposal of the citizens. Its main drainage system is the best in any city in Great Britain or Ireland; its water system is better than any other in Europe, and its lighting system, inaugurated over 25 years ago, has now been admitted to be the best scheme of electric lighting ever known in these islands.  There are the three essential services, water, sewage and light, and everybody admits that this city has the best services in these respects than any other city in these islands, notwithstanding all the condemnation we have heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the commercial register and the statements about getting the business people on it, a most extraordinary thing is that three out of the five people elected on the commercial register were people who had been members of the Corporation and who had been elected on the ordinary franchise.  That, in itself, is a complete and absolute condemnation of the commercial register.  Three of the five were men who had been elected under the ordinary franchise to serve on the Corporation, and they did serve for a number of years.  That is a complete condemnation of the system.  Further than that, owing to the extension of the Dublin city boundaries, there have been taken in areas which formerly had local authorities of their own, and which were composed, almost mainly, of the business community.  I think it is true to say that 80 per cent. of the Rathmines Urban Council was composed of the business community.  Pembroke Urban District Council, which was also taken in, was also mainly composed of the business community, so that, therefore, with the extension of the franchise, and taking in the residential areas, which are almost entirely populated by the business community, these people have quite ample means for putting sufficient of their representatives <Col N="1793" /> on the Corporation.  I want to say, with regard to the remarks made by Senator Crosbie, that we want the local authorities to look after the interests of the citizens and not to be making speeches for the benefit of the electorate.  It is true that, on occasions, where there are full meetings of the Corporation, things are referred to that ought not to be referred to, but we must not be too hard on the members of the Corporation.  We must remember that we were all trained in the old days to do these things before we had the power to make the laws of this country.  We were all trained to use public boards for the purpose of ventilating the grievances the people of this country were suffering under at the time, and I have no hesitation in saying that most of the newspapers of the time were very active in publishing all these speeches.  Senator Johnson has reminded me that our local Press, during these periods, always gave us all the encouragement we required to carry on this particular type of propaganda.</P>
    <P>To be fair about it, however, it is not at the open meetings of the Corporation that the work is done.  The open meeting of the Corporation is called to consider certain matters, and there may be things introduced into the speeches that ought not to be introduced. It is, however, in the committees that the real work of the citizens is done.  I think it is only fair to say to Senator Crosbie and others, who are condemning the corporations, and the people who serve on the public boards, that if they knew the amount of work that the members of these bodies have to do at committee meetings, where the real work of the citizens is done, they would agree that the men and women who give their time for nothing to looking after the work of a Corporation like Dublin, knowing from experience the work that is required and attached to these committees, deserve very well of the citizens.  I must say for the business community that I made friends of many men who are members of the business community in Dublin. I admired and respected quite a large number of businessmen who were in the Corporation during my time.  I <Col N="1794" /> found some of them to be most efficient members of the Corporation and most self-sacrificing in giving their time to the interests of the citizens, but, having said that, I say, also, that the citizens of Dublin were prepared, at all times, to elect decent representatives, whether businessmen or otherwise, and there always has been a good representation of businessmen on the Dublin Corporation, so far as my memory serves me. I am speaking as a native-born citizen of Dublin, and I say that there never has been a time when there was less than 50 per cent. of the Dublin Corporation composed of businessmen, and, for that reason, I say that there is no necessity for the continuance of this Bill.  I opposed it on principle. By reason of the constitution of the present Corporation and the limited powers at their disposal, there is not much need to worry about this thing, because the present Corporation has not got very much power, but, at the same time, it is the principle I oppose. The principle is wrong, and, having been opposed to the principle when introduced, I certainly welcome the opportunity to remove it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is rather a pity that the issue which this Bill raises should have been made the opportunity for a discussion as to the merits, or demerits, of ancient corporations. Senator O'Neill was very much grieved by the remarks made by a previous Senator, and he went on to make some of the most extraordinary remarks about corporations in the past, all of which seems to be a pity and irrelevant.  If he meant to suggest &mdash;and I do not believe that he did mean it&mdash;that persons voting on the commercial register were more likely to be corrupt than any other representatives, I think he has no evidence whatever for suggesting anything of the kind. I do not think he did mean it, but his remarks might be taken as indicating that he had something of the kind in mind.  It does not seem to me that this matter has any definite relation to the merits or demerits of the Corporation as we knew it.  I am very glad to hear from Senator Farren&mdash;and I think his explanation of <Col N="1795" /> the reasons why the Dublin Corporation was political is a perfectly fair one&mdash;that, so far as the future is concerned, he does not consider that it is desirable that local bodies, now that we have our own Parliament, should spend their time discussing party politics.  With that I am in entire agreement.  I believe it is one of the most unfortunate signs of the present time that party politics seem to be again entering into local government, and I believe its only effect can be to the detriment of local government and to a weakening of the prestige of the local bodies.  Any measure which will have a tendency to increase that will, I believe, be bad for the country as a whole, and, no matter what party is in power, I believe they will live to regret if they aid, in any way, the introduction into local government of what should be national politics and kept to national politics.  To a large extent, the efficiency and standing of the country must be judged by the efficiency of its local bodies and will be so judged, to a large extent, by the people outside.</P>
      <P>It is in our interest, as part of the Oireachtas, to do everything in our power to make local government efficient and, as far as possible, to keep it out of affairs which inevitably we have to deal with, matters dealing with national politics.  Personally, I was very disappointed at the Minister's speech.  I was hoping that he would give the reasons why he opposed this measure a few years ago; reasons why, the experiment having been made, it should not be allowed to continue for a few years; why it should be immediately discontinued, and what substitute he intends to provide.  The opponents of the commercial register nearly always conveniently forget the position that was attempted to be met by the provision of that register.  We heard great eloquence to-day about the iniquity of a money register and a money franchise, but I have not heard anything at all about the unfairness of leaving a very large section of the community without votes for a number of years.  Was there nothing wrong in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> At the time the original Bill was introduced&mdash;and I am not justifying all the details of the provision&mdash;large numbers of the commercial community had no vote because they had formed limited companies.  For a number of years, as part of the development of commerce, there has been a considerable increase in the number of small private limited companies formed for purposes of convenience.  To talk about most of these as wealthy concerns is the height of absurdity.  These concerns formed limited companies with the result that they ceased to have any votes for the Corporation.  In the case of a small, but by no means wealthy, company with which I am connected five of us had votes in our ward.  I remember that when I was old enough to vote I exercised it on the first occasion for the Corporation. When it became convenient, entirely for family reasons, to form a limited company the five members of the company ceased to have votes.  Under this register, as it happened, the valuation of the premises entitled it to five votes so that we are in exactly the same position as before the company was formed.  That is held up as the height of iniquity.  I suggest that it was an attempt, at any rate, to meet a problem which required to be met.  To refer to it as something that is undemocratic is absurd, and is not facing the issue.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to consider this Bill without referring to another Bill which will presumably reach this House later.  Personally, I would have liked to have seen the decision on this Bill postponed until the other Bill had come before us.  I do not want to go into the merits of the other Bill now because it would mean dealing with matters which will have to be dealt with later.  If I understand the Minister aright he suggested that five members on the commercial register, out of the 35 in the Corporation would upset the declared will of the people.  I suggest that that is absurd.  At the moment, many of the voters for these representatives have no other votes.  The only reason why this particular experiment should not be continued is the fact that, possibly out of 2,000 votes only <Col N="1797" /> 1,000 had been exercised.  The experiment was one about which there was considerable difficulty.  It was not understood, and unfortunately in many cases where limited companies are not strictly personal concerns, where matters are dealt with by a secretary and brought before the board of directors, it was found they were not even on the register.</P>
    <P>We find Senator O'Neill in his very interesting speech putting forward a number of arguments against the commercial register.  He used a number of arguments which are very strongly in favour of the register.  He told us how much more satisfactory it was to him when there were only 2,000 voters, and how difficult the position became when the number was increased to 15,000.  There was an element of personal touch previously and a good deal could be done in the interests of the public generally.  I suggest that that is one case for the commercial register. There were five men representing fairly large ratepayers, at any rate representing people with large valuations, who would suffer considerably if rates were increased.  Having five people speaking for them and, to some extent, representing their interests out of 35 would not in my opinion destroy the democratic character of the Corporation.  On the other hand it might easily bring a very useful and an efficient element into a local body.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Neill also said that the tendency was to make it almost impossible for an independent-minded person to be elected on a large franchise.  I think the Senator will admit that persons standing for the commercial register have not gone forward on a party ticket and are not likely to do so. I know some cases where there would be strong differences of opinion and resentment if a party issue was mentioned. It would only be on the ground that a local body was not run on business lines, or was not dealing with its affairs efficiently that limited companies would come to a decision.  Most of them are anxious to keep out of politics when exercising their votes.  I suggest that no case has been made for suddenly discontinuing this experiment. A case might be made for amending, <Col N="1798" /> extending or altering the basis of the franchise.</P>
    <P>An election is going to take place in a few weeks' time.  This Bill will not come into operation for three years, or at any rate for a considerable time, so why rush it?  The only case made by the Minister is that he, and presumably his Party, opposed the section when the original Bill was going through the Dáil, because it was undemocratic.  I hope we will not have the principle adopted, that everything the present Opposition opposes they will put into legislation if they have to bring in a Bill on the question later. No real harm has been done and the Act could have been given a longer trial.  It may be that it would have failed because it has been difficult to get suitable men to stand as candidates. Only a very small section of the Corporation is elected on the limited franchise and they have no power to outvote the 30 other members. This is really a retrograde step, to rush in and withdraw this experiment before it had another chance.  I do not see the reason for doing so.  I feel that a mountain has been made out of a molehill, by raising the question of corruption in the Corporation. I believe it is unjust to certain of the small limited companies that form a large portion of the business community. At any rate I think the experiment should be continued for a few more years and for that reason I am opposed to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this Bill.  As is well known I am not of Dublin.  While I never had a vote here, I have been in the city a great deal for a long period.  I have done a good deal of work here and I kept my eyes and my ears open.  To abolish the commercial register, as is proposed by this Bill, is, in my opinion, a great mistake.  I wish to speak against the principle it introduces.  As I stated I have less actual knowledge of the city than many other Senators.  This commercial register was devised in order to secure that big firms should have some representation on the City Council. To call it a privilege is, in my opinion a misuse of that word.  It is no privilege to men who have a great <Col N="1799" /> deal of hard work to do, and who would be liable to be tired from doing it to have to undertake extra work of this kind as a matter of duty.  The good and economic government of the City of Dublin is a very important thing. Dublin is the capital of the country. It is the largest city, the greatest port, and the greatest distributing centre, so that it is of the utmost importance to every citizen that this city should be well and economically governed.  That is more important to big commercial firms than to ordinary citizens.  Men who are engaged in a big commercial way can, by reason of their experience, help very greatly on to have the city well governed by the City Council.  It affects their own welfare directly, because they have an interest in such work, though to everybody, however humble, it is important that the city should be economically governed.  The average elector does not always recognise that.  He has not got the same reasons for doing so as the class for which I speak.</P>
      <P>One of the things people who are considering the setting up of works in Dublin&mdash;and it is very important that works should be set up&mdash; will inquire about is the rates. and how the city is governed.  They dive into these matters and decide whether or not to set up business here.  If they decide to do so that tends towards the prosperity and welfare of the city.  In my opinion the commercial register tends to promote efficient city government, which is in everybody's interest, and for that reason I shall vote against this Bill.  I think the House should reject the Bill.  Before I sit down I should like to refer to a quotation which Senator O'Neill alleged was from a speech I made in the debate on the original Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Well now I have looked it up.  I thought at the time that I was accused of having made it that it was highly unlikely, because although I think there is a tendency in that direction, there are so many exceptions that I think, it is not a statement I would have made at any time. But Senator O'Neill's statement has a foundation. On the Committee Stage of that Bill <Col N="1800" /> an amendment was under discussion. The amendment proposed to reduce the qualification from £20 to £10. Speaking against that I said: &ldquo;On the whole, the higher the valuation the better the brains, because the greater the amount of success.&rdquo;  Now, subject to that qualification at the beginning of that statement, I am prepared to repeat it and I do repeat it, not for any reason such as to be consistent&mdash; because I am still able to change my mind as well as anybody else&mdash;but because I thought and still think that it was a reasonable statement to make. On the subject under discussion at the moment, I suggest it is a dangerous and undersirable thing to make these quotations from Senators' speeches apart from their context.  It was definitely the question of valuation that was then being discussed by one Senator after another in that debate, and it was on that question I was speaking.  Senator O'Neill said that I made this extraordinary statement because I had got a most extraordinary brain.  I take that as a compliment. It possibly was not meant as a compliment, but I prefer to take it as a compliment, and consider it a great compliment that I am considered to have got an extraordinary brain.  I hope that I have dealt satisfactorily with a point which seems to weigh so much on Senator O'Neill's mind.  I think, too, that what I have said has a bearing on the Bill before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Clarke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am the only woman in this House who has personal experience of the Corporation for the last three years.  It is not that those three years were the only years that I spent in the Corporation.  I opposed this commercial register when it was first introduced.  I opposed it on the ground that it was making for class distinction: that you were selecting certain people from the community and giving them privileges on a very small vote which, to my mind, they were not entitled to get.  I have worked with those who were elected on the commercial register.  I have worked with them for the last three years.  I have no fault to find with them as men, but I have not found in any one of them anything outstanding, anything that <Col N="1801" /> would say to me that these men are entitled to privilege.  All the work of the Corporation is done in committee. The brains and the advice of any other member of the Corporation were just as good as those of any one of the men elected on the commercial register. You have in the Corporation, outside those elected on the commercial register, other businessmen equally good in brains and outlook as those elected on that register.  There is no reason why you cannot get additional businessmen elected to the Corporation in the ordinary way.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested, the suggestion was made possibly honestly, and in good faith, that these particular businessmen are free from political bias.  My experience in working with them is that that is not the case.  In every vote, I would say, of any consequence taken at meetings of the Corporation, those men voted one way, and one way only.  They voted entirely with one political party.  On every question where politics were concerned, they took one side, and one only.  They showed in every way that it was humanly possible to show that they definitely belonged to one political party.  Their outlook, so far as I could see, was on the whole Imperialistic. Therefore, their advice and their counsel in everything would be tinged with their outlook at Council meetings. As men, I found them just as decent and as nice to work with as any other men, but there is nothing in any one of them, so far as anyone working with them could see, which would entitle them to be privileged.</P>
      <P>Senator Milroy more or less suggested that the old Corporation, that is the one that worked all through the Tan War&mdash;that carried on the work of the Corporation during the Tan War and through the tremendous difficulties of that war&mdash;was abolished by the Government because it was corrupt.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly there was that suggestion in the Senator's statement and, I think, it was a very mean suggestion.  Anyone who will look back <Col N="1802" /> to that particular period will remember that, as the Corporation was composed at that time, the main body of the members were against the Treaty. The people had many grievances to voice at that time.  There were executions taking place, and the only public platform that people had to register a protest against those executions and against the things that were being done by the Government of the day was at the Dublin Corporation.  And because it provided a public platform from which we could voice those grievances&mdash;I made protests there myself against the execution of lads practically without trial&mdash;and because we used it as a place for making a protest against those atrocities, the Corporation was abolished.</P>

      <P>May I correct what appears to have arisen through a misunderstanding? So far as I recollect my reference to the Dublin Corporation was this: that the Bill of 1930 followed on a period of dissatisfaction with the administration of the Dublin Corporation, which subsequently led to its abolition and the appointment of Commissioners.  I made no charge of corruption, and if it be thought that any such suggestion was implied in my speech, I want to make it perfectly clear now that I repudiate any such suggestion or reflection.</P>

      <P>I intend to vote against this Bill.  I rise simply for the purpose of saying that I cannot conceive or understand what real reason there is for bringing forward this Bill at the present time.  It has been in operation for less than three years.  Senator Mrs. Clarke, who has been working during the last three years at the meetings of the Corporation with the members elected on the commercial register, has told us that everything has gone on at the meetings of the Corporation as it should have. For that reason I cannot see why this Bill should now be brought in, or why the House should be asked to do away with this particular register.  As to the principle of the Bill, I do not wish to go into that.  There is a good deal to be said on both sides.  This commercial register seems to be an <Col N="1803" /> innovation, so far as we can learn. Senator Farren was probably quite correct when he said that in no other city in Europe is there such a thing as a commercial register.  It was thought to be useful here, and we have not yet heard from anybody any sound reason why it should not be allowed to continue for some time longer.  I intend to vote against the Bill, because I think that the system introduced in 1930 should be given, shall I say, another chance.</P>

      <P>I want to say that I am wholeheartedly in favour of this Bill. I do not know any Bill that has enthused me more than the one before the House.  Deputy Guinness asked why this Bill should be introduced to remove the privilege given in the 1930 Act?  My answer to that is to ask: why was the provision dealing with that ever put into the 1930 measure? It has been stated that there is no such privilege in the municipal electoral law of any modern State that we know of.  This commercial register has been three years in operation, and may I ask what have the super-men elected on it accomplished in the public life of Dublin?  Senator Mrs. Clarke told the House that they are simply common-place individuals.  People of their class could be found going forward at any ordinary municipal election.  Why should we lament their passing?  We had in that commercial register class legislation and, in connection with it, I want to say this, that there is no blacker spot in the records of the last Administration than the insertion of that provision in the 1930 Act.  Senator Milroy talked about divorcing municipal politics from national affairs.  Does he remember that the other day some of those councillors refused to strike the rates. Was that not interfering with national affairs?</P>

At any <Col N="1804" /> rate the position is that the courts had to be invoked to get the law enforced. An appeal was made to the present Government to cut out that kind of thing, and I want to say this, that if the last Government had taken more notice of the masses and less of the classes the present Government might not be in office to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Guinness has asked why this Bill was introduced.  I think he has been answered, to some extent, by Senator Foran.  In our opinion the commercial register is a thing that should never have been passed, and the sooner it is got rid of the better.  It represents, in our opinion, class legislation of the worst kind.  It is our belief that it is a blot on the Legislature that it ever was passed.  Senator Bagwell talked of the principle behind the commercial register.  That is a thing that we objected to very strenuously at the time.  We fought it when it was being put through in the 1930 Bill.  We announced at the time that if ever we came into power one of the earliest things we would do would be to bring in a Bill to repeal it, and we have done that.  Senator Guinness and other Senators asked why we should interfere with it now since it is on the Statute Book.  I think the answer I have given as to the principle behind it covers that question.  As to the use of the commercial register, the use that has been made of it, if it can be said to have any use, and looking at what has happened, I cannot see that there was any necessity for having such a provision put into the 1930 Act or other Act, because it did not give the municipality of Dublin any talent that it could not have got and did not get otherwise.  I know the Municipal Council of Dublin for a long time.  I know it intimately since 1906.  During my long membership of the Council there were always businessmen on it. I have not looked up the records, but I think at times you had a majority of businessmen on it.  At all events, you always had businessmen on the Council.  In my recollection, some of the biggest businessmen in the City of Dublin were members of the Municipal <Col N="1805" /> Council.  They did not ask that any special privilege should be given them to enable them to be elected to the Municipal Council.  They stood up in public like their fellow-citizens, put themselves up for election after expressing their views, whether they were political views or views on municipal affairs, such as they were. They put them before the people when they were elected or defeated as the case might be.  I am nearly 50 years of age now, and I have known the Dublin Corporation for a considerable period.  I knew it before I went on it as a member; I knew it through some members of my family who were interested in it, and I recollect that some of the biggest commercial men in Dublin&mdash;I think they might be referred to as merchant princes&mdash;were elected to it even after the extension of the franchise in 1898.  Some of the biggest ratepayers in this city stood for election and got elected at that time.  Possibly politics entered into it. Until human nature has changed very much, I do not think that in this or in any other country you can take politics out of municipal affairs. Politics will enter into all elections where people are asked to vote.</P>

If anybody wants to know to-day what my views are as an individual and as a Minister I shall tell them very frankly.  I see nothing wrong in politics in local affairs.  I shall, however, go this length with those who object to politics in local affairs.  In the old days there was certainly more reason, before we had a legislature of our own, for discussing politics at local councils. There is not the same reason now for making a platform of our local councils for political affairs as there was then. There is not the same reason for using the municipal meetings of the Dublin Corporation for discussing purely Party political issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not the same reason I admit.  We have a legislature here in our own country.  It may not be all that we would like, but we have a legislature of a kind now and that is the place to discuss big, national issues on Party political lines and not at meetings of municipal or local authorities.  I do say that to anybody on a public board who takes an interest in public affairs of all kinds and in politics, Party politics if you like to qualify it in that way, I take off my hat.  I am certainly pleased to see a man or woman, who has intelligence and education to discuss these matters properly, taking an interest in them. I am getting away from the question at issue.  My own view, and the view of the Government, is that the sooner <Col N="1807" /> this section of the Act of 1930 is taken off the Statute Book the better will be the membership of the Corporation.  I believe that whatever length of time this part of the Act of 1930 is left on the Statute Book, no matter how long it is there, the result will be the same as in the last three years.  It is, perhaps, a brief time for the experiment, but I do not believe there would be any change however lengthy the experiment might be.  You will get exactly the same type of members put up for the Corporation under this special privilege in the future as you have got in the past.  With all respect to the people concerned they are no better than the commercial men, professional men, businessmen and others who had been elected to the Municipal Council on the old franchise before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators mentioned the fact that of the five men who were elected on the commercial franchise, three had already been members of the Corporation. They had gone up before on the ordinary franchise and had been elected.  I do not know why it was that those who sought the special franchise, and approved of the special franchise, if they thought they were going to get some special type of individual selected and elected to the Council, did not put forward such types.  None appeared, and I do not believe it would be possible to get them.  I agree with Senator Douglas <Col N="1808" /> that the standard of the country will be largely judged by the administration of the local authorities, but I do not think you are going to get any superior administration amongst local authorities by a superiority franchise of this kind.  I believe that people, whatever their politics, will be elected on their merits by the electorate.  You cannot, as long as human nature is what it is and the condition of this country remains as it is, keep Party politics out of local affairs.  It might not be for the good of the country if we did not have these Party politics because the clash of politics brings out the best in both Parties.  All Parties are anxious to get individuals who can efficiently express their points of view and represent them.  I do believe that in this country a Party system is useful in public affairs and in public administration.  However that is aside from the main issue here.  I do not think there is any other point which I should answer.  I have been asked for an explanation for the introduction of the Bill.  That I have given.  I have been asked why we introduced this Bill and why we did not give a longer period for the experiment to be tried out.  I have said that so far as that experiment has been tried it has not proved a success.  It has not brought any additional talent or any special addition to the Municipal Council and from what I know of the city, I do not believe it could.</P>

      <P>The reason I put down this amendment was to raise a question on a point about which I asked the Minister on Committee Stage.  It seems to me that the description of a public service vehicle is somewhat vague.  It is defined as &ldquo;a mechanically-propelled vehicle used for the carriage of passengers for reward.&rdquo;  I take it that what is meant is a vehicle which goes out on the road and takes fares from passengers but I am not satisfied that it could not be held that a car hired by a garage to a tourist for a day or a week was not &ldquo;a mechanically-propelled vehicle used for the carriage of passengers for reward.&rdquo;  The Minister said that that was not intended.

      <P>Section 16, sub-section (4).  After the word &ldquo;Síochána,&rdquo; in line 56, to insert the words &ldquo;in uniform.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was discussed, to some extent, on the last stage of the Bill.  It deals with the question of plain-clothes Gárdaí and their right to direct drivers of mechanically-propelled vehicles to do certain things&mdash;in this case, to direct the weighing of a loaded or unladen vehicle.  My proposal is that a Gárda should not, unless he is in uniform, be empowered to direct, on suspicion, the driver of a machine to go to a weighbridge for the purpose of having the vehicle weighed. The sub-section states: &ldquo;Whenever a member of the Gárda Síochána observes a vehicle which he suspects of being then used in such manner as to constitute an offence under this section, such member may require the person in charge of such vehicle to do all or any of the following things...&rdquo; He can direct the driver to go to a weighing machine to have his vehicle weighed if he suspects that the load is greater than that allowed by law.  I suggest that the Gárda who does that <Col N="1811" /> ought to be in uniform.  I know that the Minister has an amendment&mdash; No. 50&mdash;on the Order Paper which, to some degree, meets my point by providing that the Gárda must show an authority for acting.  My feeling is that a driver of a vehicle, in this case and in another case dealt with by a later amendment, ought to know that the man who directs him is an officer of the law, and has power and authority to give directions.  I do not think it is sufficient that, if requested, the Gárda shall produce an identification card, because if the driver does not know that the person ordering him is an officer of the law, he is likely to be contemptuous and resistant and he may be guilty of another offence by refusing to obey an officer of the law in the execution of his duty.  The identification card may not be produced until after the offence has been committed. Gárda in plain clothes should not be encouraged to act in these cases.  The general tendency should be to insist that officers of the police force should be in uniform when acting in cases of this kind.  There is too great a tendency to allot duties to the Gárda in plain clothes, and it is not a desirable tendency.  I am in favour of limiting it as much as possible.</P>

      <P>I think that the Minister has very fairly met the case so fully stated by Senator Johnson on the last occasion this Bill was before the House. I think that the new section introduced by the Minister in amendment 50 (quoted) is a genuine attempt to meet the objections made by Senator Johnson.  Moreover, it is a successful attempt, and very well done.  If you compel members of the police force to refrain from doing any official act unless they are in uniform, you will completely destroy their efficiency in the prevention and detection of crime. Some of these offences under the Motor Car Act are crimes.  If Senator Johnson would give his unbiassed judgment on his own amendment and on the proposal made by the Minister, he would, I think&mdash;making allowance for the spirit of advocacy that is in him&mdash;admit that the Minister's amendment is better than his own.  I do <Col N="1812" /> suggest he ought not to press this amendment.</P>

We know that it is quite common on country roads for men to hold up their hands with the idea of getting a lift. That is particularly objectionable in the case of lady drivers who are driving alone, and I have been told, not only by Senator Mrs. Clarke, who told us here publicly, but by other ladies, that this does happen, and it is not at all desirable that those ladies should be in a position of feeling that it might have been a Guard if they did not stop.  It seems to me that a Guard holding up his hand is making a demand, and it is not clear to me that that is met by this section.  It is not good enough to say that the driver did not shout &ldquo;Show me the evidence.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On the general question as to the Guard in uniform, I have always understood that people in the position of police, or Guards, as they are now called, always wear uniform.  They may, for some reason, such as when they are going bathing, get into lighter garments, but, invariably, like soldiers they are <Col N="1813" /> always in their uniform.  I always understood that, under no circumstances, could a Guard interfere with people or go on duty, if you might put it so, in mufti.  With regard to the question of stopping vehicles, the practice has not, fortunately, developed in this country, but in England if, while you are driving along a road at night, a man tries to stop you you certainly will not pay any attention to him.  The number of robberies and assaults committed under such circumstances is enormous, but, fortunately, I believe it has not developed in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am now dealing with the earlier portion of the section which refers not merely to the laden weight but the unladen weight of a mechanically-propelled vehicle.  There is, first of all, the offence if a vehicle is being used beyond the weight prescribed and, then, it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever a member of the Gárda Síochána observes a vehicle which he suspects of being then used in such a manner as to constitute an offence...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1815" /> that is to say, if he suspects that it is over the weight prescribed for a particular type of vehicle or carrying a weight greater than is prescribed, he may require the person in charge to do certain things.  There is nothing in that sub-section to ensure that the Guard shall act within the limits allowed for a Guard in uniform.  He may be a Guard not in uniform acting in this manner and he may require, if he suspects a goods vehicle, or a waggon, carrying, as was mentioned on the last occasion, sugar beet, is being overladen&mdash;and it is not set out that it has to be a vehicle that is stationary &mdash;the driver to do certain things.  He may make the request of the driver of a vehicle on the road and, if that applies to a waggon carrying merchandise, it may also apply to a vehicle of any other kind, so long as it is mechanically-propelled.  There may be some provision somewhere in some other Act setting out that the powers given to a member of the Gárda Síochána apply only in the case of a uniformed Gárda.  I do not remember it, however, and I should like to have some evidence that that is the general rule governing the actions of the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what Senator Comyn has said about the attempt made in the new proposed section, and I realise that it is an attempt.  I rather suspect, however, that it is only an attempt to pretend that there is any change and that, in fact, the Gárda may always have an identification card in his pocket to be produced on demand, but I do not think that is enough.  What I have in mind is, if there is any reason in police practice to have un-uniformed Guards on this duty, and they require to have them because they suspect that an offender would evade them if they saw men in uniform at a distance, there is the method which would meet my case that a sign or badge of some kind, which would be noticeable at close quarters, could be made available so that the driver would not have to wait until the man got out his pocket book and searched through his records.  In the meantime, of course, anything might happen, and the man who <Col N="1816" /> pretended to be a policeman would have done all he wanted to do while the request was being complied with in respect of the production of his alleged identification card.  I want to see that the man on this duty who is not in uniform will have some kind of badge which can be easily observed, either on his cap or on his coat, by which a driver can identify him at close quarters without having to wait for the footpad, as he may be, to come aboard the car.  That is the main purpose of my amendment both on this and on the later section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, sir.  The law at present is that nobody need stop for a policeman unless he is in uniform.  We are told that there are many classes of offences which it is very difficult to detect nowadays unless police can be used who are not in uniform, especially with regard to the weights of vehicles laden and unladen. The authorities are very keen on getting power to use police without uniforms, but they are quite willing to have any kind of badge or signal worn on the coat that would satisfy those who object to a Guard not in uniform doing this duty.  For my part, I certainly have great sympathy with the point of view stressed by Senator Johnson, Senator Guinness and Senator Mrs. Clarke, especially, so far as women are concerned, whether driving by day or by night.  It is not wise that they should be put into the position of being held up by anybody and left to wonder whether it was a policeman was holding them up or not. I will see, if the Senator is satisfied, that a type of insignia would be carried by a Guard which would be readily observable.</P>

      <P>Section 16, sub-section (4).  To delete all after the words &ldquo;shall be,&rdquo; in line 8 down to the end of the sub-section and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;an offence under this section and such person upon summary conviction thereof shall be liable in respect of each such offence to a fine not exceeding five pounds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In this section the Gárda has observed the driver of the vehicle, whom he suspects of having committed an offence, the offence being that he has loaded the vehicle beyond the weight prescribed. The sub-section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Whenever a person in charge of a vehicle fails or refuses to do anything which he is required under this sub-section by a member of the Gárda Síochána to do, such failure or refusal shall be conclusive evidence that such vehicle is at the time when such requisition is made being used in such manner as to constitute an offence under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a common law offence for a member of the public to obstruct the police in the execution of their duty. But if this were to come before the court, and if the prosecution was that the vehicle was over-weighted, then the charge would be under sub-section (3). If the offence was that the person had not done what he was told, that he &ldquo;fails or refuses to do anything which he is required&rdquo; to do by the Guard, as the Bill stands such refusal would be conclusive evidence that the vehicle was over-weighted.  It seems to me that that is a wrong way of getting at the truth.  A man may have been obstructive, he may have been contumacious, and may have refused to do what he was told to do, out of sheer obstinacy, but may be easily able to prove that the vehicle was not overladen. <Col N="1818" /> But it is prescribed in the Bill, because he refused to obey the Guard, that he was guilty of carrying too much beet on his wagon.  My proposal is that the penalty shall be £5 for refusing to obey the Guard.  That seems to me to be much more reasonable, more direct, and more in accordance with commonsense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know what the Minister has to say in reference to this amendment.  There are certain classes of offences committed by motorists on public roads which are so serious that special legislation is necessary to prevent them.  For instance, when a motorist has by reckless driving knocked down a pedestrian, and when he is mean enough to make off, so as to avoid detection, I think it is perfectly fair and reasonable to assume as against him, that he is a wrong-doer.  If I have ever said anything in favour of raising a presumption of guilt it was in connection with such an offence as that. Here in this case a presumption of guilt is raised for an offence of a wholly different character.  The offence for which a presumption of guilt is raised under this section is for the failure of, say, a beet farmer who, a Guard says, has overloaded, to go to a weighbridge, failure to carry the police officer to the weighbridge, or failure to procure the weighing of the load.  If he fails to comply, and if he says to a big sergeant: &ldquo;Well, I may be on the point of being overloaded, but if you come on, my springs will break.&rdquo;  It is not fair to assume, as against a man like that, that he is guilty of the offence of having his car overloaded, because he does not take the policeman on the car as well.  I would say that that is of a wholly different character to that of a gentleman driving along a road, who knocks down an unfortunate pedestrian and is then mean enough to get away to avoid punishment.</P>

I wonder if <Col N="1819" /> the Minister would consider the amendment that Senator Johnson suggests. It is a very good amendment.  I do not think that action under this section demands that drastic remedy of raising a presumption of guilt.  We have knowledge of what will happen in a case of overloading of lorries, and I do not think that in one case out of ten thousand a man will refuse to go back with the policeman or refuse to go to the weighbridge.  I am sure he would love to have the policeman in the cart. Senator Johnson's amendment is a very good one.  Of course this is a matter of making the Bill as workable as possible.</P>

As the section stands a policeman can order a man to go back perhaps two miles.  I raised the point previously and I understood that the Minister was to see if he could introduce a suitable amendment.  A man who is going to market may prefer to go four miles in that direction rather than have to return two miles.  A man might refuse to return because he might have only a certain time to get to the market and he would then be presumed to have overladen the vehicle.</P>

      <P>This is the point I raised on the Committee Stage, when I was assured by Senator Comyn and others that the effect of inserting the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; would be to allow the employer to condone all kinds of crime.  I saw that my previous amendment went too far and it was suggested that I should bring one forward on this stage.  The reason I suggest these words is that I want to provide that when an employer has taken reasonable steps to see that an employee is licensed and that the name is correctly given, the employer will not be responsible if it turns out afterwards that the employee got the licence by fraud.  Temporary drivers are engaged every day by garages to take tourists around the country.  I want to relieve them of responsibility if it is found that the licence was obtained by fraud, or if a man failed to renew a licence.  At present the employer is responsible if he employs a man whose licence is not in order.  I think it is reasonable that he should take steps to see that the licence is in order, but he should not be held responsible afterwards.</P>

As drafted the section is simply a re-statement of the law as it exists, and of what has been in force for 30 years. It has not been abused as far as we know.  I do not think the Senator can bring forward a case of hardship.  I am inclined to think that as people know the law no reason has been given to induce us to make a change.</P>

I never knew of a case <Col N="1822" /> of an employer being prosecuted.  It is the driver who is prosecuted.  I do not question what the Minister has said about what has been the practice, owing to the law having gone into disuse.  But it may be revived.  The practice of the law is that where there is no negligence on the part of the employer, and where he has taken reasonable steps to prevent negligence, he is not prosecuted.  We are now in the peculiar position, when we come to deal with a matter of this kind, that the existing law must be put into this Bill, but when we come to the question of police holding up people we go back on the law.  Some things are re-enacted and other things are not.  I am not criticising the Minister's attitude, but there is great difficulty in dealing with these points.</P>

      <P>When I moved a similar amendment on the last stage the Minister was to look into the matter to see how far it affected the first application and not renewals, and I was hopeful that he would have found a form of words which would meet what I desire.  Looking at the matter I could not, with my limited ability in the matter of drafting, fit in an amendment which would apply only to the original application without re-drafting the section.</P>
      <P>I still think it is desirable that the authority that is going to give the licence should have some direct knowledge of the fact that the applicant is a human being and does exist.  The illustration that I gave in regard to the application for a vehicle licence was quite apt&mdash;that it is a wholesale job and purely mechanical.  I think that should not be repeated in respect of driving licences.  The applicant, I think, should exhibit himself in some way to the authority that is going to give the licence, and not simply send up a written message.</P>

      <P>I hope this amendment will not be agreed to.  I think it is not really consistent with the principle in the Bill, which is that a person is entitled to a licence unless he is subject to certain disabilities.  The test of that disability, in the first instance, is a signed declaration by himself which can be questioned by the police authorities and put in order by the District Court.  The only possible object in producing an individual to a clerk in one of the local taxation offices is that the clerk would be in a position to see whether this person, simply from looking at him, had any disability or not.  The point that Senator Johnson made about a human being was not, I think, seriously meant.  The amendment, in my opinion, would be no improvement on the procedure laid down in the Bill, and I therefore think it should not be agreed to.</P>

      <P>We think that this amendment is impracticable.  Since we discussed this in Committee we have made inquiries from the local taxation officers and licensing authorities in different parts of the country.  We got replies from a number of county councils.  They are almost unanimously hostile to the suggestion contained in the amendment.  The general view is that it would not serve a useful purpose, and would not be helpful.  All the replies that we got, without exception, I think, stressed the inconvenience that this would cause to motorists in many cases.  It would mean that they would be obliged to travel anything up to a hundred miles to get a licence.  Roughly 70,000 licences will eventually be issued.  Under the amendment all these people would have to be examined.  That would mean increasing the staffs, and very great additional work on them.  It would also mean very considerable inconvenience to the individuals applying for the new licences.  We are of opinion that any advantage that might be gained by it would not be worth the additional cost and trouble it would cause.</P>

In that case there cannot be very much objection to the motion.  The Chair has allowed a reasonable amount of latitude, but I am sure none of us want three speeches on every amendment.

      <P>Section 30, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;drive&rdquo; in line 61 to insert the words &ldquo;or is in charge of.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was discussed on the Committee Stage at some length, but my attention has since been drawn to a <Col N="1825" /> point which I was not aware of at the time.  The section says: &ldquo;Every person who drives or attempts to drive a mechanically-propelled vehicle in a public place while he is drunk shall be guilty of an offence under this section,&rdquo; etc.  I am seeking to add the words &ldquo;or is in charge of &rdquo; a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place while he is drunk.  My reason for doing so is that the law has made that an offence hitherto.  It was an offence for a man while drunk to be in charge of a vehicle in a public place.  By changing the law and restricting the offence simply to driving or attempting to drive is, shall I say, a weakening of the law and favours somewhat the man who is prepared to have charge of a vehicle while drunk so long as he cannot be accused of driving or attempting to drive.</P>
    <P>My attention has been drawn to this point: that one of the rules laid down by successive generations of judges for guidance in statutory interpretation is that judges are entitled, in construing statutes, to look at antecedent legislation although repealed, and if they find words in the repealed statutes which are omitted in the subsequent and superseding legislation then they must hold that the omission of such words was intended to omit all cases which came clearly within the purview and intendment of such omitted words.  In view of that the omission of the words &ldquo;in charge of&rdquo; would be construed to mean that the being in charge of while under the influence of drink was no longer an offence.  In that way it seems to be a modification of the law in favour of the drunken motorist.  That is what I want to avoid, and that is the reason I am moving the amendment. I cannot add anything to what I said on the previous stage of the Bill, except what I have just quoted, which is from an authority on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason to change the view I expressed on the Committee Stage.  I think that in the legislation as proposed we will be able to meet fully all the cases which need to be met.  After all, if a man is in charge of a mechanically-propelled vehicle but does not attempt in any <Col N="1826" /> way to use the vehicle except perhaps to sit in it, I cannot see any necessity for bringing any charge against him, except whatever charge he renders himself liable to by being intoxicated. Suppose a man has taken sufficient drink or drugs to be incapable of driving a car and though being the owner and in charge of the car he is not actually in it, but is standing some yards away from it, if we put in the words in the amendment &ldquo;in charge of,&rdquo; I am afraid they would render him liable to a prosecution, though he was not near the car at all.  He would be charged with being a danger to the public though he was not actually in the car, and perhaps did not propose to use it.  I am afraid that might happen under the amendment.  In my opinion, at any rate, he ought not to be liable, so long as he does not attempt to use the car.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I think the Minister's interpretation of the words &ldquo;in charge of&rdquo; is very far fetched&mdash;that a man a considerable distance away from his car could still be said to be in charge of it. The phrase &ldquo;in charge of a horse and car&rdquo; in the old days always meant, I think, that the owner was actually in the car.  If the man were at the other side of the street he would not be said, I think, to be in charge of his horse and car.  I think the same thing would apply here.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think time has not helped us, and I agree with the Minister in the matter.  We are making drunkenness a very definite offence and strengthening the law in regard to it.  Where a man has gone out for a day with a car and has been foolish enough to get drunk, if he has sense enough not to try and drive the car while in that condition I am not prepared to apply to him the stigma of being in charge of the car when drunk. A man of that kind, provided he does not attempt to drive the car, is still liable to be charged with the offence of drunkenness.  I think the amendment would have the opposite effect to what Senator Johnson desires because if you make a man liable for being drunk &ldquo;in charge of&rdquo; a car&mdash;the <Col N="1827" /> same as if he drove it&mdash;then he may take the chance, if not very drunk, of driving it and of being a real danger to the public.  I believe that the inclusion of the words in the amendment would defeat the purpose which Senator Johnson has in mind and be a greater temptation to a man to drive.</P>

      <P>I have no shame in referring to the fact that the law has been as I am desiring it to be continued, and that after a long period these words were re-inserted in the British Act of 1930.  I pointed out the difficulty of preventing the running down of a citizen, who is walking the roads, by a drunken motorist.  I am not troubled about the man seated in the car, no matter how drunk he may be, if he is not going to run anybody down, but to give a man possession of an instrument of danger, such as a motor car is, when it may be driven at 60 or 70 miles in a public place&mdash;that has to be considered, having regard to the public safety.  What is going to be the position of the Gárdaí?  A man is too drunk to have charge of a car, but he is not too drunk to recognise that there is a Gárda watching him.  He knows that it is an offence to drive or to attempt to drive.  The Gárda sees the drunken man getting into the car, but the Gárda may have to wait until that man gets sober, lest he may attempt to drive.  The Gárda does not wait, and the man drives off.  How is the Gárda to prove the offence?</P>

      <P>It is not an offence to be drunk in the car and it will not be an offence to be in a position to drive a car while drunk under the Bill as it stands.  The Guard will have to wait until the man pulls the lever or attempts to drive the car.  I feel that this matter is really a present to the drunken motorist.  It is giving him a better chance than he has ever had in the past and it is going to put the onus on the Gárda to be not merely a guardian of the law but to have under observation a drunken man until he gets sober, so long as he is ostensibly <Col N="1828" /> in charge of the car.  I think the Minister is mistaken in refusing to accept the amendment and in refusing to incorporate these words in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The law as it stands at the moment was framed at a time when there were not many motor cars.  It was framed to deal with the horse-drawn vehicle.  It is quite a different thing to be in charge of a horse-drawn vehicle to being in charge of a motor car.  If a drunken man in charge of a horse and cart throws his reins over the horse's head and lies down to sleep, you cannot guarantee that the horse will not go off on its own.  In the motor car, unless the man does some act, the car will not move.  He has to pull a lever.  If it has ordinary brakes it is not in ordinary circumstances likely to move off of itself.  I feel that we have dealt with the situation adequately. If a man were charged with driving or attempting to drive a car while under the influence of drink, again there is a difficulty about defining whether a man is sufficiently drunk, He might be drunk for the purposes of driving a car.  He might have taken <Col N="1829" /> too much drink to drive a car with safety and the Guard would have to take that into account.  The man might be able to walk home, yet he might not be able to drive, or be able to attempt to drive a car properly.  We cannot define drunkenness there.</P>

      <P>This relates to the question of disqualification orders. The provisions of Section 18 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1928, were not fully set out in Senator Johnson's amendment.  On consideration of that section it has been decided to deal specifically with the question of appeals from disqualification orders. Up to the present it was intended to deal with these appeals partly by implication from the ordinary law. The question has been dealt with in Amendments Nos. 12, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, and 28 and the proposals embodied in these amendments may be summarised as follows:&mdash; (1) the Bill gives an express power to confirm, annul, or vary a consequential disqualification order or an ancillary disqualification order on appeal. (2) There is to be no power to <Col N="1831" /> discharge a consequential disqualification order or an ancillary disqualification order.  This right of discharge given by Section 34 is to be confined to the special disqualification order, that is to say, the disqualification for mental or physical defect.  (3) Express provision is made in the Bill that any disqualification order is to take effect as soon as made and is not to be suspended or postponed by reason of a pending appeal.  I suggest that these amendments will render Senator Johnson's amendments Nos. 16, and 25 and Senator Douglas's amendment No. 29 unnecessary.</P>

    <P>This is an amendment with which I really intended to deal on the last occasion but we went through rather rapidly at that stage and I was not able to call attention to it.  In respect to the special disqualification orders, it was laid down here that an appeal shall lie from the District Court to the Circuit Court.  I put down the amendment to delete the sub-section, not knowing what the Minister's amendments were going to be.  I should like to point out that still, as far as I can see, in respect to the special disqualification order, the second application for a discharge will be made to a District Justice.  That <Col N="1833" /> may take place almost immediately after the Circuit Judge has confirmed the original order.  That seems to me to be an unwise provision, that what the Judge of the Circuit Court may have decided to confirm, may at once, in effect, be repealed by a district justice.  I am not sure that the sub-section is now necessary in view of the late amendments the Minister has indicated his intention of moving.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment raises a point which I do not now see very clearly owing to all the alterations that have been made.  As the Bill stood originally, and as, I think, it still is, whenever a court makes a consequential disqualification order or an ancillary disqualification order or a special disqualification order or an order discharging an ancillary disqualification order or a special disqualification order, the court shall cause notice of such order to be sent to the Minister, <Col N="1835" /> who shall notify all licensing authorities.  I should like to know why the duty to notify the Minister and the licensing authorities should not apply equally in respect of an order discharging a consequential disqualification order.  I am not able to say whether the new amendments have seriously affected the application of this amendment, but it was possible under the Bill as it stood for an order to be made by a district justice discharging a consequential disqualification order, while it was not essential to cause particulars of that new order removing the disqualification to be sent to the Minister. That was, however, made an obligation in respect of the less serious offences of ancillary and special disqualifications.</P>

      <P>The speech of Senator Johnson has rather bewildered me. On appeal, a judge, though he may confirm the sentence of fine, has power to take away the endorsement on the licence, which would be a consequential or ancillary order.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a Government amendment. I mention that fact because it appears conspicuously on the Order Paper and, on one occasion, Senator Douglas said he knew Senator Seamus Robinson was just a Government gramophone. <Col N="1837" /> On occasions when there is a division. Senator Seamus Robinson and I make a perfect record, but I am not the gramophone of the Government or the bus owners or even the public.  I propose to appeal to that rather elusive quality&mdash;the commonsense of Senators.  Senator Dowdall was responsible, in the first instance, for having the maximum speed for passenger-carrying buses reduced from 35 miles to 30 miles.  Starting off, he harassed Senators by referring to two motor accidents in which he had been. He said he was happy that they were lucky enough on both occasions to be going slowly.  He evidently realised that the accident was the result of their driving; he appears to have taken full responsiblity for the accident.  The amendment has to do with buses but the Senator referred to two &ldquo;motor accidents&rdquo;.  I think it would have been only fair if these were motor car accidents, and not motor bus accidents, that the Senator should have said so, because what we were discussing were motor buses.  The Senator goes on to refer, in his speech, to the danger of vibration.  I do not know what the danger of vibration to which the Senator referred is&mdash;whether it is a danger to the people inside the bus or the people outside the bus or whether it is a danger to the roads. I cannot see how there can be any danger to the people either inside or outside a bus by vibration.  The Senator's parting shot at the Minister was: &ldquo;What he said about speeding-up is not viewed with any satisfaction by the people who have to foot the bill in cases of accidents&rdquo;.  If people are not insured, they naturally resent very much having to foot the Bill in cases of accidents.  But if the Senator was referring to the action of insurance companies, I am sure we would all like to be directors or shareholders in an insurance company which would collect premiums and be absolved by the Legislature from responsibility for accidents.  I should have thought that the risk was the very element of insurance, that the risk was the raw material out of which dividends might subsequently be manufactured.  I do not think that that altogether <Col N="1838" /> represents the attitude of the insurance companies.  I know a case where a young woman, driving down town and looking around, charged headlong into another motor car, with the result that it was hurled across the street and struck an innocuous motor car on the other pavement with such violence that it sprang forward and entagled itself in a fourth motor car.  She was had up but she was young and presentable; the Superintenrent of the Garda was young and, perhaps, impressionable and the representative of the insurance company was young and ecstatic.  I shall not say anything of the judge, but that lady was fined an incredibly small sum and the representative of the insurance company stood up in court and said he regarded her as an excellent risk. Without risk, there would not be many insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The debate on this question on the last stage was conducted on what I should regard as rather irrelevant lines.  Senator Counihan said he was standing in a field about 50 yards from the road when a four-ton lorry passed travelling at about 30 miles an hour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Robinson Mr. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>They sit close together, at all events.  This section refers to vehicles which have inflated, pneumatic tyres and a four-ton lorry does not, as a rule, have baloon tyres. If we are to discuss buses, Senators should refer to the faults of buses and not to the faults of motor cars or four-ton lorries.  Senator O'Connor referred to the speed at which motorists travel.  Everybody knows that they travel at great speeds.  They are permitted to go up to 70 or 80 miles an hour.  But this section refers to buses.  Senator O'Connor said: &ldquo;I think that the whole danger in motoring and the increased number of accidents have to be attributed to the speed at which many drivers travel&rdquo;. I recently saw some statistics which I am sorry I have not here.  I think they were in connection with England. Three things were mainly responsible, according to those statistics, for the vast majority of accidents and none of <Col N="1839" /> them was speed.  The majority of accidents take place between 1 and 2 o'clock.  After a meal, people relax and get careless.  If you relax, you do not speed up because that requires concentration.  The second cause was being blinded by headlights.  The minute you get blinded by headlights you reduce speed.  The third cause was people stepping off the pavement. None of these had any reference to speed, though they might be aggravated by speed.  Yet, they cover the vast majority of accidents.  Senator O'Connor said: &ldquo;I think that the whole danger in motoring and the increased number of accidents have to be attributed to the speed at which many drivers travel.&rdquo;  He goes on to account for accidents such as Senator Dowdall had, or very nearly had, but he does not say that they had any connection with buses at all.  In fact, he created the impression that they were motor cars.  He says that there is a tendency, even with buses, to travel at an enormous speed and he goes on to say that he had been in buses that travelled at 40 miles an hour&mdash;an enormous speed when there is no limit to motor cars.  They very often go up to 70 miles an hour, to my certain knowledge.  I frequently do myself.  Senator O'Connor also said that the tendency with bus drivers is to prevent any other vehicle passing them out, but, if you fix the maximum rate at 30 miles an hour, it will make no difference whatever.  Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger spoke of a twisty road at Dalkey and referred to the danger that would be caused by people driving at 35 miles an hour on that road.  That road cannot be so twisty as to make it impossible for any bus to travel at 35 miles an hour on some parts of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in a great many buses between Bray and Donnybrook church, which is not a very twisty road, and I have watched their speedometers on purpose, and I have found that no smallish bus will ever travel under 30 miles an hour, if the road permits it at all, and they do not very often exceed about 37 miles per hour.  No big bus ever travels under about 32 <Col N="1840" /> miles per hour and they very seldom exceed 50 miles per hour, but, within those limits, they go all the time. There is no bus which, if it gets any chance at all, will not go up to 35 miles an hour.  Senator Colonel Moore also spoke about motor cars and how he drove and how other people drove and he also made a reference to buses.  He said that he had seen two buses and a car trying to pass one another on the road at the same time, but he has only to go to any wide road in England and he will see three, four or five cars all going the same way passing each other.</P>

      <P>Senator Toal said that to fix a high speed would give great encouragement to young people to indulge in practices of this sort.  I do not know what he means by &ldquo;practices of this sort.&rdquo;  It is young men who drive buses, of course, and nobody <Col N="1841" /> wants old men to drive buses.  Apropos of that, it might be as well to read a letter from one of the biggest bus companies as to how they train these young men to drive the buses.  The letter says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our drivers are the most efficient in the whole country, not excepting the best drivers of private motor cars, most of them being experienced motor mechanics, and all of them selected after a long test and graded for the routes, the best men being placed on the more difficult routes. They are, as a rule, six months in the company's service before they are allowed on important and congested routes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator Toal might have been speaking about motor cars, like almost every other Senator who spoke, but, if he was referring to buses, that is what the drivers have to go through before they get permission to drive for one of the biggest bus companies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Robinson Mr. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Senators may have been slightly at sea as to what the discussion was actually about, because Senator Comyn, who is usually most meticulously careful said: &ldquo;I understand this speed limit applies only to heavy vehicles such as lorries,&rdquo; and the Minister replied: &ldquo;To buses only.&rdquo;  I cannot help having a sort of general feeling that, because it was Friday, and we are not used to sitting on Fridays, the Senators may have been misled.  This applies only to buses, and buses are the motor cars of the poor man.  I know that, amongst motorists, there is the sort of feeling: &ldquo;Hang the buses on the road; I cannot get past.&rdquo;  That is the attitude and, if there is anything we can do for them, let us do it, for goodness sake.  They will, then, be able to travel at 35 miles per hour, and they will not hold us up on the roads.  These buses run into the country where there are no railway facilities for the people who wish to come into the towns and cities to do shopping, and it is only fair that they should be able to get in and get out in a reasonable time.  The speed, I suggest, is not intended as the speed at which they should always travel.  As <Col N="1842" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce said in the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is not stated in the Bill that an omnibus driver may drive his omnibus at 35 miles an hour in all circumstances.  What is stated is that, under the most favourable circumstances possible, on the widest road, and on the finest day, with the least amount of traffic, that is the highest speed at which he can drive his omnibus.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, everybody knows that motor buses at present travel up to 50 miles per hour quite frequently, such as the express buses for Wexford, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Belfast, and I have not the smallest doubt that they will wish to do so in future.  I think it is part of good legislation to endeavour, so far as possible, to legalise illegalities that the public normally and persistently indulge in, if at all possible, and, although 35 miles an hour does not begin to touch 50 miles per hour, it is a step in the right direction.  I am quite certain that if it is reduced to 30 miles an hour there will be no change in the speed at which these buses go.  I dare say that there will be many occasions on which they will go faster than 35 miles per hour and will run the risk of being caught, but, up to now, the pace at which they travel has been left to their discretion, provided they keep within their schedules, and I think that hardship has been done to the drivers, because, if they are delayed, it is almost impossible for them to keep within their schedules without going at a very excessive speed.  I think that if the Seanad will grant the speed at 35 miles per hour, there will be reasonable excuse for the police authorities seeing that they stick to that speed and do not go beyond it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to second the amendment, and I should like to congratulate the Senator, whom we do not hear very often, on an excellent and witty speech.  I am sure that the Minister, in view of his speech earlier in the day, will be particularly interested in having a good illustration of politics without party.  The <Col N="1843" /> Senator certainly demolished all the members of his own Party who spoke, and a few of the rest of us, very effectively.  I was unavoidably absent when this matter came up before, and I propose to give my reasons for believing that it was a mistake to change the limit from 35 to 30 miles per hour.  I do not quite agree with Senator Robinson when he says that there will be no change when the Bill becomes law, because I think he has overlooked the fact that the Bill does provide, perhaps, the only really effective method of creating a change in that it makes the people who fix the time tables, in the case of buses, responsible.  When you have time tables in accordance with a reasonable schedule, you will find that bus drivers will, in the main, but not always, of course, keep within a reasonable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who drive cars know quite well that 45 miles per hour is a very common speed for buses and I think I am correct in stating that very few people who are not driving cars have any idea of speed.  I know that, although I have driven a car for a great many years, I have no idea of the speed at which a car is travelling unless I am driving and have the speedometer in front of me.  I have often been surprised, when trying to pass a bus on a country road, to find, on looking at the speedometer, that I am travelling at 40 miles per hour and that the bus is going faster.  That is the only way in which you can tell the speed at which a bus is going.  You really can get no idea if you are standing in a field or on the road.  Twenty miles per hour in one position will seem exceedingly fast if you are close to the bus and it nearly hits you. You will think that it is going at an excessive speed but, if you are a considerable distance away, the speed will not seem so fast.  We know that buses travel at very considerable speeds, but if you fix 35 miles per hour that will be the maximum speed at which they can travel.  I think I am correct in saying that, if you leave it at 35 miles per hour, it will not be possible to make a time table which will show an average of more than 27 <Col N="1844" /> or 28 miles per hour because, if the maximum is 35, you cannot get an average of more than 27 or 28 miles an hour.  I know that if you travel a long distance and get 35 miles per hour average speed out of an ordinary car, you have to travel at 50 miles per hour quite frequently.  Anyone driving a car will bear me out in that, so that if you fix the speed at 30 miles per hour you are going to bring down the time table to an average of 24 or 25 miles per hour, and the public will not be satisfied and the regulation will not be properly carried out.</P>
    <P>I think that, in fixing the limit of 35 miles per hour, you are going really as far as you can to get the public satisfied and to get the regulation carried out.  Thirty-five miles per hour as a maximum speed is not really dangerous for modern buses.  It may be, and it, frequently, is, dangerous, but the real point about the Bill is that you have got proper methods of dealing with dangerous driving which we had not under other legislation.  The greater maximum speed limit is safe when you have, as we hope, effective methods of dealing with dangerous driving.  When you have no such effective methods, you have to have a somewhat lower speed limit.  I really believe that the provision in the Bill of 35 miles per hour was a wise one, and to reduce it will really not be effective and will serve very little purpose.  We know that a great deal of the motor law simply is not carried out, and, so far as possible, we want to make this an Act which can be carried out and I think it would be far better if the House re-inserted the 35 miles per hour speed limit.  I was not here when the discussion took place before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robinson did not quote the very short speech I made on the last occasion, and I intend, for his information, and that of the House, to repeat the essence of it.  It was that the Departmental Committee, whose report formed the basis of this Bill and which consisted of those who know all about motor traffic and the regulation of it&mdash;the police, the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the Department of Local Government, <Col N="1845" /> which deals with roads and transport&mdash; made a recommendation, five years ago, that buses should not go more than 25 miles per hour.  The Minister said that that was five years ago and that there had been considerable advances in motoring since that time.  I agree, but has there been so great an advance as to warrant a jump from 25 to 35 miles per hour?  I have formed the impression from motorists' talk, from discussions here and from discussions in the other House, that motorists imagine that human nature, human characteristics and qualities can change as rapidly as the speed of motor cars and the advance in mechanical ingenuity. The purpose of this Bill is, somewhat, to save the roads but, mainly, I hope, to save human life and limb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adaptability of the <i>genus homo</i>, of human nature, does not change as rapidly as this legislation would suggest, and our trouble in all this discussion of motor transport is, I think, the impression that the individual pedestrian, the man, woman and child, must make way for the motorist and must adapt himself and his practices, habits and mentality to the motorist's needs.  We have to bear in mind that there are two dangers in this.  There is the danger to the passengers in a heavy vehicle in that one smash might easily mean the loss of 20 or 30 lives.  I think it is still arguable that something is much more likely to happen to a loaded vehicle going at a fast pace than to a loaded vehicle going at a moderate speed.  Some Senator spoke of the open roads in the country with nothing to obstruct them, but there are side roads.  There are farmers' houses, cottiers' houses, cottiers' children and farmers' children, and I have seen many times the shock women and children received when a vehicle like a motor bus came along at a fast pace. These are very much more dangerous instruments than the smaller vehicles, because they are so much heavier, and at the critical moment it may happen that they are less under control.  The fact that the Departmental Committee, after long consideration, advised 25 miles as the limit, the fact that British legislation in this matter <Col N="1846" /> has limited them to 30 miles an hour, and the fact that human nature cannot adapt itself as quickly as the mechanical inventiveness of man to enable motor cars to propel themselves, makes me feel that there ought to be a direct limitation and that 30 miles an hour is the maximum that should be allowed for a heavy vehicle carrying passengers.  I hope the Seanad will stand by its decision on the last occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I still believe that speed enters very largely into the element of danger and as a cause of accidents.  Notwithstanding what Senator Robinson has said I believe the policy of insurance companies has affected heavy vehicles.  I doubt if some of them are at the present time insured at all.  One type has been rejected twice by two insurance companies with whom they did business. Neither the poor man's motor car nor the rich man's motor car is entitled to drive along the roads to the danger of the public.  We are told that buses travel at 40 or 50 miles an hour and that it is therefore expedient to legalise that speed.  Then why not legalise illegal drinking?  Since the Commissioner reported a good deal of time has passed.  Does not every Senator know what the toll of death on the roads has been within that period? There has been a certain slackening perhaps in accident cases by reason of the very heavy rates of insurance that have to be paid.  I appeal to the Seanad to stand by its decision and to confine buses to 30 miles an hour.  It is not enough to say that that will not be observed.  In some districts possibly it may be exceeded, but at least the time tables will be based on 30 miles an hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Senator Robinson has made such a case as would induce the House to reverse the decision come to on the last occasion. These buses are of two kinds, the smaller ones being for short journeys. Senator Robinson, I understand, does not desire that buses going out to the suburbs of the city should go at a higher rate than 30 miles an hour. <Col N="1847" /> Obviously what he was referring to was what he called trunk buses going to places like Wexford and Limerick.  The question for consideration is this: if the maximum speed is increased to 30 miles an hour, will the drivers of these buses be more careful when entering towns like Thurles or Nenagh?  I do not think they will.  Will they be more careful when passing a school-house, or when passing a labourer's house on the side of the road?  I do not think they will.  The Seanad has come to the conclusion that 30 miles an hour is fast enough for trunk buses, seeing that they are likely to meet little children on the roads, people driving horses and carts, cars come from side roads, or various classes of traffic.</P>
      <P>There is another consideration.  I expect when this Bill is passed, and when the Railways Bill is passed, that there is some probability that buses on long journeys will be discontinued, if the railway company can be induced to diminish their rates.  I think it would be to the public advantage if trunk buses, running to Limerick, to Tralee or to Cork, side by side with the railways, would stop altogether and let the long distance traffic be carried on the railways. In any case, the dangers to the public of these juggernauts going along country roads at a permitted speed of 30 miles an hour, which they will exceed, are too great, and the advantage of giving them an extra five miles an hour is too little.  The increase from 30 to 35 miles does not represent a shortening of the time, the reason being that even if they are permitted to do 35 miles an hour, they are bound to slow up coming into the cities or towns.  Senator Robinson spoke about vibration, and said that he did not understand what was meant by the argument that excessive speed caused excessive vibration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not mean the vibration caused by loads of cattle or sheep crossing the Curragh, 15 yards from the main road.  The vibration is the vibration to the countryman's house at the side of the road, or to the <Col N="1848" /> house in the suburbs of a town, through which these great vehicles pass.  I think the Seanad was very wise not to reduce the speed for these trunk buses. The Senator admitted that this would not apply to small buses that ply in and around the city.  It can only apply in the case of long journeys, and 30 miles an hour is fast enough.  The Seanad ought not to reverse its previous decision.</P>

      <P>I think there was a great deal more humour than commonsense shown in support of this amendment. I have a great deal of experience in this matter, and I consider that it would be a danger to grant any increase in the speed of buses.  It is a step in the right direction to limit the speed of these vehicles.  I travel a great deal on buses and on motor cars. While I do not want to refer to any particular route, I have witnessed accidents which could be attributed to the speed at which these vehicles were travelling, and to cutting out at crossroads instead of slowing up.  I think the sensible thing is to limit the speed to 30 miles an hour.  That will restrain those who drive at a fast pace.  I often see those motor buses passing privately-owned motor cars at more than 30 miles an hour.  It seems to be a kind of advertisement on the part of some people who have lorries for hire to drive fast, in order to encourage people to deal with them.  I have no desire to impede the use of motor cars, but I consider that the Seanad should leave the matter as it is by adhering to the previous decision.</P>

      <P>I do not object to an amendment being moved on the Report Stage to repeal what was done on the Committee Stage if any argument was put up for doing so.  The mover and seconder of the amendment have not put forward any argument why we should repeal what was done in Committee.  This matter was fully discussed on the Committee Stage, and practically the unanimous opinion of the Seanad was in favour of 30 miles an hour.  When he was replying, the Minister stated that he thought the whole House was against, thus showing that the opinion on that <Col N="1849" /> occasion was in favour of the 30-miles limit for buses.  This whole matter was very fully discussed on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  On that occasion I stated that the scheduled time for trains, with the exception of a few express trains, was 30 miles an hour.  If trains are only able to travel at 30 miles an hour on a protected track it is quite unsafe, I suggest, to have buses travelling on the public roads at 35 miles an hour.  There is another point to be considered: that we want to get the travelling public between any two points off the road and on to the trains.  If the scheduled time for a journey by train between any two points is three hours, and for a bus between the same two points is two and a half hours, then naturally people will travel by bus and leave the railways there.  That is a consideration which I think Senators should take into account when voting on this amendment.</P>

      <P>The most fruitful source of accidents.  The Senators may not have used the word &ldquo;fruitful.&rdquo; But why legislate on that basis?  Why not legislate for private motor cars? Senator Johnson referred particularly to buses, and said they were more dangerous than private cars, first because they are heavier, and secondly because they are not so easily controlled. My opinion is that buses are <Col N="1850" /> less dangerous.  One reason is that a fewer number of them are on the road.  They are much more easily seen than private cars, they are more easily heard and they are usually far and away better controlled, because they are subject to test more often than a private car, especially in respect to braking.  Another reason is that the drivers of these heavy buses are far and away better than the drivers of most private cars.  It seems perfectly ridiculous to suggest that one of these juggernauts, as Senator Comyn referred to them, should be obliged to crawl along some of the trunk roads at a speed of 30 miles an hour.  Fancy one of these super-Leylands travelling at such a speed.  I think that in our legislation we should be reasonable.  35 miles an hour is reasonable.  With regard to the smaller buses the position is quite different.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when dealing with this matter, said that he wanted to have the smaller and more rickety type of bus eliminated from the road altogether.  Under this legislation we hope to have the better type of big bus on the road in future.  With improved roads, and the limitations to which Senator Douglas referred, I do not think 35 miles an hour is at all unreasonable.</P>

If the object is to destroy the bus services provided for the people, then I agree that one way of doing that is to limit their speed to 30 miles an hour.  These buses are rendering a very good service to the <Col N="1851" /> public.  I do not think we should, by our legislation, drive the long distance buses off the road.  The law provides that if any man drives a bus or car of any kind at a dangerous speed on the public road that he is liable to be prosecuted, especially if he does it where there is any heavy traffic.  I <Col N="1852" /> think it would be ridiculous to limit these big buses, which are capably driven, to a speed of 30 miles an hour.</P>

    <P>It is provided under this section that where an insurance policy is terminated by any means other than the effluxion of time, the insured shall, within seven days after such termination, deliver to the vehicle insurer the latest certificate of insurance given by such vehicle insurer in respect of such policy.  I do not quite exactly know what other <Col N="1853" /> means there would be of terminating a policy but it seems to me that where a policy had ceased to have effect from any other cause than the effluxion of time the insurance company ought to notify the insured, and that he should have to surrender his certificate within the seven days.  If there are other reasons than the effluxion of time why the policy is being terminated the insured person ought to know, and it is highly desirable that the insurance company should notify him.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 48:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 164, sub-section (1).  To delete in lines 35-36 the words &ldquo;or gets on or into or attempts to get on or into such vehicle while it is so stationary&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section makes it an offence for any person without lawful authority to get on or into a motor vehicle, or to interfere with the mechanism of such vehicle while it is stationary in a public place.  It also makes it an offence for a person to get on or into, or to attempt to get on or into, such vehicle while it is stationary.  For the offence of attempting to get on or into a vehicle while it is stationary a person is liable on conviction to a fine of £20. That is making an offence of what need not be an offence.  There is no necessary connection with the attempt to interfere with the mechanism.  I think it is rather a wrong thing to insert these words, making it an offence carrying a penalty of £20, to get on or to attempt to get on a vehicle without lawful authority.  As I illustrated in a <Col N="1857" /> previous case, getting on a stationary motor vehicle, a lorry in a public place, say, a fair green, without lawful authority, surely is not an offence that should be punishable by a fine of £20. I think it is an excessive penalty for an offence which may be no offence at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think amendment No. 49, when the Senator looks at it, will meet very largely the point he makes against the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It deals with interfering with the mechanism without authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been put to us and pressed on us, I must say, by the police.  They are very keen that the section should be left as it is, because there is a considerable amount of interference with motor cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one thing to interfere with the mechanism.  That is an offence that is punishable and rightly punishable, but it should not be equally an offence for a person to get on a motor car, say, to look at a procession.  If I, without any semblance of lawful authority and without believing I had lawful authority, got up on a motor lorry to look at at procession or if children get up on a lorry in a market place while waiting for a public meeting to be held, that is an offence.  That is reducing the matter to absurdity, no doubt, but any person who gets up on a lorry in a public place without authority is going to be made equally liable with a man who gets into a vehicle and attempts to interfere with the mechanism.  I feel that that is too stringent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to be consistent, and Senator Johnson has reversed his whole attitude on this <Col N="1858" /> amendment.  He does not realise that a man who gets into a car may be about to injure the mechanism.  Cars are left in parking places and the position will be very difficult if a man can get into a car and drive away joyriding. The maximum fine in this case is £20.  For getting into a lorry to look at a procession, the likelihood of a prosecution would be very small and the fine, if there were a prosecution, would be very small.  The other amendment would deal with any case where the person had reasonable grounds for believing that he had lawful authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>The offender must get into the car without the consent of the owner and he must also interfere with the machinery before he is liable.  Is not that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I expected that somebody who is more familiar with the working of the courts than I am would tell me that this sub-section must connect up with &ldquo;interference.&rdquo;  I expected that there would be some redrafting of that sub-section, because it seems to me to be exceedingly strict and to make an act which may be no offence at all&mdash;attempting to get into a car or lorry&mdash;subject to a heavy fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnson wants to avoid the possibility of a prosecution in the case of a person who gets into a lorry to see a procession and, in order to avoid that, he will destroy the effect of this entire section.  The object of the section is to enable a policeman to apprehend a person who is attempting to steal a car.  If Senator Johnson's amendment be accepted, the policeman can do nothing unless the man is inside the car.  If he has opened the door and is ready to steal the car, the policeman can do nothing. There is, of course, something in what Senator Johnson says, that a man who goes into a lorry without the consent of the owner or without lawful authority to see a procession is liable to a fine, but what the Senator is trying <Col N="1859" /> to guard against is hardly worth guarding.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>174.  Whenever in exercise of any power or the performance of any duty under this Act any member of the Gárda Síochána makes in a public place any request, requisition, or demand of any person, such person shall not be bound to comply <Col N="1860" /> with such request, requisition, or demand unless such member either&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is introduced as a result of discussion on the Second Stage of the Bill.  There is no express provision in the Bill requiring the driver of a mechanically-propelled vehicle to stop on signal by a Gárda, whether in uniform or not. Any provisions that may be necessary will be introduced by regulations, which regulations will be laid before both Houses.  In making these regulations, I should like to assure the Seanad that we shall bear in mind the discussion that took place on Committee Stage and again to-day with regard to the danger of allowing Gárda not in uniform to stop cars.</P>

      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill, as amended, be received for final consideration&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Fifth Stage fixed for Wednesday, 21st June.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.10 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 21st June, 1933.</P>
