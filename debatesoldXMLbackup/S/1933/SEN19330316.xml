      <P>I move amendment 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 47, sub-section (9).  To delete sub-paragraph (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> The effect of the amendment is that, no matter how many premises a maize miller may have, he need only apply for one registration.  As the Bill stands he must apply for a registration for every premises he has, no matter how many.  I think there is no necessity for that.  If a person is registered as a maize miller, I think he should be allowed to carry on his business in any number of premises that he has under the one registration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be rather difficult to keep the register unless there was a registration for each premises.  It is not going to cause a great deal of trouble to a maize miller, if he has two or three premises, to fill up two or three forms instead of one.  There is no fee charged.</P>

      <P>In connection with amendment 27 to Section 49 in the name of Senator O'Rourke, I must rule it out of order.  When this Bill was in the Dáil an amendment was moved to set up a maize millers' advisory committee as part of the machinery of the Bill.  The amendment was defeated and no such advisory committee is, in fact, provided for.  I have, therefore, to rule the amendment out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 28:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 50, sub-section (2).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;but shall not refuse to register an applicant for registration in respect of additional premises in any register kept by him if such additional premises had in fact been used by the applicant for the purposes of his business during any part <Col N="735" /> of the appointed period as defined in the preceding section, or if such additional premises are required by the applicant in substitution for other premises used by the applicant for the purpose of his business during any part of the appointed period so defined or as a necessary addition to premises previously so used.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter that was discussed at great length in the Dáil on, I think, a similar amendment.  The amendment may be divided roughly into three parts: (1) it refers to additional premises; (2) to substitution for other premises, and (3) to an addition to premises previously so used. Take the application for registration in respect of additional premises.  If the Senator refers to sub-section (6) of Section 49 he will see that if the application is made within one month the Minister has no option but to grant it.  He cannot refuse.  The Minister, however, is not bound after one month to grant an application.  I think Senators will agree that there must be some limit.  In the Dáil we extended the period to one month.  As well as I remember, it was only seven days before that amendment was made.  I think myself that a month is a reasonable period to allow a miller to decide whether he wants additional premises registered or not.  As to substitution for other premises, the only case made for that was that where, say, a maize mill was burned down the proprietor might like to carry on business in some kind of a make-shift way during the rebuilding of the mill so as to keep his business and his customers during the rebuilding period.  In fact, he might be anxious to rebuild, perhaps, on a much better scale than that of his previous premises and he would like in the meantime to hold on to his customers.  In such a case as that, unless the substituted premises were very objectionable, certainly no objection would be raised if the substituted premises were used for that purpose.  That is the only case that has been put up to us where a maize mill was burned by accident and they wanted to substitute premises during rebuilding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> With regard to the third part of the amendment, you will find in sub-section (2) of Section 50 that the Minister cannot refuse to register if the premises are attached to or adjoining.  I do not know whether Senators have the same difficulty about knowing the difference between adjoining and attached which I found, but I believe that &ldquo;attached&rdquo; means under the same roof and &ldquo;adjoining&rdquo; might mean in the next building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the question of substituting premises in case of fire, I am not connected in any way with a mill, but I am connected with certain industries where a stand-by plant or reserve plant is available in case of accident.  I can readily imagine a miller having some such plant which would be available in case of fire.  I would ask the Minister to consider something between this and the Report Stage of the Bill which he might be willing to put into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the premises referred to premises with plant in them or merely premises for holding material?  The difficulty is that in our business we often find that we can get supplies in one part of the country in one year and not in another, according to the growing of the crops, which naturally varies, and we have to get premises to store the corn in the neighbourhood of the people who grow it.  If by &ldquo;premises&rdquo; you mean premises for storing the grain they buy, it will be a serious handicap if you put any difficulty in their way.  It would be a serious handicap in our business if we could not take premises to store the corn, which we buy in the particular part of the country where it is grown.  I should like to know whether such stores are the subject of the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not refer to stores at all.  Stores need not be registered.  It is only where machinery is used for milling that it applies. With regard to Senator Dowdall's point, I could undertake to look into it, but on three different occasions we looked into this matter in the Dáil and came to the conclusion that to put <Col N="737" /> a section into the Bill would be more restrictive than otherwise.  We would have to put all kinds of safeguards in concerning the exceptions.  I think the millers would be wise to leave it to the discretion of the Minister in a case like this.  If we have to put in a section, it would be a very restrictive section and I do not think it would be for the millers' benefit in the end.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Section 50 agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 51, 52, 53, 54 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 55.</P>
      <P>(3)  Every person required by regulations made under this section to make any return who fails or refuses to make such return in accordance in all respects with such regulations shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to the penalties mentioned in Part II of the First Schedule to this Act.</P>
      <P>(4)  An offence under this section by a registered flour importer or registered distiller may be prosecuted by or at the suit of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as prosecutor.</P>
      <P>(5)  An offence under this section by a recognised wheat importer, a registered wheat dealer, a registered maize miller, a registered maize importer, or a registered manufacturer of compound feeding stuffs may be prosecuted by or at the suit of the Minister for Agriculture as prosecutor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 55, sub-section (3).  To delete in line 21 the figure &ldquo;II&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the figure &ldquo;III.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to switch across from Part II to Part III of the First Schedule.  Part II prescribes imprisonment as a penalty, and we think that there should not be imprisonment.  My amendment means <Col N="738" /> that it should be a question of a fine only, and I think that is reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the passage of this Bill also through the Dáil all the penalties were reconsidered and revised, and a certain number of them were brought from Part II to Part III, and from Part I to Part II.  They were made easier&mdash;a large number of the penalties&mdash;and really I think that we could not revise them again. Under this Bill there are lighter, medium and serious offences, and we consider that there should be a rather severe penalty in the case of wrong returns.  We have made an exception of the wheat growers, because it is recognised that a grower should not be expected to have the same knowledge of law and of the filling up of returns and so on, as a maize miller might be expected to have.  Accordingly, we have excepted the growers from it; but we think that the maize millers and others concerned should be subjected to this particular penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>Where do the distillers come in under this?  Why are we introduced into this section?  All the returns made in the distilling trade are made out in accordance with very old established customs, and I cannot make out why we are brought in at all.  It says here in (a) of sub-section (1) &ldquo;the returns to be made to him by registered flour importers and registered distillers&rdquo;; and in sub-section (4) it says &ldquo;an offence under this section by a registered flour importer, or registered distiller&rdquo;. How do we come in under this kind of thing?  I cannot imagine an offence, not already in the category, that will come under this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only with regard to wheat; that is, the amount of home grown wheat received by the distiller. I think the only questions he would be asked are the amount disposed of and the amount in stock, and if he did not answer these questions he would be subject to a penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Section 57, sub-section (2).  To delete in lines 29-30 the word &ldquo;dispositions&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;sales.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;dispositions&rdquo; is too vague and would permit an inspector to pry into a secret mixing process and to have it revealed.  The whole object of the Bill is to ensure the purchase by <Col N="743" /> millers of home-grown cereals for admixture purposes and their sale in maize meal mixture.  The only time the obligation should rest on the miller is at the time of sale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to secret recipes and processes we can discuss them under amendment 36.  The word &ldquo;dispositions&rdquo; is used because it includes sales.  For instance, we have to get returns, and if a maize miller has a retail shop he could transfer a certain amount of the maize meal mixture to the shop for sale there.  He might also transfer certain compound feeding to his premises or to a factory in order to have it incorporated in compound feeding stuffs.  There is also the possibility that a certain amount of grain might become mouldy or bad and have to be destroyed.  We would have to get returns of that, so that it would not be sales alone that would be affected.  &ldquo;Dispositions&rdquo; is the only word we could use.  I am prepared to discuss the matter of secret recipes and processes on amendment 36.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 36:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 57, sub-section (2).  To delete all after the word &ldquo;stuffs&rdquo; in line 36 down to the end of sub-paragraph (e) and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;such records of the quantities of all raw materials brought on to the premises for the manufacture of compound feeding stuffs, of the quantities of all compound feeding stuffs manufactured on such premises, and of all disposal of such feeding stuffs as may be required for the purpose of supervising and enforcing the provisions of a licence granted under Part VI of this Act, provided that nothing hereby required shall be construed as obliging the production of any information relating to or disclosing the composition of any special mixture or any secret process used by the person registered.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment concerns secret processes. Some millers have paid substantial <Col N="744" /> sums for secret mixtures and it would be grossly unfair to expect them to disclose them to the inspectors. The records of quantities and dispositions provided for should be sufficient for the inspectors, in order to see that the provisions of the Bill are being complied with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department does not take a very serious view of the secret processes.  The officials do not think there is anything in these processes. They are surprised to learn that any miller of a compound feeding stuff would pay for a secret mixture, because we have experts at our disposal in Albert College and in the Department, and we can really give to anyone who asks for it the best mixture that can be got for feeding animals, free of charge.  If it came to the point that a manufacturer claimed to have a secret process our officials would be bound by the Official Secrets Act to keep any information they got to themselves. There is no danger whatever of the secret leaking out.  We would not be disposed to go minutely into details. The amount of maize, barley, oat meal, or Sussex ground oats that would be in mixture for poultry and dairy cattle feeding is not really any great secret but the amount of some mineral that might be in it would be.  That gives some particular flavour to and distinguishes it from others.  That is the only distinction.  We would not be concerned with that as long as it was not poisonous.  If we know the amount of cereals in the mixture we are not going to pry further.  Perhaps we would be inclined to go further if we found that an extravagant price was being charged.  It will be found that we have taken very drastic powers in a later section with regard to compound feeding stuffs.  The reason is that manufacturers of these stuffs were sending mixtures over here for sale for poultry, pig and greyhound feeding for which they were charging most extravagant prices.  We had some of these analysed in the Department and, in one particular case, we found that material which was selling at 58/- a cwt. was worth 8/-, according to the materials in it.  We want to stop that kind of material coming to the country.  We <Col N="745" /> want to go further and to see that no one is engaging in that trade at home. Although we are anxious to promote industries we do not want industries of that type started.  If we find that an extravagant price is charged our inspectors may go very minutely into the composition of the feeding stuff concerned.  Even when they find out everything it will be secret under the Official Secrets Act.  All an inspector can do is to report to the Minister that the person should be stopped manufacturing that particular mixture and he will be compelled to cease doing so. If we find that he is manufacturing a new mixture under another name we may warn him, and eventually we may withdraw his licence as a manufacturer of compound feeding stuffs.  There is no fear whatever that there will be any interference with legitimate trade.  We must have powers, however, to see that legitimate trade is carried on.</P>

      <P>In the interests of maize millers, I am opposing this amendment. While we have put into the Bill the words &ldquo;prescribed regulations&rdquo; we do not want to go too far. We must be restrictive in our regulations just the same as we would be restrictive in the Bill.  It is better for those concerned to have discretion used in a case like this.  If we have to be restrictive we will have to be so restrictive that we will inflict, perhaps, a certain amount of hardship on millers who have to keep records. It is difficult to foresee all the loopholes and all the evasions that may be necessary under the Bill.  Our regulations would have to be drawn <Col N="746" /> up in such a way that I am afraid they would be a burden on the maize millers to carry out.  It is much better to leave the wording as loose as possible and at the Minister's discretion.</P>

      <P>Having taken that advice the matter must go to court, so I do not see that by accepting this amendment there would be any safeguard.  These matters would always be taken into account by the court if not by the Minister.  I think the amendment is not necessary; in any case it would require very serious consideration before it could be accepted.  Some Senators objected to the wording of this section, but the question must be considered by the Minister, and he is not likely to take action if the matter appears to be outside the control of the person concerned. If the Minister takes action then when a person comes before the court he will make his case and do his best to defend himself.</P>

Perhaps the defence I made in regard to a former amendment would be a good defence here also, that is that no complaints have been made so far in connection with the Eggs Act, the Fresh Meat Act or the Potato Act or any other agricultural products Acts, and the wording here is the same as in them. It would be unreasonable to put the duty upon us to serve notice on a particular person.  Everyone knows the difficulty there is experienced sometimes in serving writs upon particular persons.  The sheriff and his men find it very difficult sometimes to get the man they want to serve.  It would be much more difficult for the officials of the Department of Agriculture than it would for the sheriff.  It would be unfair in fact to put the onus upon them.  The Department of Agriculture has worked the Agricultural Produce Acts, and there never was any complaint of serving a writ on a yardman or anybody like that.  They would have written several letters before the stage of serving a writ was reached. The matter would not be abused in any way.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 66:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 72 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;72.  There shall be paid by the Minister, out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas, compensation at the rate of £3 per statute acre to every registered wheat grower who shall prove to the satisfaction of the Minister, in respect of the area sown by him under wheat, of which a return has been duly made pursuant to sub-section (1) of Section 56 of this Act,</P>
      <P>(a)  that the crop, or part thereof, has failed, or</P>
      <P>(b)  that the crop, or part thereof, where produced, is not of millable quality,</P>
      <P>and that such failure or lack of millable quality is in no way attributable to the wheat having been sown in unsuitable land, or to want of reasonable care and attention during its growth and harvesting, or otherwise to any default or negligence on the part of such registered wheat grower.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My object in moving this amendment is to try to secure for the farmer who grows wheat, and who tries to comply with the request of the Government, in case his crop fails or in case the wheat does not prove of millable quality, compensation for his out-of-pocket expenses.  The Minister has put forward a wheat policy which he states will improve the economic condition of this country.  If he wants that policy to be tried out and to get a sufficient quantity of wheat grown, he should, I believe, accept the amendment.  It may be said that this amendment is a policy <Col N="753" /> of subsidies gone mad but we have adopted the principle of subsidies for wheat of a millable quality.  I cannot see why the grower of wheat who is assured of a reasonable price for his product should get a subsidy when the man who goes to the same care and trouble, through no fault of his own will get less than half the price.  The grower who produces a millable quality of wheat is assured of about £15 per acre whereas the man who is not able to produce a millable quality of wheat may only get £3 or £4 per acre.  It is very questionable whether under the present state of affairs he will be able to sell it at all.  At the present time oats cannot be sold although there is a prohibitive tariff on imported oats. I do not remember that for the last thirty years oats have been sold at such low prices.  The fact is that if this present tariff policy continues the farmers will go out of production.  If the farmer goes out of the production of oats, the farmer who goes to the trouble of producing wheat and who will not be able to produce a millable quality will have practically nothing for his labour.</P>
    <P>It might be said that there is no necessity for a farmer to grow wheat if he is not able to grow wheat of a millable quality but I contend that a farmer may not for several seasons be able to produce wheat of a millable quality.  I discussed this matter some time ago with Senator Jameson who buys a considerable quantity of wheat for distilling purposes and he told me that for some years at least he found it very difficult to get a sufficient quantity of wheat of good quality for his distillery.  I contend that we will want to have millable wheat as good as distilling wheat.  Senator Jameson says that in several years his men found it difficult to get sufficient wheat to supply their requirements in the distillery and any wheat grower might find it difficult to produce a millable quality of wheat with the climate we have to put up with at times in this country.  At the present time, wheat can be bought in Dublin at from 14/- to 15/- per barrel.  That is the price for best imported foreign wheat and, under those circumstances, <Col N="754" /> it is very qnestiouable whether you will get five or six shillings a barrel for wheat which is only of a feeding quality in this country.  For that reason, I think the House should support this amendment and provide some compensation for the farmer who tries to assist the Government's wheat growing policy and to recoup him for his out-of-pocket expenses.</P>

      <P>I wish to support Senator Counihan.  When we guarantee the price of wheat, I think it is reasonable that we should compensate the farmer if his crop is damaged by weather.  I do not see anything ridiculous in the suggestion when we are prepared to compensate him in regard to his price.  In a number of counties like Leitrim and Cavan, the crop may be very late and it will not be possible to save it.  It will not be millable wheat and the growers will get very little for the crop.  I think, in those circumstances, that it is quite reasonable that they should get some compensation from the Government.  If that is not done, it will mean that the farmers in the good lands will get all the benefits while the farmers in the bad lands need not attempt to grow wheat at all because of the risk attaching to it.  I think it is a reasonable suggestion notwithstanding Senator Foran's joke about it.</P>

      <P>In Canada, every year, enormous quantities of wheat are destroyed by early frosts which come just as the milk is coming into the ear and the result is that the Canadian farmers nearly always insure their crop against frost.  I do not remember whether there is a Government insurance <Col N="755" /> scheme or whether they insure through ordinary insurance companies but almost all of them do insure, and I should imagine it would be possible to do the same thing here.  The rates would be very low indeed.</P>

I think it would be almost impossible to administer such a proposal, satisfactorily, at all events.  The State would be taking too much responsibility in the matter and would be absolving the grower from responsibility and it would never be possible to get to the bottom of it satisfactorily.  If the Bill was compulsory, it would be a different matter but the Bill being as it is, I do not see how the proposal could be administered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct Senator Counihan on one point as to the difficulty of getting millable wheat. There have been such years&mdash;I did not say several&mdash;but, in the course of my experience, I have known years in which it was very hard to buy millable wheat in any quantity.  The trouble about this amendment is that it is really against the principle of the Bill. The whole Bill deals with millable wheat that is fit for human consumption, and I do not think that the Minister for Finance has ever considered what the paying of compensation for all the wheat that is not millable or fit for human consumption that may be grown anywhere would cost the taxpayers.  I think it is really an amendment which cuts across the principle of the Bill.  There is a real danger along the lines suggested by Senator Counihan.  There is not a vestige of a doubt that if this is a successful scheme and if we reach a stage where we are growing a large quantity of wheat in this country and if, for some reason or another, very bad harvest weather comes along, a whole lot of wheat that was excellently millable will become unmillable and removed from the operation of the subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> The farmers who grow it face a very great loss, and I think Senator Robinson's suggestion is that somehow or another the farmers who do grow this wheat should protect themselves by something in the nature of insurance.  The Government who are fathering this scheme should look into that point and see if there are any conditions which would fix such insurance at a rate which a man could afford.  I think it should be looked into, because it is one of the serious risks that will have to be run by farmers under this scheme for the promotion of wheat growing in this country.  A bad season, such as some of us have seen, would undoubtedly mean serious loss for them.  The House will remember the trouble we had here on the question of insurance against foot-and-mouth disease, but there ought to be some scheme possible by which insurance would prevent that loss falling on the farmers from causes entirely outside their own control.  If that is possible, it certainly ought to be done, but I cannot see how we can alter the Bill to include an amendment such as the one Senator Counihan puts before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment strikes me as it does Senator Jameson &mdash;as cutting right across the principle of the Bill.  The Bill aims at encouraging wheat for flour milling, and if there were a proposal to give a bounty to all persons who till the land, I could understand this proposition but, clearly, if that were passed, the one thing that stands out as important to me would be lost, namely, that, with a wheat growing bounty based upon wheat for flour milling, we will have what Senator O'Rourke promised us by inference on Second Reading&mdash;a specialisation in breeds of wheat suitable for this country.  If you are to have a bounty per acre on the tillage and sowing of the crop rather than on the product, that particular encouragement would be lost.  I think that that is a fatal objection to the very idea that is embodied in the amendment, quite apart from the other objection that the whole scheme of the Bill will be destroyed by its acceptance.</P>

The price inducement is going to make farmers grow wheat and there is certainly going to be this loss.  Is it fair, if a man carries out the tillage requirements and, by an act of God, his crop is destroyed, that he should not get compensation?  There is really something in the point.  If the Minister would introduce some system of insurance, then perhaps that might meet the case.  There is a lot to be said for subsidising the man who does the work.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Counihan's amendment is a little bit wide.  It finishes off:</P>
      <P>that such failure or lack of millable quality is in no way attributable to the wheat having been sown in unsuitable land.</P>
      <P>If you consider the matter from the point of view that a farmer is going to get £3 an acre, I honestly believe that into every bog hole in Kerry people would be inclined to throw a handful of grain and the Minister would find himself an extremely popular man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As certain Senators have mentioned here, the Government <Col N="758" /> policy is to get the best possible grain grown under the best possible circumstances. We have provided here that the farmer who grows good wheat will get a better price than the farmer who grows wheat not quite so good. We do not fix a flat price for the wheat.  We are trying to encourage the efficient farmer to grow the best wheat for milling purposes.  When this tillage policy was being discussed before the Bill was brought in, the suggestion was made several times to me that the best way to encourage tillage was to give a subsidy per acre. I did not agree with that because I did not want to have tillage of an indifferent kind subsidised.  I want to see the farmer who tills properly getting a good price for his produce. If a person has a failure in the beet crop we do not compensate him, although the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and this Government have induced farmers by various means to grow beet for the factory. I admit that there have been very few failures in the case of beet, and I believe there will be very few failures in the case of wheat, too.  We do not compensate the owner of a herd of cows if his cows get an attack of contagious abortion and he loses all his calves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no inducement to produce the calves.  If you say &ldquo;I will give you £3 for each calf produced,&rdquo; that would be some inducement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all the more reason why we should not compensate them. We gave a subsidy in relation to butter, not on the number of cows in the country.  We did not say to the farmer with twelve cows &ldquo;We will give you a subsidy of £3 a cow.&rdquo;  We told the farmers that all the butter they could produce that could be sold under market conditions would be subsidised. The farmer who lost his cow got no subsidy.  Only the farmer who kept good cows and produced suitable butter was given the subsidy.  It is stated that there will be great loss in the growing of wheat if it is not up to millable quality.  I think unless the wheat is very bad&mdash;if it is just below millable quality&mdash;it will be practically <Col N="759" /> as good as the same area under barley or under oats.  Under ordinary circumstances wheat is a better foodstuff than either barley or oats.</P>
      <P>I do not take this amendment seriously.  A similar amendment was introduced in the Dáil and I know the Deputy responsible for it put it in more or less as a sarcastic amendment. I do not think the Senator is guilty of sarcasm.  He may have put the amendment in good faith.  Let us suppose that I were to administer the Act if this amendment were inserted.  I would have to prove to my own satisfaction that the wheat was not sown on unsuitable land.  I would have to be advised by some official of the Department that the land was suitable and that the failure of the crop was not due to want of reasonable care and attention.  How would my official find that out?  Would he have to call witnesses before him to see if this man exercised reasonable care in ploughing and harrowing the field; if he exercised reasonable care at six o'clock in the morning in shooting crows; if he exercised reasonable care in order to see that weeds were properly removed from the crop? As a matter of fact, the official would have to hold a sort of public inquiry.  He would have to investigate carefully whether reasonable care had been exercised in the harvesting of the crop.  I fail to understand what the word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; is meant to convey. Would the inspector be expected to see that the stocks were not left for a sufficiently long period in the field to allow field mice to accumulate?  Would he be expected to find out if the wheat was threshed at a reasonable time and the grain was brought to the mill without being exposed to the dampness of the atmosphere?  Then the point is reached where the farmer presents his grain to the miller and it is turned down.  We would have to interpret what the Senator means by &ldquo;otherwise.&rdquo;  I think the whole thing is either a joke or sarcasm and I would like to know which.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">

      <P>I am surprised at the statement the Minister has made, <Col N="760" /> following the speeches we have listened to from Senators Jameson, O'Rourke, Wilson and others.  It has been proved to the satisfaction of every sensible man who understands anything about growing wheat that the whole danger is the weather.  A man may be able to produce the best possible crop of wheat when suddenly the weather will break and he will not be able to supply a millable sample because of the wheat getting lodged or otherwise deteriorating. That is the whole case.  The Minister asks how can he be expected to prove that there was reasonable care.  If it has been a suitable year for growing wheat and the majority of the farmers are able to produce millable wheat, it would be easy for one of the inspectors to make inquiries with regard to the reaping, harvesting and threshing of the crop.  It is possible that in some years fully 85 per cent. of the wheat grown will be unsuitable for milling.  In such circumstances it is very unfair to let the farmer be at the sole loss of his crop.</P>
      <P>The Minister states that the wheat would be suitable for feeding, but I want to tell the Minister that there are several farmers in the country, and I am afraid there will be more later on, who will grow wheat and oats and look on them as the only cash crop they can grow.  When the farmer wants to sell his wheat or oats whether for feeding or for millable purposes, he will have to sell it and get the best price he can.  I submit that the amendment is a very reasonable one, and in view of the Minister's policy of trying to get 600,000 acres of wheat grown it is an amendment that he should accept, otherwise I do not think he will get these 600,000 acres grown under wheat.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 71:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 81, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;miller&rdquo; in line 20 to insert the words &ldquo;or retailed by a registered maize meal dealer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got to assume that some of the consequential amendments have been passed and that there is such a person as the maize miller.  We have got to assume that.  As Section 81 stands at the present moment, maize meal intended for human consumption can only be sold in 1 stone packages secured in a certain way.  We realise that the restriction or control on maize meal is essential to the working of this measure.  I do not think that the amendment I have put down will interfere with this to any extent. My intention is to lessen the burden which the preceding section imposes on the poor people in the provinces, particularly in Munster and Connacht.  There have been figures given in the Dáil and figures will vary very much in the different districts as to prices of meal.  The prices are largely governed by the cost of distribution, and, that being so, I think you will find that the difference in the proportion in the prices between the 1 stone package and the 20 stone sack will remain constant.  In my own locality in the South-West of Munster the situation is like this: Before this mixture scheme came in a 20 stone sack was 17/6 or 10½d. per stone Now you can only get maize or flour in 1 stone packages at 1/2 per stone. That is at the rate of 23/- for a 20 stone bag as compared with the price of 17/6 bought by the sack.  That would be an increase of 33 per cent., a very considerable amount to the small farmers and others.  I do not believe when the Bill was first debated that anyone realised that in Munster we do not use porridge as in Donegal. In Donegal the small family uses a stone of meal in the day.  In South-West Munster we use a good deal of maize in our bread.  A family of five will consume two stone of maize in their bread in a week.  That means that a small family will consume somewhere about 104 stone weight of meal in the year.  At 3/6 per stone that is an increase to these people in <Col N="763" /> the family budget of £2 in the year. In actual fact, from April onwards, when the potatoes are extremely scarce, the people will use an extra two stone of flour per week to make up for the want of potatoes.  I have not put that item into my figures.  That margin is in favour of my calculation. This £2 is a small sum, but the man who has to work a very long day before he finds any portion of that money in his pocket, will feel this tax heavily.</P>
    <P>It is in examining the total tax that you will find that flaw in the administration of the scheme.  Now in Munster there are 48,000 holders under a £7 valuation and in Connacht there are 53,900 holders under the £7 valuation. That gives you altogether in Munster and Connacht 102,000 small holders&mdash; the very poorest class.  A sum of £2 each on these families means that the preceding section will cost them £204,000 without any benefit gained at all.  I say that because the man who fills these bags will start by using more labour; finally he will put in machinery for filling them so that this will not mean any additional employment.  The position then is that in respect of this one essential article of food this Bill as it stands will impoverish to that extent people who will not get any benefit in return from it for the reason that their land is unsuitable for growing wheat.</P>
    <P>I take no credit for the fact that in Donegal they use a great deal more than this.  So as to allow that proper margin for families who do not use it in the South-West, I will give the Minister the benefit of the doubt and take only 50 per cent. of my figures. That still leaves an indirect tax of £102,000 which I think should be reconsidered. I would say that the people who will suffer this tax chiefly are not the people who will profit from this Bill in the shape of any wheat bounty. I propose a very simple thing which can be done through the present machinery.  I propose that a certain specified quantity of maize meal may be sold to these small occupants in 20 stone bags.  I fix a £7 valuation limit. That is £3 less than the valuation <Col N="764" /> figure at which the Government decided that the farmer should be totally de-rated.  If you de-rate the farmers with one hand and then shove a tax of £2 on them in this way they will not really be better off.  I have specified a certain certificate to ensure that this concession will not be used to evade the provisions which the Government decide to introduce into the country to ensure that there is a reduction in the imports of maize meal and that there is an increase in the amount of home-grown feeding stuffs used.  It is possible that there will be evasions in some directions but the amendment is worth trying.  I think it will make it possible for the small holders to get the greater part of their supplies for home consumption in the 20 stone sack.  I admit that this will mean further control but everybody is controlled under this Bill and in actual fact a great many of the people who come on the register are also maize dealers.  When this was discussed in the Dáil, there were indications that the Minister realised to some extent what this meant but I do not think he realised to the full extent.  I hope if this particular form of concession is not quite what will meet the case&mdash;the Minister may think that evasion would be greater than I anticipate&mdash;that the Minister will consider the matter and put down an amendment which we can consider on the next stage of the Bill. The certificate which follows is a simple matter.  It is of much the same type as the sales certificates for wheat.  The records are available, in the Gárda Síochána offices in every town, of the holders of £7 valuation.  At the end, the person concerned certifies and that will make him liable in a court to the penalties at the end of the Bill if he has attempted to evade the provision by going to some other dealer and getting more than his quota.  There may be some small evasions.  Finally, the actual concession amounts to just about four cargoes of maize out of the whole supply of the Free State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to follow the figures quoted by Senator The McGillycuddy. I do not know how we can be accused of taking a tax of £200,000, or even half that, from these people unless they are <Col N="765" /> consuming an enormous amount of maize.  The increase in price we were accused of was 3/6 per sack of 20 stones.  On those figures, they must be consuming for human food in the congested districts more than half the maize that comes into the Free State. Apart from that, as the Bill was originally introduced in the Dáil, it was considerably more restrictive of the sale of pure maize than it is at present under Section 81.  As it stood when introduced, there was no departure from the package of one stone, but this question was raised in the Dáil by Deputies from Kerry and Donegal, principally, and as a result sub-section (1) (a) (iii) read:&mdash;&ldquo;the weight of maize meal in such package does not exceed the prescribed weight or, if no weight is for the time being prescribed, one stone.&rdquo;  We have power under that section to change the weight from one stone as soon as the demand for larger weights is apparent in those areas. We have had no complaint through our inspectors in the country and no complaint direct to the Department of Agriculture since these regulations were made.  Although we are working already under the regulations as they stand in the Bill, we have had no complaint from these areas with regard to pure maize meal for human consumption.</P>
      <P>I mentioned here yesterday that the one complaint we did get was that a miller had been deceiving a consumer for about four weeks by giving him a maize meal mixture for human consumption without telling him that oatmeal had been mixed with the maize meal.  The point is that the person concerned did not detect by sight or taste the mixture of the oatmeal with the maize.  It was only when he was told by a third party that he had been consuming oatmeal for three weeks that he became indignant with the retailer and threatened to take an action against him.  In those two counties&mdash;Donegal and Kerry&mdash;where the consumption of maize meal is very heavy, the maize meal mixture is being used to a great extent.  When turned out with the proper mixture of food oats&mdash;dehulled oats&mdash;in the maize it is quite suitable for human consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> Seeing that the regulations have been working rather smoothly and without either complaint or comment for the past four or five months, I think it would be a mistake to make it easier for the former consumers of whole maize to go back to whole maize and to give up the mixture of maize and oatmeal.  Nobody can complain from the national, economic or public health point of view if we can drive the people of Kerry and Donegal to the consumption of oatmeal instead of maize.  From every point of view, they would be better if they went back to the consumption of oatmeal instead of maize meal.  They are gradually going back by taking at present 10 per cent. of oatmeal in the maize meal and we hope that as the years go on the percentage will be increased and that when we go up to 40 per cent. or 50 per cent. oatmeal, they will go off maize meal entirely. Nobody can say that it would not be better, economically and nationally speaking, for them to do that.  From the point of view of health, and particularly from the point of view of the health of the children reared in these counties, it would be better if they took to oatmeal.  Oatmeal has properties especially in connection with the rearing of children that maize meal has not got.</P>
    <P>As the matter stands under sub-section (1) (a) (iii), if a case is made to the Department of Agriculture that owing to bad conditions or, perhaps, scarcity of oats, the maize meal mixture could only contain wheat or barley, as good oats could not be got in one of these small areas for two or three months in some particular year&mdash; if such representations were made to the Department of Agriculture, I am certain that we would not refuse to use our powers under sub-section (1) (a) (iii) and allow larger packages than the one-stone packages to be sold in that particular area as long as the particular need might last. The amendment is really unnecessary because we have the powers to do what is sought.  There is a provision inserted by Senator The McGillycuddy about maize meal dealers which was somewhat confusing to me at first <Col N="767" /> because we had talked about wheat dealers.  Wheat dealers are the people who take the wheat from the farmer and sell it to the distiller or flour miller or sell it back to the farmer as seed.  In this case, the maize meal dealer would not be on the same plane. He would be more between the manufacturer and consumer, whereas the wheat dealer was between the producer and the consumer.</P>

If the Senator will reconsider the matter I think he will see that we have all the powers he seeks to give us, and these powers could be used in any exceptional circumstances which may arise.</P>

      <P>From what the Minister stated there is an object in this Bill of which I certainly did not know, that this extra price which the people will have to pay if they take this in the stone bags is practically a method adopted to drive them into giving up the use of maize.  I did not know that that was a principle of the Bill and I <Col N="768" /> doubt if Senator The McGillycuddy did.  From what the Minister says it would appear that to save this £2 a year, which they will lose by having to buy maize meal in one-stone bags, they will have to use oatmeal or some mixture. That means that the Government is trying under the Bill to coerce a large part of our population, the poorest part of our population, to eat something which the Government consider better for them than what they are in the habit of using.  It is quite evident that the Government intend to oppose this amendment and keep this tax on the poor people of Donegal and Kerry so as to compel them not to buy maize meal but to buy oatmeal and things which suit the rest of their policy.  I think it is well that the people of these counties should know why they have to pay this.  I have eaten plenty of maize meal myself and also plenty of oatmeal, but I never could find out that it was a matter of such importance that people like that, to whom money is so important, should be driven off a thing which is cheap to another thing, for the difference between buying a two-stone bag or a one-stone bag.  That is quite clever, but I would not be very proud of it if I were in the Government.</P>

They make maize meal there as fine as fine flour mixed with wheat flour for making bread.  That is different from the other counties.  The Senator is probably comparing that with the maize meal ground for cattle. Maize meal ground for cattle mixed with oats is a very different thing, and an entirely different price from maize meal ground into flour, so that the 3½d. may be justifiable.  The maize flour might be 1/- or 1/6 a cwt. dearer than cattle maize meal.  In that way, I think, the 3½d. might be explained. That does not apply to any other county in Ireland accept Kerry, where they want this fine maize meal.</P>

      <P>It is very hard to argue with the Minister when he changes himself into a doctor and advises as to whether oatmeal or maize is the better of the two.  I think the people in Kerry actually have gone to maize meal because it is really a more palatable food than oatmeal and that they have taken to it in Donegal for the same reason&mdash; that they like it a great deal better. I think it is most unfortunate that the price of the food which they choose should be put up and that they should be pressed to eat food which they do not want.  The reason I have put this down, in spite of the fact that we have the words in the Bill &ldquo;exceed the prescribed weight,&rdquo; which means that the Minister can prescribe it any time he wants, is that we assume when this Bill becomes law the admixture of home-grown cereals with the maize meal will undoubtedly be increased and it is quite possible that the original proposal of putting in offals in the admixture will be reverted to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that the people are now, unknowingly in many cases, eating the admixture.  They will certainly go on either eating stuff with more offals of home-grown cereals in it or be put to further expense in the shape of these one-stone bags.  The Minister said that he did not understand my figures. I can assure him that I checked them over and over again to make sure that they were right.  I did not want to come here and produce figures which were not correct.  I do not think that <Col N="771" /> these small people should have to pay. I think this is a great flaw in the Bill and should be rectified.  I suggest that something on the lines I have mentioned <Col N="772" /> should be arrived at by the Minister before the Report Stage is taken.</P>

      <P>I was induced to vote against the last amendment because I knew that an opportunity would arise to get some clarification of the matter on this further amendment.  I should like to have some satisfaction from the Minister as to what there is in the regulations that he has issued and in the Act so far as it is at present operating to make it necessary that there should be a difference of 3½d per stone in the transferring of the meal from the 20-stones sack to the one-stone sack.  If the Minister has made regulations which make that an inevitable increase in the charge, then, I think, the case Senator The McGillycuddy has made requires to be met.  I am slow to believe that the Minister has deliberately made regulations which make such an excessive cost of transferring meal inevitable.  If he cannot give us some satisfaction on the point, I think that there is some justification for the case that has been made for the amendment by Senator The McGillycuddy and I should like that the matter be made much clearer than it has been made in the course of the discussion on the last amendment.</P>

      <P>At the present time, under the present powers under which we are working, there is no regulation <Col N="773" /> except that maize cannot be sold unless mixed with ten per cent. of home grown cereal or, if meant for human consumption, it must be packed in one-stone bags.  We have not gone further.  We have not suggested of what material the bag must be made. In some cases, it is, I believe, just the ordinary paper bags that are used for a stone of flour or oaten meal and, of course, there is no justification whatsoever for an increase of 3½d.  However, that is a matter that can be dealt with by another body.  As soon as this Bill goes through we will have power.  But as far as raising the expense or cost is concerned, our regulations will not make any difference.  Certainly, we will not exclude paper bags for the one-stone weight, and the only addition will be a label which must be attached. That label will be an ordinary paper label in the case of those one-stone bags, so that the cost will not be increased in any way.  I do not think that the fact of converting, say, one cwt. of maize meal and turning it into eight paper bags of one stone each, should mean a cost of 2/4, which it would appear to be at present.  In the Dáil, when this matter was under discussion, various figures were given also, and one Deputy from Mayo&mdash;he was not a member of our Party but was very much opposed to this Bill&mdash;gave the figure as 2d. per stone of an increase as a result of our regulations. He was very emphatic in his figures because he was in the trade himself, and he said the increase in cost was 2d. per stone.  I presume that the merchants and retailers in Mayo were carrying on business at a profit, and if they could do so there, I think there is no reason why they should not be able to do it in Kerry or Donegal.  At any rate, 2d. was considered enough in Mayo.</P>

      <P>In view of what I have already said, I have nothing to add; but the Minister said that paper bags would not be excluded.  As a matter of fact, you cannot possibly have the maize in paper bags.  A man, say, comes down to a market, or his wife comes, and he makes several purchases and brings back a few <Col N="774" /> things&mdash;his maize and half-a-dozen other things in his cart.  He could not possibly bring the meal back in paper bags, for by the time he got up to his home in the mountains or wherever he lived it would be all over the cart. You must have some kind of jute or linen bags.  Paper would not do unless you have some very thick stuff. You have a cement bag, of course, but that is easily punctured, and once punctured cannot be mended, whereas sacking or linen can be mended.</P>

      <P>The price is not 3½d. dearer.  It is only 2d.  The Senator is comparing it with the price of the stone to-day.  There is only 2d. in Kerry to-day actually and I claim that 2d. is a reasonable figure because a penny must go for the bag.  A miller cannot send out 14lbs. of meal in paper.  It must be a cotton bag and that will cost a penny and the shopkeeper must get a penny for retailing it out.  So that 2d. is quite reasonable.</P>

I could do it in certain places and under certain circumstances if the case so warranted, but I am afraid that as the amendment is worded we would have to sell it in all parts, except, of course, that it would be confined to people under the £7 valuation and at all times of the year.</P>

      <P>I do not want the Senator to withdraw the amendment under any misunderstanding.  I could not do anything until the Bill is through and until the regulations are framed.  That was the intention.  I want to state frankly that if we thought there was occasion for it at a certain time over a certain area we would frame regulations so as to permit larger quantities than one stone being sold.  The point was made by Senator Counihan that never in his memory was oats as cheap as at present.  If it is the case that maize is a little dearer than it was before the scheme came in, I do not see that there is any justification for an increase in the price at all.  That is a matter that the Prices Tribunal might inquire into. I think the increase is not general and certainly not as high as in County Kerry.</P>

      <P>The object of the amendment is to secure that millers will not be compelled to brand packets &ldquo;maize&rdquo; in future.  It had been the custom until the change in the mixture to brand all packages &ldquo;maize meal.&rdquo;  If compelled to do so under this Bill it will mean increased cost, because there will be continual variations in the percentages. In my district we may be using half wheat and half barley at the beginning of the year, half barley and half oats in the spring, and all oats at the end. If the millers had to keep a stock of bags to cover that position it would entail considerable expense.  What we want is a pasted label and to have it clearly specified that the mixture is according to regulations.  I am suggesting that in the interests of economy If the Bill is passed as it stands it will compel millers to charge 1/- or 2/- a ton extra.  It would be of no benefit to anyone.</P>

It is our intention to prescribe ordinary labels setting out the contents of the sack.  Some of my advisers seem to think that it may be necessary to go beyond labelling.  Something <Col N="778" /> may arise which we cannot foresee and the actual branding of the bags may be necessary. I cannot see that it will be necessary.  As a first step the present intention is that the regulations will prescribe ordinary labels and if that is satisfactory we will not go beyond it. If it proves unsatisfactory we may have to have branding.  I do not believe it will prove unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 95: Section 97.  To delete the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, and subsequent amendments, are directed to get Part VIII of the Bill withdrawn.  The most essential amendment to that effect is the amendment I am now moving and later, amendments 99 and 100.  I propose in this first amendment to develop my argument with regard to the whole of the part of the Bill we propose to omit.  The principle of this Bill has been before the House long ago.  There has been a general election in the meantime, and I know the Government has a mandate for the principle of this Bill.  Therefore, I feel all the <Col N="780" /> more called upon to give an explanation for moving amendments, the object of which is the withdrawal of one whole part of the Bill.  I suggest to the Minister that the Bill could do without Part VIII.  That particular part of the Bill is open to more objection than any other.  That being so, and that part not being vitally important to the rest of the Bill, it is not unreasonable, I claim, to bring up amendments with the object of effecting the withdrawal of the whole of Part VIII.  I hold that it is not a national necessity that we should pass legislation that would enable two Ministers to set up milling business with public money and at public risk. It is, of course, understood that I am not referring to the present two Ministers or to any Minister.  It is, that I object to the principle, and I object to Ministers of this or any other Government going into business in this way.</P>
    <P>Let us get down to first principles in this matter.  Ministers are most unlikely to be trained in the business of milling.  If there was available a Minister trained in that business it would be either because he had retired from business or that on the question of age he would be past his time, or because he did not like the business or because he failed at it. Anyhow, the Minister would be going into a business which like any other is complicated and technical and requires a good deal of wisdom to conduct it with success.  Ministers would be quite unfit to go into this. Just like the miller in private business he would have to depend upon his officials and his employees.  I do not see how he would have knowledge enough of the business to enable him to get the best out of his employees.  He would also lack certain qualifications and incentives to economic milling.  That, as a matter of fact, is a matter of principle, and would apply to the State as it would apply to any other business.  The Ministers in this milling business, also, would change with every change of Government.  There would be no continuity or personal responsibility and no fear of the bankruptcy court. The country would have to bear all <Col N="781" /> that.  I contend that State milling would lead to a waste of public money, and would generally discourage private milling.  I do not see why private milling should not stand well with this country.  One of my grounds for making all these assertions is that I see, and it is common knowledge, that the State in business tends to be inefficient and wasteful.  That is no new question, or any special idea of mine as one member of this House; it is a matter of common knowledge.</P>
    <P>I know from many examples the evils of the State coming into business.  I do not know any satisfactory example to the contrary, with one possible exception.  It is true that that exception is somewhat apposite, in a way, because the exception has to do with the man not trained in the business&mdash; the business that has to do with corn. He dreamed a dream and his name was Joseph.  With that exception I do not know any satisfactory case of the State having gone into business and made progress.  In the forties of the last century there were many State workshops in France, and they went on there for a long time.  There was terrible waste and very great loss.  In the royal dockyards in England the State, in our time, conducted business on a great scale but they gave it up because it was found that it was far more profitable for the nation to deal with private dockyards.  Army clothing factories were established, and they were given up because they were found more expensive than factories run by private enterprise in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>In the matter of railways there is a long and very extensive experience all over the world of State ownership and it has proved in every case to be unsatisfactory.  And the principle so far from making an advance in the great countries of the world is becoming generally discredited.  In a number of countries State management of railways has been abandoned and they have reverted to private or more or less private management. That is the case in a number of countries. In these countries State control of railways has proved a failure. <Col N="782" /> It has been abandoned in Belgium, New Zealand and South Africa.  In the United States they set up a shipping board and they started a big mercantile marine and that also was a comparative failure.</P>
    <P>Russia to-day is, of course, the best example of State controlled industry. It is a more difficult country to understand than any of those I have mentioned. There the State is in every business; everything is controlled by it; yet we find that in England from nine-tenths of the newspapers and nine-tenths of the books written with the general western point of view, the whose thing is characterised as one great, wasteful muddle.  Ministers in Russia themselves are always declaring the failure of the things they have undertaken.  Of course, every new programme they produce is going to work out all right and grand after a bit, but as a matter of fact their standard is very low and, as we know, they have food queues all over that country.  If Ministers&mdash;and I am not now talking of the present Ministers, but any Ministers&mdash;were to ask for capital to set up milling with private money I do not think they would get it.  People would refuse to take the risk of entrusting their money to men who had not been engaged in the business previously. The present Ministers contend that they have got a mandate, but the minds of the people never realised, when these powers were given, that State money was going to be wasted in costly experiments by people not trained in private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I think there are objections to this part of the Bill that do not apply to other parts of it.  When we come to consider what the State did on previous occasions, in relation to these matters, I think Ministers will realise, and would prefer, that this part of the Bill should be done away with if possible. It is not for me to say whether it is possible or not, but I suggest to the House that the Bill could stand without Part VIII, which is, I think, the most seriously objectionable part of the whole measure.</P>

      <P>I put my name to these amendments as a protest against <Col N="783" /> the principle more than anything else. They are all in logical sequence while more or less independent.  I must say that I am opposed, from the general experience the world has had, to the State entering into competition in commercial enterprise with private individuals either directly or indirectly. There is always the cost to the taxpayer to be considered.  There is no incentive whatever to keep down the cost, particularly under proposals such as we have in this particular section. Here for a moment I cut away from Senator Bagwell's suggestion regarding inefficiency.  I suggest that the present Minister would be an extremely efficient miller.  Let us take a case in point.  A miller's licence is withdrawn. The Minister then steps in and under the Bill he can buy the mill at a price which the Government themselves fix. Then, being an extremely efficient miller, he is going to rationalise the industry and to work it himself.  Under the provision of Section 102 (2) he can incur any loss whatever in doing so. As a matter of fact, referring to what Senator Bagwell has stated, if shares were offered under Section 102 (2) at 5 per cent.  I would jump at the opportunity to put capital into the thing because the risk would be completely covered.  Suppose it were the policy of the Government to reduce the cost of feeding stuffs in some particular district, under pressure or for some other reason.  The Minister has only got to do what I have said and he then can proceed to undersell all the other millers in that district.  They will have either to go out of business or bring prices down to his level.  I do not think that is a thing that is fair in ordinary commercial dealing, but really these are the powers which the section gives him.  I think the fact that there is such a provision, or that there is that possibility, is going to sap confidence to a very great extent. Although we are told that there is a large number of applications for milling licences, I should say that the first time this provision is put into operation it will create very considerable alarm.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that <Col N="784" /> only if Senator Bagwell had opposed the whole scheme of this Bill, would he be consistent in proposing the deletion of this section, because it strikes me that this is a kind of reserved power which the Minister intends to have if private owners of flour mills decide by a combination or conspiracy to destroy the scheme of the Bill.  I am not going to enter into any controversy with the Senator on the merits of State ownership of any industry, but I think it is rather unwise to raise questions of the relative merits of State ownership of industry as against private ownership, at the present time, when we are witnessing the collapse of so many private industries with enormous losses, owning to inefficient management and bad control of the finances of these many great undertakings.  As I understand this particular part of the Bill and the Bill itself, it is really intended to provide for the country what the privately owned milling industry has failed to provide.  The potential flour mills and maize mills that are in question are to be established instead of mills which the private owners have ceased to work.  The whole scheme of the Bill, if the Minister had not reserved powers to step in, could be destroyed by the simple expedient of keeping mills out of operation.  Another aspect of it, as I understand the scheme, is that, in the design of the Minister, mills may be erected up and down the country for the purpose of local milling, which would not be erected in the ordinary course by mill-owners who would prefer to work port mills.  In case there is obduracy, the Minister is taking power to step in and to do the work which the private owners refuse to do, having regard to the public interest and not merely the shareholders' interest.  That has been the issue raised here on many occasions, whether the public interest is to be superior to that of the shareholders. If Senator Bagwell is opposed to the whole scheme of flour milling and the growing of wheat, encouraged by legislative action, then he is consistent in voting against this part of the Bill, but any Senator who thinks that the scheme is in general desirable, <Col N="785" /> must agree that this part of the scheme is essential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Johnson forgot one thing in his remarks.  He referred to private companies which he says have failed.  He is quite right in that, but it was the money of private individuals that was lost in these industries and not the money of the State.  It is the loss of money to the State which Senator Bagwell dealt with.  He dealt with the question of whether the State was going to lose money because the Government entered on this business. It is the money of citizens we have in mind here, not the money of private shareholders invested in big companies which have gone smash.  I think that every individual who has studied these matters will agree with Senator Bagwell that even under municipal management, not to speak of management of industries by the Executive Council, the work has not been successful to any great extent as compared with private enterprise.  There would be grave risk, if these powers were exercised, of the money of the State being lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson states that the money may be used in places where the Ministry wish to have mills started, and that if they cannot get people to carry on these mills economically in these parts of the country, they would proceed to put this part of the Act into force.  I carefully read the Minister's remarks on the Second Reading and I do not think he went to the length of stating what Senator Johnson stated here to-night.  He stated that it was only in case of national necessity or in some such state of affairs that these powers would be exercised.  He stated, I gathered, that he did not like this part of the Bill himself.  As far as I was able to judge in reading what he said, he knew the dangers of the thing.  I would suggest that if such a national necessity arose, and if these powers were required, they should form part of a separate Bill brought before the House by the Minister, with the case stated as to why he wanted these powers.  It is a pity <Col N="786" /> that they should be put in at the end of a Bill here to meet difficulties that might never arise.  I think he said himself that these difficulties did not exist at the present time.  We are told that there are millers in a surplus quantity at the present time who are thirsting for licences.  We are informed that the Free State is over-milled rather than under-milled, so that there is no possible need for this part of the Bill at the moment, and the Minister is taking powers to provide for a contingency which may never arise.  Where there is a huge question of State management of business I think it should be dealt with in a separate measure, with cause definitely stated as to the necessity for these powers, and not at the end of a Bill which we are passing with a few recommendations, but about which there has been no trouble in the House at all.  This is a different thing.  It establishes the precedent of State trading for a reason which has not been adequately argued before the House and, therefore, I wish to support Senator Bagwell's amendment. We know that under existing circumstances it can only be a recommendation, but I do think that it is one that members of the Dáil and the the Seanad should very seriously consider&mdash;whether, by passing this, they should abandon their power of considering the situation in which they could agree to giving the Minister power to carry on that business. Definite stating of a reason, and the House agreeing with the Minister and giving him the powers&mdash;those are the only conditions on which this power ought to be given and until that situation arises and until that is the way it is put before the Parliament, I do not believe that it should be tacked on to a Bill of this kind and passed in this way.</P>

      <P>I suggest that it is absolutely essential to the carrying out of the purposes of this Bill that the Minister should have these powers reserved to him.  To my mind, the powers do not go quite so far as they ought to go and I believe it would be much better if the Minister had the <Col N="787" /> power, not alone to produce the flour, but to bake it as well, and then we might, perhaps, be able to get bread in Dublin at something like a reasonable price.  At present, if a person getting relief, unemployment benefit, home help or assistance in any shape from a public authority is in a position to buy three four-pound loaves of broad in a day for his family, they cost in Belfast about 5¼d., while in Dublin they cost 1/0¾d., so that the housewife could have a pound of bacon as well in Belfast for the price of the three loaves in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Senator Bagwell speaks a good deal about State control and State running of industries.  I wonder what explanation could Senator Bagwell give of the fact that, when Great Britain was faced with the most dire consequences during the Great War, the railway industry of England was taken over and run by the State, if private enterprise was so much more successful than State control.</P>

      <P>To come nearer home, what sort of spectacle have we in this country in respect of the privately managed railways?  We have, for the last five or six years, accounts regularly about the railways being run at a loss and being subjected to unfair competition.  A man in a very small way of business, with only a few hundred pounds, could buy buses and run services, bring people from their doors to the shops, from the heart of the city into the heart of the country and create passenger and supply services in places where there never was a service.  I have in mind the County Meath, where I lived the greater portion of my life.  You could not get from Navan to Dublin on a Sunday although there were two railways serving the district, but now, since buses came along and because you had a few men who had got a little compensation for their services during the war who could buy buses, there are ten or twelve buses running from Dublin.</P>

In the last analysis, he cannot afford to subject the ordinary people of this country to starvation, if it is decided by the mill owners that a monopoly is going to be created here in respect of milling our own flour and the people should not be left in the hands of any group of individuals who could say: &ldquo;We will starve this State or get whatever prices or conditions we want for manufacturing this flour.&rdquo;  It is right and proper that the Minister should have power to take over these factories, if necessary, and as I said before, my only regret is that he has not asked for greater power, but of course, it is not too late yet. Once we have the flour made in the mills it is only another step to take over the bakeries, bake the bread, and sell it at a price at which the people can buy it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support Senator Bagwell.  I do not think there is any necessity to give the Minister power to embark on milling.  Private enterprise is quite capable of doing all the milling that is required.  We are told that the Minister has had any amount of applications from people <Col N="790" /> anxious to start mills and there is no reason to think that there will be a scarcity of mills.  If there is to be a profit made out of the business, there will be plenty of millers prepared to equip or build mills and produce the meal and flour required.  It is no analogy to say that because England thought it necessary to take over railways or equip munition factories during the war there is every reason here why the Minister should start flour mills.  There is no comparison there at all.  Of course we have an economic war in progress, but that is not the type of war that England was engaged in.  If there is a war in this country the Minister will have sufficiently drastic powers in the matter of feeding the people.</P>
      <P>There is no necessity to give the Minister the powers that have been referred to in the course of this discussion. I am entirely in favour of the Bill in so far as it tends to increase tillage.  If we have more oats, barley, potatoes, etc., the country will benefit. There is no necessity at all for this part of the Bill.  If the millers act in a way that is not considered proper it will be very easy for the Minister to allow foreign flour to be imported and in that way he can bring sufficient pressure on the millers.  If the millers do not conform with the Minister's requirements he has ample power at his disposal to bring them to their senses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great and sincere difficulty in deciding what I shall do in relation to this amendment. I disapprove altogether, and have always done so, of State interference with industry.  On the other hand, there are occasions upon which the State has to intervene.  Senator O'Duffy has told us about the taking over of railways and other works in the country.  They were taken over by the State in a time of war.  Of course, in such times that becomes absolutely necessary, but we are not at present experiencing anything like those times and I cannot say that there is any reason given&mdash;perhaps the Minister may be able to give one&mdash;why it is necessary to take powers under this <Col N="791" /> Bill to absorb all the milling industries in the country.  They may be absorbed gradually or in bulk.  Sometimes the State comes in and takes over industries.  Such a course has been found necessary in time of war or on very exceptional occasions.</P>
      <P>If it turned out to be absolutely necessary here&mdash;I very much doubt it and I cannot visualise any circumstances under which it would be necessary for the State to take over the mills&mdash;then I would be in agreement in regard to the part of the Bill now under discussion.  I certainly do agree with what Senator Jameson has suggested, and that is that this part of the Bill should be postponed until some occasion arose under which it was really necessary for the State to take over the work of flour production and other matters connected with the cereal development of the country. As Senator Jameson said, the Bill without this would be complete in itself.  It is introducing an unusual state of affairs into a piece of legislation which is purely domestic, which deals with an industry of the country. It is unnecessary, so far as I can see, that any part of the Bill should be devoted to industrialising this particular business by the State.  If the Minister can assure me personally&mdash;it is rather a personal matter, as I do feel a difficulty about it&mdash;that there is a national necessity, I will vote against the amendment.  If he cannot assure me that there is really a national necessity for such a drastic provision, I will vote in favour of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With all respect to you, sir, and to Senators Bagwell, The McGillycuddy and O'Duffy, this part of the Bill has nothing whatever to do with nationalisation.  It neither permits nor facilitates the nationalisation of the flour-milling industry.  I think Senator Bagwell was completely in error when he tried to suggest that the design behind this part of the Bill is to achieve the nationalisation of flour milling by a backstairs method. I think members of this House have sufficient acquaintance with the Government to know that if we did <Col N="792" /> intend to nationalise the flour-milling industry, we would not hesitate to produce a Bill which would be avowedly a Nationalisation Bill.  That is not what is here.  The only mill that can be acquired by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Agriculture is a mill that is not working.  A mill in respect of which a licence has been issued, and which is in production, cannot be acquired.  It is not possible for me to walk into the Dublin Port Mill, for example, order the manager out and put a clerical officer from my Department in his place and tell him to carry on.  If a mill is not in production and it is considered necessary in the national interest that that mill should be brought into production&mdash;if the owners refuse to bring it into production&mdash;then there is power to acquire it at a price to be fixed by agreement or, failing that, by an arbitrator.</P>
      <P>We are asked what is the necessity for this provision.  Senator Bagwell talked about first principles.  There is nothing in what he said after that which bore any relation to first principles. He dealt with the possibility of the Minister not being a trained miller, being too old to be effective, or being too incompetent to be successful. He talked about the possibility of a monetary loss and the probability of the Minister acting with glorious irresponsibility, cutting prices and generally causing havoc in the industry if he became an owner.  These are not first principles.  The only first principles involved are whether the State has the right to interfere with private enterprise when private enterprise is abused and public hardship is being occasioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This part of the Bill would not have appeared were it not for the fact that the millers bluffed one little bit too much.  When we announced our proposals to deal with the flour-milling industry, the millers rushed into print saying they were not pleased with the proposal, that they were much better off if they were left alone, and that they could not co-operate with the Government.  Events have since shown that the flour millers were only raising, as a poker player would say, <Col N="793" /> the ant.  We had to face the possibility of the Bill being passed and the flour millers refusing to operate their mills.  Were we to allow these mills to become derelict, or were we to take powers to permit in such circumstances the State acquiring the mills, if necessary operating them, but preferably disposing of them to people prepared to operate them?</P>
    <P>I admit that the danger has been considerably diminished.  There are not many flour millers nowadays who will say that the Bill has disimproved their position or that they are not prepared to co-operate in putting it into effect.  I do not anticipate circumstances will ever arise under which the powers conferred by this part of the Act will ever have to be exercised. To some extent, also, it is a dud shell, such as Senator O'Duffy talked about, because just as a shell cannot be exploded without a detonator, the Minister cannot acquire a mill without the money.  He cannot get the money until he goes to the Dáil and secures a Vote for the necessary amount.  In fact, the powers under this part of the Bill cannot be exercised by the Minister without a further appeal to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to have a legal right to acquire a certain class of property. It is another thing to have the wherewithal with which to do it.  The amount required cannot be provided except by the Vote of the Dáil.  Circumstances might easily arise in which it would be necessary in the national interests for the Minister to have this power of acquisition.  I cannot foresee them arising at present.  But we may find when the Bill has been passed and the various sections brought into operation that the circumstances that we had envisaged when drafting the Bill may have arisen.  If we have destroyed the organ that heretofore imported flour and carried on milling operations and if the people of this State are left entirely dependent for their supply of flour by these millers, these millers could by a deliberate policy close down the mills and refuse to operate them.  In such circumstances the licences would be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> I ask the Senators under such circumstances to say that we should have power to acquire those mills and work them so as to insure that an adequate supply of flour would be available for the people of the country.  But the circumstances, as I have said, will never probably arise, but if they should arise the power will be there. At any rate the knowledge that the power is in the Minister for the time being is likely to deter any attempt on the part of any group of people to blackmail the country in the circumstances which we have created and which enabled them to do it by the exercise of the powers conferred here.</P>
    <P>We are in fact giving to the flour millers a monopoly in the marketing of flour on the condition that they undertake to mill and sell in the country a certain minimum quantity of flour per year.  If they fail to do it, they lose their rights under the Bill.  They lose the protection which the Bill confers upon them.  There is an obligation on the State to provide or substitute in that event in order to ensure a continuity in the supply of flour.  If for a moment we consider that a supply of flour would not be available from outside, or, as was the case during certain periods of the world's history, supplies could not be obtained at all from outside, if there were a transport strike or a shipping strike or any international circumstance which made it impossible for us to get a supply of flour from abroad would the Government in these circumstances tolerate the continuance of conditions in which mills equipped to produce flour were standing idle? Would the Seanad say that in these circumstances the State should have power to acquire these mills?</P>
    <P>I may tell the Seanad that the power conferred here will never be exercised except in grave circumstances, and they cannot be exercised until the Dáil is willing to vote the money that will permit of these powers being exercised.  The mills to be acquired must be acquired at an agreed price or at a price fixed by arbitration.  There is power taken to dispose of them.  The only circumstances in which I could possibly see <Col N="795" /> that these powers will be exercised would be where a silent mill was not being brought into production or for some reason which might exist, say, for instance, that the existing owners were unable to bring it into production. In that case the State might acquire the mill and dispose of it to another group to work it.  Even in that eventuality, before the Minister could do that, he would have to acquaint the Dáil to approve of working the mill.  There are in this Bill sufficient safeguards to prevent the use of these powers.  It is eminently desirable that the powers should be there even though the powers are circumscribed in the manner I have indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced by what has been said in criticism of my amendment that this section is necessary for the working of the rest of the Bill or that Part VIII is necessary. May I refer very briefly to some criticisms that the Minister has made on this amendment?  That the millers of this country could combine to defeat the aims of this Bill I suggest is not a thing that is likely to happen.  The millers have too much sense.  Irish private and public interests have been raised in this debate.  Now I have not any particular interest to support here.  I am moving the amendment in what I conceive to be the national interest and not in any particular interest or in the interest of any particular section.  I have got no connection with the milling industry and I hold no brief for the millers by whom I was not consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All politicians desire to pull down successful great men, including successful millers.  I put it to the Seanad that the successful business men are the people who deserve more from their countrymen than anybody else does.  Successful business men are the people who start works and without such men a country is not worth much. The idea put forward here that all this is done to benefit their own pockets is absurd.  They benefit the whole country and they benefit all persons in my opinion.  I take it we are not <Col N="796" /> at war with the millers.  It would be a very bad thing for the country to create a state of war with the millers.</P>
    <P>As regards the Minister's statement on Part VIII of the Bill I cannot really understand what he means by not starting State milling.  If this is not State milling I do not know what State milling is.  This is milling by the State as against private enterprise. For that reason I suggest that this is going to be a waste of public money.  It is creating a very formidable precedent though the Minister is only taking power to do the thing.  It is a thing that is likely to be followed not only in this but in other business and it is a great deterrent to enterprise. People will not go into a thing if they think what is made possible in this Bill is likely to occur.</P>
    <P>One thing is quite clear and that is that the Minister does not want to put this Part of the Bill into operation. I entirely accept that.  He said so before too.  That no doubt is the case but I do not like the powers that are being taken under this Bill in the wholesale manner in which the powers are being taken.  What I propose to do is to withdraw these amendments and the other amendments now and to bring up another amendment providing for a limitation of this Part of the Bill to a state of emergency which would be a somewhat different thing.  Would the Minister say that he would favourably consider that?  If not I shall move the amendment as it stands.</P>

      <P>I should be quite prepared to consider an amendment which would make clear that these powers are only to be used in an emergency, but I should not like to confine myself to a national emergency&mdash;a state of affairs which would apply to every part of the country at the same time.  It is quite clear that the powers would only be used when there was strong justification for their use.  No Minister would care to face the Dáil with a proposal to devote public moneys to a purpose of this kind unless he could make a very strong case for it.  There might be a local emergency, due to local circumstances. Provided it is clear that the decision as to what constitutes an emergency is to be left to the Minister or to the Executive Council, I should have no objection to an amendment of that kind, but I do not see that such an amendment is of very much value as a safeguard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the House at the outset that it is not the intention or expectation that the House will agree to this motion, but, as Senators know, it affords me the only proper constitutional opportunity of raising the very important issues involved in this Order.  The House will remember that, with great difficulty, it persuaded the Government to accept, or forced on the Government, an amendment which finds expression in this Order. It was an amendment to the effect <Col N="799" /> that the Minister must by Order state the grounds to which he will have regard in the issue of licences.  In fact, I would suggest that these reasons strike at the root of the whole measure.  You have now the reasons stated in this Order and I suggest that they must occasion very considerable alarm.  They fall under a number of heads.  The first head to which the Minister has regard is whether the requirements in connection with new manufacture licences are already met or likely to be met by existing concerns. Picture yourself a Minister met with a problem of that kind&mdash; having to say to a person coming in here with, perhaps, a scientific process capable of unforeseen development, involving matters, perhaps, which deal with a new invention.  No Minister could posibly say that the requirements as to those proposed processes are likely to be met or are met by existing concerns.  That regulation can have only one effect&mdash;the effect of limiting enterprise and the mere revelation of such an outlook will deter people from seeking to establish business in this country.  I heard it stated once of a man that he was so clever he could unscrew the inscrutable.  That might apply to any Minister who would attempt, except in the very simplest of cases, to determine an issue of that kind.  It displays an utter ignorance of the unforeseen forces that operate in business. The whole essence of enterprise is the things that you cannot see or cannot weigh.  If all the cards are on the table would not everything be so simple?  It is the unforeseen things which are always there, the new things which suddenly arise, and which cannot be foreseen, that justify the free play and flexibility of private enterprise, and that are the driving force behind initiative and spontaneous endeavour.</P>
    <P>Then as to popular taste, how can the Minister possibly assess popular taste?  A man comes in to deal in new fashions.  Does the Minister suggest that the present standard of fashion should be stereotyped and is sufficiently and adequately met, and that if a person comes in with new ideas he <Col N="800" /> should be met merely with the attitude that what is already there is good enough and that what our people have amply satisfies for the future the requirements of the consumers?  What about scientific development?  How can the Minister foresee that and in considering an application for a licence gauge the potentialities of scientific development?  It can only mean stereotyping the present conditions on a grand drab basis and destroying all the imaginative qualities which go to make civilisation worth while.  It also involves, if I may say so, the exclusion of brains, because no person with brains is going to come in and submit to the interrogation that a condition of that kind involves.</P>
    <P>The next thing is that the Minister is to have regard to the ownership of capital.  I suggest that what we want is all the capital we can get from anywhere&mdash;from China, Japan or Timbuctoo. What we are suffering from is a lack of capital.  The Minister may know of a recent enterprise to raise capital in this country for a clothing company by private subscription.  He probably knows that the people of this country were not too ready, in spite of the economic outlook, to come to the assistance of the new enterprise. What we want is people of enterprise to come in and fertilise industry, increase the consuming power, and make things cheaper and more abundant. That is the basis of all progress. This attitude of having regard to the ownership of capital is reactionary in the extreme.</P>
    <P>Then we have the next thing: the ability or resources of the applicant. Perhaps the Minister may remember the case of Lever Brothers.  The first founder of that industry started in a small shop.  Who could then possibly foretell what that was going to develop into?  Who could gauge the abilities or the resources of that pioneer?  In the same way, a person will come along with very little to show.  He has got brains and enterprise&mdash;things no Minister or anyone else can assess&mdash;yet he is to be examined on that basis.  There again, I suggest, the whole attitude is utterly reactionary and against the free play of enterprise, which we all <Col N="801" /> want and which is the only basis on which a country and its civilisation can prosper.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister is to have regard to the locality of the works.  That again is an intolerable condition to impose on anyone who knows better than any Minister can know.  A person of enterprise comes along and he has to put the works where, in his opinion, he can do best.  Why should he be limited except by the limitation implied in town planning and conditions of that kind?  It is his own money and he is prepared to risk it.  Why should he not be allowed to go where the law allows and not where the Minister in his wisdom suggests he should go?</P>
    <P>Then again the Minister is to have regard to the amount of local employment that is likely to be afforded. Throughout all this, the person who seems to be disregarded is the consumer. The national employer is purported to be protected under the measure and the worker is purported to be protected, but the poor consumers, who are far more numerous, seem to be entirely neglected.  If a person comes in with a modern process that demands little labour, why should he be debarred?  Presumably, the effect of a process largely mechanical, is that the goods will be produced more cheaply.  Should not that be the object of all enterprise and efficiency? I am reminded in this respect of a resolution that the Waterford County Council, I think, tried to pass, in which they called upon the county surveyor to do all the work without machinery.  The county surveyor suggested that the farmers should do all their work with spades.  We are to try to regulate and stop the march of progress.  That is an attitude, no doubt well meant in the interest of labour, which must in the long run destroy enterprise and react on the consumer.</P>
    <P>Then the origin of the plant and equipment is another question.  A man of enterprise who wants to come in is not going to be limited or affected by the origin of his plant.  He may require highly technical machinery. He has to get it where he can and should be allowed to get it where he <Col N="802" /> can and not be debarred, if he wishes to come in for the good of the country, and incidentally for his own gain. Anyone who comes in here to spend money is also for the good of the country.</P>
    <P>As if all these conditions were not enough, the Minister must have regard to the general economic conditions of the country.  Lest he left any loophole by which he might not be able to refuse a licence or tie up the licensee sufficiently, he must have regard to the general economic conditions of the country.  The Minister for Agriculture not long ago was making sport of Senator Counihan's amendment in which he had a lot about general conditions or otherwise.  I consider the Minister is open to that charge here. Where he has not specific power, he is taking general power.</P>
    <P>I raise this question on broad lines and as a warning of the tendencies in Government circles towards enterprise. It is because it is so serious that I have raised it.  People who have brains and energy may want to make money. Undoubtedly nobody is going into business except to make money.  They are not going in for the good of other people.  That is an attitude that I find voiced in certain quarters, that people are going into business for the good of the community.  That is only incidental. They are risking their money for their own good and for profit and you cannot get away from that.  I would strongly advise the Minister, when people come along with mealy-mouthed talk of patriotism and doing things for the good of the people, that he should be very suspicious of them. Charity begins at home, and what is left over after they have their share will be for the good of the people. The more people you can get to risk their money the better.  Capital may be lost.  That is the way it is always. All the amenities of life, such as wireless and cinemas, have all been the result of enterprise and money risked, and a large amount of employment given in the process.</P>
    <P>I raise this point and I think it is very serious because if these licences are going to be given or withheld in the spirit that this Order implies, it <Col N="803" /> will be a very serious day for the country.  The country will go back to a low, drab level of existence, deprived of progress and of all stimulus to enterprise.  For that reason I ask the House at least to give an opportunity to the Minister to make his case in favour of this Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I would like to refer to an industry which has been of enormous benefit to the country.  Where would that industry be if it were dependent on the capital raised at home?  I refer to the sugar beet industry.  Capital to the extent of half a million pounds was required.  The sum of £10,000 was, I think, the very most that could be raised in Ireland for the starting of it. If the present Government were in power at the time the industry was started, well there can hardly be any doubt that it would never have been established here.  As a matter of fact it required all the ingenuity of the ex-Minister for Agriculture to induce a foreign capitalist to put his money into the industry.  Instead of hindering him everything possible had to be done to assure him that the industry would be a success.  If that assurance had not been given then, the foreign capital that was used to start that industry would never have come into the country.  We were told, of course, on one occasion here that that particular industry was only a white elephant.  I am glad that Senator Sir John Keane has moved this motion and I hope the House will support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad Senator Sir John Keane opened his speech by saying that he did not expect that his motion would be carried.  I am sure he hopes that it will not be carried, and I am confident that he will not press it to a division.  The seconder of the motion has given us as an example the sugar beet factory.  Surely it was established with the concurrence of the Minister for the time being.  I am thoroughly in favour of these regulations. When I saw Senator Sir John Keane's motion on the Order Paper I thought he had completely changed his attitude and was going to become a <Col N="804" /> downright obstructionist, because his motion is that all the regulations, not merely one, shall be annulled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no alternative. I was not able to do it piecemeal. The procedure only allows one to do it in globo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>But the statute only allows one regulation to be annulled at a time.  I take it now that the Senator only wants to express again what he has frequently so eloquently expressed in this House, his desire for a high and very advanced degree of civilisation.  That being so, it rests upon us to defend these regulations which have been framed by the Minister under the Act of Parliament.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the object of the Act of Parliament is to secure that the brains and ability of the Irish people should be seconded by the knowledge and experience which Senator Sir John Keane says can be got from abroad. We want to create such a condition of things as will give our own brainy people the knowledge and experience in arts, crafts and manufactures which the Senator so much desires.  That is one of the objects of the Act which was passed by this House and of the regulations framed in accordance with it and, if I may say so, strictly in accordance with the Act.  The regulations do not go in any single respect beyond the powers conferred by the Act of Parliament.  Another object was to secure that in any industries established in this country the capital or a great part of the capital&mdash;the majority of the shares&mdash;should be held in Irish hands.  Well, now is that wrong?  If it is it has been adopted in almost every civilised country in the world except Great Britain which commands the trade and commerce of the world, and still commands the seas of the world.  Senator Sir John Keane will not deny that.  It is adopted certainly in every country where industry and manufactures are in a backward condition.  I think it is a good thing and that it is certainly worth trying. I would very much like to have not the opposition of Senator Sir John Keane but his support for a trial of that principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> The Senator objects only to certain portions of these regulations.  The first portion of the regulations that he objects to is that the Minister, when an application is made to him for the setting up of a business to carry out a certain process, should have some control of the operations of the foreigner coming in here to conduct that process.  What does the Minister ask?  Just this: that he should consider this question:</P>
    <P>The extent to which the existing and probable future requirements of the public in Saorstát Eireann in respect of the process sought to be authorised by the licence are sufficiently met by business lawfully established in Saorstát Eireann at the date of the application for the licence or will probably be sufficiently met by businesses which may be established in Saorstát Eireann after such date by persons entitled to perform such processes without a licence under the Act.</P>
    <P>The argument that I intend to use will, I hope, meet with the approval of Senator Sir John Keane.  The Senator is always reasonable although this motion of his did not seem to me to be reasonable.  Now it may be that, in regard to a certain process of manufacture, a man in a small way of business and with small capital would be quite competent to conduct that process in this country, yet a combine with their agents and with people giving them information might come along for the purpose of destroying that native industry.  They might come along and say: &ldquo;We want a licence to conduct that process in the Free State and we will produce the article much cheaper.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for a while they might produce the article much cheaper than it could be produced by a small factory in this country, but when the small factory was crushed out, as happens frequently in the case of the operations of these combines, then the price of the commodity resulting from that process could be increased and increased to such an extent that the real civilisation of this <Col N="806" /> country would suffer because we would not be able to afford to pay for the article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator give instances where combines have acted in that way?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House giving examples of all the cases in which combines have come in and sold below cost price for a while so that they could sell at more than cost price and at more than a fair price when they had destroyed small industries.  My friend Senator Johnson, who knows these things much better than I do, has given me, just on the tip of his tongue, one example. What about the Wexford shipping? That is not exactly a process.  It is more than a process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am being drawn out of order by Senator Miss Browne.  Well, I will not deal with that part of the question further.  I say that if there is a person in this country who is making arrangements for the carrying out of a process of manufacture and if the Minister considers that there is a reasonable chance that he will be able to carry out that process, the Minister at least should have discretion to decide that question.</P>
      <P>The next matter is this.  Senator Sir John Keane takes exception to the second clause here, which says:</P>
      <P>In the event of the business in the course or as part of which it is proposed that the process sought to be authorised by the licence shall be performed being owned by two or more individuals,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the Minister is entitled to consider the extent to which the capital invested in such business is in the <Col N="807" /> beneficial ownership of nationals of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>Is not that perfectly right and reasonable&mdash;that the capital employed in a certain process should be in the beneficial ownership of nationals of Saorsát Eireann?  Surely, if the Minister so thinks fit, it should be held by people who live within the jurisdiction of Saorstát Eireann.  Otherwise, you may throw the ports of this country wide to the world, to the enterprise of the world, and to the combines of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane says that is right.  I do not think it is right.  I think, if the sentiment expressed by the Senator was the sentiment of the majority of the people of this country, it would be quite impossible for us to rise above the condition of simply herding the cattle that eat the grass that grows in this country.  If Senator Sir John Keane is satisfied with that, of course he is welcome to his opinion.  But I do not believe that he is satisfied with that except for the purposes of argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>With the want of experience and with the want of knowledge of manufacturing processes from which we suffer.  Nobody knows better than Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Bagwell and others on the opposite benches that manufacturing skill is first of all acquired and secondly is hereditary.  Why is it that certain manufacturers are localised in certain parts of England?  Why is the steel industry centralised around Sheffield, the woollen industry in Yorkshire, and other industries in certain other districts in England? The reason is that not only have the <Col N="808" /> people great natural ability and great acquired skill, but they also have hereditary skill in these matters.  We must acquire skill in manufactures. Until we acquire that skill we will not be able to face world competition. Will we ever be able to face it?  The answer is whether in certain industries we will have sufficient output to enable us to instal the proper machinery which will enable us to acquire the necessary skill.  I think we are perfectly right in securing that, so far as certain industries are concerned, the Minister whom we trust should have a discretion as to whether the capital employed in that industry should be in the main Irish capital or not.</P>
      <P>That is the third objection made by Senator Sir John Keane.  He objects to giving the Minister authority to determine the locality of the works. Will Senator Sir John Keane contend that there should not be some regulation as to the locality in which particular industries are carried on? Would he like to have a tannery in his demesne?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of town planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not speaking of town planning.  The point is whether the Minister is to have authority to determine, in some degree, the locality in which an industry ought to be carried on.  I think that he should have such authority for the strongest reason. It is desirable in the development of this State, and in what I might call the reconstruction of this country, that certain industries should be located in the West of Ireland, in which part of the country I have a particular interest.  Certainly the locality is a matter of the greatest concern.  I for one would be altogether opposed to having all the industries congregated around the City of Dublin, and I think it is a perfectly wise and reasonable precaution for the Minister to take, that, in the event of a new process being carried out, say, in regard to iron or steel, he should be entitled to say: &ldquo;We have iron ore here&mdash;the best in the world perhaps.  We have iron ore in the West of Ireland.  If you <Col N="809" /> want to manufacture iron articles, well then you must go to the West.  You must go to the banks of the River Shannon or to Arigna or to some place like that.  You cannot set up your works here at the North Wall or at the South Wall.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane could tell you about setting them up in Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I did not know there was very much iron ore in Wexford. I should be very glad to see them in Wexford because I know that very nice people come from Wexford. The next objection by Senator Sir John Keane is this: he objected to the fact that the Minister should have a discretion to consider the question of &ldquo;the extent to which the grant of the licence is calculated to promote employment in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; That is in clause (v).  I think that is opposition gone mad.  Surely, it is a matter of the gravest concern to consider the question of employment in this country.  Why should he not be anxious to have greater employment in this country?  And then again, the next clause to which there is objection is:</P>
      <P>The extent to which the materials for the construction of the works, the plant and equipment and apparatus of the works, the raw materials and articles used for the performance of the process sought to be authorised by the licence will be produced or made in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>Well, if I were a Minister I should like to have the power to consider that question, and I would promise Senator Sir John Keane that I would exercise that power to the fullest extent.</P>

      <P>Get what to come&mdash; the materials?  I hope Senator Sir John Keane will not interrupt me.  I am talking now of whether the materials can be supplied in Saorstát Eireann.  Surely, if they can, the Minister should have power to say to <Col N="810" /> the gentlemen with brains and genius, as Senator Sir John Keane thinks&mdash; surely, the Minister should be entitled to say: &ldquo;Now, you know of this process, of course, but we have the materials here and we want to know will you use these materials.&rdquo;  But Senator Sir John Keane will not have that.  He would not ask that of the adventurer&mdash;I am not using the word &ldquo;adventurer&rdquo; in an invidious sense&mdash; but that man coming in here is not to be asked any questions, according to Senator Sir John Keane.  He is not to be asked for his papers.</P>
      <P>The next matter to which Senator Sir John Keane objects is this:</P>
      <P>The effect of the grant of the licence on the general economic interests of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane will not allow the Minister to consider the effect of the grant of the licence on the general economic interests of Saorstát Eireann. Does he propose to give the Ministry any power at all?  Does he propose that Ministers should hold their hands, and whenever a foreigner comes, saying he has clear knowledge and ability and great genius they are to welcome him with open arms and not to consider the economic and financial interests of their own country?  As I said at the beginning I am very glad Senator Sir John Keane, who is always reasonable, said that he really hoped this resolution would not pass.  But he really wanted to make a speech and, if I may say so, it was a very good speech.  We have heard it in various forms, expressed in different ways but it is the same idea.  I dissent from Senator Sir John Keane in this.  I do not agree with him that all civilisation, all virtue and all accomplishments come from abroad.  I think we are capable in this little country of ours of developing a good many of the social virtues.  We have done so in the past and, if we get an opportunity of developing within reasonable lines, and in harmony with each other&mdash;I do not say that a controversy like this for one moment disturbs that harmony&mdash;we will be able to develop our powers rapidly and to the full extent.  I thoroughly approve of the regulations and I thoroughly approve of the Bill by <Col N="811" /> which they were authorised.  I hope Senator Sir John Keane will not press his amendment.</P>

      <P>When Senator Sir John Keane was moving this resolution he said that he did so for the purpose of giving me an opportunity of making a statement in justification of the regulations I have laid down.  Having heard his speech, however, I am not quite clear what kind of statement he wants me to make.  His speech, if I may say so, was directed against the spirit of the Act, and not rather to the regulations. As far as the Act is concerned I have only one thing to say.  Within a very short time we had a general election and at the period of a general election the leaders of political parties expose their hearts to the public.  The associated manufacturers of this State wanted to have a look at the hearts of the leaders of the various parties with regard to measures of this kind. They went to the leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party, and of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, in particular, and asked them if they would give an undertaking that if returned to office the Control of Manufactures Act would be operated and utilised in order to achieve the aims behind the introduction of the Act.  They got that undertaking from the leaders of both Parties, and the acknowledgment that the Act was necessary in the national interests.  An assurance was given them that, when the election was over, no matter what Party came back to power, the Act was going to remain on the Statute Book and was going to be operated.  The rapid conversion of those who had opposed the passage of the Act in the Dáil and Seanad was in itself a remarkable tribute to the wisdom of those who framed the measure in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the regulations.  The first one requires us to have regard to the extent to which the class of goods which foreign firms apply for licences to make are being supplied, or are likely to be supplied, by firms entitled to manufacture them without a licence. In relation to that particular regulation <Col N="812" /> the Senator expressed the opinion that national damage was going to be done because of the fact that I was not a prophet.  He asked how was it possible for a Minister to foresee future developments. I do not think it is necessary that we should foresee future developments, but present developments and conditions.  If a foreign manufacturer comes to me and says: &ldquo;I have not got at the moment any new process or any new invention but, if I am allowed into your country it is not at all unlikely that I will invent some new device which will result in the reorganisation of all the industries in the world.&rdquo;  In these circumstances I should be entitled to ask him for his credentials, and if he could not produce credentials, I should, at least, be entitled to say: &ldquo;You are not getting a licence on the strength of the statements you make.  We are only interested in what you are doing at present.&rdquo;  If they can do something which will be a benefit to us, which will add to our industrial equipment and organisation, and increase the possibility of producing wealth, they will not be refused licences.  But if they are to enter into competition here, which was only going to mean that internal competition was going to be intensified, that no increase in productivity could result, and that, at the worst the business would be transferred to some other manufacturer, then I think we should refuse the licence.</P>
    <P>The Senator asked if present fashions were to be standardised.  I do not think it is necessary to get in foreign manufactures in order to ensure development in fashions or in anything else.  If the women of this country want to wear trousers, as the women of America are reported to be doing, I am quite sure there are Irish manufacturers capable of producing them. If the demand is there it will be met by quite a large number of firms now existing.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Browne tried to make capital with regard to the sugar beet factory.  No argument can be based upon that.  She stated that in 1924 the Minister for Agriculture achieved something great when he induced a <Col N="813" /> foreign firm to come in and establish a beet sugar factory here.  I would like to advise Senator Miss Browne to take Senator Sir John Keane's advice, to reverse it and then to apply it.  Foreign manufacturers do not come here because they love us.  They do not come here for any other purpose except to make profit.  In fact, the particular foreign firm associated with the Carlow factory was guaranteed conditions which enabled them to realise a profit 48 per cent. per annum on their capital.  That was a very strong inducement. Anyone could get foreigners to come here by offering a subsidy which is in excess of the total amount realised to date by the British tariffs on Irish exports of all kinds.  An inducement of that kind no doubt would get any manufacturers in the world to come in.  That has nothing to do with this question, because there are certain industries in respect of which it is undoubtedly correct to say that we will have to avail of foreign technical advice.  In relation to such industries it is not at all unlikely that we will not merely permit foreigners to establish themselves here, but actually invite them to do so.</P>
    <P>With regard to beet sugar I hope we will be able to submit proposals to the Dáil and Seanad before very long, and when they are submitted it will be possible to see whether or not another line of action than that taken in 1924 would not have achieved the same result at a much lower cost.</P>
    <P>The next regulation relates to capital.  Senator Sir John Keane said this was a deterrent to the industrial development of the country, and excluded brains.  The Senator said that no foreign firm would ever submit to the intolerable conditions imposed upon it.  The most effective answer to that is that we have, to-day, 157 applications from foreign industrial firms for licences to establish factories in this country.  Twenty-seven of these applications have been submitted in the prescribed manner and, perhaps, with one or two exceptions, they are likely to be granted; the others are under examination in my Department. <Col N="814" /> When I look over the list of names, and remember what the Senator said, I wonder if it is true that these people have no brains.  Some of them are from very eminent firms with names that are world famous.  They certainly succeeded in making money and, if that is an indication of ability, they have ability.  Senator Sir John Keane says no one with brains would ever attempt to apply for a licence having regard to these regulations.  I suppose I must consider that these people have no brains, and that we would be better off without them.  Perhaps I shall have to reconsider the applications we have had in the light of the Senator's statement.</P>
    <P>We have here another regulation that requires that we should consider &ldquo;the ability and resources of the applicant for the licence to perform efficiently the process sought to be authorised by the licence.&rdquo;  The Senator talked of the origin of Lever Brothers.  He referred to a young man with brains and no money who might become the leader of a great industrial organisation which might spring up under his guidance if he got a chance.  Is there any harm in suggesting to these young men with brains and no money that they should try their ability in their own country first&mdash;that they should try them on the dog rather than upon us.  If there arrives at Dun Laoghaire, or at Cobh, young men with plenty of brains and no money they are the type about which we have to notify the Civic Guard, who, very often, notify them to get out of the country as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Senator next referred to a regulation which dealt with &ldquo;the extent to which the granting of a licence is calculated to promote employment in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; He did not object to that, but he argued, I think, that employment would be available in any case, and that it did not much matter, in the long run, whether the industry was established by an Irish or a foreign company as the effect upon work would be the same.  To some extent that is true, but only to some extent. If it is possible under the law, for a <Col N="815" /> highly organised, highly capitalised and long established industrial organisation to establish itself here, to the detriment of those who are here already in a small way, endeavouring to build up their business, there is a feeling of insecurity which will prevent development in that home industry.  During the last ten years industrial development was delayed here, far more by the absence of legislation of this kind, than by the absence of tariffs, because those who could invest money in Irish industry felt that no return for their money was possible.  They felt that when they were making a successful impression upon the market in Great Britain and elsewhere they would lose that market again by prices being cut and other methods, and that they were being driven out of their markets and deprived of the benefit of their investments.  It was that feeling of insecurity that delayed the development end in this country, and it is to remove that feeling of insecurity that we have brought in these regulations.  Although it is technically correct, from the employment point of view, that it does not matter in the least whether an industry is established here by Irish or foreign owners, yet, in fact, without protection of this kind we might not get any Irish-owned, or foreign-owned firms, because if we took the line that either would do we would get neither.</P>
    <P>The Senator then spoke, in general terms, about this legislation being designed to stop the march of progress, to exclude from this country technical development in industry that may develop elsewhere, and to keep Irish industry inefficient, out of date and behind developments abroad.  I do not think that that is so at all, but, in certain circumstances, we might deliberately decide to use the powers given us to do that.  I think it is without doubt that nine-tenths of the ills the world is suffering from to-day, arises from the fact that technological development has been many times more rapid than the development in social organisation.  It is because men can <Col N="816" /> invent machinery for production of goods much more efficiently than they can improve the methods of social organisation, that in their view what they advert to as new and cheaper production would cause social good instead of social evil.  There are two ways in which you can stop that; by slowing down on speed and speeding up on social developments.  I submit it is impossible with our present methods of Government, and other matters, to speed up the development of social organisation rapidly enough to overtake the development in technical matters, and, consequently, it may be, in the long run, the best thing for this country that we should slow down on technical development, that we should see that the man with the old machine is helped, rather than the new man with the new machine.</P>
    <P>In the cigarette manufacturing concerns in this city there are machines capable of producing 1,000 cigarettes per minute.  This rate of progress is guaranteed by the manufacturers of those machines.  These machines are I think of recent invention.  A few years ago these 1,000 cigarettes would be made by hand by male and female workers.  Recently a new machine was put upon the market in the United States capable of producing 2,000 cigarettes per minute.  If the manufacturers in this country decide to instal these machines they can displace one half of the people engaged in that particular branch of the industry.  That is the result of technological development.</P>
    <P>Is it desirable that we should exclude them until we get some social organisation here capable of providing that this invention is not going to occasion so much unemployment, disadvantage, and hardship until we are able to provide for those whose employment will be no longer required because of man's ingenuity in producing this new invention.  Despite the fact that, on the whole, it is incorrect to say that the powers conferred by this Bill are likely to be utilised for excluding technical development of that kind, I say it is right that we should have powers to do that, having regard to the general <Col N="817" /> considerations, having regard to the picture we get in our daily papers as to the effect that similar restriction is producing in other countries much more highly industrialised and wealthy than ours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the discussion closes I would like to say a word in connection with one of the regulations issued by the Minister.  Contrary to Senator Sir John Keane I hold the view that the regulations are such that too many outside competitors or manufacturers are allowed to come in.  However that may be, I would ask the Minister, in relation to the likelihood of industrial potentiality, not to stress that too much, because a good many industries of enormous potentiality give no indication in their earlier stages of their future development.  I shall take one industry which was established in the first instance here, the manufacture of pneumatic rubber tyres.  I am perfectly certain that if we had had a home Government at that time this country would have benefitted and secured practically a monopoly of the manufacture of those tyres.  Take also the manufacture of margarine. The first place in the United Kingdom in which margarine was manufactured was in Ireland.  That industry employs in England to-day 10,000 people. Nobody could envisage when it was first produced here this enormous development.  Accordingly I would ask the Minister, if an industry complies with his other requirements, not to scrutinise too closely this question of development, because nobody can foresee the full future development of some industries.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief in my reply.  I quite appreciate the very fair way in which the Minister made his case.  I think it is a great pleasure to meet him as a controversialist. I do not agree with him. I think our outlooks are fundamentally different but I see his ideal and I hope he will succeed in achieving it.  I only hope, too, that he will not be a sadder and wiser man at the end of some years.  I hope also that if <Col N="818" /> he applies this policy, the people will not be sadder and poorer at the end of a certain period although they may be more national.  I am fully in sympathy with his views on the question of limiting technical processes, but I would remind him that these technical processes were largely brought about by the fear of strike action on the part of the labour unions.  If it had not been for that, I think a great deal more would be done by hand than has been done.  When the Minister is applying his policy in the limitation of technical processes, I hope he will beware of the strike action of labour unions because that may be a very dangerous element.</P>
