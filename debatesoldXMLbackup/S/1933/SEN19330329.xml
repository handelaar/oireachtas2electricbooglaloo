    <Title>Local Government Bill, 1933&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. S.T. O'Kelly) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. S.T. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary object of this Bill is to put an end to the discrimination which the enactment of Section 71 of the Local Government Act, 1925, enabled the Government and certain local authorities to enforce, in recent years, for the purpose of preventing persons holding Republican political opinions securing employment to which they were justly entitled.  It also empowers local authorities to employ persons, who, though fully qualified and properly elected to posts in the gift of certain local authorities, were denied such employment because of an objection to subscribe to the declaration prescribed by the Local Government Act of 1925.  It will enable local authorities to pay to officers in their service remuneration and increments of salary, sanction to the payment of which was denied by my Department since 1925 because of the failure of certain officers to subscribe to the declaration or test referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House, and the public, are <Col N="882" /> already aware that the Government disapprove of political tests and have undertaken to remove them.  In order to fulfil the Government's undertaking to abolish all political tests, it remains for them to end the test imposed upon officers of local authorities. As far as I am aware, the only statutory example of penalisation of local officers for political reasons is that provided in Section 71 of the Local Government Act, 1925, which relates to the declaration required to be taken by such officers on appointment or on obtaining an increase of remuneration.  We are of opinion that the enforcement of a political test, declaration or oath, will not procure from civil servants or officers of local authorities more loyal or more efficient service.  There are obvious and effective measures for dealing with officers who do not perform conscientiously the duties assigned to them. It is not my intention or desire to provoke a discussion of constitutional issues on this Bill and I will, therefore, not enter into the implications of the undertaking we propose to abolish. I may say, however, that there are good citizens of this country who cannot conscientiously subscribe to that declaration and we refuse to exclude all such citizens from employment in the public service.</P>
    <P>We simply want to make the official life of this State non-sectional and to remove the political tests that were designed to perpetuate the divisions and bitterness of the past. This entails the restoration of their rights to all persons identified with the Republican movement in this country since 1921, and the giving to them of opportunities to regain the status of which they were deprived because of their political opinions in the past, so as to restore as far as can be done those impartial, non-sectional principles of national Government for which we have striven.  I have said &ldquo;as far as can be done&rdquo;: I am well aware of the sacrifices made, the years of unemployment and discouragement, waste, in one sense, of many a man's best years&mdash;for which no Act of Parliament can give any adequate compensation.  But so far as this <Col N="883" /> Government can go, with the co-operation which we expect to receive from the local authorities, towards redressing the wrongs and restoring the rights of victimised persons&mdash;we will go.  That is what this Bill is designed to do in so far as employees of local authorities are concerned.</P>
    <P>The repeal of Section 71 is effected by Section 2 of the Bill.  The repeal will take effect as on and from the 9th March, 1932, with appropriate provisions for the voidance of the operation of the section where the time has begun to run from the 9th February, 1932.  Section 3 of the Bill relates to increases of salary or emolument which would have become payable to an officer but for the operation of Section 71, and it proposes to give validity to any resolution of the local body awarding such increases of salary which became void by reason of the failure of the officer concerned to subscribe to the declaration. There are consequential provisions to effect the payment of the total amount of additional salary and emoluments to such officers; provisions to cover cases where officers have been transferred from the service of one local authority to another local authority and the revision of pensions or gratuities, at present payable on the bases of the lower scale of salary.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill relates to the appointment by a local authority of persons formerly removed from or refused office under a local authority. It is proposed to empower local bodies, with the sanction of the Minister, to regard persons so removed or refused office in the past for political reasons as being qualified for appointment to such office or an analogous office under the same or any other local authority whenever a vacancy therein occurs in the future.  For the purpose of considering qualifications for a vacancy, any officer formerly employed in Northern Ireland shall be regarded as qualified in connection with analogous vacancies occurring in Saorstát Eireann.  It is proposed to empower the local authority to place any person thus re-appointed on the salary scale which, in the opinion of <Col N="884" /> the Minister, he would have reached if he had not suffered any removal from office or had not been refused appointment to an office in the past.</P>
    <P>Section 5 relates to the periods of pensionable service to be taken into account by a local authority for the purpose of computing the superannuation which will be payable to any officer of a local body whose tenure of service had been interrupted for political reasons and who subsequently was re-employed or reinstated in pursuance of the provisions of this Bill in the local service. For the purpose of calculating the amount of any pension to which such officer may be entitled under the Local Government law it is proposed that his pensionable service may be reckoned as including the period of broken service where such period begins between the 1st January, 1922, and the 9th March, 1932.  Consequential provisions are made in connection with the liability for superannuation where an officer was employed by more than one local authority.  The expression &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; is defined as including any local authority in Northern Ireland up to the 30th April, 1923.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that where any local authority in the Saorstát employs a person formerly in the service of a local authority in Northern Ireland who was removed therefrom for political reasons, the Minister for Finance may pay from State funds a contribution towards the pension of such person in respect of his period of office in Northern Ireland and his period of broken service.</P>
    <P>Cases have come under our notice where a person continued for some short time to act in an office where his legal tenure of service had been voided by the operation of Section 71 of the Act of 1925.  Such persons were not paid for this period of <i>de facto</i> service and Section 6 of the Bill proposes to legalise any such payments since made or to be made by the local authority.  Section 7 relates to the period 1st July, 1922, to 30th April, 1923, during which certain officers and servants of some local authorities were absent from their duties by reason of <Col N="885" /> being imprisoned or interned for political reasons.  It is proposed to enable the local authorities concerned to pay to such persons the whole or part of any remuneration which would have been normally payable to them in respect of such period.  I recommend the Bill to the consideration of the House.</P>

      <P>I hope the Seanad will heartily agree with the provisions of this enlightened measure.  These political oaths are an invention of comparatively recent times.  They did not exist in the ancient times in the history of this country or even in the history of Great Britain.  They were the result of the religious wars. More than eighty years ago, a Commission was set up, with a view to inquiring into the numerous classes of oaths that were then in existence and, in their recommendation, they said that the political oath was the invention of unscrupulous men for the purpose of binding or humiliating honest men.  They were designed for the purpose of keeping all office in the hands of one particular party.  At the time that most of them were introduced it was the Whig Party, and they were continued in England by the Tory Party who, when they came into power, wanted offices for their followers.  In the process of time these political tests and oaths became so numerous that there was no office in the State which had not its own peculiar oath.  Policemen had to take an oath.  All Churchwardens had to take an oath.  Looking through the book containing the various forms of oaths, I find that they numbered, at one time, I think, 700 or 800 different forms.  This Commission was set up, as I say, about the year 1850, and it recommended that they should all be swept aside because they served no useful purpose and because they were never effectual to prevent a man otherwise disloyal to the State from acting in a disloyal manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised, when a certain measure dealing with oaths came before this House to find that most of the gentlemen opposite found it in their conscience to support the <Col N="886" /> retention of the particular oath in question.  I am sure that nobody could conscientiously support the retention of this particular oath which is an oath of office designed for a political purpose, which the experience of centuries has found to be most mischievous and, of course, which is contrary to the spirit of our own time.  I do not wish to enter into any controversial matter, but I hope the Seanad will do credit to itself by allowing this measure to pass without any comment or controversy whatever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLoughlin Mr. MacLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the principal object of this enlightened Bill is to remove the declaration of allegiance which some evil disposed persons of &ldquo;most vindictive character&rdquo; inserted in the Local Government Act of 1925.  I may, perhaps, be excused for recalling the circumstances under which this declaration of allegiance to the State &mdash;not an oath&mdash;was inserted in that Act.  The country had just emerged from the confusion and turmoil of civil war.  The war-wagers, who are now the Government, had refused to accept the status of the Free State. They looked upon this Oireachtas as an usurping body without any legal or moral authority to legislate. President de Valera, who then regarded himself as the hereditary President of a <i>de facto</i> Republic, and head of a rival government to the Government validly elected by the majority of the people of the Saorstát, had declared &ldquo;that the foundations of the so-called Free State were built on sand, and that the foolish people who were building on that foundation would never cease to live in fear and trembling.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Vice-President of the Executive Council of the Free State&mdash; His Majesty's distinguished Minister for Local Government; I don't know what position he held in the Republican Government of that time&mdash; declared, with an arrogance befitting a Hindenburg, that he did not consider himself &ldquo;demobilised&rdquo; and, referring to the damage done in the civil war, prophesied cheerfully that <Col N="887" /> they would do twice as much damage the next time.  All through the country the supporters of Mr. de Valera and Mr. O'Kelly, including many public officials, were gaily boasting that the Free State would never function, and that it would collapse in a few months.  These officials made no secret that they were quite willing to hasten that much desired end.  It was under these extraordinary and perilous circumstances that this reasonable declaration of allegiance&mdash;and not an oath, as Senator Comyn says&mdash;to the State&mdash; not to any political party&mdash;was inserted in the Local Government Bill of 1925.</P>
    <P>May I read the monstrous section&mdash; this relic of the Penal Laws&mdash;which has stirred the patriotic ire of the august and gallant Minister and stuck in the gizzards of the Party ever since?:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where after the passing of this Act a local authority passes a resolution either appointing a person to be an officer of that local authority or increasing the salary or emoluments of an officer of that local authority such resolution shall have no effect until such person or officer shall within one month after the date of such resolution have made and subscribed a declaration as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I do solemnly and sincerely declare that I will bear allegiance to the Irish Free State and its Constitution as by law established and that in the event of such appointment being confirmed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health I will to the best of my judgment and ability duly and faithfully perform the duties of the said office and will observe and obey such orders and directions in relation to such duties as shall lawfully be given to me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Seanad will note that the section did not apply to officials already holding office unless they sought an increase of salary.  It applied principally to new appointees and the pathetic picture which the doleful Vice-President drew in the <Col N="888" /> Dáil of high principled idealistic Republicans being driven from their snug jobs to starve in the noisome slums of America and Australia is simply&mdash;if I might borrow a word from the Minister's polite vocabulary &mdash;hogwash.  Personally I should be sorry to make anyone suffer for his principles.  But I always suspect a man who talks too much about his principles.  High sounding talk about &ldquo;principle&rdquo; very often amounts to nothing more than a hypocritical excuse for doing the wrong thing or omitting to do the right thing.</P>
    <P>I know that no man of genuine principle&mdash;no honest Republican&mdash; would seek service under a State that he did not recognise and was plotting to subvert.  It was only the mean, self-seeking, late-coming, safety-first extremists who would stoop to that. For their misfortunes I shed no tears. At any rate almost nine years have passed since that Act was enacted, and I venture to say that not nine persons lost their jobs because of it.  On the contrary, owing to the system set up by the Cosgrave Government by which appointments were made scrupulously on merit by an independent Committee &mdash;people who were bitterly opposed to that Government were able to get some of the best positions in the country&mdash;without any violence to their patriotic susceptibilities beyond subscribing to that declaration which, as I have said, is not a political test at all.  It does not require allegiance to any party but to the State&mdash;and allegiance to the State is merely allegiance to the majority will.  It is the same allegiance which a Government owes to the people who give them their Governmental authority.</P>
    <P>Is it too much to expect from public officials that they will faithfully perform the duties for which they are paid, and give allegiance to the State that pays them?  Is it evidence of bitterness on the part of any Government that it requires public servants to give allegiance, not to itself as a Government, but to the majority of the people?  Is it evidence of bitterness against the Cosgrave Government that it threw open for competition all public appointments, making no <Col N="889" /> discrimination between enemies and friends, but insisting only that this declaration of fealty to the State should be made equally by all appointees?</P>
    <P>Naturally a declaration of allegiance to the State and Constitution which they tried vainly to smash and then coveted, is distasteful to the present Government.  Hence we have this Bill to provide back pay for the breakers of bridges without the necessity to lacerate their consciences by pledging allegiance to the people who paid for the bridges.  And while we are not to have allegiance to the State, the Minister for Finance has emphatically declared that &ldquo;loyalty and devotion are to be exacted from every public officer.&rdquo;  Loyalty and devotion to whom or to what?  Is it to the erratic Minister for Finance?  If it is, then the loyalties of public servants will change with every moon.  Is the Minister for Finance going to emulate the example of Louis XIV and to lay down the doctrine of the royal egoist &mdash;<i>L'état, cest moi</i>?  If that is his intention he will probably discover that there are other egoists in the Government who will claim a share of this allegiance including the arch-egoist of the century.</P>
    <P>There are signs that the policy of other members of the Government is to exact, at least, a Party allegiance. So far as they can manage it, they are making a corner in all the jobs and appointments that are going for their own followers.  Even in relief works it is the secretaries of the Fianna Fáil clubs who determine who is to get work and who is not, while scores of Fianna Fáil supporters have been pitchforked into jobs without any other qualification than their political affiliations.  It is plain that Tammany Hall methods are being introduced into Irish public life, and that public appointments are made, dependent, not upon the competence and loyalty to the State of the individual, but upon his political sympathies.</P>
    <P>The treatment of General O'Duffy is an example.  No officer of this State performed his duties more faithfully or more efficiently.  The proof of this <Col N="890" /> is that no charge could be made against him.  He was removed from office for the sole reason that he had been 10 years Commissioner under a Cosgrave Government&mdash;and these are the people who talk about abolishing political tests!  Is that a political test or is it not?  Those who talk of &ldquo;political tests&rdquo; are applying political tests every day in the week.  All over the country efforts are being made to deprive public servants of their jobs, because they are suspected of not being sufficiently enamoured of the economic war which is bringing us so much glory.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Clubs have set up a sort of O.G.P.U., sending in reports against public servants&mdash;that they are members of the A.C.A.&mdash;merely because they have been seen talking to neighbours who were on the side of reason at the last election.  This is the manner in which this Puritan Government is banishing injustice from public life.  What a splendid hypocrisy then it is to declare that the object of the Bill is to clear the path to unity, harmony and good feeling among all citizens of the State!</P>
    <P>The real object of the Bill is to empower local bodies to reward with Free State gold those who tried to destroy their property&mdash;or as Senator Farren phrased it&mdash;&ldquo;those who tried to scuttle the ship of State.&rdquo;  This is a Fianna Fáil bone to the I.R.A. dog to keep it from inconvenient yapping. The Republic has now become a bit of dusty stage property and is relegated to the lumber room of Fianna Fáil from which it is produced occasionally to humour the virile and exacting patriotic demands of extremists like Senator Quirke.</P>
    <P>I am supposed to be fanatically anti-Republican.  The Minister, I am told, did me the honour of describing me to the Dáil as a narrow-minded, bigoted, bitter anti-Republican.  In the eyes of consistent, big-minded statesmen like the Minister, I may appear narrow-minded, bigoted and bitter, but I want to say that I have never been consciously bitter against genuine or honest Republicans no matter how wildly impractical their <Col N="891" /> doctrines.  My bitterness and bigotry only extend to the pseudo-Republicans &mdash;to the opportunist Republican&mdash;to the Republicans who turn Imperialist in the dog days and send loyal messages to the King they affect to scorn in more frigid times&mdash;who drink his health with greedy enthusiasm and accept his messages on their ministerial knees.  Having wallowed in greasy Imperialism for a summer, they turn round and accuse better Irishmen than they are of disregard of their patriotic obligations.</P>
    <P>It is quite appropriate that the gentleman who proclaimed loudmouthed loyalty to King George at Ottawa should now be moving to remove from the Statute Book a declaration of loyalty to the people of this State by the officials who are paid to serve it.</P>
    <P>If I moved on Committee Stage to substitute for the declaration in the Act the declaration which Mr. John T. O'Kelly so fervently subscribed in the presence of the élite of Imperialism at Ottawa, I suppose it would be acceptable to the Ministry.  According to our present Government all the allegiance is to be to the King and there is to be no allegiance to the people&mdash;I, though I may be a bigoted anti-Republican&mdash;put the people before the King.</P>
    <P>Accordingly I have considered it my duty to protest against this Bill which is an attempt to dethrone the people by a repentant Republican.</P>

      <P>I could not do less than support this Bill for the reason that I was in the Seanad when the original Act was passed.  I was then one of a very small minority who opposed its passing.  I opposed it because I considered that it was unjust to people who took the opposite side to that which we took who were sitting here.  Those people did things with which many of us, possibly, did not agree; but there was one thing with which we should never have agreed, and that to hound those people out of their employment.  It meant either taking this Oath and believing in it, or it meant taking the Oath and not believing in it; and <Col N="892" /> that was a very terrible thing to put up to those people whose only means of livelihood were the clerkships or the other positions which they held under the Government.  They took the losing side undoubtedly, and I think that everybody must agree that they were just as honest in taking the losing side as we were in taking the winning side.  I voted against the Act at that time although I had been asked to introduce it.  I declined to do so at the time, and I think that the only thing I can do now is to support this Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not think I need say very much.  There does not seem to be anybody who, in my opinion, would carry any weight anywhere in Ireland to-day, who has a word to say in opposing the Bill. In view of the attitude of the House, I think I can very well disregard the statements made by Senator MacLoughlin.  The Senator had his day, but that day is finished, thanks be to God.  The Senator had his period, when he and those whom he served did everything they could to down the man who did not stand with them.  I have instances of it here in this city, and I know of instances of it in almost every county in the Free State.  There was no extreme to which they did not go to prevent honest men and efficient men from getting the employment which was their due in the Free State.  That day, I hope, is finished.  Certainly, it is finished so far as we are concerned. We intend, not alone to finish that, but to finish the very memory of it&mdash;Senator MacLoughlin and his type notwithstanding.  I hope that that type of public representative will get little show here and little show in the political assemblies of the future.  I am glad that there has been such little opposition to the Bill so far as the Seanad is concerned. I think it speaks well for the Bill and for the ideals of those who put it forward.  I would ask, if it were possible, that the Committee Stage should be taken this day week.</P>

      <P>I suggest that we take the Committee Stage on the next day we meet, because, so far as I can see, the only business we are likely to have next week would be the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I thought that the House might think it unnecessary to meet, as, apparently, we must meet, during Holy Week.  I am advised that certain Bills will come to us that the Government will require to have passed before Easter.  I suggest, therefore, that we meet on the Tuesday of Holy Week, and that we might get through our business on the Tuesday and Wednesday of that week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Seán MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, as no doubt all the members of the Seanad are aware, is to make it possible to issue out of the Central Fund, first of all, the amount required to meet the Supplementary Estimates not covered by the original Appropriation Act of 1932; and, secondly, to issue out of the Central Fund that sum which will be required to meet the cost of the normal Supply Services for the first four months of the year.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it is necessary to deal with the Bill at any great length, but with regard to Section 1 of the Bill, which is concerned with the provision to be made to meet the cost of the Supplementary Estimates, the House may be interested to know some of the major items covered by the sum of £2,694,112 mentioned in that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is the Supplementary Estimate of £250,000 on Vote 7 for the old age pensions.  That represents the cost to the State of the additional benefits granted by the Old Age Pensions Act of 1932.  The next item of importance is the sum of £350,000 which is provided under Vote 69 for relief schemes. The next item is £250,000 which is <Col N="894" /> provided under Vote 74 for the relief of rates.  That is the special and additional grant which was given for relief of rates on agricultural land last year. The next item is £1,616,000 which is to be provided under Vote 75 for the advance to the Guarantee Fund and which, in fact, represents the complementary step which must be taken to the passage of the Land (Purchase Annuities Fund) Bill in order to recoup the Central Fund, the Emergency Fund, and the local authorities the amounts withheld on account of the deficiency in the land annuities collection. The other items are of minor importance and represent what would be the normal Supplementary Estimates at this time.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sum of £7,985,460 covered by Section 2 of the Bill, that represents the usual provision made at this time of the year in order to enable the public services to be carried on pending the passage of the Estimates by the Dáil, the presentation of the Budget, and the principal Central Fund and Appropriation Bills of the year.  I do not think that it will be necessary to deal at length with these.  It would take a long time to do so and possibly the agenda is heavy.  It might suffice if I were to point to the main differences between this Vote and last year's Vote.  The first thing that arises is that the Vote this year is slightly heavier than last year.  This Vote is for £7,985,460 out of the total provision of £22,039,951, as compared with last year, when the amount asked was £7,840,460.  However, there are two rather striking differences between this year's and last year's Estimates to which I would like to refer.</P>
    <P>On Vote No. 7&mdash;Old Age Pensions&mdash;there is an increase of £479,000 for the complete year for the additional benefits conferred under the Old Age Pensions Act of 1932. On Vote No. 8&mdash;Local Loans&mdash;provision is asked for £900,000 out of the total of £2,150,000.  There is an increase in the total Estimate over last year's provision of £1,000,000.  When we consider the amount voted last year as a Grant-in-Aid to the Local Loans Fund there will be an additional <Col N="895" /> provision this year of £1,600,000.  Of the sum asked this year, £318,513 is provided as a Grant-in-Aid to cover loans sanctioned in 1932-33 in excess of the amount originally provided in that year.  The increase in the amount required on account of the normal Grant-in-Aid for 1932-33 is chiefly due to the provision made for loans for housing purposes which will be £1,700,000 for the coming year, as compared with £350,000 last year.  The amount which we are asking for in this Central Fund Bill on account of housing loans is approximately £500,000.  A sum of £100,000 will cover loans to public authorities and cover the cost of other classes of public health works and constructional works generally.  Similarly in Vote No. 41 there is a net increase in the Estimate of £229,980 over what was provided last year, and of this increase £220,000 mainly represents increased provision for housing grants.</P>
    <P>As against these items, in which considerable increases are being granted, there are some items in which certain deductions have taken place and to which possibly the House would like me to refer.  The first provision is in Vote No. 8&mdash;Local Loans.  Last year that Vote included provision for the annuity payable to the British Local Loans Fund under the Ultimate Financial Settlement of £600,000.  We do not propose to ask the Oireachtas at this stage to make that provision and accordingly nothing has been included in the Estimates to cover that £600,000. The whole of the £2,150,000 asked for in Vote 8 this year will be spent in this country in providing employment and in the execution of useful public works. Similarly in regard to Vote No. 16, provision was made last year for recoupment to the British Government of £105,000 in respect of the civil pensions and £1,126,500 in respect of the Royal Irish Constabulary pensions.  The Vote this year does not include any provision for these payments, and accordingly the total amount of the Vote will be reduced by £1,234,640.  On Vote No. 55&mdash;Land Commission&mdash;there will be a total decrease of £190,483 and that is accounted for very largely by the <Col N="896" /> non-inclusion of provision for payment to the British Government of a contribution towards charge for excess stock of £134,500 and a further decrease of £73,455 to meet the deficiency of income from untenanted land.  These are the principal items upon which there has been any very great departure from those of last year.</P>
    <P>There have been minor reductions which are very largely accounted for by a decrease in the bonus payable to civil servants owing to the fall in the cost of living figure.  I might say that it is a rather striking commentary on what we were told when the Government's protectionist policy was being considered in the Oireachtas, that one of the effects would be to increase considerably the cost of living.  So far as the cost of living figure may be taken as a true representation of any changes which might take place in that very composite quality, which we refer to as the cost of living, there has been a very substantial decrease rather than an increase.  I do not think that there is anything else that I might usefully say at this stage.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Minister's last remark, does he remember that there is an economic war in progress at present, and that the prices of farmers' produce have decreased enormously?  Is he boasting about that?  I would like to comment upon another item to which the Minister referred&mdash;old age pensions.  When the Bill was here some Senators protested against the change that was made in the means test.  That was one of the greatest public scandals that ever happened in this country.  I am not referring to the administration of the Act but to the effects of removing the means test.  I know cases where people who own motor cars and wireless sets, and who have electric light in their houses, are making their farms over to their relatives in order to live on the State and draw the full pension of 10/- a week.  It is becoming a terrible scandal in the country and I would like to protest against it.  I protested when the Bill was going through this House and I protest against it now. With regard to the prices of many <Col N="897" /> articles which have to be imported it is not true that they have decreased. Prices have increased.  Except for farmers' produce there is no decrease in the cost of living.  I hope the House will not agree that it is a thing to be boasted about, that the cost of living has gone down, because of the impoverishment of farmers, who are not able to sell their produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get some information from the Minister, particularly with regard to the rate of interest charged for the building of agricultural labourers' cottages.  The House will remember that in the Local Loans Fund last year there were two items, one of £600,000 and one of £550,000, which in the ordinary course would be raised from the taxpayers and which under the previous Government was regarded as abnormal expenditure, but would be repaid, as the loans fell due, by those who received the money.  When these items were going through I was of opinion that the reason why these items were placed on the taxpayers was that the Government had in mind the question of issuing the money at a very low rate of interest in order to have houses built for labourers.  The money is raised from the taxpayers and therefore can be issued without the necessity of repaying the capital. Under the former Government the price at which the loans would be issued included repayment of the capital and sinking fund.  That practice was departed from last year.  Notwithstanding that, I find that these loans are being issued at 6 per cent. or 6¼ per cent.  Seeing that the taxpayer has already paid the money, I do not think that is right.  The main difference between this Bill and last year's Bill is a reduction in the amount of money paid to Great Britain, amounting to over £2,000,000.  Although that money is not included in this year's Estimates they are higher than the amount asked last year.  The reason given by the Minister is that there is an increase in the cost of old age pensions, which is, perhaps, well spent money, and £1,000,000 extra needed for Local Loans for housing.  I <Col N="898" /> notice that the Minister did not indicate that the £448,000 is to be given to the relief of local taxation this year, notwithstanding the fact that the money is not being paid to the British. The Estimates as a whole are greater than those of last year.  While the payments to England are not included in them, the amount for the relief of local rates is diminished by about £440,000. That would give an idea of the increasing cost of government of this country under a Government that was to reduce expenditure and to give the same satisfaction on a reduced Estimate.  I think that would take a lot of explaining.  Perhaps the Budget will show that the necessary money will be found in another way.  Probably the Minister will get it from sweepstakes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather difficult to discuss this Bill seeing that we only got the Estimates yesterday.  It is not easy to go through the Estimates, to analyse them, and then to come here and discuss them at such short notice. We have a proposal from Senator Robinson to have the different stages of the Bill completed this afternoon. Such a proposal reminds me very much of the pictures issued by the petrol companies, of a man who is looking out for a motor car to appear and when he looks again he finds it is gone.  Our chances of debating these Estimates under such circumstances are infinitesimal. This is the expenditure side of the Budget.  I take it that there will be ample time to discuss the items when we see the Budget and know where the money to meet the expenditure is to come from.  The Minister has explained certain decreases in expenditure and referred to local loans for housing.  I have no doubt that the plans for these schemes are sound, and that the superannuation and retired payments to which he referred, deal with the money that is in dispute with Great Britain.  The money for the land annuities does not come under this Bill, but the Bill means that this is a continuation of the war with Great Britain, a war which the farming community <Col N="899" /> are finding so burdensome. The Bill is a practical admission that the war is going on.  In the Dáil the Minister stated that a Grant-in-Aid of agriculture of £1,750,000 will be provided. I have been trying to find where these figures appear.  I could not find a supplementary agricultural grant of £448,000.  I could not find anything, except £229,000, under the Vote for Local Government and Public Health.  Where is £1,750,000 mentioned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that £599,000 of the Supplementary Agricultural Grant is charged on the Central Fund and does not appear in the Estimates.  The next thing is that it will be necessary to introduce a new Bill during the coming financial year to distribute the agricultural grant on the new basis.  Accordingly, as the new Bill has not yet been introduced, and has not passed the Oireachtas, we could not include that provision in the volume of Estimates now before the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>That explains why I could not make the figures balance. There is no use, therefore, in my saying anything more about agriculture.  The Minister has explained why there is a difference in the totals.  As regards expenditure generally the figures are practically the same as they have been for some time.  There may be a difference of £500 or of £200 or £300 here and there, but in the Estimates before us there is nothing to show that, as regards the ordinary cost of running the State, we are doing it any cheaper now than we were before.  I take it the Minister's answer to that will be that it cannot be done for anything less.  Probably he is right.  At any rate there are no savings apparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then I come upon a rather strange thing.  I find a reference to relief <Col N="900" /> schemes, but against a number of them there are no figures entered. Section 1 of the Central Fund Bill that we are discussing provides for the issue of £2,694,000 odd out of the Central Fund for the service of the year ending the 31st March, 1933.  It is quite evident from the blanks in the Estimates that such a provision is not being made for the year ending 1934. Is it the belief of the Government that they can get through next year without any Emergency Fund grant-in-aid? The fact that the payments to the British Government&mdash;superannuations and annuities&mdash;are being withheld shows that the economic war is to go on full tilt.  Last year there were various bounties and grants to agriculturists who shipped their produce to Great Britain.  Are there to be no more of these?  Are they all to cease? There is no provision being made for them so far as I can see.  Are we to have, this year, what probably was excusable last year, emergency grants rushed through the Dáil, and then brought forward to this House in such a way that Senators will not have any chance of discussing them adequately? Are we to have them brought forward and rushed through at one sitting? If that is so, then we will be in the same position this time next year that we are in to-day: passing a sum of 2¼ millions extra under the title of an emergency grant put through the Dáil and brought forward here for five minutes discussion.</P>
    <P>I see that the Olympic Council and the Tailteann Games are not going to get anything this year and that the leather subsidy is to be discontinued. The Minister stated definitely that the sum for the relief of rates on agricultural land is to be down by £250,000. He has stated that relief schemes are only to have £150,000, showing there a saving of £350,000.  Is there anything in the present state of the country, known to any member of this House, which would indicate in the slightest degree that the cost of relief schemes is likely to be less this year than last year, or that the need for them is likely to be less?  In my opinion quite as much will be needed for relief schemes this year as last year, and yet a <Col N="901" /> saving is shown under this head of £350,000.</P>
    <P>I now come to advances from the Guarantee Fund.  I must ask the Minister to explain that clearly.  In banking, advances mean a thing that you expect to get back.  I presume the Minister hopes to get back the £1,600,000 from the people against whom it has been charged.  He is going to get that money, I take it, out of the money held in suspense. That is the way that item is going to be cleared.  Therefore, one must come to the conclusion that if we had not these nice little nest eggs, as a result of the great war with Britain, we would be in a shocking financial condition now.  Of course, there is the other way of looking at it that if we had not the war we would not be in this financial condition, and would be able to pay our rates and hold our heads up.  I want to point this out to the House: that if the economic war is to continue next year no provision, so far as I can see, is being made now to help those who will suffer as a result of it.  There is nothing before us to show how the money needed to help them is going to be provided.  The Minister will probably deal with that later on. Quite a number of columns in the Estimates before me are left blank, but if the economic war goes on they will have to be filled up and filled up by further taxation, and under the very worst system of doing that, namely, with emergency grants rushed through when the need for them arises.</P>
    <P>I think the Government, at the present time, ought to have some fair idea of what all these bounties, bonuses, grants-in-aid, and everything else that will probably arise next year will amount to&mdash;the gross amount that would probably cover them.  I think that information ought to be given in the Estimates, and that we ought to have a statement from the Minister. This idea of having Estimates for £22,000,000 is entirely wrong.  I do not think it is a right thing for the Government, in our present situation, to evade the issue; they should give us an estimate of what they consider the things on which we spent two or <Col N="902" /> three million pounds last year are going to cost this year.  I think that when the Budget is introduced we should have estimates put before us honestly telling us what the Government believe is the amount of money they will require in the current year as well as the reasons for asking the House to assent to it.  I do not think the Government should act as they are acting here, leaving a lot of blanks to be filled up by emergency legislation later, legislation put through in a hurry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister for Finance how he justifies the deduction of one shilling in the pound in the agricultural grant.  This matter is now before the different county councils.  The Monaghan County Council, of which I am a member, met yesterday.  We decided to strike a rate which is sixpence in the pound higher than last year.  That increase of sixpence is due entirely to the cost of home assistance.  If it had not been for that we would have been able to carry on with last year's estimate.  The increase of sixpence in the pound for home assistance is due altogether to the present Government's economic policy. The cost of home assistance has increased because poor working men are unable to get work.  There is no employment in the towns owing to the fact that the farmers have no money to spend.  At our special meeting yesterday we had a demand from the Department of Local Government and from the Minister for Finance that we must increase our rate by a further shilling in the pound.  We refused to do that.  I would ask the Minister how he justifies his demand for a further shilling in the pound from the farmers of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody is threatening a strike against cuts this year.  The railway men are on strike against the cut proposed in their wages.  The teachers and the civil servants are out against cuts in their salaries. It is not a 10 per cent. but a 100 per cent. cut that the farmer is asked to bear because the Government's policy has absolutely taken away all his <Col N="903" /> income.  There is no doubt about that. Yet, in face of the fact that all his income is taken away the Government say to him that he must pay an additional 1/6 in the pound in his rates this year.  A demand of that kind is bound to make trouble.  If the people are not able to pay, then sooner or later there will be a strike and that will bring the administration of the local bodies and of the whole country into a state of chaos. I ask the Minister to reconsider that matter and to allow the county councils to carry on with the rates they have agreed to strike.  He should try to find this shilling in the pound in some other way.  For instance, he could cut salaries.  The present Government have been promising us for a very long time to reduce salaries.  I see that the Government now propose to repay the American loan of £1,000,000.  They propose to do that and a war on.  Surely the repayment of that loan could be postponed. It is a very extraordinary thing to propose the repayment of this American debt at a time when the farmers have been deprived of their total income, with an economic war on and when they are being asked to pay an additional 1/6 in the pound in their rates.</P>
    <P>I know that the answer of the Government to all this is that they are reducing the land annuities by half, and that therefore the people can afford to pay higher rates.  At the present time, halving the land annuities is no recompense to the farmers for the losses they are suffering. If all the annuities and all the rates that the farmer has to pay were remitted at the present time it would not put him in as good a position as he was in two years ago under the Cosgrave Government.  Everything that he has to sell is reduced in price by about a third, sometimes more, while everything that he has to buy has increased in price.  For instance, he has to pay from 5/- to 7/6 a ton more for his coal.  The blacksmith has to increase his charge for shoeing the farmers' horses by a shilling. When my blacksmith charged me an <Col N="904" /> extra shilling for the shoeing of my horses and when I asked him the reason for it his answer was that he has to pay more for coal and iron. All these increased charges come back on the farmer.  He has to meet them all, and at the same time to sell his stock and his produce at reduced prices.  The other day I saw a bill in connection with eight cattle that were shipped to Birmingham.  The sum of £39 was paid in duty to the British Government.  The farmer who had to pay it would not pay £39 in his land annuities in three years.  It is my opinion that if the present Government continue in existence very much longer there will be no farmers left in this country.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister not in a position to make a better offer to the boards of health throughout the country in connection with housing loans than that which was communicated to these bodies recently?  The boards of health have been asked to build labourers' cottages very extensively.  I agree that such work is very desirable and very necessary.  But on the loans advanced the Government want the boards to pay 5½ per cent. interest on the money, and in addition 1¼ per cent. for sinking fund.  If money were to be borrowed on those terms, then a wholly uneconomic rent would have to be charged to the labourers for the cottages.  We propose in the County Monaghan to build 200 houses, but if we have to borrow the money at the rate fixed by the Government, 5½ per cent., with the additional charge for sinking fund, then we will have to charge the labourers a rent of half a crown a week.  At present we have some hundreds of labourers' cottages let at 1/- and 1/3 a week.  We find it difficult to collect the rent of 1/3 a week.  In fact, quite a large number of the tenants are in arrear with their rents, some of them for four and six months.  If tenants are not able to pay a rent of 1/3 a week, what is the position to be if we build houses for which we must charge half a crown? &mdash;I suggest to the Minister that he should float a housing loan.  If he were able to get money at 3½ per cent. <Col N="905" /> and were to lend it at a reasonable rate to the boards of health then they might be able to build cottages that could be let at about 1/6 per week. I see that the Northern Government were able to float a loan at 3½ per cent. and the English Government at 2½ per cent.  There is no reason why, on the credit of this State, we should not be able to get a loan on as good terms. There is no use in the boards of health building cottages and charging rents for them that the labourers will not be able to pay.  Of course, if the labourers are not able to pay, then the rates must bear the burden which, in turn, means that the farmers must pay.  That is what happened under the old Labourers' Acts schemes.  Any arrears that accumulated in connection with cottage rents had to be paid ultimately by the farmers.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I want to deal with.  It is in connection with the Old Age Pensions Act recently passed by the Government.  The Government made a mistake in connection with that measure.  They should not, I think, have agreed to give pensions to the inmates of public institutions.  A great many of these people will be inmates in these institutions for the remainder of their lives.  What happens at the present time is that they are entitled to a pension of 10/- a week. They sign an authorisation enabling somebody to go to the post office to draw the old age pension weekly for them.  As far as I can learn, only about 2/- of the pension reaches the old age pensioner.  The public institutions in which the pensioners are being maintained, so far as I know, get nothing out of the pensions.  I think some provision should have been made that portion of the 10/- would have gone for their upkeep in these institutions. Because of the failure to make any provision of that kind some thousands of pounds are lost annually to the taxpayers. Only a small portion of the pension is of any benefit to the old age pensioner.  The remainder apparently goes to some outside person or perhaps the official who gets authority to collect it at the post office.  That person gets the 10/- and just gives a few shillings to the pensioner.</P>

      <P>Senator Miss Browne and Senator O'Rourke have spoken as if the present Government were responsible for the fall in the prices of agricultural produce.  In a manufacturing country like Britain it is quite obvious that cheap food is practically equivalent to cheap raw material.  The price of food in England fell so low that the subordinate interest in England&mdash;agriculture&mdash;was so threatened by the great depression in prices that the Government there were compelled to call on countries that were importing food to Britain to restrict their imports.  It is now calling on the Colonies to decrease their imports of butter and cheese.  When this so-called economic war was threatened I went across to England as quickly as I could to get in, before the duties applied, something over a hundred tons of butter.</P>

      <P>Thank God, I did not succeed with it all.  One ship carrying 35 tons was late, and I brought it back. I lost money on every ounce of the 100 tons I sent into England, but I made money on what I brought back, so that when Senators talk about Deputy Cosgrave or anybody else increasing the price of Irish agricultural produce in England, by implication blaming the present Government, I say that to anybody who knows the facts such talk is pure rubbish.  Choicest New Zealand butter is selling in London to-day, delivered less discount, at 70/- per cwt.  It is being retailed at 10d., and in a good many cases at 9d. per 1b.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather rejoiced that the Estimates contain no provision for emergency relief work, but I expect we shall have some emergency relief works.  While they were probably immediately necessary and gave a good deal of employment&mdash;the labour-content was high&mdash;I think it was a choice of evils.  The breaking up of some of the roads and the replacing of them by better roads was, in the circumstances, wasteful.  I suggest to the Minister and to the Government that it would be very much better to carry on even to a larger extent than has <Col N="907" /> been done the subsidising of some productive industry like agriculture or to arrange for the carrying on of continuous housing schemes where some value would be given for the money. It is only natural that if a man knows that at the end of a particular job, in a few weeks, he will be workless, he will not work hard to put himself out of work.  If, as recommended by a committee instituted by Deputy Cosgrave's Government and presided over by Deputy Vincent Rice, a continuous housing scheme was entered upon, we would get better value for the money spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Jameson as regards the difficulty of criticising Estimates which only reached us a couple of days ago.  Looking over the Estimates last night, I found a number of small points upon which I should like to put questions to the Minister but I do not think it is desirable to take up the time of the House on details.  I notice that pretty drastic cuts have been made in the Grants-in-Aid of scientific investigation. I should like to know from the Minister whether any prior consultation took place with the bodies concerned and whether he is satisfied that these cuts can be effected without permanently injuring the bodies concerned&mdash;the Royal Zoological Society, the Royal Irish Academy, the Royal Hibernian Academy, the Royal Irish Academy of Music and the Irish Folklore Institute.  I am not a member of the Royal Irish Academy of Music but I am informed that the reduction of £200 in their grant may create very serious difficulties for them.  I am not inclined to criticise the Minister for endeavouring to make economies in these grants but, before reductions are made, an opportunity should be given to the bodies concerned to make representations and the Minister should be satisfied that they will not be seriously or permanently injured.  I am told that in one case the body concerned knew nothing about the reduction until yesterday.  Possibly my information in that respect is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two matters in connection with general financial policy that I <Col N="908" /> should like to raise.  Perhaps they would come up more appropriately on the occasion of the Budget but they are matters which come under the control of the Department of Finance and I should like if the Minister would give them some consideration before the Finance Bill is introduced.  One of these matters is in connection with the method by which income-tax is charged on income from investments.  I think I am correct in stating that it is the policy of the Government to do what they can to encourage persons to invest their money in this country rather than in undertakings outside the country. While admitting the difficulties, I imagine that everybody would be glad to see as much money as possible invested at home.  If the Minister makes inquiries, he will, I think, find that the income-tax authorities&mdash;accidentally rather than intentionally, I am sure&mdash;place barriers and difficulties in the way of persons who at present hold investments outside the country and desire to transfer their money to investments within the country.  A relative of mine consulted me about certain changes of investments and that is how the matter came to my notice.  This particular person had a comparatively small income&mdash;£60 or £70&mdash;from investments outside Ireland and the proposal was to invest the money within the country.  We found that under Schedule D.&mdash;I am not positive about the exact schedule, because it is difficult to keep these schedules in mind&mdash;investments outside the country and certain other investments, including bank deposits inside the country, are treated as one separate source of income.  Assuming that this person had an income of £70 and succeeded in selling these investments or reducing his income to £20, he would be obliged next year to pay tax on the full £70, even though he had changed into Irish investments. The Irish investment comes under a different schedule and is regarded as a different source of income.  Therefore, it would be treated as new income and the investor would have to pay twice.  I consulted an authority on the matter and I was told that the way in which the two classes of investments <Col N="909" /> were divided was accidental.  I am not suggesting to the Minister that he should give me an answer to this question now.  I am not suggesting, either, that I have stated the position correctly but I know that in one or two cases that is the way the matter worked out.  Perhaps the Minister would look into the question and see whether it is possible to include income from investments here and in Great Britain in the same source of income. If that were done, the transfer from a British investment to an Irish investment would not entail any additional payment of income-tax and would leave the investor in the same position as before, which, I think the Minister will agree, is desirable.</P>
    <P>Another matter on which I feel rather strongly and which I would ask the Minister to inquire into is that of the taxation of profits of companies operating here when those profits are put back into the industry for capital purposes.  Any investigation of the majority of our smaller companies would, I think, show that the majority are suffering from lack of adequate capital.  If they succeed in making a profit, it is highly desirable in the interest of the company itself, in the interest of employment and in the interest of the ultimate taxable capacity of the country that as large a portion of that profit as possible should go back into the industry by way of reserve, for the buying of new machinery, the extension of buildings or any other work which may be deemed desirable.  Before that money goes back into the industry, the State takes 5/- in the £, or 25 per cent. of it. If the profits are divided amongst shareholders or partners, I have no objection whatever to their being obliged to pay the proper amount of income-tax, but where the profits are put back into the industry some concession should be made.  When income-tax was 3/- in the £, it was bad enough but now that it is 5/- in the £, it means taking 25 per cent. of the money that ought to go back as capital.  If the company were a new one and came under the Minister's scheme of last year, it would enjoy a 20 per cent. reduction of tax, but if it is not, the <Col N="910" /> full 5/- must be paid.  If the firm happens to make a profit of £5,000 or over, not only is there a tax of 5/- in the £ but there is also Corporation Profits Tax of 1/6 in the £ or, in all, 6/6 in the £, or one-third of the profits, even though the money is being put back into the business.  That ought to be looked into and some concession should be made.  While it might seem as if the total amount received by the State in tax would be less, in practice it would not be so, because in course of time the State would inevitably benefit by the money which went back into the business.  It may be argued that if money is put into a reserve, it may afterwards be taken out and divided as profits, thus leading to a certain amount of tax evasion.  My answer to that is that if the State agrees to free money placed in reserve from tax or to fix a low rate of tax for it, then any money taken out of reserve for the purpose of paying dividends should be subject to tax, so that the State would not lose.  This is a case in which the Government, if they really want to help industries in this country, could give real assistance.  I am not pleading in respect of the payment by the individual.  I am pleading for a reduction of the tax charged on profits which go back to increase the capacity for employment and the productive capacity of the industry.  At present, the State takes 25 per cent. or 33? of these moneys, as the case may be.  I could argue this matter at considerably greater length but I think the Minister knows exactly what I am driving at and I hope the Government will consider the matter before the next Budget is introduced.</P>

She said that the fact that we had, in certain circumstances, excluded from the calculation of means certain amenities which a person enjoyed not as of right but as of privilege had given rise to one of the greatest public scandals that had ever occurred in any country.  She went on to refer to cases where people who had wireless <Col N="911" /> sets, motor cars, and large houses had become entitled to pensions owing to the operation of the Act of 1932.  It is not our desire that people who are not properly entitled to pensions should receive them.  If Senator Miss Browne would be good enough to give me particulars of the cases she has in mind, I shall have them investigated.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question raised by Senator Wilson as to the rate of interest on local loans, and the plea made by Senator O'Rourke that the rate of interest should be reduced in respect of housing schemes, I should like to point out that the very generous grants made under the Housing Act of last year were fixed having regard to the rate of interest which then prevailed.  They were fixed on such a basis as would enable local authorities to build houses and to let them at rents which would be approximately half what such houses would have been let at under preceding Housing Acts.  The point I wish to make is that the rate of interest on local loans cannot be considered apart from the very substantial increase made in respect of the grants for housing.  If those two facts are taken in conjunction, it will be found that their co-operation is such as to enable this very substantial reduction in the rents to be made.</P>
      <P>With regard to the criticism of Senator Jameson, I should like to say, firstly, that I understand that the volume of Estimates for the Public Services was in the possession of members of the Dáil on Tuesday or Wednesday last.  I do not know whether there was any delay in supplying them to members of the Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If my Department has been in any way responsible for that, I should like to express my regret to the House for any inconvenience it may have occasioned them.  At the same time, I should like to say that, as a general rule, the Estimates are not discussed at any great length on <Col N="912" /> the Vote on Account.  A further opportunity will arise when the Appropriation Bill comes before the Seanad for the consideration of the Estimates in greater detail.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point as to the Guarantee Fund advance, the position is that there is statutory authority at the moment to fill the Guarantee Fund or the Purchase Annuities Fund.  Accordingly, in order to keep the bookkeeping right, the Estimate for £1,616,000, to which Senator Jameson has referred, has had to be introduced.  It is one of the Supplementary Estimates which the Dáil has passed, and it forms part of a sum of £2,694,000 referred to in this Bill.  The position, as matters stand, is that we would have to keep the Guarantee Fund or the Purchase Annuities Fund up to the figure of £2,978,000 next year.  But we are expecting that we shall have the new Land Bill before the Dáil and Seanad some time before it becomes necessary to clear the Guarantee Fund next year and that we will be able to make the necessary legislative provision to obviate the necessity for introducing a similar estimate next year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Emergency Grants-in-Aid, we could not make a definite provision in these estimates for bounties and claims of that nature.  There has been much criticism of these bounties and we have heard the statement made often that the farmer gets no benefit from them, that they are altogether insufficient, while they are the maximum that the State could, in any event, afford. Their payment has been so interlinked with the question of the payment of the Land Annuities proper to the Exchequer that we are having the matter fully considered.  It has been decided to continue the bounties in any event until the 30th April.  Before that date arrives, the Government will be in a position to announce more definitely its intentions with regard to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Relief Schemes, I am not going to say that we are so optimistic as to feel that £150,000 will be sufficient to deal with the want and destitution which exist on account of <Col N="913" /> unemployment.  At the same time, it has to be remembered that in the Estimates we are making very substantial provision for public works. I have referred to the additional provision of £1,600,000 under the Local Loans Fund and the additional provision of over £200,000 on the Local Government Vote.  Remember that, last year, schemes had to be improvised rather hurriedly.  This year, the local authorities had a very clear indication of what the Government policy is in these matters.  We have given them encouragement to go ahead with public works of a nature which will yield a permanent return to the State.  Accordingly, we are of opinion that it will not be necessary to make anything like the provision for relief works next year that was made last year.  What the actual provision will be will have to be determined when we have before us the definite estimates for revenue for the coming year.  We shall have, in regard to that matter and in regard to all other matters, to cut our coats according to our cloth, and we shall have to take into consideration the limitation of our own resources and the fact that we are encouraging local authorities to undertake constructional works on a very wide scale.  We do hope that the effect of these works will be to reduce the provision which otherwise might have to be made for the relief of destitution and want.</P>
    <P>With regard to the points made by Senator O'Rourke as to the reduction in the local taxation grants, that, like the question of bounties, is linked with the question of the land annuities.  We have given very substantial reductions in the land annuities which will cost the Exchequer in a full year not less than £2,200,000.  If, as an offset against that, we reduce the local taxation grant by £450,000, I think the balance of advantage is on the side of the agricultural ratepayer.  In passing, I should like to deal for a minute with the example which Senator O'Rourke gave as indicating the hard plight of the farmer at the present moment.  I understood him to say that, when a certain farmer had sold <Col N="914" /> eight cattle in Great Britain, he had to pay £39 in duty on them.  I do not know whether my calculations are right but that would seem to indicate that that particular farmer&mdash;I may possibly be crediting him with more business acumen than he possessed&mdash; received something in the neighbourhood of £17 or £17 10s. per beast and, in addition to that, he would have received, possibly, £1 15s. by way of export bounty if he sent his cattle over the Six-County Border or £2 3s. 9d. if he exported them through the port of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  I have a bill here showing that a man made £20 on the other side but had only £13 returned to him.  There was a duty of £6 6s. per head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with this particular matter.  I may be wrong, but I assume that having sold his cattle at £17 10s., he would get 10 per cent or 12½ per cent. in respect of bounty on them.  If my argument is right, it would look as if he had got something in the neighbourhood of £19 5s. or £19 13s. per beast.  I am not in a position to say whether that is a generous price for that particular type of beast or not but, at any rate, it is far removed from the poverty line and it would indicate, at any rate, that cattle have some real value even under present adverse circumstances.  As I say, I am not a farmer and I do not know whether that would be regarded as a generous price, but it does indicate that the cattle trade is not altogether in the very parlous state that has been represented to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the points made by Senator Douglas, I should like to have much more definite particulars than he has been able to give in the course of this debate before expressing an opinion as to whether anything could be done to relieve the position which he has described.  I should like however, in that connection, to say that, at first thought, it appears to me that it would not be possible to include in one and the same category incomes <Col N="915" /> derived from internal and external investments.  Difficulty would arise because of the fact that we have a double income tax agreement with our neighbours on the other side of the water and, for the purpose of making claims for refunds under that agreement, it is necessary that we should be able to check those claims with the British revenue authorities and that they should be able to check the corresponding claims with us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>My point was not that it should be returned in the one category but that, for the purpose of treating them as sources of income in relation to the payment of taxation, they might be treated as one.  If you have one source of income from investments and another one from salary, they are all treated as different sources. If one ceases altogether, you do not have to pay in the year in which you have not received it, but, if it partially ceases, you have to pay on the whole amount.  That is how it works out.</P>

      <P>I should be glad if the Senator would be good enough to do so.  With regard to the other point as to whether it would be possible to exempt from income tax the profits derived from a business which are reinvested in the business, as the Senator euphemistically puts it, &ldquo;for the benefit of the industry,&rdquo; if they are reinvested in the business, it is not for the benefit of the industry, but for the benefit of the proprietor of the business, who is in exactly the same position in regard to his own business and the investments he would make therein as he would be in regard to any investment he would make in some other person's business.  He would put his profits, that is, his income, back <Col N="916" /> into this business, and I am sure that, first of all, he would not dream of putting them back unless he was certain that it was going to yield him a certain profit.  It would yield that profit and, if you once conceded the principle, it would seem to me that it would ultimately resolve itself in this way that we would have to exempt altogether from income tax any profits derived from a manufacturing business or, in fact, any other sort of business.  Apart altogether from that, we should thus be in this position that, whereas we should tax the clerk earning an income in the business, or a manager, or possibly a foreman who is earning an income in the business, whereas everybody employed in the business might be liable for income tax, we should have to exempt the man who owned the business and who was drawing a profit on the whole thing.  Apart altogether from the logical extension&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Every man who owned an individual concern could turn it into a private company or corporation and it would be quite impossible to administer a concession of that sort and, accordingly, I should like to say at this stage that I can hold out no hope that the Government, anxious and all as it is to develop Irish industry, will be able to grant an exemption of the sort indicated by Senator Douglas.</P>

      <P>These motions do not originate there, anyway, and it is only when the Minister concerned or some harassed official asks me to do so, that it is done.  I take it that the Central Fund Bill in its very nature is a late Bill.  It is compiled in relation to figures that come in only towards the end of the financial year and it is in the nature of things that it should be late.  Also, whatever other delay has taken place was caused in the Dáil where the Opposition had a good innings and it is not our fault that the Bill is rushed upon us.  I did my best to give the greatest possible notice of this motion.  I asked the Cathaoirleach last week, and he kindly consented to do so, to announce verbally that this motion was being tabled for this week. That gave Senators a full week to bring forward any recommendation they felt inclined to bring forward.  I might also add that not for the last 12 years has the Seanad ever sent forward a recommendation to the Central Fund Bill, so that generally, apparently, these Bills are only Second Reading Bills in this House.  There is, therefore, really no great hardship inflicted on the Seanad.  The urgency of this Bill, I am sure, is quite clear to every Senator.  The Bill must be through by the end of the month, otherwise matters will be difficult for the Government.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that I am sure we all sympathise with Senator Robinson in having to act the part of a gramophone&mdash;&ldquo;His Master's Voice&rdquo; kind of thing&mdash;but it has been done by other Parties and we do not blame him one little bit and particularly in this case.  I am glad that he has given me an opportunity of pointing out to the Minister that he either totally evaded or misunderstood the case I put with regard to profits which were put back into a business.  I should like to ask whether if an individual invests money in a speculative investment and is happy enough to make capital profit, he has to pay any income tax?  The Minister, I think, will answer that he does not pay any income tax whatever on the capital appreciation which he may achieve.  If he happens to prefer to put the money back for the purpose of extending the industry, instead of paying it to himself or his partners which he can do at the present moment, I hold that he is helping the country as a whole.  If he takes the profits and puts them into his own pocket and then invests them in some other investment, possibly outside the country, he is giving the minimum amount of benefit.  If, on the other hand, he puts the money back into new buildings, machinery or definite improvements he may ultimately gain in the sense that he will get further <Col N="919" /> profits on which he will pay tax. On any ultimate gain he will have he will pay his tax and there is a very great distinction between money that is put back, with the risk involved&mdash; and increasing an industry&mdash;and money paid out to an individual.  The Minister can see no difference according to his own speech.  Whether it is right or not to make the distinction is a matter which he and the Government will have to decide but, when he says there is no difference, I must join issue with him.  I think there is a very great difference and a difference which the State might very well take into consideration.  I do not suggest that the whole amount of the profits should be allowed free of tax even if they were all put back into the business; but I say that it is in the State interest, and I am pleading for something that would make it easier to put them back into the business for purposes of extension which I hold is what we want.  I am not speaking now of my own case at all.  I know of many other cases and I have been approached by a number of manufacturers on the matter.  I see that the Federation of Irish Industries raised this matter, or a kindred matter, at their conference the other day&mdash;I think it was yesterday&mdash;and I know that the case which I am putting is not an individual case but that it is a view held by a great many people.  I am quite certain that the State would gain by giving some exemption on money so put back and that to hinder the same is a great mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years ago I made a proposition, more or less informally, on the same lines and was told by a person well informed on these matters that it was a dangerous idea to get abroad and was administratively impracticable and generally unsound. It may be administratively impracticable, but I am satisfied that it is sound if one starts off with the idea which, I think, the Government on the whole supports, that individual wealth should be considered as trust moneys&mdash;that the individual wealthy man, who has a <Col N="920" /> large sum of money at his disposal, if he disposes of it in a way which is advantageous to the community and not on his personal fancies or upkeep or maintenance or luxuries, and actually administers his wealth for public benefit, uses it in effect as a public fund.  It seems to me undesirable theoretically and in principle to treat the income of a man, who spends that income on the fulfilment of his own desires of a personal nature, in the same way as you treat the income of a man who uses his income as a trust and spends it for what are recognised to be public benefits.  It is on that ground that I think there is something to be said in favour of the proposition which Senator Douglas has put forward.</P>
      <P>As to the impracticability, that is another matter.  It may be that it would open the way to evasions by those people who do not treat their funds as trust funds.  On that ground the proposition may be quite unsound, but I do not think it should be turned down on the grounds which the Minister himself put forward, as though the income of the taxpayer were equal, no matter what he did with it, for tax purposes and because the money re-spent in the industry is still the property of the individual.  While that is quite true, I think it is an undesirable way of looking at the problem of the better utilisation of the individual's wealth.  I am afraid that the Minister, if he examines this matter closely, will find that when he puts forward that objection he is adopting the very individualistic outlook and the Victorian view of finance and the responsibility of personal wealth.  I think there is more to be said for this proposition than the Minister gives credit for; but if he is not prepared to concede anything on those lines I submit that the alternative is to make a discrimination on all incomes that are drawn from Irish industries as against incomes which are drawn from investments in British or other industries external to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Perhaps the Minister did not understand me, but I want to put my point to him again. My point was in connection with the money in the Local Loans and my suggestion was that as the money was collected or raised in taxation it should be issued free to the local authorities in order to enable them to build these houses.  I cannot see how the grant, which he says is a consideration to be taken into account, would be made up in the future by the Exchequer as it is received, when these repayments are made by the county councils which get this money, and that, in fact, it would be creating a property for the Minister for Finance in the future; whereas a distinction should be drawn clearly between this money loaned from taxation as against money issued from loan. I do not think the Minister understands me, perhaps, but I think that the money should not be charged for at the rate of 6½ per cent. for an object, which, after all, is a very good social object&mdash;the building of houses for the poor people of the country and particularly for the agricultural labouring people.</P>
      <P>The Minister also made a remark about the Guarantee Fund.  As I understand it, next half year the land annuities will be collectible only as to 50 per cent.  In what way will that be brought into operation?  Will the Bill about which the Minister speaks be passed before the next gale day or what will take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out to the Minister that, while we have been talking so much about the income tax, there is one disability from which businesses in the Free State suffer very much as compared with businesses on the other side of the water, and that is the Corporation Profits Tax.  That tax was put on in Great Britain for a war purpose and when we found it carried on here in times of peace I went to the late Minister for Finance and I got out of him a declaration that as soon as <Col N="922" /> possible financially he would take off that tax because, as he admitted, it was a very serious charge against businesses.  Our present Government, however, have added strokes to it instead of taking it off, and instead of it being 5 per cent., it is now 7½ per cent.  This is over and above income tax and it is a very distinct crippling handicap on Irish businesses competing with businesses across the water.  On Senator Johnson's own showing, it comes in even if you want to put money back into your business.  First of all, you have got to pay the same income tax as the people across the water and then you are charged 7½ per cent. in addition.  The late Minister for Finance practically justified it by saying that as it was only on a few firms which paid such large amounts he could not do without the money.  I think that is what he said.  But now the profits of the businesses which pay this have been reduced and the position now is that much smaller businesses pay this corporation profits tax than used to pay it.  As I have not had the pleasure of addressing the present Minister on the matter, I suggest that if he is looking into the handicap on Irish industries he should certainly look into this matter of having to pay 7½ per cent. more than anybody across the water has to pay.  I can assure the Minister that in a competitive business such as mine it is not a matter to be sneered at and that it would be a very good thing if the Minister could solve this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the point raised by <Col N="923" /> Senator Wilson I think that the misapprehension which lies under his whole argument is that the whole of the money in the Local Loans Fund is naturally going to be provided out of taxation.  I think that, in view of the fact that we are providing £1,600,000 more for local loans than last year, it is an appalling assumption on the part of Senator Wilson. Certainly I do not think that we would want to raise that out of taxation in any one year.  The theory I advanced on it last year was that a certain amount should be provided every year as a grant for local loans for the purpose of enabling them to carry out useful works and at comparatively low rates of interest.  At the same time, I also felt that if we were providing the authorities with assistance in any other way&mdash;that, in fixing the rates of interest, we should be entitled to take the additional forms of assistance into consideration and adjust our rates accordingly. Apart from the very generous increase in the housing grants we have also given very substantial grants for public health works.  For that reason, I felt that on the balance of the cost of these works which, in many cases, I think, was something about one-third or one-fourth of the whole, the authorities could pay more easily the current rate of interest, or interest at a rate which would be related to the rate at which the Government itself could borrow.  I think that we shall have to maintain that until the position becomes more normal.  When we reach that condition of affairs, then I think we will be able to reconsider the whole question of the rate of interest and possibly to reduce it even below what would represent the current rate at which money could be borrowed, so as to give the local authorities that additional inducement to carry on work.  But during the present stage of transition, as I might call it, which is naturally owing to the difference which has arisen between ourselves and our neighbours on the other side of the water, the whole general financial scheme of the Government <Col N="924" /> must be of a somewhat tentative nature.  I would not like to commit myself now to fixing a rate of interest which would represent what would be our final word on that matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Guarantee Fund I may say that the last date on which that matter would arise for consideration would be about the 18th February next; so, we hope that the new Land Bill, which would give effect to the Government's pledge, would be law long before that date.</P>
      <P>I am very well aware of the grievous way&mdash;and I do not wish to minimise it in any way&mdash;in which the Corporation Profits Tax does affect a rather large number of our joint stock undertakings, and in fact some undertakings which are not of that character.  At the same time I have to plead after all, as a final and incontrovertible reason for a Minister for Finance for imposing extra taxation, that under present circumstances it is unavoidable.  I realise that it would be desirable if some arrangement or some reconsideration of the whole position of the Corporation Profits Tax could be undertaken, and when times are better I promise that that will be one of the things I shall consider very carefully.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give the House some information as to the position of this Bill?  The original Bill I think was one of the longest Statutes passed since 1922 and was enacted with less than five minutes' consideration in either House.  It has <Col N="925" /> often been said that there should be a permanent Bill.  I am not pleading that the Army Bill should not come up annually.  I think it is desirable that it should come up annually for examination or re-affirmation, and that the Dáil and Seanad should have an opportunity to deal in detail with whatever Statutes govern the army. On the grounds that the existing Statute has had no consideration whatever in the Oireachtas I feel that there should be a promise from the Minister that a Bill, either the present one or some other one, should be brought to the House in some way with such amendments as are desirable and that the House should get an opportunity of examining it.  It is on that ground alone that I have been appealing for seven or eight years for re-consideration of the Defence Forces Bill.  One notices that it is like the Local Government Bill under which we are working, a Temporary Provisions Bill.  It was a Temporary Provisions Bill in 1923 and it is a Temporary Provisions Bill still.  I am sure it depends on the Minister how long it is to be temporary.</P>

      <P>How long this Bill is going to remain a temporary one does not, unfortunately, depend altogether upon me. The legal staff and the headquarters staff of the army have been working on the farming of a new Bill for the last nine months, and the only reason it is not here instead of this Bill is that it was impossible to get it through the draftsman's office in time. The draftsman's office is completely snowed under by the different Bills that have been brought forward.  The Bill is actually ready to go to the draftsman as soon as he is ready to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Standing Order 85 the Report Stage of the Land (Purchase Annuities Fund) Bill, 1933, be taken to-day.</P>
      <P>The remarks I made when dealing with a previous Bill apply also to this Bill.  If this Bill is not passed before the end of the month I understand that most of the councils will not be able to strike the rates.  I think the Minister made a good case last week for urgency and I hope the Seanad will allow the Bill to pass now.</P>

      <P>There are two verbal amendments which I shall ask the House to allow to be made on this stage pursuant to Standing Order 93.</P>
      <P>Section 55, sub-section (5).  After the word &ldquo;importer&rdquo; in line 28 the words &ldquo;registered maize meal dealer&rdquo; were inserted on Report. It is desired to insert the word &ldquo;a&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) of the new section inserted before Section 82 on the Report Stage on the motion of the Minister, it is desired to substitute the word &ldquo;mixtures&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;mixture&rdquo; in the first two places in which it occurs.</P>
