      <P>I would like to know from you, sir, if there is any rule in this House with regard to the observance of Church holidays.  As Senators are aware, Thursday next is a Church holiday.  I presume the Seanad will meet on Wednesday.  It would be well to know if the same rule will apply here which applies in the other House regarding Church holidays.  Very important events often take place in the country on such holidays, so that it would be well if we knew if the Seanad is going to observe the same rule that the Dáil observes.  Unless there is some very grave reason to the cotrary I think the Seanad should observe Church holidays.  I would like to know the feeling of the House as to what is likely to occur in future.</P>

If it was thought wise it could be so arranged that the House would not meet on Church holidays. At present the matter is optional, and the House decides for itself as each occasion arises.</P>

      <P>Before this Bill is passed I desire to say that my mind was a little troubled about a matter that I consider to be of the greatest importance.  When coming in I mentioned it to my old friend, Mr. Moylan, and he made the position perfectly clear to me.  At the same time the more the attention of the public is drawn to it the better.  I am referring to safety or emergency exits on buses. I notice that in a great proportion of the small and the large buses there are emergency exits, but large numbers of the older type of buses have no emergency exits.  A very serious accident occurred in the city two or three years ago, in the Coombe district, and if there had been an emergency exit on the bus that was concerned the results would not have been so serious.  I travel a great deal by bus.  I notice when coming into the city in the mornings that the buses are sometimes very much overcrowded.  In the old type of buses the door is next to the engine, while in the newer type the door is at the end of the bus. They are small folding doors and I noticed on Sunday last when going to Mass at Baldoyle that it took at least three minutes before the door could be opened.  What troubles me is the fear that if one of these buses, by any <Col N="1863" /> unfortunate mischance sideslipped and turned into the ditch the door would be closed and there would be no means of getting out.  Anyone who travels by buses knows that if they are over-crowded&mdash;and they are overcrowded practically every Sunday with people returning from the seaside&mdash;and if a fire occurred, or if a cigarette happened to get into clothing it would be dreadful to think what a holocaust would ensue.  I am drawing attention to the matter in order to strengthen the hands of the Minister and his officials in enforcing his powers, because I am afraid if precautions are not taken some dreadful accident may happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) (for Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>For some time past the Government have been considering the question of providing our requirements in cement from factories set up in the Irish Free State, and we are interested in proceeding, at the earliest possible moment, with the setting up of these factories as part of our general industrial policy.  As Senators know, the demand for cement has been increasing.  Owing to the wide use of cement, and owing to extensive building programmes, not to speak of road works, which are in contemplation, and which may be carried out during coming years, the demand is likely to increase.  We are in the fortunate position in this country that we have available at many points very large quantities of the raw materials necessary for the successful working of this industry. At the present time our capacity is something like 200,000 tons of cement per year, and it has been estimated that about two factories will be necessary of 100,000 tons capacity in each case, to supply the existing demand. That is supposing that our total requirements are supplied from home sources.  If the demand for cement <Col N="1864" /> for various purposes continues to increase, as it has been increasing, it is possible that a third factory may be necessary.  From the investigations and discussions which have taken place regarding this matter the Government feel that the persons responsible for the building of the factory, the proprietors, will endeavour to build at points where the demand for cement is likely to be considerable, so as to reduce transport costs. The price of cement, which is a very important matter in connection with the proposals in this Bill, is not ascertainable, at the moment, as a firm figure.  We do not know that until we are granted the powers which we seek in the Bill.  We are not in a position to say what the figure for cement is likely to be.  To a great extent it will turn on the location of the factories.  The proprietors and the people who are setting up the industry will have to take that matter closely into consideration.  Even as regards power costs and labour costs we are not in a position to say what they are likely to be now, but we feel&mdash;and this is the reason we have brought in the Bill&mdash;that the Minister should have certain powers which will enable him to give to whomever he grants a licence to set up a factory or factories to carry on the business, without being threatened with an undue importation of cement at a much lower price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in the position here at present that the Irish Free State is said to be one of the few free markets for cement, if not the only one.  Nearly all other territories are divided up between the different cartels and monopolies and the result is that the price of cement in practically every other country is regulated by the manufacturers or by combines of manufacturers.  In this country, we have benefited considerably, up to the present, by reason of the fact that we are a free market and that all these various syndicates are dumping&mdash;I think I may use the word&mdash;cement into the Irish Free State at a price much lower than the price in Great Britain at present and a price, which, although I have not gone into the details, I think I would be justified in describing <Col N="1865" /> as below the cost of production.</P>
    <P>If we are to set up this cement industry in this country, I am afraid it would be impossible to fix the price of cement, therefore, at the price which rules at the present time.  There will be an increase in price, but it is hoped that that increase will be gradual.</P>
    <P>Under Section 12 of the Bill, the Minister lays down certain conditions appertaining to the granting of licences.  I should say that the general scheme of the Bill is that the Minister should have power to grant licences to a manufacturer of cement to set up a factory in this country and also to give him power to grant licences for the importation of cement.  It is considered that it will be necessary, while the factories are being built and the supply of cement is being obtained from home sources, to control the importation of cement.  Therefore, broadly speaking, there are two considerable powers which the Minister is looking for under this Bill.  One is the power to grant licences to manufacturers to set up factories for the production of cement and the other is to grant licences regulating the importation of cement.</P>
    <P>With regard to the licence for the manufacture of cement, a section in the Bill, Section 12, lays down all the various matters in respect of which the Minister may attach conditions to a licence.  He may, for example, attach conditions regarding the extent to which raw materials or articles necessary for the production of cement are secured from sources within the Irish Free State or regarding the extent to which he considers it advisable that nationals of the Irish Free State should be employed in these factories.  He may also lay down conditions, somewhat in the same manner, Senators will remember, as were laid down in the Control of Manufactures Act, which, in this particular respect, this Bill follows: he may also lay down conditions regarding the amount of capital which it is necessary to have in the business and the amount provided by Irish Free State nationals. He may also lay down conditions regarding the management of the <Col N="1866" /> business and to ensure that the management should, so far as possible, be in the hands of Irish Free State nationals, but the most important conditions, perhaps, that the Minister will seek to attach to whatever licences he may grant are those regarding the nature and quality of the cement manufactured and the maximum price which may be charged for cement manufactured at each factory.</P>
    <P>We had been asked to put in this Bill a standard specification, laying down exactly the quality of cement which it would be necessary to produce in order to get a licence, because, as Senators will realise, the price fixed and the price which the Minister must agree to and which will be laid down in the licence will largely be regulated by the quality and nature of the cement to be produced.  It is hoped, however, that the question of the specification of the cement will be dealt with in subsequent regulations and it has not been thought advisable to lay down the standard specification at this juncture in the Bill itself. Therefore, the safeguard that we have, with regard to the price of cement, is that the quality of the cement and the price charged will be such as the Minister agrees to.</P>
    <P>There are various other conditions which he may attach to the licence for the manufacture of cement, but these, I think, are the most important.  I wish, therefore, to emphasise this fact that we do not anticipate, if this industry is established and the factories are got going, that the price which will be fixed and which the Minister will have to sanction will be the same as the price which now rules in respect of the Irish Free State market.  It is anticipated that the price will be somewhat higher.  It would not be an economic proposition for people to come in here and invest large sums of money under present conditions. I believe that the capital necessary in respect of each factory might run up to £500,000.  Something between £400,000 and £500,000 has been stated as the amount of capital necessary and, obviously, it would be impossible to get cement manufacturers to undertake the business unless they had <Col N="1867" /> some security in regard to unfair competition and unless there is some guarantee that they can make a reasonable profit and that they are going to cover their costs of production and their usual expenses.  The Minister must, therefore, be satisfied as to the price before he grants the licence.  It is anticipated that the price will increase but not to a very great extent, but that there will be a gradual increase during the period between the time when the Bill becomes law and when the cement factories are capable of producing our total requirements.</P>
    <P>In the event of a person, to whom a licence has been granted for the manufacture of cement, breaking any of the conditions laid down by the Minister, he will be subject to a penalty not exceeding £100, plus a fine not exceeding £50 for every day during which the offence of breach of the conditions laid down in the licence continues and, under another section of the Bill, the Minister has the additional power to revoke a licence which has been granted, if he is satisfied that the conditions have not been observed.</P>
    <P>Parts III and IV of the Bill are somewhat novel.  They deal with the compulsory acquisition of land for the purpose of cement factories and for the purpose of certain transport works which have to be set up in connection with the running of these factories. We are very anxious to have the factories established at the earliest possible moment and we thought, when we were putting these proposals before the Oireachtas, that it would be advisable to include this provision for the acquisition of land because, normally, of course, as Senators know, it would be necessary to proceed by way of private Bill, to have hearings in committee, and there might be some vexatious delays and vexatious claims made which would tend to hamper the quick establishment of the industry.  I think that, within these two Parts, consistent with getting the industry established as soon as possible and removing the danger of vexatious <Col N="1868" /> delays or hindrances, we have given fairly appropriate safeguards.  The Minister, for example, if an application be made to him for an order making compulsory the acquisition of certain lands, has to consider any representations that will be made to him in connection with the application and may not come to a decision within six weeks.  If it is found impossible to reach agreement regarding the compulsory acquisition of the land, the matter is referred to an arbitrator in the same manner as is provided under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  In addition to that, all orders made by the Minister in respect of compulsory acquisition of land or in connection with the provision of facilities for transport works will have to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, who may annul the orders if they see fit. I think these two Parts of the Bill will be recognised as being necessary for the establishment, at the earliest possible moment, of the industry.</P>
    <P>Part V is an important part of the Bill and it deals with the second matter of licences.  The first matter, as I have pointed out, is the question of the licence for the manufacture of cement.  The Minister may grant a licence for that purpose and may attach certain conditions.  I have given the Seanad an outline of some of the conditions and all the conditions are set out in Section 12.  Part V deals with the licences for the importation of cement.  It would be very anomalous if the cement factory were established, capital invested in it and the industry got going in a particular part of the Free State, that, within the area served by that factory, cement importation should be allowed to continue.  At the present rates, it would be impossible for the factory to compete and the Minister seeks power here to restrict the importation of cement and to grant licences to importers provided that certain conditions set out in Section 30 are fulfilled. The Minister will, during the period which must elapse before we are able to supply our total requirements from home sources, be prepared to grant <Col N="1869" /> licences but he will endeavour to see that, in whatever steps he takes in connection with the matter, he will not interfere with the success of a particular factory serving a particular area. This has been a rather troublesome matter and it is difficult to set up suitable machinery which, while allowing persons who cannot procure cement from the factories to import it, will, at the same time, achieve the end desired by the Minister, that is to say, will not interfere with the success of these new factories, but it is believed that by granting these licences, on which a fee will be chargeable in accordance with the amount of cement that is being imported, the difficulty will be overcome.  A fee will definitely be charged on each licence in proportion to the total tonnage of cement which it is proposed to import. It is thought that, in the beginning, the fee will be something like 6d. per ton on foreign cement and 5/6 per ton on British cement.</P>
    <P>During the 18 months when the factories are being established and the industry set up, these fees may be increased, because, as I have already pointed out, we have to face the fact that the price of cement will increase, but it is not anticipated that it will increase to a very substantial degree. I am not in a position to state definitely what figure cement will, in fact, be produced at in the Irish Free State.  There is the question of quality and the question of the specification which have yet to be dealt with.  There is also the fact that, although the Government has been in consultation with groups&mdash;I think there are two definite groups interested&mdash;and proposals have been handed in to the Minister of Industry and Commerce, nothing in the way of a definite decision has yet been reached, so that it would be impossible for me to tell the Seanad at the moment what the ultimate price of cement will be.  I can only say that it is anticipated that the price will be something over 32/- per ton. It may be 34/-, or it may be 36/-.  I cannot give a definite figure.  But, I think that we can take it that it will be over 32/-, and that cement imported <Col N="1870" /> into the country, pending the setting up of these factories, will have to pay a fee which will be regulated according to the amount of cement imported and regulated also in view of the ultimate price which the Minister will shortly be in a position to announce. But for the first three months it is thought that the fee will be nominal: 6d. a ton on foreign cement, and in the case of British cement, on account of the emergency duties which we have imposed, something like 5/6.</P>
    <P>It will be stated probably in opposition to these proposals that they tend to increase the cost of housing.  They do, but from the inquiries I have made, I think the increase is very small indeed.  I have been told that even a 4/- increase in price would only mean a very small, an almost infinitesimal, increase in the cost of the production of a single house. Under this Part of the Bill the Minister reserves to himself the right to refuse to grant licences for the importation of cement.  There must be a certain amount of discretion left to the Minister in view of the fact that we have got to give these factories an economic basis to work on, but, consistent with that general plan and general policy, it will be the duty of the Minister to see that the price of cement is properly regulated; that the quality is of the highest standard possible, and that the price is as moderate as may be.  In connection with these licences for the importation of cement, the full particulars regarding each particular import licence will be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiuil.</i></P>
    <P>With regard to the factories I should also say that their allocation will depend largely upon the arrangements made by the cement manufacturers themselves.  We know definitely that it is their intention, if these proposals go forward, to set up factories in areas where consumption is large and where they will be near a market.  If one factory is established in the east and one in the south of 100,000 tons output in each case that will be sufficient to cater for our present requirements.  Later on, if the demand for cement increases we may have a third factory which I hope <Col N="1871" /> may be allocated to the western area. The amount of employment estimated for the two factories in the east and south is something between 400 and 500 men employed directly.  There will, of course, be other advantages. Employment will be given in connection with transport and distribution: in fact probably more employment will be given in the distribution of this cement from inland centres than is at present given in the distribution from the ports.  The cement will have to be distributed from two or three centres, and Senators will recognise that a good deal of indirect employment will be given in addition to the direct employment in the factories themselves.  I think these are the main points in connection with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal of the enthusiasm that might otherwise be created by the establishment of two cement factories will be modified, I think, by the announcement of the Minister that the cost of cement is going to go up.  The Minister is unable to say with any certainty, even approximately, what the amount of the increase is going to be.  I take it the policy will be to enable manufacturers to charge what the Minister will consider an economic price: that is a price that will pay for the cost of production, interest on capital, sinking fund and so on.  If these factories are not worked very efficiently, needless to say the charges that will enable these costs to be realised will be high in proportion to the extent to which the cost of a commodity like cement goes up, and to the same extent will housing be affected.  It will be a terrible shock to those interested in pushing on housing programmes to learn that a serious impediment is likely to be placed in the way by an increase in the price of cement. Cement is becoming very popular in the erection of houses.  It is used to a tremendous extent now.  Personally for that reason alone I should not be very sorry if I saw something happen that would cause builders to go back to bricks because I think they are infinitely preferable to concrete.  I <Col N="1872" /> am afraid they are not going to do that so that one of the big results from this may be a slowing down in the carrying through of housing programmes.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that there may be 400 or 500 men employed in the two factories.  Well that is not a tremendous number.  You might easily, by a slowing down in house building, disemploy four or five times that number.  It is, I think, notorious that the amount of labour employed by cement factories is very small in proportion to the total output.  The Minister did indicate that more people might be employed in the transport and distribution of cement after these two factories are erected than is now the case.  Well, that would mean that the cost of production would be added to and that the cost of cement would be further added to.  It would mean uneconomic distribution, if that is the case: an addition to the labour costs, and consequently a further increase in price.  One of the alleged drawbacks in regard to housing is the high cost of building so that anything that would tend to increase the present cost would be disastrous in present circumstances. We have the great advantage that at the present time cement is being made available here at a cheaper rate than in any other country in Europe.  In view of the housing programmes in hands, that is a tremendous advantage. If we are going to imperil that by allowing the price of cement to be increased unduly for the sake of employing 400 people, and at the risk of disemploying perhaps 2,000 people, I do not know that it is a very statesmanlike move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem to me that if eventually we give a complete monopoly of the cement requirements of this State to a couple of people&mdash;to a few factories&mdash;then we should insist that they will sell cement at world prices, not at the price perhaps that it is being sold now in the Free State, but at world prices.  Why should the Irish people have to pay more than the world price for cement?  Surely we should have our housing materials as cheap as the people of any other country, and in view of the tremendous <Col N="1873" /> leeway that we have to make up in this direction I think we should be very careful not to impose an undue burden on those who have set out to solve that very big and difficult problem.  I hope, therefore, that the Ministry will be exceedingly careful, when these factories are set up, to see that the country is not exploited.  Once they are established, of course, one cannot allow them to go down if at all possible. That may mean charging a price for cement that will be out of all proportion to the price charged elsewhere: that will be out of all proportion to what we should pay, having regard to the world price.</P>
    <P>I notice that Section 4 of the Bill provides that &ldquo;The Control of Manufactures Act, 1932, shall not apply to the process of manufacturing cement.&rdquo; That is an extraordinary proposal.  It is less than a year since that Act was passed.  It was said at the time that the Act was extremely necessary in order to prevent Irish industries being captured and exploited by aliens. Yet, here in the very first Bill almost under which it is proposed to set up a real industry that particular Act is set aside so that the much hated alien is allowed to come in and exploit the cement industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that under Section 12 the Minister has power, which I hope he will take advantage of, to attach conditions such as those which I mentioned in my opening statement regarding the ownership and control of the industry and employment in it?  The Control of Manufactures Act is not necessary, I think, in this particular case in view of the fact that conditions can be attached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case it was considered necessary to set aside that Act.  Perhaps the Minister will say that Section 12 will prevent aliens from owning more than 50 per cent. of the capital in the cement industry.  If it does, of course it is almost equivalent to the Control of Manufactures Act, but it is rather significant that that particular Act has been set aside so quickly, particularly in regard to what is expected to be a permanent industry here.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on his frank and lucid explanation of the Bill, particularly in view of the fact that he is only acting here as deputy.  I think we are all grateful to him for putting the purpose of the Bill so frankly and clearly before us.  To my mind this is absolutely an experiment, a somewhat doubtful experiment, but it is part of the general policy of a Government which proposes, by every means in its power, to arrange that all possible articles shall be manufactured in this country.  With that as a general policy, as something to be aimed at, I certainly am not going to disagree. We have, however, a case here which shows clearly the difficulties that are involved in a policy of that kind.  I frankly admit that, in some respects, this Government have discovered in a way not previously discovered that certain goods can be manufactured at a reasonable price for a country with a population of 3,000,000 people&mdash;goods not previously manufactured here. They have also discovered that some other goods can only be manufactured here at a very much higher price.  Now as to the goods that can be manufactured at the same price as outside, there is no doubt whatever that any step taken by this or any other Government to ensure this manufacture here is highly desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they can only be manufactured at an increased price it may nevertheless be desirable that they should be manufactured here.  That is particularly the case where the articles are of a luxury or semi-luxury character and are not in any sense a national necessity.  It may also be the case where the amount of employment given is so large proportionately that the gain to the country is worth the increased cost which the consumer has to pay. Where, however, the article which you desire to have manufactured here is one which is required by the whole population, and particularly one that is required by the poorer sections of the population, you have to hesitate a great deal and very carefully measure the benefits before you decide that that article should be manufactured here if the cost is to be substantially, <Col N="1875" /> or even to any extent, increased.  I should like to ask the Minister if he could give us, when he is replying, some idea of the amount of employment which he anticipates in the two factories.  He used a figure, I think of 500, but he then went on to refer to a certain increased cost in distribution, and it was not clear to me whether the 500 included such employment, or whether it specifically referred to the two factories.  Personally I cannot see why there should be any substantially increased employment in distribution, because if the cement is used it has to be distributed at the present time, so whether it is imported and distributed, or whether manufactured here and distributed, it does not seem to me that there should be much if any difference ultimately.  I do not see how you can count on any increased employment on the grounds of distribution.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell referred to the fact that the Control of Manufactures Act did not apply to this Bill.  I think if he will read Section 12 carefully, he will realise that the scheme proposed here obviously would have to cut out some, at any rate, of the provisions of that Act.  In the policy outlined in the Control of Manufactures Act, it was intended to limit the number of persons who would come in here, invest capital and manufacture in industries which were being protected and which, therefore, might in certain cases be an attractive market for manufacturers.</P>
    <P>To my mind if you adopt for a small country of 3,000,000, a full protectionist policy you must have some such Act as the Control of Manufactures Act, whether you like it or not, because the area is small. If persons, particularly our own nationals, are going to be persuaded to invest money in industry, when the total consumption inside the protected area is small, they must have some kind of assurance that there will be a limit to the amount of manufacture which will take place. Otherwise, if you have no such provision what will inevitably happen will be that a number of small <Col N="1876" /> persons will start in these industries, and at a later date some large combine will come in, and if they are perfectly free they can put the smaller people out of business, after these people have proved that the market is there.</P>
    <P>If the area is small, it does not seem to me that you could possibly adopt a protectionist policy such as is being adopted at the present time without some such restrictive provisions as there are in the Control of Manufactures Act or such as are proposed here.  But we have to face the fact that provisions of that kind are creating difficulties in themselves, and unless I read into the Minister's speech and into this Bill something which is not in any way intended, I think that that very Control of Manufactures Act, which is more or less necessary, has prevented the establishment under the ordinary normal procedure of large industries such as the manufacture of cement. I am not expressing any opinion about this industry because I do not know anything about cement, but we have to consider whether the Government are justified in this experiment or not.  I look upon it as an experiment which is rather doubtful because it touches the provision of housing which is essential in this country.  To get your cement factories established you have got to have a closed market.  You have to provide that after what the Minister considers the requisite number of factories or the requisite capacity to manufacture has been obtained, then the market will be closed and there will be no further importation from outside.  I find it difficult to make up my mind as to whether the drawbacks of a closed market in industries of this kind may not prove greater than the admitted advantages which will accrue by establishing these industries.  I think it is one of those things which can only be solved after it is tried out.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out several rather unsatisfactory provisions in the Bill.  They are provisions which will be almost certainly followed in similar Bills which may be introduced for <Col N="1877" /> other commodities in order to provide a closed market.  Senator O'Farrell drew attention to the Control of Manufactures Act.  The Minister interrupted him and pointed to the provisions of Section 12.  I should like to point out to the House that Section 12 means that the Minister sets out to specify a Control of Manufactures Act for every licence and the provisions for one firm may be different to those which are given to another.  One firm may be allowed to manufacture with 50 per cent.  Irish capital.  In another firm the Minister may insist on 75 per cent.  Irish capital, while in a third there may be only one per cent.  Irish capital.  That is a matter that is entirely at the discretion of the Minister.  I think that there is very grave danger that in conditions of that kind you may create a great deal of feeling and much dissatisfaction. Further, I am not sure that it is fair to persons who get licences.  The Control of Manufactures Act was carefully considered in the Dáil and here and as a result a considerable number of safeguards were introduced to deal with any situation that might arise.  It did safeguard persons who obtained licences to manufacture under the Act, and it safeguarded existing industries. In this case we are not concerned with existing industries but we are concerned to some extent with persons or firms who come in here to manufacture under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister drew attention to the fact that a breach of any of the conditions which the Minister may attach to a licence under Section 12 involved a fine or penalty of some kind&mdash;a continuous fine to a maximum of £50 per day and the danger that the licence would be withdrawn.  I should like to draw attention to the fact that under Section 12 (k), one of the conditions shall be the employment at such factory of nationals of Saorstát Eireann. Other conditions are (1) the extent to which the raw materials and articles used for the manufacture of cement at such factory shall be materials and articles produced or made in Saorstát Eireann; (m) the extent to which the capital invested in the business carried on under such licence is from <Col N="1878" /> time to time to be owned by nationals of Saorstát Eireann; and (n) the extent to which the management of such business is from time to time controlled by nationals of Saorstát Eireann.  I want to point out that those are things, particularly those mentioned in (m), which may not be absolutely at any particular moment in the control of the firm.  Let us take clause (m) for the sake of argument. A licence is granted on condition that 51 per cent. of the capital is owned by nationals of Saorstát Eireann.  I take 51 per cent. because that is the provision in the Control of Manufactures Act.  If it is to be, and it almost certainly will be in the case of a large company, a public company, its shares will be issued to the public and are liable to transfer.  We know that in some of these larger firms it has not been easy to get Irish capital.  In certain cases to my own knowledge some of the larger firms have only just managed to get 51 per cent. Irish capital.</P>
    <P>If it just manages to get 51 per cent, and if by death a transfer of shares takes place, that factory may by circumstances outside its own control cease to have 51 per cent. of Irish capital.  In the Control of Manufactures Act that is met.  There are provisions which provide that that will result in no penalty for a period of six months, a period which gives the company time to make the requisite arrangements.  Under this Bill, as it stands, if there is a breach of any of the conditions&mdash;and the Minister is empowered to attach the whole of the Control of Manufactures Act to a licence&mdash;the licence may be withdrawn.  I suggest it is not a wise thing to give the Minister power to attach conditions such as control by nationals in such cases, and that if you are going to have that principle operated it should be on the same lines as in the case of the Control of Manufactures Act.  If you are going to make a provision of that kind, which may mean that a man may incur a penalty for a breach of the licence it is not fair to the licence, because conditions may arise which may render the licensee liable <Col N="1879" /> to a penalty for a breach of the licence and he will not have the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act to safeguard him.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of standard specification.  There is a very strong feeling amongst engineers and architects&mdash;I think it is pretty general&mdash;that the standard of cement must not be allowed to fall under this Act.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated in the Dáil that he accepted that view and that he was most anxious that the general standard, which is the British standard at the present moment, should be maintained.  The Minister attaches a condition to each licence, whether that be a licence to manufacture or a licence to import, stating the quality for that particular importation or that particular manufacture but the quality may be different in the case of different persons.  It seems to me that it is desirable that, in some form or other, there should be a standard below which one cannot go in the quality of cement which is going to be manufactured.  I think that it is generally admitted that owing to the very wide use of cement in the building of cheaper class houses, the introduction of a cheaper quality of cement might prove in a very few years to be a national disaster.  The difficulty could be got over in two ways.  You could either provide&mdash; which I think would be very cumbrous and somewhat difficult&mdash;for a test specification or, alternatively, assuming the Minister agrees with the present standard&mdash;which is really the world standard because I understand it has been adopted very largely in all countries&mdash;the present standard could be adopted as the Irish standard.  In that case a provision could be made that the Minister should by order define a minimum standard specification before any licences are granted to a manufacturer or importer instead of providing that the quality will be stated in each particular licence.  I should like the Minister to explain a statement by him that rather puzzles me&mdash;that during the <Col N="1880" /> period that steps are being taken to get the factories ready the price will gradually increase.  I suppose that is right but I cannot see why it should increase unless the Government means to put on a progressive tax.</P>

      <P>If it were not being made here, the persons interested would not want a higher price for a thing they were not producing and, presumably, it could be bought from outside at the price which obtains at the present time.  I take it from the Minister's &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; that the intention of the Government is to force up the price.  If that is so, I think that it is a very doubtful policy.  It means that the country will have to pay an increased price even in the interim and we do not know to what standard the price is going to be forced.  Until the factories shall have been established here, we shall not know at what price cement can be produced here.  Nevertheless, the price is to be forced up before that.  I think that that is placing an unnecessary tax on housing.  I do not like that proposal and I hope it will be carefully considered by the Minister before it is adopted.</P>

      <P>On principle, I should be against this Bill.  It will increase the price for building, which is a very big item.  Farmers and others use a considerable amount of cement, though they have not very much money to spend on building now.  However, they must continue to use cement and I should be against the raising of the price on them.  This is protection gone mad.  However, that aspect of the matter has been very ably dealt with by Senator O'Farrell and Senator Douglas and I cannot add anything to what they have said.  But if it is decided to build these factories and if one is to be built in the south, I want to put in a claim, here and now, for my own county, which is the only place where cement was manufactured in the past in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am corrected in that. A large cement factory was carried on <Col N="1881" /> there for years and a great amount of employment was given in the district. It only failed because the owners could not produce cement as cheaply as the imported cement.  I knew the place well.  My family owned property beside it and, so far as a factory can be made ideal, the conditions of employment there were ideal.  An important consideration is that the natural materials are there and are superior to any in Ireland.  The cement manufactured by the Cooper family in Drinagh was far better than anything imported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We thought we could never get anything as good.  The lime has a peculiar quality there.  For building it is superior almost to any other lime.  It has peculiar strength and I was always told that that was the reason that Drinagh cement was superior.  A great deal of unemployment was caused in the locality when the cement factory was closed.  It is within three miles of the large town of Wexford.  The Government's agricultural policy has hit that town very badly, because it has hit the foundries. They have lost from 30 per cent. to 40 per cent. of their trade and a great deal of unemployment in the town of Wexford has been caused by the Government's agricultural policy.  The farmers have no money to buy agricultural implements and sales have fallen enormously.  These things ought to be taken into consideration. A very fine factory, well built, is standing empty.  Why then build another factory?  The Wexford factory may want to be enlarged if 500 people are to be employed in it. There were not that number employed in the old factory.  There is a railway line running up to it.  It may be that it is too much in a corner but, after all we have done for the railways, the freight to other parts from Wexford should not be too heavy. There is a railway line running through Waterford to Cork and running along the east coast to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When these factories are being considered, I hope that the position in <Col N="1882" /> Wexford will be considered.  There is a tradition there as regards this industry, which is an important thing in the manufacture of any article.  The people there have been doing the work and know how to manufacture the article.  In all industrial countries, certain places specialise in the production of certain articles and it is well known that these articles can never be manufactured with equal success outside these particular districts.  Sheffield makes knives and Bradford makes wool but Sheffield could not make wool as well as Bradford does.  A great many men in Wexford know all that is to be known about the manufacture of cement.  While I do not agree with the general principle of the Bill in compelling people to pay more for an article so necessary as a building material, if these factories are to be built, I hope that the claims of Wexford will not be overlooked.</P>

      <P>Nobody would object to this Bill going through if we could be sure that only 6d. per ton was going to be charged for foreign cement and 4/6 for British cement.  That would not affect the building trade very materially, but we cannot forget that, in pretty similar conditions, a Flour Bill was passed not very long ago. What do we find to-day?  Flour is 25 per cent. dearer in the Free State than it is in England.  Like Johnny Walker, it is still going strong.  I believe that, in a very short time, the price of flour will go up further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>That has to be taken into consideration.  The number of people employed in the flour trade in Ireland is not more than 400.  We have before us a proposal to set up a cement factory.  It will cost £500,000 <Col N="1883" /> to set up one of two factories.  I should like to know how much of that capital will be spent outside the Free State and how much will be expended in either Wexford or Cork.  At the moment Continental cement, we are told, is being made at a loss.  I can quote one small figure for the information of Senators.  Five or six years ago a cement block, eighteen inches by nine inches by four and a half inches, cost 6½d.  To-day, that block can be bought for 3d.  I take it that the price of the sand in that block has not varied very much.  That shows that, at the moment, the price of cement, as Senator Farren explained, is extremely low.  If we can get an assurance from the Minister that a definite price for the commodity will be fixed, we will all welcome the factories that the Minister foreshadows. At the same time, I think that we are all greatly disappointed at the number of people that will be employed.</P>
      <P>I want to argue against the possibility of an Irish factory being able to produce cement within a reasonable distance of the people outside.  First of all, we have very little experience in the making of cement, though in Wexford they have had some experience. In other countries they have had years of training.  They have the highest experts employed.  They have proved that they know their business.  At the same time, we shall have to bring fuel to all our ports, and that is a very important item in the manufacture of cement.  If the price of cement went up in anything like the proportion that the price of flour has gone up, I do not think that the public would welcome these factories.  Otherwise, most of us would be most anxious to see them established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very refreshing, indeed, to hear Senator Miss Browne speak in the terms which she did in reference to this industry.  The speech of the Senator was the most encouraging speech I heard for a long time from that side of the House.  While she professes to oppose the Bill on principle, she has certainly made a very strong case in support of the Minister's arguments. She stated that a factory <Col N="1884" /> existed at Drinagh, that it gave immense employment in the locality, that the materials, in the opinion of experts, were the best obtainable, and that the factory failed because at one period, as I take it, cement was produced at less than the cost price in other countries, as it is being produced to-day.  The home factory was, therefore, not able to compete.  That is what is happening at present.  Nobody knows how long that condition of affairs will continue.  It is not likely that these countries will continue to manufacture cement if they are doing it at a loss.  Beyond doubt, the necessary material is available in the country.  The amount of expert knowledge required in the manufacture of cement is not very great.  We have men in this country who can hold their own with any men in the world in knowledge of this business.  It is no argument to say that we cannot compete with foreign experts or with mass production. It is no argument to say that employment will be provided for only 400 men.  If 400 men are capable of producing all the cement required in this country, it is absurd to say that the building trade will be so affected that 4,000 or 5,000 men will lose employment if the price of cement is raised as a result of the establishment here of a cement factory.  The work of 400 men could not affect the building trade to such an extent that 4,000 men, as has been stated here, would be put out of employment.  I do not think that that can be argued at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is within the experience of Senators that when tenders were invited for the building of cottages throughout the country five or six years ago, when the price of cement was normal, and when builders were given a choice of cement construction or brick construction, the difference in the tenders was negligible.  At that time Portland cement was being manufactured as a paying proposition in England. The difference in the tenders was then negligible and was not sufficient to affect the rents of these houses.  When all is said and done, it would be a very good thing if a great proportion of builders were driven back largely to the use of bricks.  Even if the price <Col N="1885" /> of cement were raised, I believe we would have a compensation in the action of builders in resorting to the use of bricks.  We have brick clay in abundance in this country, equal to that in any foreign bricks.  I think it would be an advantage if this Bill resulted in driving builders back to the brick fields and thereby opening up the manufacture of bricks.  This is an experiment, and a very laudable experiment.  The Shannon scheme was an experiment.  It met with opposition. Every experiment is a plunge in the dark, such a plunge as some people would take to-day by backing the Aga Khan's horse or by backing Mr. Dawson's horse.  This plunge is more of a certainty than some of the things that were opposed here.  When these schemes were started we did not think any the worse of them in some quarters, but the results have been beyond the anticipations of those who opposed them.  I believe that the results of embarking on this scheme will be very fruitful and surprising. When the Minister speaks of additional employment in the way of transport of materials I do not agree with him.  Employees presently engaged in that end will find sufficient to do in future distribution.  I do not think that additional employment in that way will be given.  It may give additional employment incidentally in the immediate locality of the factory, such as catering for and supplying four or five hundred men and their families. I believe this scheme will be a success for cement for the upkeep of the roads of the future.</P>
    <P>It is generally acknowledged that cement-constructed roads will play a very important function in the future of the transport system.  Where such roads have been tried they have been productive of good results.  With the extension of roads of that character the employment given by cement factories may be multiplied three or four times.  I hope that will be so.  In any case, I believe this is an experiment worth trying.  If the particulars regarding housing are gone into, it will be found that this proposal will not interfere with the progress of building <Col N="1886" /> operations or hold up building schemes.  I have heard no argument against the Bill, and I cannot understand why Senator Miss Browne opposes the Second Reading, while at the same time giving the strongest approval to the feasibility of establishing the industry here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Congested Districts Board were building houses in all parts of the country some years ago, I remember they found that the difference in price between cement and bricks or stone depended on whichever material was available in a particular place.  In some places the cement was cheaper, in other places stone was cheaper, and in other places bricks were cheaper.  That was the experience of working all over the West of Ireland.  With regard to what Senator Miss Browne said about the cement that was manufactured in Ireland, I can bear her out in that matter.  There was no better cement than that made in Wexford.  I remember that a very high wall was built with Irish cement around the racecourse at Mullingar.  They boast of that wall in Mullingar.  It is certainly a very fine wall.  The question of free trade arises in connection with this matter.  The same difficulties are raised whenever a Bill of this kind is brought forward, the argument being that there will be such a rise in prices as will ruin the country.  We have had experience of free trade in this country for the past 70 or 80 years, with the result that we have no industries.  It is time to put an end to that state of affairs and to see what can be done otherwise.  Even those who were insistent for the maintenance of free trade have found it necessary to change their policy and to charge a higher price for commodities made at home than those that are imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable and necessary that we should have cement factories, and that they should be protected from attack by other countries sending in supplies, which would result in closing the Irish factories.  Many industries here failed owing to the attacks of combines and rich merchants outside the country, who decided to crush Irish industries. <Col N="1887" /> These combines could send sufficient quantities of their manufactures in and sell them at prices that would prevent factories here manufacturing at the same price.  When the factories were closed the price of the imported article would immediately rise.  Unless we can control that danger we do not know the moment the foreign firms might raise prices.  We had many instances of it.  I remember when the late Mr. Parnell opened mines in County Wicklow to supply the Dublin Corporation with cobbles, there was great opposition although the Wicklow stones were the cheapest.  Firms in Wales immediately dropped prices considerably below what the same stones could be produced at, and as soon as the Irish stones were out of the market, prices immediately rose.  That is an example of what has been done here for 70 or 80 years, and I hope it will not be allowed to continue any longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we might describe Senator Miss Browne as being in favour of the factory but against the Bill. I may say that I think the Government are rather late in introducing this Bill. It should have been one of the first Bills they introduced.  We know that battleships, railway engines and railway tracks are now being built with cement.  What could be better for the building of a tariff wall than cement? A cement wall will be impregnable.  I know a little about this matter.  The Government may get the Bill, but it is very doubtful if we will ever get the factories, seeing that the cement corporations are huge international combines.  I went into this question some time ago with residents in Skerries, where, notwithstanding what has been said about the Wexford cement, I am told the material is capable of producing the best cement in the world.  The Portland Cement Corporation was approached, and they bought an option; but they never went on with the factory.  I am told that these people have options in some of the best centres in the country for cement, but that they have no intention of building a factory.  I am doubtful <Col N="1888" /> if anything we can do will induce them to do so.</P>
      <P>I want to call the attention of the Minister to another aspect of this matter.  Cement is very largely used in all parts of the country and is entering into all forms of industry, such as housing and roads.  I understand from people who ought to know that in comparison with the expenditure cement gives very poor labour returns. We are living in a machine age.  The Government does not seem to realise that the machine is displacing man everywhere.  I will give an instance. We went to great pains to ensure that we would produce all the flour we require in this State.  So far we have only succeeded in enriching the mill-owners and displacing the workers.  I know one mill not very far from this House where the output has been increased by 50 per cent. and the staff reduced by 25 per cent.  Where are we leading?  The people are paying more for flour.  Who is getting the benefit?  We are talking about putting on tariffs but machinery is imported from England or from the Continent. The machinery for the factories will be imported from some other country. The capital will be sent abroad for machinery to produce the cement while the workers will be on the dole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to bring home to the Minister in this matter is that, realising we are living in a machine age and that machines are displacing men in industry, they ought to set about making a definite labour charge on these industries to which monopolies are given, in order that the workers may get some real benefit from these industries.  At present that is not the case.  If we are going to launch out into cement factories we may find that we are paying a very enhanced price for the cement, as the employment given may be infinitesimal in comparison with the outlay.  I want to impress that upon the Minister.  We are all in favour of the Government's efforts on behalf of Irish industries, and in particular for the development of rural industries but, when we see what is happening in flour milling, we want to stop that practice, if it is at all possible. These cement corporations are <Col N="1889" /> huge affairs, and it is doubtful if they will worry about the amount of cement they sell here.  We are fortunate in having international competition for cement.  As the Minister said, we are getting it at much less than the cost of production.  That is a very fortunate position to be in, but it may not remain so very long; so that it is well to ensure against its cessation by legislating towards that end.  Having got our legislation, I am doubtful if we will get our factories.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow what Senator Foran has said in regard to this question of the concentration of capital into these factories.  Last week, on the Insurance Bill I suggested that, notwithstanding the protestations of the Ministry regarding the decentralisation of industry, the tendency towards concentration would be too great for them and this instance, I think, is another illustration of the truth of that statement.  The Minister has given a good deal of information but he has not given enough and I would ask him if he can tell the House something more about the expectations regarding the subscription of the capital.  He has told us that the capital cost of one of these factories might be £400,000 or £500,000.  No doubt, it is within his knowledge where it is expected that the capital will come from in the beginning. On the figures that have been given, it is quite clear that a very great proportion of the cost of a ton of cement will be allocated to pay interest on the capital invested which means the export of that return and not its employment in Irish industry. On the assumption of £500,000 capital in a factory with 100,000 tons of an output, one can see the probability that even at what would be considered a moderate return for dividends and depreciation of only 10 per cent., you have 10/- per ton going to the recoupment of the capital provided by people who are probably outside this country altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, the question arises, too, of what proportion of the fuel that would be required to produce a ton of cement will be of Irish production.  Conceivably, <Col N="1890" /> it might be all of Irish production, but I wonder is that going to be a factor to be put before the proposed company.  If it is all imported, there will be another 10/- per ton of cement going out of the country because, some time ago, it was stated on good authority&mdash;it may have been changed since; new methods, new machines and new methods of power usage might have altered the situation somewhat&mdash;that it took 10 cwt. of coal to produce a ton of cement.  Some information on that point would be welcome because, if the provision of the machinery and the coal is to come from abroad, the repayment of the cost of those out of the ton of cement will account for at least £1.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the use of cement in house building but, during the last three years, at any rate, there has probably been more cement used on roads than has been used on houses and even if every house in future is to be built of concrete and if three times the number of houses are to be built per year than have been built, say, for the last three years, there will not be more than 100,000 tons of cement per year used in house building.  I have been expecting to hear something from the motor owners and users in regard to the increased cost of road making and, therefore, the increased road charges that would fall on the Road Fund.  I think it will undoubtedly be an advantage to the ratepayers if there is a very great increase in concrete road making because the original cost will come, in the main, out of the Road Fund and there will be a very much smaller charge for upkeep.  What the effect of that will be on rural labour is another question, but Senator Foran has drawn attention to the inevitable consequences of these modern advances in technique and methods of production which the Minister knows very well are not going to be recompensed by the kind of labour that would be involved in the making of cement in such a factory as this.  I do not know of my personal knowledge but I am pretty certain that the experience of <Col N="1891" /> cement making in Drinagh, twenty years ago, however efficient it may have been, would have very little to do with the making of cement in the new factory that is to be built.  I anticipate that it will be chemists, mechanics, engineers and the like that will be required and not skilled labourers and that the Irish labour that will be required in the main will be wheeling barrows, keeping chutes in order and that kind of thing.  I anticipate&mdash;the Minister could tell us whether I am right or not&mdash;that most of the 400 or 500 persons likely to be employed in connection with the two factories will be employed in the preparation and the gathering together of the material rather than in the factory itself and that is not going to be very highly paid labour.</P>
    <P>Whether it is deliberate or not, I do not know, but I notice that, notwithstanding all the powers the Minister has taken, he has not taken any power to ensure that the pay of the workers in connection with the factories will be under his control, and that there is no security that a reasonable minimum wage will be paid to those engaged in the work.  In regard to the price, undoubtedly cement is being imported at the present time at an exceedingly low price.  I have heard talk of 26/- per ton for certain Continental cement, and I find from the returns, for the first three months of this year, that the average price in the City of Dublin was about 30/6 per ton.  That is considerably below what is being obtained for the same qualities of cement anywhere else, but, as has been pointed out, you cannot rely on that for very long.  Only a year ago the average price for cement of all kinds landed in Dublin, for the first six months of the year, was 37/2, against 30/6 this year. In 1928, it was 40/4; in 1929, 38/7; in 1930, 36/9, and in 1931, 35/3, so that the price prevailing to-day cannot be relied on to be maintained, and if, as the Minister expects, the price of Irish cement can be fixed at not more than, say, 35/&mdash;I think that was the figure he gave&mdash;we are probably not going to be worse off than we were in any of the years from 1928 to 1932.  We know that <Col N="1892" /> every effort is being made to-day to raise prices universally on all kinds of commodities and, if there is any success in that, I have no doubt at all that cement will be one of the first to which will be added several shillings per ton.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear from the Minister that the intention with regard to the licence duty on imports, during the period between the passing of the Bill and the establishment of the factory, or, rather, I think he said the first three months, was to put only a duty of sixpence per ton on Continental cement.  That is a relief, and I hope that the increase beyond that will be very gradual indeed, because it would be a disadvantage, but not, by any means, so great as some people have suggested, that there should be an unnecessary rise in the price of cement merely for the benefit of the Exchequer, because that is what it would mean, between now and the establishment of the factory.</P>
    <P>I think it is well to give some information regarding the effect of a rise in the price of cement on the cost of a concrete house.  The Minister said that the amount that actually falls on the tenant of a house which is being built under the Act of last year is not going to be very heavy.  Assuming that about 15 tons of cement go into the building of a house which is costing, say, £450, which is higher than most of the houses that are being built in the country now for slum clearance schemes, a 5/- a ton rise in price would not involve a cost of more than 5/- a year, and it must be borne in mind that, on that class of house, the State is bearing two-thirds of the cost so that the increase in the charge on the tenant of that house would not be more than 1/8 per year. That is not going to be a very heavy burden if there is any advantage at all.  The question that is involved, I think, is what is going to be the effect on employment in other industries that are engaged in the preparation of materials for houses of the establishment of cement factories in this country.  Is it going to be a case of leaving the enterprise to win its way against every other kind of material or is it going to be a case of giving <Col N="1893" /> definite preferences of all kinds to the capitalists who have been induced to invest half a million pounds in such an industry?</P>
    <P>There are proposals, of course, to establish brickworks, and similar kinds of operations are being encouraged. Somebody said that the great majority of people would prefer a brick house to a concrete house.  If there is going to be reliance entirely, or even to any great degree, upon house-building schemes for the support of the cement factories, then one has to bear in mind that the demand for brick houses, if there is a supply of bricks of good quality available in different parts of the country, will probably decrease the demand for cement for house building.  On the other hand, it has been pointed out that there is a great market in other directions for cement.  Road-making is an obvious use that would be made of cement.  I have no doubt there will be very great changes in the physical aspect of this country in the next few years, due to the fact that cement is being made at home and that it is a very valuable article for construction works.</P>
    <P>The Ministry is taking powers in this Bill to secure that the quality of Irish made cement will be up to standard.  I think it was Senator Douglas who suggested that it would be worth while taking powers to secure that the quality of the imported cement was up to a similar standard. I do not know&mdash;I have no reason for saying it&mdash;that any poor quality of cement is being imported, but I can say that if there is any poor quality of cement in the world at all it may come here in view of the fact that this country is being used at present as a dumping ground for surpluses in other countries.  So long as it is once accepted, as a Government duty, to insist on a standard specification for any cement that is to be used in the country, I suggest that should be put into operation immediately and not leave it to the chance of any builder or contractor to buy any cheap cement that he can get, knowing that he will be able to sell his house and have no further responsibility for it.  Once the <Col N="1894" /> Minister has accepted the duty of creating a standard for the cement that is to be used within the country, I suggest to him that he should put that into operation immediately in regard to all cement that comes into the country.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill because I think it is desirable that the country should be in a position to manufacture its own cement and not be dependent on the chances of the world market and the willingness of competitive foreign manufacturers to supply this country at a low price.  But there is an aspect of this that troubles me a little.  I would ask the Minister either to look into it or tell us that he has already looked into it.  Senator Foran expressed a little doubt as to whether, notwithstanding all the preparations, there would ever be any cement manufactured in the country at all.  Assuming that there is to be cement manufactured in the country one may ask: who are the manufacturers of the machines that are going to be used in the factories?  To what extent are the machines being made by firms which are owned by rival cement trusts and combines?  There are so many questions involved in this kind of thing that one is tempted to be a little suspicious: to ask for assurances that all these various aspects have been looked into, and that a frank statement of all the facts will be placed before the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>This debate has been very long drawn out, so long that the House seems to be emptying itself. One statement made by the Minister rather surprised me: that it has been definitely decided to establish one factory in the East and one in the South.  We had Senators from Cork and Wexford putting forward their views, and suggesting that factories should be established in their particular areas.  This Bill, in my opinion, represents a progressive move on the part of the Government.  I do not know that the Minister's statement that the factories will be set up where there is likely to be the largest consumption represents a very wise decision.  I think it would have been <Col N="1895" /> much better to work on the principle of setting up factories where you had the best materials and the best workers.  If the Government go on that principle, I am satisfied they will not set up factories in the South and East, but in the West.</P>

      <P>On the question of cement buildings, it is my opinion that cement houses for the people are not near as good or as healthy as houses built of brick or stone.  I think the Government would have been well advised to follow up the very sound principle they acted upon in connection with the Gaeltacht Housing Act by advocating and insisting that Irish materials would be used.  I think that even if the use of stone involved a little extra cost the Government would have been well advised to insist on stone buildings rather than cement ones.  It has been my experience, and that of the farming community who are obliged to put up stabling, that cement floors in stables are not healthy for live stock.  The old cobble stone floors were much healthier.  The putting down of cement floors in stablings has resulted in a terrible increase in rheumatism and other diseases in live stock.  The cattle get rheumatism from sleeping on the cold cement floors.  Taking all these matters into consideration, I think it is not good policy for the State to advocate the use of cement in house building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas said that the price of cement will be increased here as a result of the setting up of these factories.  The Minister anticipated that point in his opening speech by saying that the price would possibly be no higher here than it is in England at present.  It will be higher than the present price of cement here, because that price is a dumping price.  It is questionable whether we are getting good value for the cement that is being sold here at a dumping price.  It is only a few months since I saw some stabling that had been built with this imported cement.  The building was up as far as the roof, and when a man pushed <Col N="1896" /> his foot against it the whole side wall collapsed.  What happened was that the cement was of such poor quality that it never set.  I do not say the cement used in that stabling was typical of all the cement coming into the country, but certainly there is a lot of that class of stuff coming in.  Even at the present price we have no guarantee that we are getting good value in the cement that is being imported.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general principle as to whether or not cement factories should be set up here, whether we should have any factories at all or not, we have had to-day the same old whining cry from the members of the Opposition: &ldquo;Oh, this is protection gone mad.  This is bound to fail, you will be up against the greatest experts in England, France and America, who are the be-all and the end-all of everything in connection with the manufacture of this article.  You can never compete against them.&rdquo;  That is the cry we always get from the members of the Opposition.  It reminds me of the story of the young man who had ideals.  When starting out in life he went to consult a cautious old man.  When he put his proposals before him the old man said: &ldquo;Do not be foolish, do not go into that, you will never succeed.&rdquo;  If views such as those were to be followed by everybody then the world would have no great manufacturing magnates; we would have no great manufacturing centres. What have you in the whole commercial world but a policy of gambling?  No matter what sphere of activity people enter, they have to gamble at some period of their lives.  It is only the gambler in any sphere of life that succeeds in the long run.  In connection with this Bill, we have a market of our own, and it depends on ourselves whether we make a success of this or not.  The market is here for all the cement we manufacture.  There is not even the element of gambling in it, because the market is there.  Yet, in spite of that, the members of the Opposition utter their old cry, because they seem to have no interest in anything except in their own petty political ends.</P>
    <Col N="1897" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that it we have to use cement in this country we ought to make some effort to produce it.  It is another question whether or not its manufacture will be a paying proposition, in view of the fact that we will be obliged to compete with people already engaged in its manufacture in a very large way, and whether it may not inflict too great a cost on the community for the benefits that may be derived from its manufacture here.  I am satisfied that we have in abundance the materials required for cement manufacture, and there is no reason why we should not endeavour to turn that raw material into the finished article.  I do not know that a lot of what was said to-day on this Bill was quite germane to it.  We had a variety of matters introduced that, I think, might very well have been left out.  Senator Douglas referred to the question of standard quality.  He said the Minister should take steps to ensure that the cement manufactured in the two factories it is proposed to set up would be of a certain standard quality.  I think that, of necessity, the Minister must do that, whether the cement is used for road work, for the building of houses, or in any other large undertaking.  The reason is this: that architects and engineers responsible for the preparation of specifications for such works will see to it that the cement used in them is up to a certain standard. Therefore, I think it will be the duty of the Minister to make regulations providing for a certain standard quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas also referred to another matter which I think is of very great importance, the fact that under Section 4 of the Bill it is provided that &ldquo;That Control of Manufactures Act, 1932, shall not apply&rdquo; to this measure.  I take it that what the Minister has in mind there is that it may be impossible to get in this country 51 per cent. of the capital required for the establishment of these two factories.  Therefore, he has taken the precaution of putting this section into the Bill, so that in the event of 51 per cent. of the required capital not being available here that will not <Col N="1898" /> act as a barrier to the setting up of the factories.  I would like to say that up to recently we had a factory in Dublin that gave employment to 300 people.  The factory failed, though efforts were made to secure 51 per cent. of the capital from Irish Free State nationals.  I say that it is a pity the Government did not, for the sake of the 300 people employed there&mdash;and if their families were taken into consideration there would be about 1,400 souls involved&mdash;waive the condition in regard to capital in that case.  Very few of these people got employment since.  I think it is regrettable that some steps were not taken to exclude that particular factory from the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act with regard to capital.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell and others have said that if the price of cement is increased it will add materially to the cost of housing schemes.  I suggest that if the aggregate of cement used in the manufacture of concrete blocks 18 by 9 by 4½ which are being sold at 3½d. each continues to be used, there cannot be any increase in the cost because I am afraid there was not very much cement in them.  I think if you can procure concrete blocks with a proper aggregate of sand and cement you will get houses much cheaper than have been built in recent times.  Senator Foran referred to the matter of British combines.  I know from my association with him that he has a good deal of experience in these particular matters.  He talked about a certain area putting forward claims as a centre for a factory.  I believe with the last speaker that in selecting a site for a factory, the questions to be considered should be whether the best materials are available there and whether the site would be suitable from the point of view of transport. No matter what county that site is in if these conditions are fulfilled that is the place to erect the factory to make it an economic proposition. There is no use putting one county against another.  That method is all wrong.  If the thing is going to be attempted it should be done in a purely businesslike fashion.  The question of proximity to large centres <Col N="1899" /> where there is likely to be a big market should also be taken into account. Senator Foran referred to the fact that a combine had got an option in a certain part of the country where it is known that an abundance of material is available for the making of cement.  He stressed the fact that these people had taken an option, but I might point out that in Part III of the Bill the Minister has taken steps to deal with such parties like them.  Where an option has been taken, the Minister has power to acquire the lands compulsorily.  We need not, therefore, fear the activities of big combines in that respect.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made in regard to the question of preventing our people from enjoying what we are enjoying undoubtedly at present&mdash;the luxury of being able to purchase cement below the cost of production. It is an extraordinary thing, but it is true, that we are getting it below the cost of production.  It is also an extraordinary thing but it is also true that we are selling butter to the people of the North of Ireland below the cost of production.  It appears to me that we are living in a mad world.  We are buying cement from other people below the price at which they can produce it and at the same time we are selling to the people of Great Britain and Northern Ireland produce at a price below the cost of production to us.  It seems to me, as I say, that we are living in a world which has gone mad.  We hear a lot of talk about modern methods and mass-production but it seems to me that it would be a good thing for humanity if we went back to the old-time methods when we had rubble stone walls.  That was before the cement age.</P>

      <P>One did not need a mason at all for the type of house I am talking about.  Senator Foran also <Col N="1900" /> referred to the question of protection for flour milling, and to the fact that the Oireachtas went through the form of passing an Act to protect flour millers against unfair competition and against the dumping which was going on.  The combine on the other side was dumping flour into the country below the cost of production. Their surplus production was being dumped here, and in order to prevent that, the Oireachtas passed a measure protecting the flour millers and providing that flour could only be imported under licence.  What happened? As Senator Foran pointed out, one of the flour millers increased his output by 50 per cent., and at the same time reduced the number of workers engaged in that industry by 25 per cent.  It appears to me that there is something radically wrong at the present moment when such things can take place.  I read the speeches of people who are responsible for things such as that every day in the week. These people in responsible positions are constantly pressing the Government on many questions, but I want to say openly and frankly, as a representative of working-class people, that if the petty manufacturers of this country think that laws are going to be made to enrich them and to degrade the working class people, we are not going to stand for it, and the sooner they know it the better.  I have met some of the people who were engaged in this particular industry and who have lost their employment.  They are in a pitiable position.  Many of them are on outdoor relief, and some of them have been evicted from their homes.  If protection is going to bring nothing better to other industries in this country, the sooner we understand one another the better.  If protection means that the petty capitalists are going to get freedom to exploit a restricted market and are going to get the right to compel the whole population to pay an increased price for the commodities they produce, if it is going to enrich a few people while bringing misery to the working population, it is not going to continue very long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I am in favour of this Bill, as I believe it will benefit the community at large.  I support it in the <Col N="1901" /> belief that it will benefit the community as a whole and not with any idea of benefiting only a few people. At some stage steps will have to be taken to deal with the all-important question of protection for workers which is involved in this.  We heard some years ago that what was wanted was more production, but then a most extraordinary thing happened&mdash;the countries who produced most are poorest to-day.  We produced more than the people could consume; we invented machines which displaced the human element in industry.  We know many people are so poor that they are not now able to purchase the commodities we produce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to speak on this Bill, but having heard some of the arguments adduced in favour of it I feel that it is up to me to say something.  This Bill, of course, is part of the policy of extreme self-sufficiency in production.  It is a policy in which I do not believe, a policy which I think could be accepted by anybody only with great reservation. Nevertheless, it is one which has undoubtedly been endorsed by the electorate as has also the policy of regulation of industry by the Government which enters very much into this Bill. There is no question whatever but that this Bill will be given a Second Reading. It should be in the circumstances, but I think if you admit the principle you will find it very difficult to amend it.  Although I believe I am a very small quantity in this House, I think it is my duty to express my views on this subject.  This idea of extreme self-sufficiency in production, that you will make everything you require, and at the same time expect other people to buy your surplus production from you, is one of the things that is killing the civilized world to-day.  It does not need anybody of great erudition to see that.  It is a fact that is being demonstrated in the newspapers every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to the establishment of a cement works in this country to manufacture all the cement we require by private enterprise, but I do say that it is a very curious thing that notwithstanding the fact that we have had all these remarkable <Col N="1902" /> natural resources that have been described for the manufacture of cement, we have not got these works established by private enterprise. There has been a considerable market for cement in this country for a long time, yet we have not got these cement factories.  The Minister hopes to establish them under protection with the result that cement will be dearer.  That fact the Minister has admitted without any reservation.  He is satisfied that with the present state of things it is exceedingly unlikely that the operation of this Bill will be unattended by a rise in the price of cement.  Cement is especially cheap in this country.  We have got it at a price under the cost of production to the manufacturers.  Nobody is suffering from the cheapness of that cement, and a great many people have benefited by it.  I should say that position was a good one if we left it alone.  It is not going to be left alone because the idea is that it is desirable that we should make our own cement and that employment should be given.  I have no objection to any scheme which aims at the reduction of unemployment, but is it desirable that you should give employment in the making of cement&mdash;dearer cement?  That is one side of the picture.  On the other side there is the fact&mdash;I think it follows as an incontestable fact&mdash;that cement is going to be dearer and that all buildings and engineering works into the construction of which cement enters will be dearer.  Streets and roads made of concrete will be dearer. I do not believe in this policy, or I do not believe in this Bill, and I think I should say so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not very anxious to speak in this debate until I heard Senator MacEllin make his outburst.  Lest he might think that the position was that those who represent certain classes were cowed, I feel I should say something.  Of course, as Senator Bagwell has said, this is another step along the road of self-sufficiency, or, if you like to call it, economic isolation.  I am glad to see that some people at least are getting uneasy.  We had evidence of that last week and I feel that Senator O'Farrell <Col N="1903" /> is not very well placed on those benches.  I think he, at least, sees the red light shown by the policy involved in this Bill.  One would have thought that when you got full-blooded protection you would have enough of it, but not a bit of it.  These apostles of self-sufficiency never seem to be satisfied. In fact, it seems to me that they cry &ldquo;stinking fish&rdquo; in suggesting that there is not enough brains or ability to take advantage of the protection which is afforded to industry, that you must go further and give monopolies, and in order to secure this national position, you must make conditions about capital control and everything else&mdash;as much as to say, that without this statutory protection our people are incompetent.  I think that that is a very sad and a very wrong admission.  Apart from this being socialistic and open to all the dangers that some of us believe socialistic policy involves&mdash;rigidity, regulation, stereotyping existing conditions and technique, preventing scientific development&mdash;apart from that, what is this Bill going to do for the community?  Admittedly, it is going to raise the price of cement. The volume of employment which it will give was previously estimated at about 1,000.  That has now been reduced to 500 and, as against that, has to be set a very probable diminution in the number of people handling this stuff at our ports.  In connection with the whole policy, there is the great danger of reducing the business of handling goods at our ports and rendering unproductive the large amount of capital put into the facilities provided at the ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect I have not referred to yet in connection with this unfortunate proposal&mdash;that is, the limitation of the varieties of cement that must follow. Anybody who knows anything about building knows that there are many varieties of cement&mdash;ordinary, standard Portland cement &mdash; differing largely in their setting qualities. Some set slowly; others quickly.  It is desirable, in some cases, from the point of view of engineering technique, to have a rapidly-setting cement.  Here, <Col N="1904" /> you are restricting your market to a small country, as this undoubtedly is. What is the analogy?  The analogy is as if you were going to make cement in Yorkshire or Middlesex or Lancashire. That is the proportion.  If you are going to limit your market to that extent, you are not going to be able to supply the different varieties of cement needed for the best building technique.  We have white cement, of Portland cement character, made for certain purposes.  Though the market is small, the need exists in certain cases, and, if you are going to consider the amenities of life, you ought to be able to supply that cement and not have to go to the Government for a licence to import it.  You have, then, this quick-setting cement, which is used for ferro-concrete, and another class of cement for setting under water. Naturally, where you have a small market, you cannot supply these varieties out of your own resources, and you are bringing in all this Government regulation and licensing and all the trouble and worry that those involve.</P>
    <P>Senator Crosbie spoke as if the price to the public was entirely dependent on the cost of production.  Everybody knows that that is not so.  The price to the public is very much influenced by the purchasing power of the public. I feel that, if this policy continues, the purchasing power of the people will be reduced and you may make as much cement as you wish, but the people will not buy it, because they will not have the money.  One has dealt so often with the general principles involved in this matter that one can only continue to protest.  When one is boiling enternally with indignation, one gets a certain amount of relief in speaking one's mind.  You have here a most extraordinary contradiction.  One of the Senators referred to &ldquo;a world gone mad.&rdquo;  We are, presumably, putting our hands in our pockets and sending delegates to a world conference to try and arrange for a freer flow of trade and to try to get somewhere near the axiom that trade is mutual and depends on the exchange of goods. While doing that, we are giving a denial to that whole doctrine by the policy we are pursuing here.  We, ourselves, <Col N="1905" /> are a large part of the demented world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Purser Griffith</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Seanad will bear with a few words from me.  My claim is that I am probably the oldest user of Portland cement in Ireland and that, during my forty years' service in the Port and Docks Board, I have probably used the largest quantity of Portland cement in Ireland.  I have only one real fault to find with this Bill&mdash;that is, leaving the quality of the cement to be arranged by the Minister.  I should have liked to have seen a statement in the Bill setting out a definite standard below which the cement manufactured here or imported into the country should not go.  I was, perhaps, one of the pioneers in connection with the formation of standard specifications and tests for Portland cement.  As far back as the year 1887, I brought the subject before the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland.  I impressed upon them the necessity of adopting standards in specifications not only for Portland cement but for other materials, though Portland cement was the principal factor in the proposals I made.  Two years later, having visited Germany, I submitted another paper on standard tests, using the same arguments that I had used previously but reinforced by the experience I had gained abroad.  In the early Seventies, Germany had been practically dependent on English Portland cement.  England had almost a monopoly at the time.  Germany, with its usual determination, set to work to discover a method by which they could replace the imported cement with cement manufactured in their own land.  They went about the matter in a very business-like way.  A combination was formed between the Government, cement manufacturers, engineers, architects and builders. That association still exists.  They came to agreement, after very careful investigation, with scientific thought, as to what standard should be adopted for the Portland cement of Germany.  Of course, the first objection raised against that was that it would stereotype your material, and <Col N="1906" /> that you would not get any improvement in cement manufacture.  That has turned out to be a complete mistake.  To the present day, Germany manufactures Portland cement under this standard specification.  Thirteen years after I brought forward the subject in Dublin, the English Institution of Civil Engineers formed a committee under the chairmanship of Sir John Wolfe Barry, a very distinguished engineer of his time, with the object of obtaining a standard for Portland cement in particular and for other materials, like steel and ironwork.  That Committee worked hard and gradually gained ground. It was replaced finally in 1901 by the British Standard Engineering Association, which has now a world-wide reputation.  Practically all the manufacturers in Britain and in our colonies are adopting that standard for the Portland cement to be used by them.  My plea is that the Minister should insert in this Bill a minimum quality of standard Portland cement.</P>
      <P>Without entering into details, I should like to say that British standard Portland cement is recognised all over the world as a thoroughly sound and safe material.  That would not prevent the manufacturers making different qualities of cement, such as Senator Sir John Keane has spoken of.  That has, undoubtedly, proved beneficial to the cement manufacturers as well as to their clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember speaking in London on this subject.  One of our best Portland cement manufacturers was present and he said: &ldquo;We have made our reputation by the manufacture of our cement.  We are not going to jeopardise it by any of the fads Mr. Griffith has proposed.&rdquo;  Within two years after that speech was made, I received from that gentleman's firm a circular stating that they were now prepared to grind their cement to a fineness equal to the German standard.  That was the first step taken by one of our leading firms. Now, the various &ldquo;fads&rdquo; which engineers put in their specifications have ceased to exist.  My only recommendation is that the Minister should take this into account in this Cement Bill and insert a standard which the cement <Col N="1907" /> manufacturers and the public at large will understand.  Any cement manufactured in this country should be up to that standard.  In my view, it is very important that we have an unlimited quantity of material in Ireland for the manufacture of the very best Portland cement.  Some 45 years ago I was approached to use a Portland cement made not many miles from Dublin.  As an importation myself into this country, I naturally looked upon that cement with suspicion, but the result was extremely gratifying from the cement manufacturer's point of view, for I became a convert to the opinion that we could, in Ireland, get as good a cement as could be obtained from the other side of the water.  We used some of that cement on our works on the North Wall, but, finally, the poor company was driven into liquidation as a result of the very low price at which the English manufacturers combined to send their cement into this country.  These are some of the points that strike me most forcibly.  I do feel that, on the Committee Stage, an effort should be made to make perfectly clear that our Portland cement will be up to standard and will be recognised out of Ireland, for I cannot help believing that we have here a manufacture which would result in a good export trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain one matter, about which I am doubtful.  In the event of the factories not materialising, is it the intention to subject licences to bring in cement to a revenue charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.  The position is that for the next three months, and perhaps longer, the licence will be purely nominal.  I should perhaps have explained more fully that the intention with regard to this fee is not so much that the price of cement should be graded up to the price at which cement will ultimately be produced here, as that it is desired to provide a safeguard, in case, when the factories are started, cement may continue to be imported in large quantities.  The intention is not alone to reach that price, whatever it may be&mdash;I daresay it will be the world price&mdash;but to prevent <Col N="1908" /> importers from taking undue advantage of the position.  As the Cathaoirleach suggests, if a situation arises where it would be impossible for some reason to proceed with these proposals, I take it then that the imposition of fees will not be insisted upon, and that the whole thing will lapse. We are not in a position to state definitely what the price of cement will be here ultimately.  We will try to achieve the position that only cement of the highest possible quality, of British standard specification, or even a higher specification, if it is found feasible, will be produced, and that the price will be related to the world price.  I see no reason why cement cannot be produced here at the same price as in other countries.  I must confess to the Seanad that I have not gone into the costings closely. Senator Johnson raised a number of points in connection with the matter. I can only promise that when the proposals are being examined in the Department the closest possible attention will be paid to the question of getting materials from home sources, and endeavouring to see that whatever money is spent in connection with the factories will, as far as possible, be spent at home.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure Senator Sir John Griffith that the question of British standard specification has been under consideration.  One of the difficulties I see is that if it was considered desirable to raise the specification, or to make any alteration at a later stage, it would be necessary to introduce a special Bill to do so.  I can see a difficulty about leaving the matter in the hands of the Minister, but I think the House can rest assured that the Minister, in conjunction with the different Government Departments concerned, will consult with the engineering bodies before he reaches any final decision in reference to the specification. I know that the Minister has been considering the British standard specification. His feeling was that it might be better not to introduce it into this Bill.  However, that can be argued on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The substance of the discussion that was germane to the principle of the <Col N="1909" /> Bill revolved around the question of price.  I was glad to hear Senator Johnson, who has more experience of housing matters than I have, referring to costings.  I do not know whether an increase of 10/- is possible.  I should say it is not, unless price cutting is carried on to a greater extent.  One of the reasons we are taking these powers is because the whole situation may change and syndicates may arrange that cement will be sold in the Irish Free State at a certain price.  On the other hand, competition may become keener, and it is possible that the price of cement may become lower through a price-cutting campaign.  I can assure the Seanad that the world price will be the basis and the foundation of the price that the Minister will endeavour to fix.</P>
    <P>As regards the situation of the factory or factories the Government, of course, in its endeavours to develop industrial potentialities here is constantly up against this question. There is no doubt whatever that foreign capitalists coming to this country look at this matter purely from the point of view of their own commercial profit, or, from what might appear to them to be solely economic considerations.  The circumstances in this country are often entirely unknown to them.  After all we cannot blame them.  They are taking a risk, taking a leap in the dark, in the same way as we are, and it is up to them to see that their business will have a reasonable chance of success.  They are not going to sink money in a venture that has no prospects.  The only alternative I see to our starting the industry ourselves would be a frank discussion between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the parties to the transaction, whereby the rights of the public will be fully safeguarded. Anyone who has control of a Government Department, even for a limited period, will realise that our position is different to that of the man who puts up the money, who has to take a certain risk, and who is prepared to take it.  He knows what he is about, and he takes a sporting chance that he will win out. <Col N="1910" /> If he does not, that is his funeral. In the case of a Minister it is quite a different proposition.  The Minister has to look before him to see what is going to happen in four or five years' time when an entirely different situation may arise.  A project which looks simple on the surface may have other implications which may not be brought to the Minister's notice until it is impossible to go back.</P>
    <P>We meet these difficulties constantly. I can only say with reference to the question of decentralising industry that there is a desire on the part of people investing money in industries to be near large centres where they feel there will be a market and the other amenities that are necessary. On the other hand, I think technical science and the development of machinery have reached such a pitch now that, as Senator Farren has pointed out, wherever there is raw material in abundance industries can be established if you can only bring people who are responsible for setting up industries and putting money into them round to that point of view.  Of course, the question of transport charges has to be considered.</P>
    <P>We have been trying to make arrangements with regard to certain areas, particularly the poorer areas, which otherwise would be neglected, to see if they could not have industries, and in regard to industrial alcohol and peat we hope to succeed in making definite arrangements.  I have to agree with a great deal of what Senator Johnson, Senator Farren and Senator Foran said, that very often these industries are a doubtful proposition. We cannot hope to achieve finality or perfection.  In present circumstances we can only make what we consider the best arrangement for the future, and see that an opportunity is afforded to reconsider matters at a later stage.  In the beginning of an experiment such as this, a certain leap in the dark must be taken. There are certain doubts but, on the whole, I think the proposal is sound enough because there is a market here.</P>
    <P>With regard to industrial proposals generally, there are all these difficulties. We could, if we wished, sit down, <Col N="1911" /> as our predecessors did, saying that it was too much trouble.  There are many Departmental difficulties.  We cannot possibly overcome them at once.  It may be that we will not overcome them satisfactorily.  At any rate we are determined to go ahead.  That is a big thing, if there is a will to face the difficulties.  After all, if there were no difficulties there would be no fun. The difficulties are there and they have to be got over.  With the assistance and co-operation of the Oireachtas and the people I think we will be able to face those difficulties and, please God, overcome them.</P>
    <P>Of course, some Senators disagree fundamentally with this policy.  I remind them, at any rate, that the policy is definite; that we are going in a certain direction.  It is not like the policy of other countries that goes in one direction for two or three years and then turns back and goes in the other direction. At least we will not say that we are going to stick to the gold standard, that everything depends upon doing so, and then suddenly reverse, saying, that there is no necessity whatever for sticking to the gold standard.  Another country which announced that it was the most wonderful free trade country in the world; that free trade was the life breath of commercial prosperity, turns round and decrees a regular tariff wall, imposing tariffs as high as any other country.  The Government there should not interfere with free trade, which was the policy for 100 years, neither should it regulate trade, but now it suddenly turns round and ties up trade and agriculture by a system of quotas and restrictions.</P>
    <P>In this country people may disagree with our policy, which is clear and definite, and which, on the whole, is understood.  But I think the people, as a whole, are anxious that the policy of relying on the foreign article, because it is a cheap article, should end, and that we should try to produce our own requirements. If we fail, well and good.  Someone will come along and point that out, but there is no need to burst into righteous indignation.  People will get an opportunity of pointing out whatever mistakes the Government makes, <Col N="1912" /> and there will be a full discussion on them.  Would it not be better for the country if we had more co-operation and more of the friendly advice which we had from some Senators, so that we could get things right?</P>
    <P>At any rate, let us recognise, like people in Parliaments in other States, that when a certain Government is elected with a certain policy, it is the duty of the country to let that policy go ahead; not to obstruct it and not to come along with shibboleths about economic isolation.  I could call the policy of economic isolation economic development.  The argument of increased cost to the purchaser has been exploded, because we have shown in the factories that were set up in Cork and elsewhere that we can produce articles as good, and probably better, than foreign articles without increasing prices.  The technique is there if we only get the necessary technical qualifications and get our own people to acquire them. There is no reason whatever why all our resources should not be placed at the disposal of our own people.  If, as Senator Johnson stated, we do not do that, we will only make confusion worse confounded.  For the present the Government has accepted the principle of private enterprise.  On the whole, we believe it is better that these new industries should be run by people who have experience, and who are well qualified to run them rather than that a Government Department should attempt to do it.  If there are difficulties in dealing with these capitalists and so on, and it is quite obvious that public policy is subordinated to private enterprise, and if the general intention of the Government, that the whole policy we are engaged upon at present should be for the benefit of the community as a whole, is not being carried out, I quite agree with Senator Farren that it is the duty of the Government to take steps to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>The Senator, however, while referring to the irrelevancies that had been introduced, brought in some irrelevancies himself.  He referred to the closing down of a factory in Dublin.  I am not fully cognisant with all the facts, but I know <Col N="1913" /> that every effort possible was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to endeavour to get people in this country interested in that factory and to get the necessary 51 per cent. of native capital, and I know that people were interested and that people could have done it, if they thought it was a good business proposition, but they thought that, apart altogether from the particular difficulty of the time, the general prospects of that particular factory were not good.  That is my information.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas attaches great importance to the Control of Manufactures Act.  It seems to me that Section 12, to which I referred, shows clearly what the policy of the Minister in this regard is.  He will endeavour, so far as he can, to see that the majority holding of the capital is in the hands of Irish Free State nationals, and that the management will, so far as possible, remain in the hands of our own nationals and that, so far as possible, employment will be given to our own people also. I am not in a position to say to what extent those groups who have put up proposals in this matter are prepared to float a capital issue here or what arrangements they have made with the banks or what other arrangements they have made for an issue.  All I can say is that, in this matter, we shall, of course, endeavour to get the 51 per cent. of Irish Free State capital, but I would remind Senators that we have a number of proposals of this kind such as the beet and peat proposals and this particular proposal here, and I could not say, at the moment, whether, in respect of all or any of those proposals, it will be possible to get the capital subscribed here at home.  We know that, up to the present, there has been a certain diffidence and more than diffidence, a definite timidity, in investing capital at home.  People have been afraid of labour troubles; they have been afraid that this policy which is being embarked upon at present may not continue but that it may be changed at some future time.  I have no doubt whatever but that the Government will endeavour to get the largest <Col N="1914" /> possible amount of capital subscribed here at home.  If it is the position that we cannot get the 51 per cent. of capital subscribed here at home in connection with the cement industry, we shall have to consider whether it is worth while going on with the proposals. I have quite an open mind on that matter but I think that, even if we cannot get the 51 per cent., if we can assure ourselves that, in the future, the majority holding will be in the hands of our own nationals, we should be satisfied.  We should be prepared to take a certain amount of risk in the beginning if we feel that ultimately the thing will work out all right and that the policy that we are desirous of having in operation will be carried out.</P>
    <P>I agree also that a great many people would prefer an extension of the brick works, and I have only to say that public bodies, obviously, can do a great deal to help these brick works in their different areas.  I know also that definite proposals have been made and definite work is going on to develop brick works in different parts of the country.  That is very valuable indeed, and I hope that this proposal will not injure this development in any way. There will always be the question, alluded to by many Senators, as to whether the cement house, in spite of its cheapness, is really the best dwelling even for poor people. There will always be, I think, a desire among architects and public men generally, and those charged with responsibility in the matter, to endeavour to provide brick houses, and I think that public bodies, under the present arrangements for giving preference to Irish materials, can do a lot to help these brick works forward.</P>
    <P>We have two points of view which again show the difficulties that a Department is up against in connection with proposals of this kind.  We have the point of view expressed here on the left that we want to safeguard ourselves against these capitalists in the matter of the capital and to see that the return they get is not inordinate and not too large a proportion of the return which the factory gets from its manufacturing. <Col N="1915" /> On the other hand, we have the point of view of Senator Douglas, who is anxious that these people who come in and invest their money here should have some safeguard, and that they should not be at the mercy of the Minister, and he suggests that, on Committee Stage, we may have to discuss the question of whether some definite conditions or definite safeguards might not be embodied in the Bill to protect these people.  We are taking a risk just the same as they are.</P>
    <P>The whole matter is <i>sub judice</i> at present, but I must assume, from my own knowledge, which has been corroborated in the House, that these big cement manufacturing combines are not likely to make any great mistakes in any arrangements they are making with the Government.  They have all the technical knowledge and experience; they can come along with new machinery, with the very latest developments, and, in dealing with them, of course, we have only knowledge which, perhaps, is not very up-to-date in regard to these costings and so on.  These people are always in an advantageous position in that they have the very latest knowledge and know where the greatest economies can be made, and know, when planning out a new factory, everything that will go to making it the producer of higher profit per unit than has ever been done before.  They have acquired that knowledge, and it is their opportunity. They have spent their whole lifetime on that, and, as I said in the beginning, so long as we accept the principle, as we are accepting it, that private enterprise should have a hand in these proposals, and that we should rely on it largely to bring them to fruition, we must, if we ask them to take a certain risk in establishing the industry, at the same time give them certain opportunities to make good.</P>
    <P>When the Government is definitely associated with proposals of this character by legislation, obviously, the matter would always, if particular difficulties or crises arise, be fully open to public opinion and open to the fullest possible discussion in both Houses. That is the best security the people <Col N="1916" /> have and, on the other hand, it is a security that is very valuable to those investing in the industry.  They have the Seanad there as well as the Dáil and if they feel that they are not being well treated, I am sure that they can get opportunities to raise the particular matter that is afflicting them. I do not think I need go into the matter further.  Senator Miss Browne and Senator Crosbie referred to the claims of their respective areas and Senator MacEllin referred to the West of Ireland as a suitable area for one of these factories.  No decision has been made on the matter, and I think the House, as a whole, will appreciate that it would be quite impossible for me to give any indication.  I mentioned the fact that a factory was likely to be erected in the east and also in the south, because the Minister for Industry and Commerce had already mentioned that in the Lower House, but beyond that I could not go at the moment.  In any case, not having gone into the matter in detail with the groups who are interested as to what areas are best from the point of view of raw materials and all the other relevant factors, I could not possibly give any indication at the moment as to what places exactly are in mind beyond the general indication that the Minister has already given in the Lower House, that these groups are, apparently, interested in having their factories as near to the points of big consumption as possible.  Any influence that the Government may have would be directed to endeavouring to decentralise these works and to spreading the employment more widely over the whole country, but there again you have, as I have already indicated, special difficulties.  I can assure the House that the claims of particular areas are not being overlooked and that, in regard to some of the very poorest, we are making special arrangements and hope to deal with them in a special way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment will be to restore the position under the Principal Act whereby no trade loan guarantee could be given for the purposes of working capital.  I consider that was a very wise precaution. The Minister, on the Second Reading, justified this new proposal whereby working capital will be eligible for the guarantee on the argument that a person might, in the first instance, invest his own capital in buildings and then have none left for the purposes of working capital.  Surely that position could be met under the old Act, because if he merely advances his own capital for the purpose of buildings of a fixed character it will be quite possible to regard that in the nature of an advance and let the Government advance take the place of that, setting free the money given under the guarantee for working capital.  What I fear will happen under this new proposal is that a person with little or no resources, the possessor of buildings which he has inherited or which he has been in possession of for a considerable time, buildings on which no expenditure has been made for many years and which, perhaps, are not up-to-date in any way, will come along and say that he wants capital merely for the purposes of working capital.  A guarantee in such a case would, I consider, be very undesirable. It was the object of the original <Col N="1919" /> measure to avoid circumstances of that kind, and I do not see that it should be departed from now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>While I sympathise to a considerable extent with some of the arguments used by Senator Sir John Keane, I do not agree that this amendment would be a wise one to accept or that it would help the position.  I think I am correct in stating that what he said in regard to the old Act was not the case.  It was definitely ruled that it was not possible to obtain a further loan under the conditions to which the Senator referred.  That is not my principal reason for opposing the amendment.  There are two classes of concerns that, to my mind, are properly eligible for a Government guarantee.  One is a perfectly new concern in which a substantial amount of private capital has been introduced. Personally, although it is not in the Act, I think the Government will have to introduce for their own safeguarding some kind of general rule as to the percentage of private capital which they will insist on having introduced into a concern.  I do not think it matters very much as to whether that private capital is technically used for working capital or whether it is used for buildings.  It is the proportion of the total amount of money that is being put into a concern, as represented by assets, which really matters.  The other class of company that I have in mind is one that is already in existence, one in which a substantial proportion of money has already been invested.  For the sake of argument, if you have a company with a capital of £200,000, which wishes to make another article or extend its present works, and wants a loan of £30,000 or £40,000, then part of that will be essential for working capital, because if you extend machinery or extend your business you require an increased amount of working capital.  A loan of £40,000 to a company already in existence, with £200,000 invested in it, is a far safer loan for the State than a loan of money that is going to be put into brand new buildings which a few days after they are built will be worth <Col N="1920" /> only a half or a quarter of the money advanced if the company wound up. Therefore, I think the arbitrary provision with regard to working capital was a mistake.  It made it more difficult for money to be advanced to existing concerns.  In fact, existing concerns were ruled out completely under the old Act.  I admit there is difficulty in saying what the percentage ought to be, but I believe the Government will find it desirable to insist on a general percentage for working capital fixed in relation to the amount of private capital invested in a concern. I do not believe the amendment would achieve what Senator Sir John Keane requires.  It would prevent, I think, the guaranteeing of loans of a most desirable character to firms already in existence; firms which have been reasonably successful and wish to extend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather inclined to agree with the views put forward by Senator Sir John Keane.  I think it would be very wrong to provide working capital out of Government funds for any business.  In the case of a firm, such as Senator Douglas spoke of, requiring a loan of £30,000 it ought to be in a position to give a mortgage on its premises and machinery that would enable the Government to take the place of a bank.  A bank might require more liquid security than the Government, but under this Act I certainly think it would be very short-sighted on the part of the Government to give a guarantee for a loan required merely for the purposes of working capital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what Senator Crosbie has said, if a company even borrows £10,000 or £15,000 to purchase machinery for extensions, that becomes a first charge and therefore, will definitely limit the further borrowing powers of that firm from a bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Senator Douglas's suggestion would be feasible because while the Advisory Committee up to the present, I think, have insisted in practically all cases on applicants putting up 50 per cent. of the capital required there may be special cases where, for reasons of Government policy, we consider that <Col N="1921" /> additional assistance might be given on general national grounds&mdash;for the development say of particular areas or because an industry is definitely experimental and is in the nature of scientific research.  We have these special cases, but I do not know whether a percentage arrangement would be feasible.  I can promise the Senator that I will look into the matter with the Advisory Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the amendment itself I fear that if we accepted it we would be negativing the whole principle of the Bill.  The position which we found ourselves in was that we had certain industries in respect of which the situation was as Senator Sir John Keane himself referred to the applicant had expended his money on buildings, plant, or premises.  The money having been expended in that way it was not possible, under the old Act, to recommend the application for an advance.  It was definitely excluded and a loan could not be guaranteed upon it.  We had some cases of that kind.  Then, again, we have to depend largely on the Advisory Committee.  It is composed of an independent body of businessmen who have had a good deal of experience of this work.  They are absolutely free in making their recommendations. If their recommendation is in favour of the rejection of an application the Minister, I think, invariably accepts it.  If they recommend the guaranteeing of a loan the Minister, I think, also accepts their recommendation.  The members of the Advisory Committee are quite free and independent.  Senator Sir John Keane wants to amend the Bill in the drastic way he proposes, but we have to assume that the members of the Advisory Committee will act as reasonable men and will not put up any proposition that they cannot stand over. After all, it is quite usual for business people to go to the banks and get overdrafts for the purposes of working capital.  It would be a very serious position if industries had to close down because of a mere technicality although the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Advisory Committee and the Department of Finance were satisfied that there was a good <Col N="1922" /> case for a guarantee.  It would be a very serious thing if the application should be rejected and perhaps an industry closed down because of this technical defect in the law.</P>
    <P>The whole object of the Minister in this Bill is to deal with that kind of situation.  It is not anticipated that this Bill will be permanently necessary. A Bill was introduced in the Dáil to-day to deal in a different way with the question of industrial credits.  I think the Senator might withdraw his amendment in view of the fact that he has the Department of Finance and the Advisory Committee to safeguard the position, and further, that it has been the practice up to the present for the Committee to insist on 50 per cent. of the money being put up.  The Committee will have to satisfy themselves that it is impossible to raise money from the banks or in any other way, and that the applicant has made the best effort possible to raise the money by his own private endeavours before they will recommend the application. If the Committee are not satisfied on all these points, the chances are that they will reject the application.  The Senator will recognise that the Committee are not blind to the fact that manufacturers have every opportunity under the present tariff system of making good.  They have got quite exceptional opportunities, and, therefore, I can assure the Senator, that it is only in very exceptional circumstances, where we felt that an industry was definitely in danger, that we would be anxious to implement this new amendment of the Trade Loans Act.  I fear, therefore, that I cannot accept the amendment.  It would be at variance with the whole principle of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not like the sort of picture that the Minister has shown us of these trade loan guarantees coming to the rescue of an industry in danger.  Surely that is not the purpose of the Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to create fresh employment, to enable retail prices to be reduced, and not to save concerns in general.  I am alarmed because I can see the Government stepping in to enable concerns to pay off their creditors.  Banks very <Col N="1923" /> seldom do that.  Banks, with all the precautions they take and all the security they get, make, unfortunately, quite a large amount of bad debts. Here&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;I see a position where the fixed assets of a concern have been fully pledged already and where further capital is required.  That capital, if used for working capital, will be unsecured.  If it is used to pay off the prior creditors who have a lien on the fixed property, it will no longer be required for working capital.  It is because the previous experience of these trade loan guarantees has been so unfortunate that I feel the House would be wise to insist on certain specific precautions.  If it decides in its wisdom not to insist on any statutory precautions and, as the Minister says, leave it to the Advisory Committee, well and good, but previous experience does not show that the money will be very safe by that method.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3 :&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 6 of the Act of 1924 is hereby amended as follows, that is to say, by the addition at the end thereof of the words &ldquo;and (a) the amount of capital repayment outstanding, and (b) the amount of interest in arrear.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present under the Principal Act the Minister has to lay before each House within one month after 31st March in each year an account up to that date of the total sums, if any, which have been issued out of the Central Fund under this Act, and the total sums, if any, which have been paid into the Exchequer in repayment of sums so issued.  This new section, if it is passed, will require him to give this further information annually, that is to say the amount of capital repayment outstanding and the amount of interest <Col N="1924" /> in arrear.  Heretofore a considerable time has elapsed before the House has been aware of the large losses under this Trade Loan Guarantee Act.  It does seem only right and proper that the House in placing the resources of the State at the disposal of private enterprise should know from time to time, as an ordinary business precaution, how the loan is faring.  If an advance is made under certain conditions of capital repayment, and if these capital repayments are not made, it is surely reasonable that this House and the Dáil should know that.  In the same way if the interest is not punctually paid Parliament should know.  That will be the effect of the new section.  It seems to me entirely reasonable that, when we are practically becoming partners or shareholders in a business, we should be informed of the progress of that business and, that if it is not going well, we should be informed of that fact at least once a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that in that case the amendment is of no value.  What is the purpose of the amendment?  Say there are 20 firms who have obtained loans, that 19 of them are paying up, but one, a very large one, is not.  You publish the deficits of the one, but that gives no information.  The purpose of the amendment surely would be to find out if particular firms are in default.  If that is the purpose, surely it is not very wise to make a comparison between banks and the publication of any information regarding cash transactions with their customers.  It seems to me that is the analogy.  If you ask the Minister to publish the position of every individual firm for the information <Col N="1925" /> not merely of the members of the Dáil and the Seanad, but for the information of the world, you are not doing what banks would do.  Further, I would point out that the directors of the financial undertaking are well aware of the position, that is to say, the Minister for Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor-General are made aware each year of the facts of the matter, and if there is anything to be reported it will be brought to light in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I thing the suggestion to publish individual cases would be disastrous if adopted, and to publish the total would be useless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Sir John Keane used an argument which really does not apply.  He says that a sum of money has been lost in the early stages of the application of this policy.  We admit that some money was lost, but in things like that, when they are in an experimental stage, it is usual to sustain some loss.  Therefore, I think what happened under the former Administration is really no strong argument at the present time. What is the object of publishing these two things&mdash;the amount of money outstanding and the amount of interest in arrear?  Senator Sir John Keane says he does not want it in the case of individual firms.  In that he is very reasonable.  He does not want it in the case of individual firms; he only wants the aggregate.  What does he want the aggregate for?  Is it for the purpose of having here each year a debate as to the wisdom of this policy of supporting industries?  It would take a considerable amount of capital in arrear and a great amount of interest in arrear to deflect me, for one, from the policy of favouring industries in parts of the country where capitalists as a rule are not inclined to invest money and where employment is most needed.  I think Senator Sir John Keane having stated his position and shown his knowledge of the earlier Act and of this Act, should allow the Bill to go as it has been drafted without amendment.</P>

      <P>The procedure which has <Col N="1926" /> been in operation up to the present has been in operation since 1924. While I must agree with Senator Sir John Keane that we have had unfortunate occurrences in the operation of the Act, I think that far from this proposal being reasonable it is most unreasonable, coming from a Senator who knows how extraordinarily careful commercial concerns must be about having their financial position made known to the world.  The Advisory Committee is what we have ultimately to depend upon, and while we have had these unfortunate occurrences, as a result of which the State has lost money and lost heavily, we have to assume, and I assume, that this Committee, while anxious to encourage industry, will on the whole be just as careful of the taxpayers' money as bank directors are of a bank's money.  Nobody could suggest to a bank that they should give the slightest information as to the financial position of the firms with whom they are doing business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested here that we should publish to the world in the initial stages the difficulties of industries which are depending on our aid.  The fact that you publish the aggregate only does not mean anything.  It may be that one company would be involved, but, in any case, every company that is getting a loan is going to be adversely affected.  Its credit is going to be very badly affected in the eyes of the public if any particulars regarding arrears are published.  I think the amendment is altogether unreasonable and would be most unfair.  We are out either to help firms, or we are not.  If we accepted the amendment, I do not think that business people would take us seriously, because obviously we would not be taking even the ordinary precautions to keep their affairs private. If it happens that something goes wrong with the affairs of a firm which has obtained a loan and that that is published, the position would only be worsened.  The Senator knows, too, that the Department will have a full knowledge of any case where default is likely to arise, or actually arises, and the question is likely to be dealt <Col N="1927" /> with in the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I think the amendment would be altogether unfair and unjust in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the criticism which has been made of the amendment, I do not think it is at all unfair.  The information will be given in the aggregate.  There will be no more revealed to the public than is generally common knowledge, because word is passed round quickly in commercial circles when people are in difficulties.  Through enquiries of various kinds and from various sources, business people have a very shrewd idea when other concerns are in difficulties.  Senators who have spoken against the amendment do not seem to be seized of our duty in this matter. We are allowing State resources to be used to start enterprises and we are quite satisfied, apparently, to let the position drift until after two or three years we may be faced with the fact that two-thirds of the capital has been lost.  It is our duty to know from time to time, not how individuals are faring, but how the total liabilities of our debtors are in the aggregate being discharged.  I do not for a moment accept the view that this amendment is in any way unreasonable.  On the other hand, I consider it is our plain and bounden duty to have these things published if we are to have regard to our responsibilities to the taxpayer. As for Senator Comyn's comments, we do not appear to talk in the same language.  Senator Comyn is prepared to hand out public moneys right and left to anybody who wants it&mdash;that is my interpretation of his statement&mdash; for the purpose of relieving unemployment. I consider that if that attitude were adopted we should shortly find ourselves bankrupt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane with his usual eloquence has tremendously overstated what I intended to convey.  I intended to be quite reasonable, and not to throw away public money right and left.  I am merely considering the fact that there are certain areas in this country where unemployment <Col N="1928" /> is great, where employment is very much needed, and where somebody must take the risk which an ordinary investor would not be in a position to take.  Let me show how unreasonable Senator Sir John Keane is.  Let us suppose that Senator Sir John Keane and myself are two successful applicants for a trade loan, that Sir John Keane pays up his principal and interest, and that I do not pay up either principal or interest.  We are both bracketed together.  There is shown in the annual return that there is so much money outstanding for principal and interest unpaid. Certain ill-disposed people might then say: &ldquo;There is Sir John Keane; he got an advance of money and he has not paid either principal or interest.&rdquo; His plan of aggregating the good and the bad is very unfair to the good. The only fair amendment would be to provide for the publication of the names of the firms which are in default, and the amounts which they are in default, both in regard to principal and to interest.  That would be fair, but everybody admits it would be very bad business.</P>

      <P>On this section, may I ask for information?  Under the Principal Act, a return is published of the total amount of advances made during the previous quarter and the amount of interest arising thereon.  In the last return, two advances are set out and the figure given for interest liability is 2½ per cent.  I think the Minister will agree when I suggest that that is not the rate of interest paid by the borrower.  That return has caused considerable misunderstanding in business circles, suggesting, as it does, that a person secured under the Trade Loans Act can go and borrow money at the rate stated.  Will the Minister be good enough to clarify the position?</P>

      <P>The statement is a statement of guarantees and the rate of interest shown thereon is the rate guaranteed by the Minister under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts.  The interest actually charged is greater and, in such cases as are financed by a bank, the interest depends upon the current bank rate and is therefore a fluctuating amount.  In case of default, the charge upon public funds is limited to the rate of 2½ per cent. I am having arrangements made to have a note added to the statement which will make the position quite clear on the face of the document.</P>

      <P>Three years ago, the first of the Public (Charitable) Hospitals Acts became law.  The purpose of these Acts is to enable funds to be raised, by means of sweepstakes, for hospitals that provide treatment to a specified extent for poor patients. If a hospital, or a group of hospitals, desire to raise money in this way, they are required by the Principal Act to appoint a committee for the purpose. This committee has to draw up its scheme, submit the scheme to the Minister for Justice for his approval, and, when it obtains the sanction of the Minister for Justice, it becomes lawful to put the scheme into operation. Although the Act contemplates the possibility of a single hospital promoting a sweepstake for its own benefit, in actual practice individual hospitals, as everybody knows, have not promoted sweepstakes for their own special benefit.  From the beginning, there has been a management committee, or, strictly speaking, a series of management committees, one being appointed for each sweepstake; these committees have been responsible for initiating schemes and carrying <Col N="1931" /> them through.  The Act of 1930 contained a number of safeguards to ensure that each sweepstake would be properly conducted.  The management committee were bound to deposit with trustees a sum equal to the total amount of the prizes and these trustees were authorised to pay, out of the money at their disposal, any prizes not duly paid or provided by the committee. Under the 1930 Act, not less than 20 per cent. of the money received from the sale of tickets was to go for the benefit of the hospitals. In fact over 25 per cent. has been made available to the voluntary hospitals. The expenses of sweepstakes, other than remuneration given in relation to the sale of tickets, was limited to 30 per cent. of the money received.  In practice, the expenses of the sweepstakes have not reached that figure, and have not even approximated to that figure.  In respect of the last sweepstake, the expenses did not exceed 10 per cent.  The payment of promoters has been limited to 7 per cent.  That was the amount paid for the first sweepstake but, since the first sweepstake, they have been getting less than 3 per cent.  It is not proposed in this Bill to alter the percentages laid down in the preceding Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three bodies are primarily concerned with each sweepstake.  In the first place, there is the management committee, which is primarily responsible for initiating the scheme; there are the trustees, who hold the deposit to secure the payment of the prizes, and there are the promoters, who actually conduct the sweep, who from the beginning have been a limited company &mdash;the Hospitals Trust&mdash;and with whom the management committee enter into the agreement.  A further body&mdash;the Committee of Reference, to which I shall refer presently&mdash;has been set up under these Acts but this committee has nothing to do with the actual holding of the sweepstakes.  Although the Bill repeals all the Public (Charitable) Hospitals Acts passed since 1930, it re-enacts in substantially the same form the parts of those Acts relating to the holding of sweepstakes.  When a <Col N="1932" /> hospital, or a number of hospitals, wish to organise a sweepstake, they will have to appoint a committee to draw up a scheme for the sanction of the Minister for Justice and make a deposit with the trustees equal to the amount of the prizes.  There is a slight change in the present Bill with regard to the period during which such committee shall continue in operation.  At present, as I have said, a committee has to be appointed for each sweepstake about to be held.  Under this Bill a committee can be appointed to hold more than one sweepstake.  The committee will continue to act until such time as the Minister for Justice or the committee of the associated hospitals terminates its existence.  The committee itself can also terminate its existence under the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before explaining in further detail in what respects this Bill differs from existing legislation, I should, perhaps, direct the attention of the House to the extension of the definition of &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; in Section 1 of the Bill. In the Act of 1930, the word &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; was given the meaning that ordinarily attaches to it&mdash;that is, an institution for affording medical, surgical or dental treatment.  In the two Acts passed the following year, it is provided that one-third of the proceeds of the sweepstakes be paid to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  This third share was to be applied to the provision, improvement or equipment of institutions maintained by local authorities for the prevention, treatment or cure of physical or mental diseases or injuries and also for the benefit of nursing organisations who were given one twenty-fifth part of the allocation to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; in this Bill covers all the types of institutions that could receive benefit under the previous Acts and it extends the definition so as to cover institutions for the blind, deaf, dumb and mentally defective.  It also includes institutions for the care and maintenance of expectant mothers or mothers with children of less than five years.  A few of these institutions have been set up in recent years.  Under existing sweepstake <Col N="1933" /> legislation, county homes have not been considered eligible for allocations out of the sweepstake funds. The definition of &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; is extended in Section 1 of the Bill before the House so as to include the infirmary portions of county homes.</P>
    <P>Senators who have any intimate association with the administration of these county homes, or with the class of patients who go there, will realise that in many of the infirmaries there are poor old people, who do not expect to be cured of their illness, and are not afforded up-to-date hospital facilities, even for the form of treatment that may be made available for them, so as to, at least, ease their condition, if it was not calculated ultimately to cure them.  A good deal could be done for poor old people and for chronic invalids, who have no prospect of being cured but, whose condition at least could be considerably eased.  It is intended for that reason, where infirmaries in county homes fall far short of what is desirable, and as the local authorities have not found it possible to finance the extensions and equipment which would be desirable, to include infirmaries in the scope of the Bill amongst institutions to which allocations can be made.</P>
    <P>It is also intended to make money available from the Sweepstake Fund for research work.  I need scarcely remind the Seanad that although clinical observation is of great value, an advance in medicine must largely come from new knowledge obtainable, to a great extent, by laboratory investigation. The necessity for giving financial assistance for research work has been impressed upon me by the medical profession.  The Committee of Reference in its report referred to the importance of and the necessity for extending work under this head. Accepting in principle the fact that research is now closely associated with hospital work, it becomes a proper object for subvention.</P>
    <P>I now come to the part of the Bill which proposes a departure from the existing arrangement for the distribution of the moneys.  At first, when the management committee drew up a <Col N="1934" /> scheme they stated in what proportion the proceeds would be distributed amongst the bodies they represented. The surpluses of the first three sweeps were distributed in this way, and the promoters agreed on the allocation and the proportion that would go to the various participating hospitals. In 1931 the law was altered, and the Minister, when he sanctioned the scheme, was directed to set up a Committee of Reference consisting of three persons, to report to him as to the proportion in which the hospitals' share of the proceeds should be divided.  The Committee was first appointed for the scheme under the Manchester November Handicap, 1931, and the report was published in the following May.  I am sure Senators have read the report, in the course of which the Committee criticised the existing hospital system.  I do not wish to over stress the criticism unduly, as it appeared in the report, but at the outset the Committee noted the lack of appreciation by many of the hospitals of proper lines of development in relation to the needs of the community.  They stated that building programmes were hastily considered; without any survey of what was required in that particular area, that there was no general plan, and no attempt at co-ordination.  They suggested that in most cases the main anxiety in the minds of the governing bodies of the hospitals was to obtain the largest possible award out of the moneys available.  Of course one could understand that.  That was naturally in the minds of those connected with the promoting hospitals.</P>
    <P>With that report from the Committee of Reference before it, it appears to me that the Government would be neglecting an opportunity if they allowed things to stand as they are, and continued to make allocations on that basis, without trying to evolve some system of co-ordination, such as was suggested by the Committee of Reference.  Until we have a complete survey of the hospital facilities, especially in regard to the facilities extended for the treatment of the poor, and of the needs of the community, or of that section of the community <Col N="1935" /> that is unable to provide its own medical treatment, it does not appear to be possible to decide in what proportion this money can be allocated, in order to secure the best results. This survey cannot be carried out in the course of a few months, or between one sweep and another.  It is a matter that will probably entail investigation extending over many years.  Obviously, if the report was rushed, and if we did not take due time to make a complete survey and examination of our hospital requirements, and of the existing institutions at our disposal, mistakes would be made.  It would be too late to try to remedy the defects in our hospital system when all the money had been expended.</P>
    <P>To meet that situation, the Bill proposes to set up a body called the Hospitals Commission to carry out the necessary investigations, to prepare schemes for improving and co-ordinating our hospital facilities, and in future to advise the Minister on applications for grants referred to him.  On the setting up of the Hospitals Commission, and the passage of this Bill, the Committee of Reference will be abolished.  The Hospitals Commission will consist of at least three persons, but, in the beginning, until a considerable amount of the preliminary investigation and survey has been carried out, it will be found necessary to have a larger membership than three.  In all probability the normal membership of the Commission for some time, at any rate, will be five, and of these it is intended that two should be medical men and three laymen.</P>
    <P>There is another departure from the existing arrangement regarding the disposal of the money accruing from the sweepstakes.  It is not proposed to continue the division of the surplus on each sweepstake into the proportion of two-thirds being earmarked for voluntary institutions, and one-third to the Minister for Local Government.  In future the proceeds of each sweepstake will go into a single fund, to be called the Hospitals Trust Fund, which will be held and managed by five trustees to be appointed by the Minister.  All the proceeds of the sweepstake, up to <Col N="1936" /> and including those of the Derby, 1932, have been distributed.  These are all that could legally be distributed at present, as the Committee of Reference has not yet reported on any of the sweepstakes held subsequent to the Derby of 1932.</P>
    <P>Any surpluses that have not been distributed when this Bill becomes law, it is proposed to hand over to the national trustees, to be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this Bill.  The normal procedure will be that in future when the governing body of an hospital applies to the Minister for a grant, he will refer the application to the Hospitals Commission for investigation and report.  There will be obviously some cases in which it will not be necessary to submit applications to the Hospitals Commission Applications from boards of health, mental hospitals' committees, and such local authorities in general, have had detailed examination by the Minister's technical advisers.  Many schemes that have already received detailed examination are ready for operation. It will not be necessary to submit such schemes to the Hospitals Commission. In such cases the Minister will be empowered to make such allocations as he may consider proper.</P>

      <P>More or less.  The Minister can attach conditions to the making of a grant.  Perhaps it would be well if I explained the reasons for this provision at this stage.  It will be found in Section 24 (5).  The Public Charitable Hospitals Act did not apply to other hospitals.  The Acts on the Statute Book apply only to hospitals in receipt of voluntary subscriptions, and that use 25 per cent. of their accommodation for free patients, or those who pay at a rate not exceeding 10/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1937" /> These conditions are in the first Act. It was found that they operated to exclude certain institutions that were doing very necessary and very useful public work, and the Oireachtas, from time to time, by legislation, allowed certain hospitals to become participants in the benefits of the sweepstake moneys although they did not provide 25 per cent. of the beds free or comply with the conditions.  The first amending Act of 1931 contained, for example, the names of six institutions to which the Act was extended, notwithstanding the conditions I have mentioned.  The Bill does not re-enact these conditions. It gives the Minister power to specify the purposes for which a grant is to be expended and power to attach conditions for securing that it shall be expended on these purposes and, also, to attach conditions for attaining other objects, such as the provision of free beds, so long as the endowment lasts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 24 (5).  It is obvious that, before the Minister imposes any conditions, he or the Hospitals Commission will have to consult the body affected so as to satisfy himself that the conditions he is attaching to the allocation are reasonable conditions and conditions that are capable of fulfilment and which the institution is willing to carry out.  The section has given rise to a certain amount of apprehension on the part of some of the voluntary hospitals.  Some people appear to think that its real purpose is to enable the Minister to interfere in the day-to-day management of these voluntary institutions and that he might even interfere to control details of administration.  I have, in the Dáil, stated many times, and, perhaps, I shall have to state it more than once in this House, that the Minister has no such intention whatever.  The one object in the mind of the Minister, the object that we mean to achieve and to take such powers as will ensure that we can achieve it, is to secure that moneys will be used so that adequate provision will be made for the treatment of <Col N="1938" /> the poor, that the best equipment will be provided in these institutions to ensure that the very best that medical science can provide in the way of treatment will be at the disposal of the poor, free of charge, and it is necessary, I think, that we should take certain powers to attach conditions to the making of allocations if we are to safeguard the position of the poor in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An hospital may join with others in promoting a sweepstake but the fact that an hospital does join with others in promoting a sweepstake does not, of itself, give that hospital any right to any share of the proceeds.  The claim will have to be established in the ordinary way on the basis of the work that the institution is doing for the community and it will have to be established to the satisfaction of the Commission and to the satisfaction of the Minister.  As Senators are aware, the Public Charitable (Hospitals) Acts would, in the ordinary course, expire next year.  The extent of the unsatisfied needs of the hospitals, as shown in the Report of the Committee of Reference and as we are aware of it in our records in the Local Government Department, renders it necessary, apart altogether from other considerations, to continue the Acts in some form.  The Bill before the House does not fix any time limit and the reason we have not attempted to fix a time limit is that we cannot, at this stage, forecast the financial results of future sweepstakes.  Neither are we in a position to know, until this survey we have in mind has been carried out, the approximate amount of money that would be necessary in order to produce the scheme of hospitalisation that we have in mind.  The operation of the Bill can terminate in many ways.  It can be repealed if and when it has served its object.  The Minister for Justice may, at any time he is satisfied that sufficient money has been raised, withhold his sanction to a scheme, or the voluntary hospitals, if they are satisfied that sufficient money has already accrued for their purposes, may not set up a committee to promote a scheme at all, so that in a number of ways the operation of the Bill can be <Col N="1939" /> terminated.  Over £5,000,000 has been made available, in the last three years, for hospital purposes by means of sweepstakes and about four-fifths of that amount has already been distributed to the hospitals or allocated by the Minister for Local Government. I have no doubt that, if the Oireachtas had been able to foresee the huge and astounding success of the Hospitals Sweeps, as a method of raising money, legislation such as this would have been introduced probably at the very beginning and some such machinery as we propose setting up now under this Bill would probably have been set up at the outset, but, at any rate, it appears to me that it is better to come along and try to get some co-ordination and to get our hospital development along some premeditated plan, even at this stage, than that we should continue to disburse money, not in accordance with the estimated needs of the community, but in accordance with the estimated needs of the individual hospitals themselves, which is an entirely different thing.  The connecting link that has been established now by the Committee which has been set up to promote the sweepstakes will probably be found to be very useful in the future.  We hope to have the full co-operation of the voluntary hospitals in trying to evolve the best system that it is possible to evolve and we hope to be able to allay, with the passage of time and with a reasonable and sensible administration of this Act, any suspicion that may be in the minds of the Committee of the Associated Hospitals at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>This House has facilitated the Government, as far as possible, in extending the section by which the Minister for Local Government could apply towards prophylactic medicine&mdash;in this case, clearance of slums&mdash;the money subscribed by the sweepstakes.  The position at present is that £5,000,000 have been subscribed, and the Dublin public are still as badly housed and as dependent on hospitals as ever they were.  It is the most extraordinary example of stultification by success that I have ever experienced.  Here we are with 50,000 <Col N="1940" /> people in one room tenements, and we have £5,000,000, and we are as far from relieving them as ever, and the need for hospitals is growing.  There are about 19 hospitals in the city, with 19 slum areas round them, lowering the rateable value of their areas in the town.  Each hospital creates a slum, and the slum requires an hospital.  The Government, having wrung the neck of the goose, are now discussing its golden eggs, as if the sweeps were going on for ever&mdash;from success to greater success; the Government has peculated the sweepstake money just as chivalrously as a rogue who robs the till of a blind man's dog.  They are killing the sweep as they killed our cattle trade. They should have known very well that the sweep only lives by publicity and yet they tax the source of the sweep's life&mdash;the British Press.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>And the &ldquo;Daily Mail.&rdquo; If you wish to discuss this taxation of the Press further: for the first time in our history the Tammanyisation of this town came into being under the present Government and we have the owner of the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; extracting taxes from the public pocket to preserve his private property.  The public taxed for private property.  If that is not corruption I do not know what is corruption. I will not go further into that matter.  The point I wish to discuss is that this immense amount of money which has already been given has not, even under the powers we gave the Minister or tried to give the Minister, been applied towards preventive medicine in dealing with disease-producing conditions.  It has tied the hands of those interested in public health.  Everybody had good intentions but, apparently, the wording of the Bill is inelastic.  There are instances in it at present where it is difficult to define definitely &ldquo;facilities and equipment&rdquo; in relation to the hospitals.  It sets out that these shall be deemed to include provision for therapeutic or recreative benefits for patients.  It is very necessary to have some provision for a general library, because most important in the convalescence of a patient is his recreation&mdash;the books he reads.  Hitherto, books have been <Col N="1941" /> supplied in a very haphazard way. Their source has been public charity. People when they do not want magazines or when they become out of date send them to the hospitals.  In certain cases, such as tubercular cases, in which there is a long period in bed and in which a patient's mind is very receptive and when the class of patient is at a receptive age, there is no suitable literature.  In some hospitals, provision is made to give books of instruction only, but books of instruction, when recovering from an illness would bore anyone to death.</P>
      <P>What I wish to ensure is that the section will be definitely made to provide for a central distributing library, such as they have in Denmark, England and America.  I have a note here from a meeting held lately in Cambridge, in regard to hospital services, which says: &ldquo;The hospital library is a solace to the patient and an aid to nurses and physicians and an indispensable factor in preserving hospital morale.&rdquo;  It is possible, under two or three of the sections of this Bill, to extend portion of the money to the formation of a central distributing library, but I want to ensure that there will be no possibility of surcharge on any of the people responsible for the distribution of the funds through, for instance, the action of an over-officious accountant.  Sub-section (7) of the second last section sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A grant made by the Minister under this section for the benefit of any existing or proposed hospital or nursing organisation may be made for all or any of the following purposes, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the purchase of land or buildings, including any superior or outstanding estate or interest in land or buildings;</P>
      <P>(b) the construction of buildings;</P>
      <P>(c) the reconstruction, extension, alteration or improvement of buildings;</P>
      <P>(d) the purchase of hospital, nursing and other equipment;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I think that the Minister is in accord with the general purpose of that, he should make it definite that a <Col N="1942" /> hospitals' library can be instituted. After all, a hospital grant covers such a thing as a porter's uniform and it should be made clear that it could also be used for the purpose of endowing a central library&mdash;because some of the hospitals are small and cannot have a library equal to that of a richer hospital.  The simplest way out, if it is not possible to combine all the Dublin hospitals in one, is, at least, to have a central distributing centre for books which would be available for them all.  In England there are 200,000 volumes for the use of patients, and, in America, of course, there are many more.</P>
    <P>The general principle of the sweepstake is a very excellent one.  The only criticism I have to make is that the Government have done more damage to it in a short time than even loss of novelty of the sweepstake could be expected to do.  I am afraid that the sweepstake has been very greatly injured not by the fact that people are getting tired of such investment, but by the steps the British Parliament have been incited to take by the action of the Government here.  Some of these steps have already, without legislation, been put into practice.  For instance, the Press of England&mdash;Senator Comyn a moment ago interjected a remark about &ldquo;The Daily Express&rdquo;&mdash;I did not refer only to the &ldquo;Daily Express,&rdquo; though it is a very excellent and widely distributed paper, whose proprietor has not had to resort to Parliament to buttress his property by protective duties.  That newspaper has already withheld notices of the £100 prizes.  That is a writing on the wall, or off it, rather!  The Betting Com mission recommended that the newspapers should not give publicity, which is the breath of life to our sweepstakes. When that is withheld it will be a very serious blow to the sweeps, because you cannot expect the British public to subscribe to a sweepstake which cannot publish results.  The British public do not necessarily want any excuse of charity more than that which is provided by the hospitals to buy Irish sweep tickets.  Had these hospital sweeps been extended to the clearance of the slums in our city the <Col N="1943" /> charity would be greater, more called for, and more direct.  I do not suppose there are in Europe more uncomfortable or more insanitary conditions than we have here in the City of Dub lin.  It is a monstrous thing to think that this city should be served by so many hospitals with their overlapping laundries, X-ray departments, apothecaries' departments, and so on, when the cause of disease and the need for hospitals are unchecked.  We know very well the reasons why the hospitals cannot be merged.  There is one explanation which, if pushed to its logical conclusion, is that there has grown up a vested interest in disease. It comes to that and nothing else.</P>
    <P>I think the Bill should be extended and a section inserted so that the Minister would be empowered to spend money for the prevention of disease and for the alleviation of conditions conducive thereto.  I think that measures should be taken now to introduce such a section.  A sum of £5,000,000 has been provided to spend on hospitals in a country that has not a population of 3,000,000 people.  It would be far better for the Government to use their powers and say: &ldquo;We have spent enough on hospitals and we are now going to get rid of unhealthy houses.  We are going to give our citizens healthy homes and healthy schools and playgrounds for the children.&rdquo;  The first thing to do is to define what is a slum, and secondly to take a census of the people in the slums.  Steps will have to be taken to ensure that, when a slum area is cleared, it is not filled up again by people coming up from country towns, who, although healthy and strong when they arrive, will, because of the surroundings in which they find themselves, soon succumb to disease.  That very well managed and philanthropic institution&mdash;Guinness's &mdash;has had much experience of the physical condition of its employees. It found that well developed, strong young fellows when they came up from the country after a period of residence in unhealthy surroundings in the city quickly succumbed to <Col N="1944" /> disease.  It met that by good housing. That is a lesson that is fifty years old, but it has not been taken to heart by the Government.  We have our 18 or 19 hospitals in Dublin but we still have fifty thousand poor people living in sub-human surroundings. This country has already got from the sweeps £5,000,000.  I will support any Government that will take the whole of the sweep money, even if it ignores the hospitals in the future, and apply it instead to getting rid of the slums.</P>
    <P>Senators may not be aware that a large part of the city is under the high tide level of the River Liffey.  I cannot at the moment recall the details that were given in the engineers' report, but when the main drains were being put in it was discovered that a great part of the subsoil of the city is infiltrated by high tides.  The people living in these areas of the city are simply fodder for hospitals.  You cannot expect to have healthy children reared over such damp earth.  Healthy people come up from the country, but within a very short period, if they are unemployed, they merge into the slum population. Therefore, what we are getting is a population of patients.  Is there to be no end to this vicious circle?  The first thing to be done is to stem the tenement population.  That must be done by taking a census.  It is an appalling thing to permit people to go on living in kitchens and areas 14 feet under the ground.  When people leave these slum areas to live in the new houses at Fairview, Cabra, Bath Avenue, etc., and in the other centres where there are new houses, these old tenement houses should be knocked down or sealed up.  What is going on at present is that you are simply putting people through a process of health reduction in order to make hospitals indispensable in perpetuity.  I do not think that subscribers to the sweepstakes would lessen their subscriptions by one farthing if they knew that this Government had sufficient foresight to see that it is more necessary to have good houses than good hospitals.  Is it the Government's ambition for the Irish people that they become perpetual <Col N="1945" /> patients of hospitals supported by British sportsmen?  Has our race no better destiny than that?  I know it may seem a fanciful suggestion. But really are hospitals to be looked upon as Valhallas or paradises for our citizens?  If the houses of the country were well provided one hospital would be quite sufficient.  If those who are interested in hospitals were not well looked after, then one might say that one hospital might be too many!  After all, the great Empire of Austria had only one central hospital.  It was so thoroughly managed and well administered that people went from the ends of the earth to study there.  Generally there are more than 3,000 people in the Dublin hospitals, but students could not see them without extensive journeying and this prevents Dublin from being a great teaching centre to Europe as it is to its own students.</P>
    <P>This Bill is really strangling the intentions of the Government.  I know that, apart from the scandal that the Government itself benefits from the sweeps, otherwise its intentions are good, but this Bill will stultify its object if it is limited strictly to hospitals, as if it were never to be realised that the thing to do is to enlarge the scope of the measure so that the Minister will be able to deal with the slums which are the factories for hospital cases.  I have very few ambitions in life, but one is to see an end to the scandal of the Dublin slums.  We have money enough to build a new city for our people&mdash;no: they are to be given hospitals!  Reference has often been made to the fact that in this city we have 50,000 people living in one-roomed tenements.  Life in such conditions is going on at present and the hospitals are getting £5,000,000.  In Grafton St. between some of the drapery houses and jewellers' establishments there should be an exhibition window containing a slum room so that all might see the hidden horror of our city.  It is in such surroundings that many a citizen rears his five or six children. That is the kind of horror we have here.  In that kind of paralysis our people are losing the rights of human beings.  People are being so sapped in their energies and so beaten down that <Col N="1946" /> they accept discomfort and disgrace and do not realise that they have a right to the decencies of ordinary life, to a share of the £5,000,000.  The miracle is that people living under such conditions are as good as they are and that they have not degenerated long ago.  It is more important to get rid of the cause of hospitals than to keep them going.  The Bill proposes to meet some of the difficulties that I have in mind, but I think that the Government is not sufficiently alert towards making it clear for instance that the fund provides for books.  Books are more important than porters' uniforms. In the case of patients convalescing it is desirable that some interesting food should be provided for the mind and that steps should be taken to collect and to sort the kind of literature that is sent in to patients, and to exclude literature of the haphazard type that is not at all suitable for them.  Periodicals are circulated and within reach of children that are not suitable even for adults in a state of convalescence.  I think a section should be introduced in the Bill which will clearly and unequivocally make provision for the establishment of a central distributing library.  I propose to move such an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardBigger" hpid="Sir Edward Coey Bigger Sir Edward Coey Bigger">
      <NameTxt>Sir Edward Coey Bigger</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  Certain amendments to it will be proposed on the Committee Stage, and if these are accepted the Bill ought to still further improve our hospital system.  Notwithstanding all the money that has been given to the hospitals, very little has been done for the relief and cure of cancer.  During the past five or six years very great strides have been made in England, on the Continent, in America and other places in the treatment of cancer by radium and X-rays. In England a few years ago an appeal was made to raise funds to purchase radium.  The Government of the time offered to give a pound for every pound that was subscribed.  As a result something like £300,000 was raised. That was for the National Radium Committee.  A few years before that the British Empire Cancer Research Campaign raised about £300,000.  These two big organisations, with their large <Col N="1947" /> financial resources, have done a great deal in England for the establishment of radio-therapeutic centres.  Neither of these two bodies has any functions as far as the Irish Free State is concerned. It, therefore, devolves on us to devise means by which something similar may be done here.  Perhaps I should explain what I mean by a radio-therapeutic centre.  It is a hospital with special equipment in charge of experts who give advice and treatment in cases of cancer.  There is a great dread of cancer, although patients suffering from it in the early stages have no pain.  They conceal their condition from their friends and in this way very often the stage at which they could be benefited has passed.  It is in the early stages, when patients do not suffer pain, that their condition might be more easily improved and cured.  If such an institution were established here it would bring hope to thousands of persons who are suffering and would be the means of curing a large proportion of them.  There is nothing but despair at present.</P>
      <P>Up to the present practically the only treatment for cancer in the Free State is by surgical means, whereas in other countries, in England, Wales, Scotland, the Continent, America and Canada, there has been treatment by radium and X-rays, in addition to surgical treatment.  Many of the Continental centres have been started and continued by Government grants.  The Irish Free State is a long way behind all the progressive countries in the world in its treatment by radium, which has now practically taken the place of surgery in the treatment of cancer of the mouth, cancer of the tongue, cancer of the skin, and certain diseases of women.  Even in incurable cases radium treatment gives the patients great relief from their suffering, prolongs their lives and makes them more comfortable in other respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Seanad is not going to allow those suffering from this most painful and dreadful disease to be in a worse position than those afflicted with it in other countries, more <Col N="1948" /> especially as this Bill gives them the power to provide a fund to make the necessary provision.  This is a national question and there should be no delay. If this matter is referred to the new Hospital Commissioners, it will delay the matter possibly a year, and even then owing to the pressure by various interests they may be prevented from allocating adequate funds for this purpose. In the meantime there are nine persons suffering from cancer dying every day in the Free State and their places are being taken by nine new cases without hope of receiving the best advice and treatment.  It is estimated that there are 5,000 to 6,000 persons suffering from cancer in the Free State. This large army with their ever-increasing suffering are moving continually to the only goal where relief is possible, that is by death.  This is not a question of supplying funds to purchase radium, as there is more radium in the Free State at present than is being used, thanks to certain donors.  Senator Sir John Griffith has given £2,000 and other parties have also made contributions for the purchase of radium.  That is not what we want.  What is urgently required is to provide a properly equipped institution for giving advice and treatment and for providing facilities for training medical men in the use of radium and X-rays.  Radium is one of the most wonderful, most expensive, most dangerous, and most potent therapeutic substances known to medical science and, therefore, should only be used by those who have the necessary training and experience.  It requires great experience to avoid doing an injury to a patient and more knowledge and experience to treat a patient successfully.</P>
    <P>I might mention that one of the earliest, largest and best radium institutions is in Paris and was established by Government funds.  Belgium has four radium institutes, all established by Government funds, and it is organising another, which will provide facilities for radio-therapeutic treatment of both charitable and private patients, for teaching and for research. These will have 14 times as much radium as there is in the Free State, <Col N="1949" /> although Belgium has only about twice the population.  In Stockholm there is a thoroughly equipped institute established by Government funds, and patients are conveyed there from all parts of Sweden free by rail.  There are between 20 and 30 radium institutes in England, Wales and Scotland.  The one in Manchester &mdash;the Holt Radium Institute&mdash;has 14 medical men on the staff.  Half of these give their whole time to the institute.  I hope the Minister will accept an amendment to provide funds for the establishment of such an institution on the lines of those in England, Paris, Belgium and Stockholm. I should like also to suggest that funds should be made available for a pension fund for nurses and midwives. Nurses and midwives, particularly nurses, largely assist in running our hospitals.  They have a very severe training and they are very badly paid.  They have no possible means to provide for their old age when they are not fit to work.  I think it would be very proper to allocate a certain amount for this purpose and I hope that if amendments are brought forward for that purpose they will be accepted.</P>

      <P>My objection to proceeding now is not by reason of any opposition to the provisions embodied in the Bill.  I think some form of regulation, which I dislike so much in other matters, is necessary in the case of these hospitals and it should have come before now.  The individualistic element under the new conditions has got totally out of hand.  It has been necessary for some considerable time past, in view of this utterly unexpected windfall that there should be some check on the waste and demoralisation that is inevitably involved in these schemes.  I do not mean, by saying that I hold these views, that I cease to be a believer in the individualistic method but in view of the new conditions some check is obviously necessary.  There is only one other point I wish to make and that is in relation to the method by which the commission on the sale of tickets is calculated.  I objected before, and I object again, to the provisions in the old Act, and repeated here, by which the commissions given on the sale of books remain undisclosed.  The ordinary member of the public in buying a ticket or a book of tickets imagines that the only reward sellers get is two free tickets.  Those who have even an elementary knowledge of what goes on behind the scenes know that that is not a fact.  I think that those who participate in a sweepstake have a right to know what the odds are.  Their odds cannot be ascertained unless they have a complete knowledge of the commissions given or, failing that, some statement on the part of the auditors of the total number of tickets in the drum.  We know that that is unpopular and that the hospital people <Col N="1951" /> do not like it.  But I consider that in a lottery like this which is run under State auspices, if not directly under State direction; there is a responsibility to those who take part that they should know the odds with which they are faced.  That can only be done if the commissions are disclosed or the number of tickets published.  I propose at a later stage to put down an amendment with the object of securing that information.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane is so very often in a minority of one in this House that I am not going to allow this opportunity to pass of assuring him that he is not in a minority of one on this occasion, that there are at least two in the House of the same opinion.  The Bill in general I think has to be discussed in two parts.  The part which deals with the utilisation of the funds that go into the possession of the Hospitals' Committee is, I think, deserving of all support.  I think it is acknowledged by everybody that there should be some proper co-ordination of the hospital services of the country.  On the question of the raising of the funds I am of the opinion I had when the original Bill was introduced. I said it was the antithesis of the doctrine which preceded the establishment of the Free State.  It is the antithesis of the doctrine of Sinn Fein, of self-reliance.  It is asking the people of other countries to pay the cost of the social services which the system of civilisation under which we are living imposes on the people concerned.  I think that is a bad essential principle. However, it is with us.  I want to support Senator Sir John Keane's point in regard to the publicity that is needed.  This Bill will repeat for the public information and edification, the fiction I was going to say, that the whole of the scheme is State governed and controlled.  I am not making the slightest suggestion that the conduct of the hospitals sweepstake is at all unworthy in any respect so far as those who accept the principle of sweepstakes is concerned.  But the Bill imposes upon the promoters of a sweepstake the obligation to present a scheme to the Minister.  It places upon <Col N="1952" /> the Minister the responsibility of approving of that scheme and the clauses which deal with these two matters suggest to anybody reading them that this is a matter wholly under the control of the Minister.  That being so, I suggest that the scheme sanctioned by the Minister ought to be made public, in the first instance, and after that, that the results of the sale of tickets ought to be made public.</P>
      <P>We are assured that there is an audit of accounts.  Of course, there is an audit of accounts, but of what accounts?  Of the accounts concerning the expenditure of the money that comes into the possession of the Hospitals Committee.  Section 6 (e) indicates that the scheme must contain the prices intended to be charged for tickets in the proposed sweepstake. That means that the public are to be informed that the price&mdash;if the Minister approves&mdash;shall be, say, 10/-. Surely, that is an indication to the purchaser of the ticket that that 10/- is to be accounted for.  It is not accounted for in the audited statement sent out to members of the Oireachtas. Because that clause is in the Bill, the audit of that 10/-, or multiple of 10/-, should be made known to those concerned. If it is not to be made known, then that clause ought not to be in the Bill.  I made this criticism before.  I have stated it in this way now to show that Senator Sir John Keane is not alone in his criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of those who spoke and voted against the Sweepstake Bill when first introduced, holding, as Senator Johnson holds, that if we could not improve the lot of the sick poor by voluntary effort, the next best method would be to do it by way of taxation.  Having said that and holding that view, I wish to say that, in my opinion, the sweepstakes are being conducted in a manner absolutely beyond any valid criticism. They have been conducted in a perfectly straight way.  Everybody gets a chance.  We all know, notwithstanding what Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Johnson have said, that the vast preponderance of people who take a ticket go in for a flutter or a gamble on the off-chance of getting rich overnight. <Col N="1953" /> If they do not get rich, they say: &ldquo;Better luck next time,&rdquo; and they go on again.  We all know what human nature is.</P>
      <P>I think that the Bill is an admirable measure and my only regret is that nobody anticipated the extraordinary success these sweepstakes would be so that arrangements could be made, as in this Bill, for devoting portion of the moneys to co-ordination, research and such things as the Parliamentary Secretary outlined.  Indeed, I think that the only advantage we would have got from adjourning to-night would be the opportunity of reading in full the very admirable statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary in explaining the Bill.  I wish to join with Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger in the plea he made with regard to a cancer hospital.  I have made inquiries as to the institute of this type in Manchester, and I am told that it is doing extraordinary work in connection with the cure of cancer, so far as one can apply the term &ldquo;cure,&rdquo; because it is not regarded as a cure if there is a recurrence within five years.  Even in cases where a cure is impossible, it robs this frightful disease of a great many of its terrors.  I think there is also something to be said for the plea that a certain portion of the fund should, if possible, be devoted to the provision of pensions for nurses who are superannuated or lose their health in what must be a very exacting calling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one other remark to make about a matter which causes me some misgiving.  I should have no misgiving of course, in the case of the present Minister for Local Government or his Parliamentary Secretary but I can imagine a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary such as Mr. Hugo Flinn or Mr. Hogan of the late Administration. We know that modesty is not their predominant passion and when we are doing away with that limitation of a third of the fund for hospitals under the Department of Local Government and Public Health, I fear lest, by any mischance, the Minister or his Parlimentary Secretary be transferred to another Department and their successors be of the nature and quality I have mentioned.  The Minister might, I think, in that regard, reconsider the <Col N="1954" /> putting of some limit on the amount to be taken by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Otherwise, I think this measure is wholly admirable and I am only sorry it was not introduced much earlier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>When the original Bill was introduced I, like Senator Dowdall, opposed it most strenuously. One of my reasons for opposing it was that we were giving the credit of the State to an organisation that might be mismanaged.  This Bill has received general support in the Seanad.  The main reason, I think, is that the organisation in regard to which we had misgivings has proved itself most efficient.  The sweepstake has been conducted in a way which has commanded the admiration of the world and it undoubtedly deserves the phenomenal measure of success that has attended it.  A great many wise suggestions have been made in the course of this debate by Senators, beginning with Senator Gogarty, who, by the force of his genius, was able to introduce a number of irrelevancies. He recommended one wise thing to the Minister&mdash;that suitable books should be provided for patients.  After all, the object of all treatment of disease is the benefit of the patient.  My friend Senator Johnson reminds me that the hospitals are to get a revenue outside the proceeds of the sweepstake.  I do not know whether their revenue is likely to increase as a result of the knowledge of the people that the sweepstakes have been so productive but I do think that the provision of books, if the suggestion commends itself to the Minister, would be desirable. Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger has recommended that a central cancer hospital should be established and thoroughly equipped.  He has given reasons for that suggestion and I take the liberty of reinforcing, so far as I can, the arguments put forward by Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson is not alone in his support of the suggestion put forward by Senator Sir John Keane.  I think that the credit of the State is involved in this Hospitals' Sweepstakes scheme. The State does not take direct responsibility, but still it is known all over <Col N="1955" /> the world that this sweepstake is conducted under the authority of an Act of Parliament and under the supervision of the State.  It seems to me that an account ought to be given of the commission which is paid in respect of the sale of these tickets, or in the alternative&mdash;a worse alternative, I think&mdash;that the total number of tickets that go into the drum ought to be given.  My sole reason for saying that is that the credit of the Government is involved in this matter.  We have legalised and legislated for these sweepstakes and we take portion of the money.  There may be reasons why Senator Sir John Keane's recommendation cannot be complied with, but they would need to be very strong reasons to void the force of the statement which he has made.  The object is not to provide bricks and mortar, not to build hospitals, not to provide for the persons who run hospitals. The real object is the care of the patient.</P>
    <P>The persons concerned with the care of the patient ought to be considered to an even greater extent than they are in this measure.  Senator Dowdall has referred to the nurses. They give the best years of their lives to the care of patients.  They are badly paid.  They can make little provision for old age.  Nurses find in their profession that advancing years tell more heavily against them than they do upon people engaged in other walks of life.  I think that provision for nurses could very well come within the scope of this measure and that the seven objects set out in the Bill&mdash;provision of land, construction of buildings, extension of buildings, purchase of equipment, endowment of hospitals, payment of maintenance charges and discharge of debts&mdash;should be extended to include provision for nurses on whose attention a good deal of the comfort of the patient depends. Seeing that the Seanad is almost unanimously in favour of such a provision, I recommend it to the consideration of the Parliamentary Secretary, if it can be brought within the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to deal with a few <Col N="1956" /> points only.  I shall deal with them very briefly.  Most of the points raised could be more appropriately dealt with on Committee Stage.  Senator Gogarty raised the question of the provision of library facilities in the institutions covered by the Bill.  As I understand the Bill, Section 24 (7) (d), which refers to the purchase of hospital, nursing and other equipment, would cover the provision of library facilities.  I think that the Senator had in mind something more elaborate than the provision in a hospital of a room with books that would be called a library. He had in mind, I think, something like a central institution.  I am quite impressed, as any medical man must be and as most intelligent laymen would be, with the curative and therapeutic value of library facilities in hospitals.  I think it would be a great boon for these patients to have proper library facilities&mdash;the best we can provide.  We will have the matter looked into, but it would probably necessitate some slight amendment to provide a central library such as Senator Comyn and Senator Dowdall have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need not follow Senator Gogarty. There are some places into which I should not like to follow him.  It is open to a good deal of argument in an interesting debate whether better results would not be got if this money were applied to other purposes, such as removing the causes of illness.  That question is not before us now. The Government has given very generous financial assistance, particularly towards a solution of the housing and slum problems.  I think the housing problem is well on the way to solution if local authorities make use of the generous financial facilities placed at their disposal.  Senator Sir Edward Bigger raised an important question regarding the provision of a special radium institute.  When Senators have a little more time to look into the terms of the Bill they will find that most of these things are possible under it.  The Minister could make an allocation to endow an institution, or to set up a new institution, to be called a Radiological Institute, <Col N="1957" /> for the prevention, treatment and cure of human diseases.  If it does not come under the heading of &ldquo;cure,&rdquo; it could come under the heading of &ldquo;prevention&rdquo; or, at least, of &ldquo;treatment.&rdquo; That could be provided within the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As to pensions for nurses and midwives a very difficult problem arises as to the class of nurses that Senators have in mind.  Nurses in the employment of local bodies may be inadequately paid.  Many of them are inadequately paid but, if they are, it is the fault of the local authorities, and salaries should be increased, if they have not a living wage.  Take the case of midwives who are paid salaries by local authorities. The suggestion, apparently, is that we should allocate money to increase the pensions.  At present they can retire after a certain number of years' service with two-thirds of their salaries as pension.  If the hospitals provided an additional sum to be added to that you would have reached the position where it would pay midwives to retire, taking two-thirds of their salaries, and whatever they got from another fund, than to remain in the service.  These are some of the difficulties.  I think the solution of them is to pay these people reasonable and adequate salaries.  They have ordinary pension rights.  In the case of private nurses they have an earning capacity and are paid reasonably well.  If a private nurse is employed, and I hope that Senators never needed to employ nurses, the standard amount would be paid.  I do not want to be personal but I doubt if Senators who made the plea for private nurses would themselves pay more than the ordinary standard fees that private nurses charge. There are many people in public employment at the present time who are paid considerably less than private nurses are paid for their services.  If it is a matter of relieving destitution I say in all sincerity that there are many sections of the community in greater need of relief.  In the definition a nursing organisation to which the Minister can make an allocation it is set out</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1958" /> ... means an institution or organisation in Saorstát Eireann which has for its sole or principal object the nursing of, and providing of nurses for, poor persons suffering from physical diseases, ....</P>
    <P>If the main purpose of a nursing organisation is looking after the poor we come to their rescue out of the Hospitals Sweep Fund.  I think our primary concern ought to be for nurses devoted to the nursing of the poor.  Let me put another aspect of this matter.  Supposing we decide that we should pension all nurses I do not know where that is going to lead to.  I think it would immediately lead up to doctors.  How many poor doctors are there?  There are plenty of them.  There may be poor Senators, and there may be poor doctors in the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there are wards-maids in hospitals who devote their lives to the nursing of the sick.  Are we to pension them also?  I have a good deal of sympathy with a badly-paid nurse, but I do not think the solution is by making funds available from the sweepstakes.  If people are not satisfied with the salaries that public authorities are paying nurses, they should bring pressure to bear on the public authorities to increase the salaries.</P>

      <P>By giving a somewhat detailed explanation of the points that were raised I hoped to be able to satisfy the House that many amendments are unnecessary and, in the light of the facts, that many others might not be moved, thus saving the time of the House at a future stage.  As Senator Sir John Keane is not present now I do not think I need deal with the points he made.  Senator Dowdall has some anxiety about the one-third and <Col N="1959" /> two-third proportions.  That difficulty is already dealt with in the Bill.  He need not have any anxiety in that respect.  Senators should bear in mind that were it not for the introduction of this Bill the sweepstakes would, in the ordinary course, come to an end next year, and the hospitals, apparently, would have to be satisfied with the money that has accrued.  We are extending definitely the period for the operation of sweepstakes in the hope&mdash;and a very optimistic hope it is  that sufficient money will accrue to give our hospital problem if we get time to work it out.  The difficulty about the one-third and two-third proportions is this, that we have, through our technical advisers in the Local Government Department, many schemes ready for operation, that have had the necessary detailed <Col N="1960" /> examination, but we cannot operate them, and the local authorities cannot proceed, until we are able to say how much money we will be able to give them.  We could release these schemes to-morrow if we could lay our hands on a little more money.  I admit that, for the present, we will encroach beyond the one-third previously allocated to the Minister.  The problem of the local authorities is one that will be solved in the near future.  When it is solved, not only the two-thirds, but the entire fund will be available.  We have no anxiety whatever that voluntary hospitals will suffer.</P>
