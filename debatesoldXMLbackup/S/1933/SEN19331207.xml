    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Prisons Bill, 1933, be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This Bill has its origin in certain difficulties that have been experienced with regard to the closing of certain prisons in the country.  That is with regard to the interpretation of Sections 7, 30 and 31 of the Prisons Act, 1877.  The first difficulty that arose was with regard to the closing of Tralee Prison.  That prison was closed in 1920.  It was afterwards used in 1925 as a military barracks and subsequently handed over to the local authority.  Certain proceedings were brought and it was held that the Closing Order of 1920 was ineffective and invalid because no special reasons were stated, as set out in Section 30 of the Prisons Act of 1877.</P>
      <P>A further difficulty subsequently arose with regard to the Kilkenny Prison.  That prison was closed and part of it was handed over to the local authority and part of it&mdash;that is the governor's house&mdash;was rented by the State to the superintendent there. Proceedings were brought in the High Court by the county council and it was held that the Order was invalid in so far as you could not close part of a prison without closing the whole lot, and that you could not hand over part of it to the local authority without handing over the whole lot.</P>
      <P>There are certain other difficulties with which we are faced and we want to regularise them.  These difficulties existed for years with regard to the Dundalk and Roscommon Prisons.  That is the object of this Bill.  Section 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill are intended to replace Sections 30 and 31 of the Prisons Act, 1877.  Section 6 is intended to cover the case of the Tralee Prison and Section 7 that of Dundalk.</P>

      <P>This Bill is not necessitated by any traffic in drugs in this country but in 1931 this country was a party to the Convention at Geneva and, as Senators will be aware, in other countries this illicit drug business is a very serious menace.  The Saorstát is a party to that Convention at Geneva, and it is to implement that Convention that this Bill is now brought before the House.  It is a technical Bill.  Medical men may have some amendments to suggest.  I have no objection to accepting them if they do not cut across the main purpose of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister one or two questions.  Section 5 of the Bill reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any officer of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may detain and examine and if necessary open for that purpose</P>
      <P>(a) any postal packet sent from a place outside Saorstát Eireann and containing or suspected by him of containing any article the importation of which is prohibited or restricted by this Act, or</P>
      <P>(b) any postal packet addressed to a place outside Saorstát Eireann and containing or suspected by him of containing any article the exportation of which is prohibited or restricted by this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Any officer&rdquo; seems wide and &ldquo;any postal packet&rdquo; also seems very wide. I wonder if the Minister could in any way restrict it by specifying the officer who would be authorised to do this. Giving to &ldquo;any postal&rdquo; officer delivering letters who suspects there may be something in these letters prohibited by this Bill, the right to detain the letter and open it seems a bit wide. <Col N="1951" /> That is one point.  Another part of the Bill&mdash;Section 13&mdash;reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It shall not be lawful for any person to import into Saorstát Eireann any substance to which this Part of this Act applies.</P>
    <P>The same applies not only to the importing but to the exporting.  The position now is that every doctor on either side of the Border is importing or exporting drugs every day in the week.  He must take these dangerous drugs across the Border no matter on which side of the Border his practice is.  I suggest to the Minister that possibly by some restriction or arrangement he might exclude a medical man from being interfered with in any way in the ordinary course of his practice.  Giving every doctor who may be practising on either side of the Border the right of getting a permit might be wrong, but there may be some other way of dealing with the matter.  I am only suggesting it to the Minister.  I do not propose to oppose the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides that &ldquo;any member of the Gárda Síochána or any inspector shall be entitled to enter the premises of any person,&rdquo; etc.  The right of entry is one that is pretty well safeguarded in the Public Health Acts. I wonder if any restriction could be introduced into this section so as to make it read that &ldquo;any authorised person&rdquo; and so on.  These are the only points that occur to me.  Otherwise, the Bill is, I think, a very desirable one.  It is of international importance, and is only putting this country in line with other countries.</P>

      <P>I think we will be able to meet the Senator with regard to Section 5.  We can have the section deleted and an amendment inserted that will meet the Senator's views. With regard to Section 31, and the other section to which the Senator referred in connection with the Border difficulty, there is no element being introduced into this Bill that does not appertain to other legislation.  I do not think the Senator need have any fears about the matter he referred to.  In practice there will be a permit or some <Col N="1952" /> arrangements will be made to try and meet these difficulties.  I will look into the matter and see what can be done.</P>

      <P>These rules are merely formal.  They are made in accordance with the provisions of Section 66 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  They are supplementary to the rules made under the Principal Act.  They are concerned with forms that have to be adopted by interested parties and by practitioners.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill does not, I think, lend itself to the type of discussion that ordinarily takes place on the Second Reading of a measure.  It is a Bill to amend and codify the existing law relating to workmen's compensation.  It does not introduce any new principle.  The principle of <Col N="1953" /> the measure, that any workman injured in the course of his employment is entitled to get compensation for that injury, or his dependants are entitled to get compensation in the case of death, from his employer, has been enshrined in legislation here for almost half a century, and is in fact enshrined in the legislation of all countries. This Bill is designed to give effect to certain changes in the machinery for the implementation of that principle, based either upon the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee which met and reported on the matter in 1926, or upon the experience which has since been derived from the operation of similar legislation in other countries.  We do not stick entirely throughout the Bill to the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee.  They were departed from in a few not unimportant particulars, but, in the main, the Bill is their product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will, perhaps, best serve the purpose of the Seanad if, at this stage, I merely give a brief indication of the changes in the existing law which it is proposed to effect by this measure. Taking these in the order in which they appear in the Bill, the first change made is in the definition of &ldquo;workman.&rdquo;  At the present time the existing Act applies only to persons engaged by manual labour whose remuneration does not exceed £250 a year.  That limit is being increased to £350, and certain additional classes of casual workers are being brought within its scope, more particularly those who are employed in connection with games or recreation through a club and those employed in or about the residence of an employer.  Both these two classes were heretofore excluded from the scope of the Workmen's Compensation Act.  The Bill also affects certain other classes such as share fishermen and crews on certain ships.  The term &ldquo;accident&rdquo; is given an extended meaning so as to cover cases where, for instance, a workman acted without his employer's orders or contrary to statutory regulations. Senators who are familiar with the matter are aware that in the past injustice was occasionally done by the <Col N="1954" /> limitations upon the term &ldquo;accident&rdquo; which appeared in the original measure and which are now being removed, consequent on the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee. The changes that we are making in this measure are in conformity with those that have since been made in other countries.</P>
    <P>The amount of compensation payable in fatal cases is being increased from a maximum of £300 to £600.  The original limit of £300 was fixed in the year 1906, and although in 1917 increases in the amount payable in cases of total or partial incapacity were made, no change was made in the amount payable in fatal cases, which is still subject to the maximum of £300 as it was in the year 1906.  The Inter-Departmental Committee recommended that the amount should be increased to £600.  They made various recommendations as to the allocation of that sum between the different classes of dependants.</P>
    <P>We have not followed completely the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee which did not prove to be quite suitable in all respects, but the provision in the Bill does stick fairly closely to what they recommended.  The maximum sum of £600 is divided into two lump sums; one called an adults' lump sum, and the other, a children's lump sum.  If there are no dependants at all, the claimant merely gets the amount required to cover medical expenses and burial.  Under the existing law the maximum payable is £10.  That is being increased under this Bill to £15. Where there are adult dependants, an adults' lump sum is also payable, and where there are children dependants, a children's lump sum is also payable. The adults' lump sum is a minimum of £200 and a maximum of £300. Subject to these limits, it is 156 times the average weekly earning of the deceased worker for three years.  It will be distributed among the adult dependants of the deceased in such manner as the court may determine.  The amount of the children's lump sum will depend upon the number of children and the ages of the children.  It will not, in any case, <Col N="1955" /> be less than £200.  In the Schedule of the Bill the manner of calculating it is set out.  The Schedule provides that the employer shall pay, in respect of each child under 15 years of age, a certain sum, varying with the number of children, for every month that each child has to live until it attains the age of 15 years.  Any compensation paid to the workman, in the interval between the injury and the date of his death, will be deducted from the compensation paid to his dependants after his death subject, of course, to the minimum payment in each case. Where the adults' lump sum and the children's lump sum together exceed £600, the Bill provides for a pro rata reduction of each sum so that in no case can the maximum payment exceed £600.  Compensation awardable to persons partially dependent upon the earnings of the deceased workman will be proportionate to the compensation payable as if they had been wholly dependent, and that will be determined by the court.</P>
    <P>Partial dependency, as now defined in the sub-section of the Bill, much to my surprise, caused considerable controversy in the Dáil.  Under the existing law the position is somewhat anomalous.  In the original Workmen's Compensation Act a phrase was used designed to secure that dependency would be interpreted as being dependent on the deceased for the necessaries of life.  At first the term in the Act was interpreted in that manner by the British courts.  In 1900 a case was heard in the House of Lords in which the judgment was given by the late Lord Halsbury who gave to the phrase &ldquo;dependency&rdquo; an entirely different significance.  That particular judgment has been frequently the subject of criticism.  It was based on a statement that no adequate definition of dependency had been produced, or was possible, and on that account the judgment stated that compensation should be payable in respect of the pecuniary loss suffered by persons on the death of the workman.  While that was the law in Great Britain, account was not taken as to the extent to which a person was dependent for support <Col N="1956" /> on the deceased worker, but only of the actual pecuniary loss he suffered by his death.  I said that that judgment was based upon a statement that no adequate definition of dependency was possible.  That statement is incorrect, in view of the fact that there is in this Bill a definition of dependency which is admitted by everybody to work very satisfactorily. In fact, the satisfactory nature of the definition has been frequently the subject of comment in British judicial decisions.  The change was made in Great Britain in 1923 when, following upon the report of the Departmental Committee, a Bill to amend the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1906, was introduced into the British Parliament. The phrase originated in the State of Massachusetts and was copied from there into the British statute.</P>
    <P>The Inter-Departmental Committee that met in 1925 was representative of all different opinions, and recommended that the same phrase should be introduced here, so that the law, in that respect, should be brought into conformity with the law in Great Britain. In 1929 when a private Deputy introduced a Bill into the Dáil, and when that Bill went to a select committee, an amendment was proposed on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, which introduced the definition, which is now introduced into this Bill.  That was carried unanimously and with the support of all Deputies present.  It was, therefore, with some surprise that I found when this Bill came before the Dáil that the suitability of that definition was criticised from different parts of the House.</P>
    <P>The criticism, in so far as directed to the merits of the measure, was based upon a misunderstanding, first as to the actual significance of the term used, and secondly the manner in which it had been interpreted in the British courts where it has now been the subject of legal interpretation and decision for over ten years.  In every case in Great Britain in which that particular section of the British Act was involved the interpretation put upon it was one favourable to the <Col N="1957" /> workmen.  The significance attached to the working of the section was that which was designed to attach to it in order to secure that compensation would not be paid merely on the ground of providing for the necessaries of life.  Compensation has been paid in Great Britain in consequence of the decisions under that section on the basis which provides the necessaries of life corresponding to those enjoyed by the deceased workman's dependants before his death.  In only one case was that particular definition held to be a limiting definition, and that was in respect of payments made by the head of a family in respect to insurance upon his life, which payments were held not to be in any sense a necessary of life, and consequently if one of the family was killed in an industrial accident, although that member of the family was contributing to the family fund, no compensation was payable in respect to the amount that the family expended upon insurance.  Though this may have been a correct interpretation of the statute, having been made, it became clear that the phrase should be amended.  If the head of a family provides a weekly or monthly or quarterly premium in order to ensure that upon his death a certain sum will be payable to his dependants, and thus to limit the possibility of their being involved in hardship, and if the continuance of that insurance was only possible because of the contribution received by the head of the family from the working members of the family, then if one of those working members is killed in an industrial accident such payment should be made to come in under this Act.</P>
    <P>On that account I indicated in the Dáil that I would have prepared, with a view to insertion here, an amendment that would bring within the scope of the sub-section insurance payments of that kind.  Whether it will be possible to get a satisfactory amendment, I am not able to say.  I do not feel that I am under any obligation to produce such an amendment because, having made the offer, the amendment that had been moved was not withdrawn, but was made the subject of a division and, therefore, my obligation to <Col N="1958" /> produce an amendment here obviously fell.  However, I am anxious that the Bill should be made as satisfactory as possible and, if a suitable amendment on the lines I suggested can be produced, I trust it will be considered here on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>In non-fatal cases the position of the law has been that since 1926 the workman who was totally incapacitated was entitled to get 50 per cent. of his pay, subject to a maximum payment of £1.  There were certain other provisions in respect of persons earning less than £1 or less than ten shillings but, for the purpose of noting the changes proposed to be made, we can confine ourselves to the general run of cases.  That continued from 1906 to 1917 when, in consequence of the rapid increase in prices which had taken place in that year and the preceding year, a temporary Act was introduced in the British Parliament to permit of increases in the amount of compensation in non-fatal cases to the extent of 75 per cent.  After that Act was passed, therefore, the payments of workmen's compensation in non-fatal cases were calculated on the basis of 50 per cent. on the pre-accident earnings increased by 75 per cent.  That raised the maximum to 35/-.  That temporary Act, known as the War Addition Act, which was designed, I think, to have a very limited life, was continued in 1919 and up to the date on which the Free State was established.  It continued to be the law in Great Britain as well as in this country.  In Great Britain, however, the law was changed in 1923 when the temporary Act was repealed and the original Act amended by increasing the maximum amount of compensation payable from £1 to 30/-.</P>
    <P>Since 1923, therefore, the position in Great Britain has been that a workman totally incapacitated has been entitled to get compensation on a 50 per cent. basis of calculation subject to a limitation of 30/-.  Here, however, the temporary Act was continued from year to year under the Expiring Laws Bill and is still in force.  It is only now that we are effecting the changes in the law which would correspond to <Col N="1959" /> the changes effected in Great Britain in 1923.  We are proposing to insert a maximum payment similar to the British maximum of 30/- but, instead of calculating the amount of compensation on the basis of 50 per cent. of the pre-accident earnings, we propose to do it on the basis of 75 per cent. of the pre-accident earnings.  In certain cases, of course, the compensation will be 80 per cent. where the pre-accident earnings do not exceed £1; but in all other cases 75 per cent.  It will be clear, therefore, that the amount of compensation in the vast majority of cases will be in future in the country substantially higher than in Great Britain.  In the case of workers earning 60/- a week and upwards before the accident the compensation here will be the same as in Great Britain. In all other cases it will be higher except in one case where the two curves meet and where the worker was earning 25/- a week before the accident, in which case the compensation here is the same as in Great Britain.  The worker who is earning £2 15s. 0d. per week&mdash;and I take it that of all the workers who are at present employed in the Saorstát, the vast majority of them would be at £2 15s. 0d. a week or below that figure&mdash;will, in the case of an accident involving total incapacity, get 30/-.  In Great Britain he would get 27/6.  At 50/- he is still on the maximum here, but only gets 25/- in Great Britain.  If he were earning 40/- a week before the accident he would still get the maximum here of 30/- whereas in Great Britain he would get 22/6 and so on down the scale. The practice in other countries appears to be in all cases to pay compensation subject to a maximum at the rate of 66? of the pre-accident earnings.  It varies from country to country.  The 50 per cent. prevailing in Great Britain is low.  It is a lower percentage payment than appears to be the practice in other countries. There is, however, no country, except one, paying more than 70 per cent. In future we will be paying 75 per cent.  In Spain 100 per cent. of the <Col N="1960" /> pre-accident earnings is paid, but not in the form of a continuing payment as is proposed in this Bill.  It is paid in the form of a lump sum for two years only, so that there is no comparison between the two countries. In some of these countries they have sliding scales.  Sixty-six two-third per cent. of the pre-accident earnings is paid up to a certain proportion of the earnings and, over and above that, 22 2-9ths or some other percentage is paid; but in any case where I have been able to make a comparison between the law in other countries and the law proposed to be established here, the law here appears to be much more definitely in favour of the workman than elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In the case of partial incapacity the amount of the compensation is calculated on the basis of the difference between the post-accident and pre-accident earnings.  The same percentages operate.  Where that difference is less than £1, an 80 per cent. payment is made.  Where the difference is more than £1, 75 per cent. is paid.  Under the existing law, if the incapacity lasts less than seven days, no compensation is payable.  That period has been reduced to four days under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for the making of conventions with other States providing for reciprocity in the matter of payments, and the recovery of compensation. Another change is that we abandon the principle of arbitration, and it is provided that the Circuit Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all claims for compensation arising out of the Act, with an appeal on questions of law from any decision of the Circuit Court to the Supreme Court, but subject to such appeal the decision of the Circuit Court shall be final and conclusive.  Up to the present there was an alternative to the Circuit Court of an Arbitration Tribunal but, in fact, that alternative has not been availed of in this country, and it is not necessary to continue it.  The Bill provides for the registration in a register to be kept by the county registrar of the actual agreement in the payment <Col N="1961" /> of compensation, and not the memorandum of agreement.  It also provides that if the registrar, for any reason that occurs to him, thinks it desirable, he can refer the agreement for consideration to the Circuit Court judge before registering.  The idea of that provision is to protect the workman against being tricked into the making of an agreement detrimental to his interests.</P>
    <P>The six or seven industrial diseases scheduled in the Act are also scheduled in the Bill.  There is, of course, power to add by order from time to time other diseases or other processes, but as to the 24 diseases which are covered by existing orders the industrial processes through which they arise have not yet been undertaken in this country.</P>
    <P>These are the principal changes.  I think a discussion on them might be more conveniently left to the Committee Stage, when each section can be taken separately, because it is really a matter of discussing the sections one by one, rather than raising particular points in the course of a debate such as should take place at this stage.  If any particular points relating to separate sections are raised, I feel disposed to leave anything I have to say on them until the Committee Stage, when they can be given more effective consideration, and a more lucid explanation of the various considerations which enter into the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get some information about Section 5, as I intend to try and have that section amended.  It has been the practice of agriculturists and others to employ people on the contract system.  I referred to this matter on a previous Bill but I could not get a satisfactory explanation.  What is the position of a farmer who takes on a man by contract to cut thistles, to thin turnips, to cut weeds or to perform such work? Under previous Acts it was not clearly stated whether such a man would be entitled to compensation.  The matter has never been definitely defined.  It should be defined in some way under <Col N="1962" /> this Bill.  Several cases have arisen where the insurance companies denied liability and persons who met with accidents were left without any compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very liberal measure, and I think the Minister is to be complimented on the way on which it seems to take note of every decision which has been given under the Workmen's Compensation Acts since their inception.  I believe this Bill will work. I do not intend to criticise it in any way, but I think&mdash;good though it is&mdash; it is capable of some amendment. Although it is perfectly right of the Minister to say that no useful discussion can really take place on the Second Reading, that any such discussion should be one conversant with each particular section, there are two or three matters which I should like to bring to the notice of the House now.  The first one relates to casual labour.  The Minister is providing that casual labourers shall be entitled to compensation.  That is nothing more than simple justice.  Then the difficulty arises, and it has been very strongly argued in the other House, that the effect of giving the right of compensation to the casual labourer will be to deprive him of employment which he otherwise might receive.  It was stated that no man employing a casual labourer will wish to incur the risk of becoming liable, in the case of death, for a very large sum of money, or in the case of an accident to a weekly contribution, which might last during the lifetime of the labourer; and that consequently casual labour will be deprived of employment which might otherwise be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some substance in that contention, and because of the substance there is in it, I suggest to the Minister, as he has grappled courageously with this question of the casual labourer, that he should go further and finish his work and, as I consider, do it properly.  I have been considering whether it would be possible for the Minister to complete the job now that he has undertaken it.  So far as I know these Workmen's Compensation Acts, Ministers in every country <Col N="1963" /> have been always afraid to tackle the problem of casual labour.  Our Minister on the present occasion has tackled it by providing that the casual labourer shall get compensation.  I do not think he has met the case which was put forward against that namely, that the result of this legislation will be to deprive the casual labourer of the employment which he would otherwise have got.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think that the Minister ought to go further, and the way he can do it, I think&mdash;and I say it with great deference and with some doubt &mdash;is by a scheme of compulsory insurance, day-to-day insurance, or week-to-week insurance.  That is, that a casual labourer should have a card, and that his employer on the morning he commences work, or at the beginning of a week, in case he intends to employ a labourer for a week, should stamp the card with a penny stamp or a three halfpenny stamp.  That is all that would be necessary.  A three halfpenny stamp would cover the risk.  The casual labourer should have a card and the man who employs him should see that it was stamped, and that the stamp was defaced before he began to work.  There may be a difficulty about seeing that the stamp was defaced at the proper time so as to avoid fraud.  That might be a difficulty but it can be resolved by a little code in one or two sections in this Bill, which would then make the Bill perfect.  Difficulties like that in my opinion should not appal us at all. It will be remembered that when the Sweepstakes Act was being discussed a question arose about the tickets in order to prevent the possibility of fraud.  Senators in the course of the discussion devised a scheme which was successful.  If Senators put their minds to this question a perfect scheme of daily or weekly compulsory insurance can be devised.  I have consulted some people who have spent their lives upholding the rights of working men and they are of opinion that such a scheme can be carried out.  Someone may say: &ldquo;Oh, you are going in for a scheme of State insurance through the Post Office.&rdquo;<Col N="1964" /> I am not afraid of a scheme of State insurance of casual workmen, provided a contribution is made by the men who employ them.  We should not be turned aside by shibboleths or by fear of names or of words.</P>
    <P>The casual labourer, just like the shorn lamb, is entitled to the special considerations of the State, and the least the State can do is to see that when that man is injured, he gets compensation, and that in getting compensation, he is not indirectly deprived of the chance of getting work.  That is a problem to which the Minister will, I am sure, direct his attention with a view to seeing if it can be carried out. If it is carried out, I think that this measure will be the most liberal and the most complete measure of workmen's compensation that has appeared on the statute book of any of the countries with which I am acquainted, and I have rather wide acquaintance with matters of this kind.  So much for that question of the casual man.</P>
    <P>There is the other question which arises on Section 43 of this Bill. Section 43 is, in many ways, a very necessary section, and more necessary in other countries than in this country. It provides that when compensation is given to a workman by a judge, he is to get the whole compensation into his own hands, and cannot be defrauded. Unfortunately there were, some time ago, a few cases in which some solicitors took proceedings on behalf of workmen, and they settled the cases on the basis of a big sum for themselves and a small sum for the workmen. That should be stopped.  It is not a thing that is very common in this country.  The solicitors who are employed by workmen in this city never, as I am informed, take anything except their taxed costs.  The solicitors in big business and the solicitors to whom the workmen ought to go, are most honest and honourable men, but there was in England, and there may have been in other countries, a great danger that an injured workman would be exploited.  This section, however, goes too far and it goes too far for the reason that when a workman is injured, he does need the services of a solicitor, but he also needs contributions <Col N="1965" /> from friends.  He needs help from friends, and he needs an advance of money, and if the advance of money is made by an individual, whether he be a solicitor or not, or by an organisation of workmen or by some society, pending the hearing of his case, that advance ought to be repaid and the judge who hears the case ought to go into that question and determine the amount of that advance and direct payment to the man who came to the rescue of the injured man when he was in difficulty.  That is the second point on which I propose to introduce an amendment which, I hope, will receive consideration from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I think these are the two main question.  From my perusal of the Bill, I think there are some things which have been omitted.  There are two or three classes of workmen whose cases are not covered.  There is the case of the workman who is employed by a contractor who is not a citizen of Saorstát Eireann and who has no residence in Saorstát Eireann. There are some contracts given to people from Scotland, England, France and Germany.  If a workman is injured while in their employment, he can, of course, while they are here, bring a claim for compensation and get the weekly payment; but if they leave the country, there is at present no method by which they can be compelled to continue these payments.  I know of three or four cases in my own experience where workmen who got compensation are unable to recover it now because the person from whom they got the compensation is out of the jurisdiction and I think that ought to be remedied.  The way to remedy it is, I think, to provide that if a foreign contractor employs workmen in this country he shall be compelled to insure them with a company having its headquarters here or through some person resident in the jurisdiction who would be responsible for the compensation.</P>
    <P>There is another class of workers who, I think, are left out of the beneficent provisions of this Bill. They are ordinary labourers who are employed to do work on a foreign ship.  The sailor on board a foreign ship is protected by the law, and the <Col N="1966" /> sailor on board an Irish ship is protected by the law, but if an ordinary worker is employed to work on a foreign ship&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>No; in the case of discharging cargo the stevedore would be the person responsible and he is usually a man of substance, but there are many things done on a ship in port by ordinary workers&mdash;a carpenter might be taken on to do some work or a person might be taken on to wash the decks&mdash;and that class of person, receiving injury, has no effectual remedy against the owners of the ship. That is the other point and it is the only point.  There is a provision in the Bill&mdash;I think it is Section 32&mdash;which provides that if a workman receiving a weekly payment ceases to reside in Saorstát Eireann he shall thereupon cease to be entitled to receive any weekly payments unless a medical referee certifies that the incapacity resulting from the injury is likely to be of a permanent nature.  I think that that restriction is probably too severe.</P>
      <P>However, I am sure the Minister had very good reason for limiting it in the way in which he has limited it.  If, however, there was a workman who, for the sake of his health or for the sake of getting a cure, went to a foreign country, I think it would be very unfair to deprive him of his compensation while he was away.  These are the only points that seem to me to require consideration by this House. They do not at all derogate from the excellence of this measure.  They are simply intended to deal with matters which were probably overlooked.  I know that the matter of the casual labourer was not overlooked, but I would urge the Minister in that case to take the bull by the horns, and, as he has given the casual labourer compensation, to see that nothing is done to deprive him of the chance of getting employment.  If he does that and makes his Bill complete, this, I repeat, will be the fullest and most beneficent measure of workmen's compensation that has appeared on the statute book of any country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1967" /> I wish to say this further, that various claims have been made on behalf of workmen, various advances have been made in legislation in regard to workmen, and a great deal has been spoken about these advances, but there was no measure ever introduced so useful to the working man as the Workmen's Compensation Act.  It is equal to all the others put together, in my opinion.  It was the one protection that the labouring man and his family had.  He went and gave his labour for reward, for wages.  As the law stood before these Acts were introduced, if he received an injury in the course of his employment he was thrown on the world, and had nothing to keep himself or his family.  Therefore, I say this is the most beneficent legislation for workers that has ever been introduced, and I should like to see it made as perfect as it is humanly possible to make it.  I think this Bill has gone almost to the limit of perfection in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator who has just sat down suggested that there were some things possibly that had been overlooked by the Minister and his Department before bringing this Bill to the House.  I can hardly imagine that anything has been overlooked. It is now over seven years since the report of the Committee was made, and we were informed time and time again that the report was being examined and that a Bill would be introduced shortly.  Between promises of that kind, there was a close examination, so I cannot imagine that anything has been overlooked as the Senator has suggested.  I should be better pleased if I could think that some things had been overlooked, because there are omissions from the Bill that I regret.  I think it would have been better if the Minister had followed the report of the Committee right through and, if possible, had improved upon it.  After all, whilst seven years' growth in a nation's life is not very great, in matters of industrial development it is claimed that there has been considerable growth, and that should be in the <Col N="1968" /> direction of improving the economic position of the working people of the country.  It is no use talking of improving a nation's economic state unless that improvement is going to have its reflection in the workers' conditions, and seven years' consideration should have meant an improvement on the Committee's report, whereas, in one or two important respects, the Bill is less favourable than the report.</P>
      <P>I would have been pleased if the Minister had given us a review of the position to-day as compared with the position in 1925-26 when the Committee's inquiry was going on.  There were several recommendations of that Committee which were dependent upon the course of affairs in the few years that succeeded.  Certain statistics were not then available and it was hoped that they would become available.  Certain information was not then at the disposal of the Committee which it was hoped would be placed at their disposal.  I should like to have from the Minister some indication as to the effect of the information that is now at his disposal, or presumably at his disposal, upon the situation that existed at the time of the Committee's report.  There was one recommendation to which I should like to draw attention&mdash;paragraph 17 dealing with State encouragement of the &ldquo;safety-first&rdquo;campaign.  I want to make clear that so far as trade unions are concerned, they are much more earnest about preventing accidents than having compensation paid to workmen for them.  The representatives of the trade unions on that Committee were very glad indeed to urge and to subscribe to the recommendations regarding accident prevention and &ldquo;safety-first&rdquo; because, as I say, they were more concerned about preventing accidents than that workmen should get adequate compensation if accidents did occur.  Not much of a positive character, that I am aware of, has been done to implement the recommendations of that Committee regarding accident prevention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is certain to be a considerable amount of industrial development and it is time, I think, that very positive action should be taken to give <Col N="1969" /> effect to these recommendations.  I do not think that they all require new legislation.  I think they are very much in the hands of the Department at present but I am very doubtful whether there is a sufficient accident prevention staff at the disposal of the Minister at the present time.  While I say that I recognise that so far as reported accidents are concerned there has been a very great improvement. Reported accidents, according to the last report which is available, that is for 1931&mdash;another is due but it is not yet circulated&mdash;are very much less. There has been a steady decline since 1928 in the number of accidents reported&mdash;1,144 in 1928; 1,228 in 1929; 860 in 1930 and 738 in 1931.  Even more gratifying, the decline in fatal accidents has been equal to the decline in accidents of all kinds.  I say that is very gratifying but it has also some bearing on the scale of compensation that is contained in the Bill, especially in so far as it departs from the scale of compensation recommended by the Committee.  Obviously, without question&mdash;any member of the Committee would have admitted it&mdash; there was some regard paid to the incidence of insurance as it was then known.  It was on a higher range than exists to-day, when the risk was estimated.  Notwithstanding that, there was agreement amongst all the members of the Committee representing various interests.</P>
    <P>They came to a compromise agreement and they recommended certain rates of compensation including a figure of 35/- a week as the maximum for total incapacity.  I say that was a compromise agreement.  There was a compromise from the labour point of view and I presume a compromise from an industrial point of view and the insurance point of view.  There was a general compromise to work out an unanimous agreement and that unanimity was reflected in the report. If it had been thought that it was going to be followed by legislation less favourable to workmen than the Committee unanimously recommended, there would not have been unanimity. There would have been certain parts of the report which would not have <Col N="1970" /> been agreed to by the labour representatives but to which they did agree in virtue of the fact that the insurance representatives and the employers' representatives had agreed to the rate of compensation.  Now, though seven years have passed and an improvement in the economic condition is expected to follow Governmental policy, the Minister comes in and says &ldquo;We are going to depart from that part of the report and reduce the maximum rate of compensation from 35/- to 30/-.&rdquo;  I do not think that that can be justified at all by any argument that the Minister adduced in the Dáil.  I am rather disappointed that he should repeat here the reference to other countries.  All these other countries that he refers to have been governed and are governed in the main, certainly all their workmen's compensation and employers' liability legislation has been enacted, by capitalistic Governments and Parliaments. They have been following long after even the British legislation in the matter and I would have hoped that the Minister would not, at least, base his case upon the enactments of capitalistic-minded Parliaments.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also referred to the year 1917 and the Bill of that year which altered the compensation for total incapacity.  He mentioned also the 1906 Act, at which time the maximum rate was 20/-.  He might have gone further back than that.  He might have gone back to 1897 when the maximum amount to be paid was 20/-.  I think if the Minister would follow his own example and talk about costs of living he would find in effect that the result of his Bill is to give less, relative to prices, than they had as a maximum in 1897 and in 1917. During the discussion of the 1917 Bill the index figure in Great Britain ranged from 175 to 180; to-day it is 156.  The Minister certainly ought to raise the maximum to 34/- and not to 30/-, if he wants to stick to that proportion. By reducing it to 30/-, he is paying the workers compensation in that respect lower than it was in 1917, 1906 or 1897.</P>
    <P>While I admit that, as a matter of practical convenience, it is desirable to have some kind of maximum, I <Col N="1971" /> should like the Minister to get away from the thought that you have merely to compensate workmen on a basis which represents the minimum cost of the necessaries of life.  Even the necessaries of life based upon to-day's prices, if one includes nothing more than food and fuel, for the ordinary family would be higher than 30/-.  I shall not enter upon that just at this stage.  I would, however, ask the Minister to recognise that, if a workman is worth to his employer £3 per week, the loss of the capacity to earn £3 per week should be compensated at something approaching the sum that is being lost, not the sum that it costs that man and his family to live on the barest margin.  It is compensation for loss of earning capacity; it is not compensation merely for the purpose of keeping the man alive.  The rate of wages is important, because it indicates the standard of living to which the man and his family have been used and if, by an accident arising out of that workman's employment, the family is deprived, then the compensation should be something equivalent to enable him to continue the standard of living which he was used to when in employment.</P>
    <P>I admit that that principle has not been embodied in the British legislation, or in the report, or in the other definitely drafted schemes of workmen's compensation.  But, because, as a matter of practical concern, it has not the inability to persuade capitalistic Parliaments to grant anything approaching justice in the matter should not be taken as a justification for reducing the maximum agreed upon by a body representing the two great interests of employers and workmen and including also representatives of insurance interests and legal practitioners.  I think that that is the chief defect of this measure. There are other points, one or two of which have been raised by Senator Comyn, particularly that in relation to the employment of Saorstát workment by a Saorstát employer outside the Saorstát, that I hope will be remedied during the Committee Stage. <Col N="1972" /> The other matters that he referred to may be of importance, but it may not be possible to remedy those without international agreement.  There are, however, one or two points that should be the subject of examination and discussion in the House.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I agree that the Bill is a serious attempt to remedy many of the grievances which have exhibited themselves in the workmen's compensation law.  I would, however, have been much more pleased if the Minister had gone further in such a way as to ensure that compensation that had been awarded should be paid.  There should be some kind of compulsory insurance so that the workman should be guaranteed that when compensation has been awarded he would receive it.  I think, even beyond that, the Minister might have considered favourably a proposal to have a State-guaranteed scheme of workmen's compensation, a matter which was favourably commented upon in the report. It is worth noting from the latest figures I have got, covering the year 1928, of the British insurance companies, which include also Irish figures, but of course only to a very small degree, that of the total sum received in premiums only 56 per cent. was paid for compensation, including legal and medical expenses in connection with the settlement of claims.  I do not know how that figure would compare with Saorstát figures before or since. There are figures published and laid on the Table, but they are not totalled, and one has to make a long tot, which I have not been able to do, as to the proportion of employers' liability claims affecting the Saorstát.  A very rough tot shows that out of £315,000 or £320,000 received in premiums in the year 1930 about £200,000 has been paid in claims.  I should like to have heard from the Minister some figures as to the amount paid by employers in premiums and the amount paid by the insurance companies by way of compensation. It seems to me that 35 per cent.  to 45 per cent. over and above the cost of compensation is too high a rate to charge employers for insuring against liability to accident.  On the face of it, that is an indication that a <Col N="1973" /> very great change should take place in respect to the charge for employers' liability insurance.  However, there is nothing of that kind in the Bill and we can only regret that the Minister, in his close examination of the problem, has not seen fit to deal with that side of the question.  I give due credit to the Minister for having gone a long way to improve the law in relation to workmen's compensation but I plead with him not to justify his failure to do the perfect thing by reference to the practice of some of the most retrograde countries in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the chorus of congratulation to the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  There is no doubt that it is a well-conceived measure.  It codifies the law down to the present time, and the only important alterations that it makes in the law are those increases in the amount of compensation which, I think, having regard to what has happened in England and probably in Northern Ireland, were already overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to a matter which was mentioned by Senator Johnson.  I am not sure whether it was not also mentioned by Senator Comyn.  It interests me very much as a lawyer.  That is the case of the employer and his workman, both resident in the Saorstát, having a contract of service which was made in the Saorstát, but engaged in the performance of work outside the Saorstát. Under the Bill as it stands, if an accident happens while the workman is at work outside the Saorstát, he has no remedy against his employer in the Saorstát.  An amendment in this connection was introduced in the Dáil, and there was a very interesting discussion upon it, both from the legal point of view and from the practical point of view.  The Minister admitted that, although the workman and his employer lived in the Saorstát and had a contract of service made in the Saorstát, if the accident occurred outside the Saorstát, there was no remedy under this Bill.  He objected to an amendment which made the employer directly responsible in a case like that, <Col N="1974" /> because he thought it was a matter which could best be dealt with by international convention.  With great respect, I doubt very much if it is a matter that could be best dealt with by international convention.  In any event, that course would necessitate delay and, probably, hardship, because these cases must continue to arise so long as the Border exists, and they will affect workmen resident in the Saorstát. No matter what international convention is made, legislation will be necessary.  The convention itself will not be sufficient.  Legislation will be necessary in order to give our courts jurisdiction to deal with the type of case I have referred to.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a suggestion in the Dáil and said he would carefully consider the matter further.  He intimated that he would try to devise an amendment which would fit the case of an employer resident in the Saorstát and having no assets in Northern Ireland whose workman, also resident in the Saorstát, met with an accident in Northern Ireland.  Because he had no assets in Northern Ireland, the employer could not be made effectively liable there.  The Minister promised to see if an amendment could be introduced to meet a case of that kind, pending, at any rate, an international convention.  I suggest, with great deference to the Minister, that that is a course which may give rise to a certain amount of preliminary difficulty. The question whether the employer has or has not assets in Northern Ireland will have to be decided before the claim is made.  The court, or referees, would have to be satisfied that there were no assets in Northern Ireland before that amendment would be of any use.  I think that it is an amendment which would work very slowly and, probably, very uncertainly.  I suggest to the Minister that, pending the international convention, he should take the ready course of adopting the amendment moved in the other House, I think, by Deputy Costello, and make compensation recoverable whether the accident takes place outside or inside the Saorstát.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, there is no new principle involved in this Bill but there is a very great extension of the degree to which an old principle is to be applied.  Whether it is wise, nationally, taking the long view, even in the interests of the class which this kind of legislation is designed to protect, to have the most generous scheme of workmen's compensation of almost any country, I do not know.  After all, any reasonable person must admit that the question is one of degree.  You could have compensation so onerous as practically to stop employment.  It may be questioned whether this legislation does not go too far.  There is always danger of that because, from the nature of the case, the spectacle of a man, through illness or accident, being reduced to a lower state of efficiency and he and his family being unable to live in the way they were accustomed to previously, is so distressing that there is a tendency to favour what I may describe as very humane legislation.  There are political reasons, too, why legislation of this kind may go too far because, obviously, the enormous majority of any electorate consists of workmen.  I am not making any assertion as to whether or not this Bill goes too far.  I do not know enough about it to say that. Only time will show any little incongruities there may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one factor that I think must be borne in mind, and that is that if your scheme of compensation is more generous, obviously the cost of insurance is going to be greater and the need for insurance very much greater than before.  I do not know to what extent employers in this country insure against this class of risk, and to make assertions without really being sure of one's data would perhaps be unwise.  I will, however, hazard the guess that there is a very large number of workers who were not insured adequately against risks under previous Acts and still less in relation to the class of risk which will have to be faced under this measure.  I am strongly disposed to agree with Senators Comyn and Johnson that there should be bound up with this legislation a large scheme of insurance <Col N="1976" /> against employers' liability, for the reason that if that is not done the responsible employer will insure adequately and it will cost him a great deal more than it would if everybody insured, because obviously the greater the scope of insurance the more cheaply it can be effected.  I suggest the Minister should look into the compulsory insurance aspect in connection with this measure.</P>
    <P>There are some points in the Bill in which it seems to me a question of principle is involved to a certain extent and although it may not be a new principle and there may be precedents for the sections to which I am going to refer, I think that on the merits some aspects of them ought to be reviewed.  As regards the question of the liability of the employer for an injury, set out in Section 15 and 16, it seems to me to be wrong that when an accident results in a death or serious and permanent disablement to a workman the employer shall be liable.  The section sets out the employer's liability &ldquo;notwithstanding the fact that such workman was at the time when such accident happened acting in contravention of any statutory or other regulation applicable to his employment, or of any orders given by or on behalf of his employer, or that he was acting without instructions from his employer.&rdquo; If you have a principle of that sort it directly encourages people not to take the care they otherwise would take.  Every accident is, so to speak, a national waste; every man who gets injured is a national loss, as it were. The measure as it stands is scarcely fair to the employer who takes every possible precaution to prevent accident.</P>
    <P>In Section 16 it is set out that an employer shall not be liable in respect of any injury to any workman which is proved to be attributable to the serious and wilful misconduct of such workman.  That is, of course, going very far, but the section also provides&mdash;&ldquo;unless such injury results in the death or the serious and permanent disablement of such workman.&rdquo; Then the employer is liable notwithstanding that the injury is the result <Col N="1977" /> of misconduct.  That seems to me not to be quite right in principle.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of sub-contracting, there are complications of which I am not aware.  Surely a contractor carrying out for a principal some work which it is the contractor's business to do and of which he understands the risk&mdash;work to which he is constantly accustomed&mdash; should be the person against whom the claim should be made and not the principal who cannot know about that sort of thing in the same way as the contractor; otherwise the contractor would never be employed by him.</P>
    <P>Section 24 seems to open up an important point in relation to unemployment benefit and it does not seem to be quite clear to me how people will be dealt with.  It seems rather to leave things very much in the air.  Sections 43 and 52, on the subject of solicitors' costs, appear to me to be excellent.  I listened to Senator Comyn's remarks and obviously he is better up on the subject than I am.  It does seem to be right that solicitors' costs should be subject to the control of the court.  Abuses have been known to occur occasionally and the class of person involved is very often quite unable to protect himself. I recognise the justice of what has been said about loans.  Loans should be repaid but I do not see why the court should not take cognisance of this matter just as well as anything else.</P>
    <P>Those are the only points which appear to me to be necessary for the purpose of reference in advance.  I hope the point about insurance will, in particular, receive further consideration from the Minister, possibly with a view to the suggested revision.  If not, I would suggest to the Minister that the appointed day should be some distance off.  People ought to be given time to consider this question of insuring under the Act.  It would be inadvisable that they should be obliged to do anything too hurriedly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the statement of the Minister with considerable interest as I wanted to ascertain from his remarks if his attitude in regard <Col N="1978" /> to certain aspects of the Bill, following the discussion in the other House, had undergone any change.  I had only two or three points specially in mind and I could not find any reference to these particular points in the statement that the Minister made to-day, He said in the other House that this was to be the law in regard to compensation in the future; he will recollect the passage himself in which he referred to that.  He said that this codified measure would represent the law in this State in relation to compensation. If that is so, I think it is very desirable that possible anomalies and loopholes that might lead to unnecessary litigation or possibly involve injustice should be avoided in a measure of this kind.  I have in mind in regard to these points the criticisms which were made in the Dáil and which could be repeated here with a very good show of reason.</P>
      <P>I have studied this Bill in its entirety because the particular purport of the section can be grasped and the understanding of its merits or demerits can be understood without waiting to grasp the Bill as a whole. I must say that in reading the Bill and on reading its analysis in the Dáil, I find that, for the Dáil, the discussions were unusually enlightening and informative and that even the remarks and observations of the Minister were made with some glimmer of intelligent understanding.  But there were two or three points which struck me as important.  I was very glad to hear Senator Comyn referring to one to-day and I heard Senator Brown refer to another.  Certainly before they can be allowed to stand as they are it is necessary that their meaning should be clarified by the Minister; in the absence of that an amendment would be essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing to which Senator Comyn referred was with regard to casual labour.  I do not propose to enter into the arguments adduced by him to-day nor to invite the Minister to defend these provisions of the Bill as they stand.  I merely refer to this in order to indicate the aspects of the Bill where I propose to table amendments for discussion on Committee <Col N="1979" /> Stage.  The Minister will recall the long discussion in the Dáil on paragraph (b) (iii) of sub-section (2) of Section 5.  I think that that clause has left the Dáil in anything but a satisfactory state, that is to say (b) (iii) which includes the words. &ldquo;employed for the purposes of any work in or about the residence of his employer.&rdquo;  I think that that matter, as Senator Comyn pointed out, involves I might say an almost 90 per cent. risk of depriving such persons as may be referred to here of the opportunities of employment.</P>
    <P>One thing I would ask the Minister to do and that is when it comes to the Committee Stage to give some indication as to whether there are any statistics or information available as to the number of instances of people in such a category.  I ask that so that we might have the percentage of the risks involved.  Information of that kind would be very useful and would enable us to arrive at the point as to whether that particular provision is one the retention of which is necessary or whether its retention would add to the danger of the casual labourer of that kind to the extent to which I referred.</P>
    <P>The next section to which I propose to table an amendment is Section 24. The Minister will recall the discussion in the Dáil on this section.  Sub-section (3) of Section 24 reads: &ldquo;Every order under this section shall be made subject to the condition that it shall cease to be in force if the workman receives unemployment benefit.&rdquo;  The Minister's main case in defending that section was on the grounds that it would prevent the workman receiving more than his pre-accident earnings if that section were to stand.  It is an argument to which he seemed to attach considerable weight and, to a certain extent, the way in which he applied it was an ingenious one.  But the one thing that he did not advert to, and that nobody else adverted to, is what I would like to refer to now.  This is an abstract from the Minister's statement in Committee in the Dáil&mdash;&ldquo;Take the case of a man earning 40/- a week. If he becomes incapacitated he is <Col N="1980" /> entitled, on the basis of total incapacity, to receive 30/- a week.  If he recovers sufficiently to be able to take up light work and, in fact, succeeds in getting a job, say as a night watchman at 10/- a week, the difference between his earnings pre-accident and post-accident is 30/-, and he is entitled to get 75 per cent. of the 30/-, that is 22/6 or thereabouts.  His position while he has the light work is that he is getting 22/6.  If he loses the light work and becomes unemployed, he will be getting in unemployment insurance benefit a minimum sum of 15/-, and may be getting 25/-, which, added to the 22/6, will give him a total remuneration above that which he was earning before the accident occurred.&rdquo;  That is sound finance, but this is a defect in the Bill; that the Minister takes a man earning 40/- a week as a basis, and the compensation while incapacitated as the maximum of 30/- a week as the sum to be paid.  That case is put where people earn 40/- a week or less. But take the case where a man earns £3 or £4 a week.  The argument that the Minister developed there in no sense holds good.</P>
    <P>That is one point to which I propose to table an amendment when the matter comes forward.  The nature of the amendment that I would table would be that when such a case arises as is referred to in the section such case will be reconsidered by the court. The only other section to which I want to refer is Section 15.  Senator Brown referred to this.  I think it was in connection with a Saorstát workman meeting with an accident in the territory outside the jurisdiction of this State.  I read that discussion very carefully and very minutely and I must say that the arguments of the Minister and the arguments also of the Attorney-General were decidedly unconvincing. I hope that in this respect at least an amendment will be carried in Committee which will remove from the Bill these defects to which I have drawn attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I served on the Workmen's Compensation Commission and it is on the report of that Commission that this Bill is largely framed.  It has taken a long time to produce the Bill. <Col N="1981" /> In many respects I wish it had taken much longer because, to my mind, the workers under the new Bill will be adversely affected.  I think the Minister has travelled over a well-worn path in producing the Bill.  He has made very little changes.  He certainly has taken a very retrograde step in reducing the maximum amount of compensation from 35/- to 30/-.  The people who receive the 35/- under the present law are engineers, ship builders, dock labourers and mill operatives.  I think if a census were taken of various occupations, it would be found that it is within these groups the majority of accidents occur.  The very nature of their employment makes that possible. These are the people whose weekly contributions are going to be reduced from 35/- to 30/- under the present Bill.  In doing that the Minister is following the minority report presented by the representatives of the employers.  I have had a great deal to do with workmen's compensation cases.  I have had a great deal of experience of them.  Mention has been made here of the difficulty of a Saorstát employer and a Saorstát worker on a foreign ship recovering from a foreign owner.  I have had cases of Saorstát workers engaged on a foreign ship meeting with accidents as a result of the defective gear of the ship.  As that foreign owner had no agent or registered office here there was no way of recovering compensation in those cases.  That is a matter that I think the Minister might look into with a view to providing some remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of people brought under the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act has been substantially increased.  We are now bringing in what may be described as the black-coated worker under it.  Senators will realise that the number of accidents amongst this class is very small.  Consequently, the insurance corporations are going to benefit very substantially by their inclusion.  People with £350 a year are going to get the noble sum of 30/- a week if they meet with an accident.  That is the boon and the blessing that is being conferred on them by bringing them in under the Act.  Compensation has always been a <Col N="1982" /> puzzle to me.  I could never understand why a person who meets with an accident should be deprived of the major portion of his weekly wages; surely that is the time such a person most needs it.  If a farmer has a horse working on his land and it goes sick, half its ration is not cut off.  The veterinary surgeon is called in to do what he can for the sick horse; but in the case of an injured, or a sick, workman half his ration is cut.  He is left in the position that he has to try and make whatever provision he can with some of the voluntary hospitals with a view to getting well again.  The employer benefits by the whole thing.</P>
    <P>The Committee made one recommendation in their report which is not embodied in the Bill, dealing with cases where a person is so injured as to be almost totally dependent on the help of another person.  In such cases the Committee recommended that a very substantial increase should be allowed in the weekly compensation in order to provide the necessary help for the injured person.  I hope the Minister will look into that aspect of the matter and see that some such provision is made in the Bill.  The case of a person who is injured and rendered almost sightless, making it necessary for him to get help from another person to enable him to get round, was considered by the Committee. It recommended, I think, 20 per cent. in those cases over and above the maximum.  I think that a provision to that effect should be embodied in the Bill.  There has been no departure regarding casual labour, except to a very limited extent.  The casual labourer was always catered for.  The compensation that should be paid to him has been fairly well established by now.</P>
    <P>The question of light work is dealt with in the Bill.  Up to now no person, judicial or otherwise, has been able to determine what is light work. Orders have been made from time to time about light work, but nobody has yet properly defined what light work is.  If the Minister is able in this Bill to do anything that will help to clarify the position with regard to light work, he will be doing a good <Col N="1983" /> day's work for employers and workers alike.  Up to now it has been a very elusive thing.  To do something in the Bill for injured workers entirely dependent on the help of other people would also be a step in the right direction.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the position of people engaged in the large groups of industry that I mentioned: engineering, ship-building, house-building, dockers and all those engaged in the heavier industries.  The compensation payable to all these people is going to be reduced under the Bill.  As I said before, it is amongst those engaged in the groups I have mentioned that the majority of accidents occur.  The great majority of people are going to lose substantially under the proposed legislation.  In my opinion there will be no proper solution of this question of workmen's compensation until it is properly nationalised, and personally I see no very great difficulty in bringing that about.  It is closely allied with State insurance and unemployment. If a man is sick he is entitled to unemployment benefit, and there should be, I think, some linking up of that with cases of injury due to accidents.  If the three things could be amalgamated under the one stamp, it would be a very good thing for the working-classes in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this Bill that I am not satisfied with, and that is the part that deals with casual labour employed by small farmers, road contractors and people of that type.  I am acquainted with an incident that happened where the breadwinner of a family, employed by a small farmer who had a contract for repairing a few miles of road for the county council, and where this man lost his life in quarrying material, for this road, and left his wife and family absolutely unprovided for.  Even though in that case the Bill will enable the next-of-kin of such a man to proceed against that small farmer-contractor it would be a case of selling him out and leaving his family <Col N="1984" /> unprovided for.  I think that, in equity, if the law has provided for one class of worker it should provide for the other class of worker also and that they should have the same amount of benefit as well.  Take the case of two brothers.  One of these works for a big business corporation.  That corporation is in a position to safeguard themselves by insuring their workers so that if that brother meets with an accident he and his family will secure compensation.  But the other brother works, let us say for a small farmer with 15 or 20 acres, which means that in the case of his meeting with an accident there is no provision for it. I think that is a weakness in this Bill.  What Senator Foran put forward is the only solution, and that is that all workers should be insured under some central State insurance scheme which would thereby provide the same benefit for one class of worker as another.</P>

      <P>The greater number of points raised have been, as I expected, more Committee points than matters for discussion at this stage of the Bill. No doubt we will have them all under consideration again when the Bill comes before us in Committee.  To enable Senators, however, to consider their amendments carefully, I would like to indicate some general considerations applying to the points raised which Senators, perhaps, might bear in mind when considering their attitude. Therefore, in order to enable that to be done, I propose to take the points made by Senators in order.  Senator Counihan referred to an agriculturist employing a person who contracted to do certain work on the land.  He implied that that person so employed had no claim against the agriculturist if he became injured in the course of his work.  That is not correct at all If any person, in the course of trade or business, contracts with any other person to do work, then, that person, or any one employed by that sub-contractor, is entitled to proceed against the principal who is named in the contract.  The only exemption in such case is where a farmer engages a person to do work in which a machine <Col N="1985" /> driven by mechanical power is required, such as a threshing machine. If a farmer employed the owner of a threshing machine to do work on his land, any person injured during the course of that work has a claim against the owner of the machine, and not against the farmer.  But if the person is employed on work in which mechanical power is not required then the farmer is liable for any claim for compensation.</P>
      <P>I shall deal now with the point raised by Senator Duffy.  If a local authority, in doing anything in the exercise of its powers and duties, is doing something which will be regarded as a trade or business for the purposes of the Act, and if that local authority contracts with anybody to do anything and a person employed by the sub-contractor is injured in the performance of his duty then the local authority is liable for any compensation arising out of the injury to the person employed by the sub-contractor. The person injured has the option of proceeding against the sub-contractor or the local authority.  If the Senator reads Sections 19 and 9 I think he will find the case he referred to appears to be covered.</P>

      <P>No, but in parts of the existing law which are being re-enacted. If it can be shown that in any decided case&mdash;and I am not aware of it&mdash;in which the law has been differently interpreted I would be prepared to consider an amendment.  But it seems to me quite clear that the sections that have been re-enacted of the original law give claims for compensation against the local authorities in the one case or against the farmer in the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Comyn raised the old argument against bringing within the scope of the Bill casual labourers employed in the neighbourhood of the house or premises of the employer, that including them in the Bill will prevent such casual labourer from getting work.  I do not believe it.  I am quite certain that when Senator Milroy suggests that 90 per cent. of the people <Col N="1986" /> employed in that way are employed out of charity he is not talking with even the minimum amount of intelligence that he attributes to me. Although it may be true that occasionally casual workers get employed around the house without any other reason than that the employer wants to help an individual worker, still, in the majority of cases, such casual labourers are employed because they give value for their wage and because their employer wants the work done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in respect of injuries suffered by the casual labourer employed around a man's house.  The casual worker employed in respect of a trade or business was entitled to compensation, but, up to the present, the casual worker employed in connection with a private house or a club conducting games or recreation is not entitled to any claim for injury. The reply to the main argument of Senator Comyn and others is that the inclusion of the section of the Act of 1906 bringing in all casual workers employed in connection with trade or business did not prevent such people getting employment.  It may be true that occasionally a man gets work out of sheer charity, and for the purpose of giving him something to do, but, in the vast majority of cases, people are employed on this casual labour because there is work to be done and such casual labourers will not be deprived of that work because of the passing of this Bill.  If it could be argued that they would be deprived of work because of this Bill then the same argument could be used against the whole principle of workmen's compensation, on the ground that employers will not employ people, or will only employ a reduced number of people, because of the responsibility they incur.  The real fact of the matter is that the householder who employs such casual labour can insure himself for about one shilling a year.</P>

      <P>Well, 2/6 a year at the outside.  The suggestion was made by Senator Bagwell and by Senator <Col N="1987" /> Comyn that there should be compulsory insurance.  I think we must at once face the fact that any system of compulsory insurance must mean a system of State insurance.  I challenge anybody to conceive any system of organisation which would enable a law requiring compulsory insurance to be imposed so that an administrative machine could take into record every action throughout the whole country where a man is employed even casually by every employer.  If we are going to have compulsory insurance in the Bill, that is, a section which would require every employer to insure against his risks, then we must be certain that we shall be able to enforce that law.  I do not think that we can devise any way in which to make such a section enforceable and if we were to introduce any such section into the Bill without being able to enforce it the effect would be that the whole law would come into contempt because of the fact that such a section could be evaded in a widespread manner.  Even in a State system such as we have for sickness and unemployment insurance there is a very considerable amount of evasion and although we maintain a very large staff of inspectors throughout the whole of the Saorstát continually checking up on the records of individual business and private employers we have not been able to catch up on all the evasions which we know and which everybody knows are taking place.  I will admit that I am considerably attracted by the idea of a sort of all-in insurance scheme, with one card and one stamp, which would combine in one system unemployment, national health insurance and workmen's compensation.  It will not be easy to devise such a scheme.  It will be even more difficult, having devised such a scheme, to frame it in such a manner as to avoid all the obvious loopholes that may give rise to fraud and evasion and it will be more difficult still actually to put it into operation. At any rate, I do not think we would have been well advised to delay the task of amending the Workmen's <Col N="1988" /> Compensation Act any further until some such system had been devised.  Once one begins to consider a system of that kind, all kinds of possible extensions of it begin to arise in every direction.  I think that such a scheme would have to be the subject of very careful consideration and prolonged examination before legislation could possibly be introduced.</P>
      <P>Senator Comyn says that Section 43 goes too far.  I should be glad to see his suggested amendment, but I would point out that it does not interfere with anything, and that it has been the law since 1906.  A number of Senators spoke about one or other of the host of problems that arise when one comes to contemplate the cases of foreign employers or foreign workers or both, and accidents occurring within and without the jurisdiction of the Saorstát. It is, I think, quite clear that nothing that we could put into this Bill, or into the law of this State, will secure for a Saorstát employee compensation from a foreign employer who has got no assets here or compensation from an employer who had been engaged here, but who had left the country leaving no assets behind him.  If we are going to get compensation for the employee under such conditions we can only do it following an international arrangement by which we can give the same right to a foreign worker in return for reciprocal treatment of our workers in other countries.  The Bill gives us power to bring about such reciprocal arrangements.  Particular reference was made in the Dáil, however, to the case of the Saorstát worker employed under a contract of service made in the Free State with a Free State employer, but injured while working for that employer outside the jurisdiction.  The case of Northern Ireland was mentioned with particular reference to that.  Bringing in the case of Northern Ireland confuses the whole issue because any amendment that could be considered in that connection could not be confined in its operation to Northern Ireland or Great Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because under the existing law it is, if not quite certain, <Col N="1989" /> at any rate fairly clear that an employer could not be made liable to pay compensation twice for the same accident if it occurred in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, but if we were to amend the Bill in the manner suggested, it is by no means clear that he might not have to pay twice if the accident occurred in a country other than Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  Even in the case of Great Britain the employee, under common law, might proceed against the employer.  If he has a right of action against a third party, in common law he can proceed against his employer, but the employer is entitled to be indemnified by the third party. If the accident took place outside the jurisdiction it would not be impossible that the workman could get compensation from the employer here, and compensation under common law in Northern Ireland.  I do not think that any of us contemplates that the man should be compensated twice. The position is so difficult to deal with by national legislation that, in making our decision, which we recommend to the Dáil, that these matters should be dealt with by international arrangement, we were supported by the International Labour Office Convention, which consisted of representatives from all countries, all of whom were experts in workmen's compensation legislation, and which, as Senators are aware, because it is mentioned in the Inter-Departmental Committee Report, recommended that precisely these matters should be the subject of international reciprocal agreement.  The Inter-Departmental Committee itself recommended the same thing.  Mr. Justice Hanna, who is recognised as an authority on this very matter, submitted his views to the Committee, and set out the things which should be dealt with by international convention, and he put first of all this particular problem of Free State employees meeting with accidents outside the jurisdiction.  When speaking in the Dáil, I did not pretend that there was not a problem to be dealt with.  There is a problem to be dealt with and a very important one, but I said that it could be dealt with <Col N="1990" /> more suitably by an international reciprocal agreement than by an amendment of the law of this State which would have effect within the jurisdiction of this State, and which would be dissimilar in this respect to the law of any other State.  In every other similar case it is a matter for international agreement.  I did promise in the Dáil to try to frame an amendment and get it introduced in this House, not precisely on the lines suggested by Senator Brown, but to provide that compensation would be payable here, where the contract of service was made here and where the worker was, at the time of the accident, engaged in connection with the employer's business here, but the accident took place outside the jurisdiction. As an example, we can take the case of a man employing a chauffeur driving from one part of the Free State, say, from Donegal, and passing through Northern Ireland.  If the driver of the car meets with an accident on the journey, we want to give the employee the right to proceed against the employer, since he was engaged here and since all the assets of the employer are here.  The employee in that case should have the right to proceed against his employer here, because in passing across Northern Ireland he was performing work in the interests of the employer whose business was in the Free State. Another case would be that of the man who takes a racehorse across to England&mdash;if the tariffs permitted&mdash;to take part in a race.  He meets with an accident in Liverpool&mdash;perhaps the horse kicks him in the stomach.  Again, his right to compensation should be enforceable in the Free State courts, because the contract was made here and the business and assets are here.  I hope to get an amendment to deal with this type of case.  On the more general type of case where an Irish Free State contractor undertakes to build a house or a bridge in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain, and brings in Free State workers and carpenters, that cannot be satisfactorily dealt with otherwise than by an international arrangement of the type which the International Labour Office <Col N="1991" /> Conference and the Inter-Departmental Committee have recommended.  It has been said that there has been considerable delay in having such an international agreement.  I can only agree. There has been delay, unjustifiable delay, in dealing with these matters. On the general question of the worker employed on a foreign ship, or employed by a non-national, without assets in the jurisdiction, we can do nothing without an agreement.  We cannot deal with foreigners.  We cannot create assets.</P>

      <P>The ordinary practice is to insure.  British contractors going to build a bridge in India or somewhere else insure, so as to provide the employees with the right to compensation which they would have got if the accident took place in Great Britain.  Even in respect to Northern Ireland it has been the practice of the tariff insurance companies to provide for the ex gratia payment of compensation at the standard rates paid to their employees by Saorstát contractors injured while working in Northern Ireland. That has been done in practice, even though there is no legal requirement for it.  The general question of the reduction of the maximum rates of payment in cases of total incapacity is one no doubt that we will have before us again.  It is not fair merely to describe the change made in the Bill as a reduction in the maximum rate.  As I pointed out, there is an altered method of calculation, which must be taken into account.  In general, the consideration which, in our opinion, justified a reduction of the maximum rate was (1) the fact that since the maximum rate was fixed there has been a substantial reduction in the cost of living; (2) the scale of compensation which we propose to pay here is definitely higher than the scale at present prevailing in Northern Ireland or Great Britain, although these countries are much more highly developed industrially and, (3) so far as we have been able to discover, the scale of compensation we propose is as good, if not better, than that paid in any other country.  I was not referring entirely to countries with a capitalistic form of government.  In the case of Russia the payment to <Col N="1993" /> persons totally unfit for work is sixty-six and two-thirds of the pre-accident earnings, as against our seventy-five.</P>

      <P>Subject to standardisation of salaries at the rate of £2 15s. per head I have no doubt we would get that.  Senator Bagwell referred to Sections 15 and 16.  The reason why the change is made in Section 15 is to secure that a workman becomes entitled to compensation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that such workman was at the time when such accident happened acting in contravention of any statutory or other regulation applicable to his employment, or of any orders given by or on behalf of his employer, or that he was acting without instructions from his employer.</P>
      <P>It has been found that employers were evading liability to pay compensation through a number of devices, including that of representing that the employee was acting contrary to instructions given him by his employer.  The employer may have said: &ldquo;Do not put your hand on that axe, or you will get it cut off.&rdquo;  If the employee got his hand cut off, the employer could then say that he was acting contrary to instructions.  It is because there was such evasion that the change in the law was recommended by the Committee. That change was effected in Great Britain over ten years ago.  I think it has not been the experience that any ill effects on employers followed.  The employers' representatives on the Commission supported the change.  So far as Section 16 (2) is concerned:&mdash;</P>
      <P>An employer shall not be liable under this Act in respect of any injury to any workman which is proved to be attributable to the serious and wilful misconduct of such workman, unless such injury results in the death or the serious and permanent disablement of such workman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1994" /> That is not a change in the existing law which operated since 1906. Senator Milroy announced his intention of tabling an amendment to Section 24. I do not think the Senator quite grasped the effect of the section.  A workman totally disabled gets the rate of payment provided in the Bill&mdash; the total disablement rate.  If he recovers sufficiently to be able to undertake, not the work he was previously engaged upon, but a lighter class of work, and if he succeeds. in getting light work, the compensation he gets is 75 per cent. of the difference between what he was earning before the accident and what he earned after the accident.  But, if he cannot get light work, and if he goes to the court and demonstrates that his inability to get it is due to the accident, and whatever physical disability results from it, the court, in its discretion may, if it thinks fit, say that the worker shall be entitled to be paid as if totally incapacitated. That is the position which this Bill contemplates in sub-section (1) of the section.  The worker has been injured; he has recovered from the injury and is capable of getting light work; he has, however, satisfied the court that he is unable to get that light work due to the accident, and the court orders him to get full compensation instead of the partial compensation to which he is statutorily entitled.  Such workman then makes a claim for unemployment insurance benefit and gets the benefit.  The Bill provides that, in such case, he ceases to get the full compensation which the court had awarded to him, and he gets only the partial compensation to which he is ordinarily entitled.  It has been argued that that is unjust to the worker.  My answer to that was that in certain cases and, in fact, in the majority of cases, it might well work out that a worker getting his partial compensation, plus his unemployment insurance benefit, would be getting more than he had been earning before the accident occurred.  That will not work out in all cases, but it works out certainly in the case of a worker who is earning 40/- a week and, remember, it does not matter what his post-accident earnings are&mdash;you can <Col N="1995" /> put those at any figure you like&mdash; because he cannot be getting benefit while he is earning and it is only when he ceases to earn that he gets benefit and consequently, gets only the partial incapacity rate.  If he is only partially incapacitated, and if his benefit fails, if it becomes exhausted, if he becomes no longer entitled to get benefit, but nevertheless is unable to get work, he can go back to the court and again satisfy it that his inability to get work is due to his injuries, and the court can again order that he should get the full benefit.</P>

      <P>The Minister may recollect a passage in the Dáil debates&mdash; I think it was on Report Stage&mdash;in which he admitted that that would probably happen only once and that if he got light employment and then lost it, it finished his chance of going back for a further extension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will note, however, that we amended the Bill on Report Stage so as to ensure that he could go back but we did it also for another reason.  We, in fact, changed the section and we did so because of the difficulty which Senator Foran referred to.  He said that he did not think much of our description of &ldquo;light work&rdquo; or he asked if we had attempted to find a description for it. Every attempt up to the present to devise a satisfactory section to deal with that particular case has been a failure.  A section was devised by the British Parliament in 1925 and was embodied in a British Act.  It seemed, on the face of it, to provide everything that everybody wanted to provide but quite recently it was the subject of a House of Lords decision which completely nullified it.  People did say that the House of Lords was wrong in its decision, but whether it was right or wrong in the legal interpretation of the phrase, there is no doubt that the decision completely reversed the intention of those who framed the section.  Last year or late in 1931, the British Parliament again had a shot at it, and it had a shot after several trial attempts, at producing a section which would make it clear that <Col N="1996" /> where a worker's inability to get light work was due to his injuries, he should be given full compensation by the court instead of partial compensation without, at the same time, encouraging him to avoid getting work or on the other hand, making it possible for the courts to say that his inability to get work was due not to his injuries but to the state of the labour market.</P>
      <P>Senator Foran said that we took a long time to produce the Bill.  I do not think we did.  You cannot produce a Bill of this nature, a Bill which requires very great care in its drafting because every word of it is likely at some stage to be the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court, in a hurry and, having due regard to the necessity of careful phrasing, and to the fact that our predecessors took from 1926 until 1932 and then did not produce the Bill, the fact that the Bill has now been produced in our second year of office is to our credit.</P>

      <P>We inherited a white print which was, however, publicly repudiated by its authors.  I was giving them credit for making the change when they refused to accept the credit.  Senator Foran suggested that we are bringing black-coated workers in for the first time.  That, I think, is not correct, if his interpretation of the phrase is the same as my own.  I used that phrase to describe the clerical type of worker and the Bill, in any circumstances, applies only to those engaged by way of manual labour, even though we raised the limit of remuneration so far as the manual labour definition is concerned and, consequently, the deep design to benefit insurance companies which Senator Foran read into the particular section is not there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We established a standard of pay for manual labour which the Labour Party will scarcely object to.  There was a suggestion made by the Committee that we should pay additional compensation to persons <Col N="1997" /> requiring the constant help of another person.  That was a recommendation of the International Labour Office Conference and we considered it with great care but I was unable to devise any satisfactory method which seemed to me to be fraud proof. I think that most of us know, and the Labour Party as well as everybody else, that there is as much, if not more, fraud in relation to workmen's compensation than there is in relation to many other enactments. Extraordinary ingenuity, in fact, has been shown from time to time in arranging these frauds.  I dislike trying to put in a section of that kind because it seems to me that it would open the pathway to fraudulent claims very wide indeed and I thought it better that we should leave that matter stand over, at any rate, until we had some evidence of how it was working out in the one or two countries in which it has been put into operation. I certainly feel that I could not recommend the inclusion of a section of that kind having regard (1) to the considerable difficulties of phraseology which would ensure that benefit would be confined to those to whom we intended to give it and (2) to the probability that every person who is receiving workmen's compensation would be able to establish a good case for the assistance of a second person.  If it would be possible to limit it to particular classes of incapacity, it might be possible to do it, but I do not think it can be done and I gave the matter considerable attention.  However, as I have said, these are all matters which can be more fully and adequately discussed on Committee Stage. Any suggestions that Senators have to make may be debated then and again on Report.  I am myself proposing to submit certain amendments which were discussed when the Bill was before the Dáil on Report in order to implement certain undertakings I gave then and on the strength of which other amendments were withdrawn.</P>

      <P>On Second Reading, Senator Comyn asked why it was necessary to include the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883, and subsequent Acts continuing and amending that enactment, in the Schedule of the Bill.  The position, as the Senator is, no doubt, aware, is that when the original Act was passed it was anticipated that the problem of housing in rural Ireland would be dealt with satisfactorily within a period of five years, an anticipation which, it is <Col N="1999" /> not necessary to inform the Seanad, was not fulfilled.  The Act was subsequently continued by amending Acts in 1885 and 1886, and so on up until 1906, when an Act was passed which provided that the Labourers Act should continue in force for a period of ten years from the passing of the Act until the end of the Session of Parliament next ensuing.  The theory underlying the time limitation which was imposed in all these Acts was, as I already indicated, that the problem of rural housing would have been satisfactorily dealt with in the main and that the only thing that would then remain to be provided for would be the proper administration of houses which had been built under the Acts, and their maintenance.  Needless to say, once more that anticipation, even the anticipation of the 1906 Act, has not been fulfilled, largely due to the reason that the operation of the Act was suspended and that, in fact, operations were not resumed until the beginning of last year when the problem of rural housing was tackled in earnest.  It is felt, however, that the justification which existed for making the original labourers' code a temporary one still exists and that until further progress has been made towards a solution of this problem and until we are in a position to visualise what the future position in regard to rural housing is going to be, we should not do anything to make this a permanent code but should await the results of the present activity.  In that connection, I might point out there is in some counties a feeling that these cottages should be passed on to the owners. In other counties, however, there is some objection to that.  What the position will be when the problem, as a whole, has been fully dealt with, it is very difficult to say.</P>

      <P>Senators, I expect, have studied the Report, and they will notice that it owes its origin to a resolution passed at the Conference in Ottawa last year.  The co-operation indicated is of a character which brings it more into line with international co-operation, as in the case of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the International Office of Public Health and the International Veterinary Bureau.  Prior to October, 1933, the Saorstát participated in the activities of a number of bodies and made contributions amounting to £825 to the scientific information bureaux&mdash; the Imperial Agricultural Bureau, the Imperial Institution of Entomology and the Imperial Mycological Institute. The Empire Marketing Board disbanded on the 30th September, 1933. This Board was financed by the British Government in the circumstances described in paragraphs 187 to 189 of the Report.  Under the new scheme proposed by the Committee certain economic services which would be performed by the Board are to be <Col N="2001" /> undertaken by the Imperial Economic Committee, a body which is already engaged in the investigation of the marketing of Commonwealth commodities, but which was hitherto financed from the funds of the Empire Marketing Board.  The Imperial Shipping Committee was also financed by the British Government, but under the new system both the Economic and the Shipping Committees will be financed by all the Governments of the Commonwealth.  As a result of the adoption of the report, the total additional contributions required from the Saorstát for the various agencies for economic and scientific co-operation is £960 per annum.  These contributions from the Saorstát are for a period of three years from the 1st October, 1933.</P>

      <P>I think that we should give more than a mere perfunctory assent to this motion, because it marks what I think must be one of the purple patches in the career of the Minister who proposed it.  It is a unique moment.  It marks the formal incorporation of the Imperial idea into the philosophy of Fianna Fáil.  It is one of those moments that make some of us, who have heard the Minister and his colleagues denouncing this alien importation of the Imperial idea, realise the truth of the words, that there are more things in Heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy.  One wonders whether this motion moved by the Minister for Lands and Fisheries marks another stage in the rake's progress, or whether it is the evolution of a superman that we are witnessing.  Surely it is not possible that anyone so wise as the Minister, and so virtuous as we have reason to believe him to be, can either have erred in 1931 in his judgment of such matters, or that the sweets of office have beguiled him into changing the views he then held to those he has expressed to-day&mdash;views that are implied if not expressed by his proposing this motion. In 1931 the approval of another Imperial Conference Report was proposed here.  The Minister for Lands and Fisheries, who was not then in office, used these pregnant, significant and, I am sure, deliberate words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2002" />&ldquo;I hold that we jeopardise our moral position by our activities in connection with the Imperial Commonwealth Conferences.  We give away our position by having anything to do with the Imperial forces that combine to make up the British Empire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the speaker who to-day proposes the motion of approval for economic consultation and co-operation between those forces that make up the British Empire or the Commonwealth. I say again that this is a moment which makes us stand aghast at the extraordinary, and, so far, inexplicable diversity of views which can be combined in the mentality of one individual&mdash;not merely diversity, but confliction of views.</P>
    <P>I have read this report with keen interest.  I think it is an admirable report.  It is informative, it is constructive, and has suggestions which, if given effect to, may possibly have more healing effects upon the differences between peoples than even political agencies can produce.  I heartily endorse the proposal to approve of this report, but I should like to know the purpose of the reservation of Mr. Lemass, as he is referred to here.  I should like to know for what reason that was intended.  I should like to know where it points.  Personally I have not sufficient insight into the matter.  It is a very bald, brief paragraph accompanied by no explanation, and I cannot at the moment see the wisdom of it.  This motion, I think, does not exactly approve of the report itself, but of certain recommendations in the report.  Mr. Lemass approved of the report in toto.  His reservation was to this effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not object to the adoption of this report and the accompanying resolutions, but I wish it to be made perfectly clear in the published records of the Conference that the Government of the Irish Free State are not prepared to contemplate the setting up of an Imperial economic secretariat or of any similar organ of centralisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it was a pity that the objection expressed in that reservation was not more fully explained.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  This is a motion to approve of the voting of money for economic co-operation between certain agencies within the British Commonwealth. Surely if that object is laudable it is desirable that such co-operation should have as intelligent and effective a directing head as possible.  The precise way in which that would be arrived at I am not even pretending to hint at.  What I am commenting upon is the fact that the representative of the Saorstát, whose name appears here, apparently objected to having any effective directing centre to influence the functions of those co-operative agencies which we are proposing to strengthen and support.  The only reason that I can see why that reservation was put in was that Mr. Lemass should show that he at least is in accord still with the views of the proposer of this motion expressed in 1931&mdash;that we give away our position by having anything to do with the Imperial forces that combine to make up the British Empire. It surely was not in accord with the statement made by the Minister for Finance the other day in the Dublin Chamber of Commerce:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is the earnest desire of the Government of the Saorstát that the relations between the people of Ireland and Great Britain should be amicable and cordial.  We recognise that in many important matters the two peoples have a community of interests and of common concern. We believe it is not beyond the capacity of the two peoples to arrive at an understanding which will be honourable and lasting.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Certainly there is a wide diversity between the statement of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries in 1931, that of the Minister for Industry and Commerce at Ottawa, and that of the Minister for Finance at the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  I should like to know, further, to what extent and in what way we propose to avail of the institutions outlined and dealt with in this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2004" /> I should like to emphasise one other point&mdash;that this report outlines and portrays a form of Commonwealth organism which has been in a state of growth, which has been, in some directions, proved and, in other directions, strengthened.  But it differs from those services to which the President referred in his few remarks in that this is specifically and emphatically a Commonwealth organism of which this State is, by this motion, going to become an integral part.  As it grows and develops, it is going to bring together those various States and entities which make up the Commonwealth, to bind them together with links stronger than steel, links which will be much more difficult to break or shatter than political affiliations. That is what we are asked to give assent to and I hope we shall give cordial and emphatic assent to it. But I ask you to recollect that this assent is asked for by the gentlemen who informed us in 1931 that we gave away our position by &ldquo;having anything to do with the Imperial forces that combine to make up the British Empire.&rdquo;  It is well to know whither we are tending.  We cannot walk out of the Commonwealth on one leg and walk into it on the other, unless some new form of human ingenuity is to be devised.  I know that the present Government are very ingenious.  They have devised some extraordinary situations. They devised certain formulæ, empty and full, which would have seemed to be beyond the wit of man to devise a few years ago.  But they have not yet devised a political arrangement by which we can go in two opposite directions at the same time.  We are honoured to-night with the unusual presence of our President. If he can inform us how we are simultaneously to go out of and into the Commonwealth of Nations, he will be doing something of which I did not consider him capable up to the present.  This is his opportunity to reveal the big secret of how to stand simultaneously in two different positions.</P>
    <P>The composite bodies dealt with in this Report have not been, so far as I <Col N="2005" /> can see, a bad sideline for Saorstát Eireann.  I gathered from the statement of the President that our total contribution is £960.  He stated in the Dáil that the Saorstát representative on one of these bodies would get a fee of £500, which would be credited to the Saorstát Exchequer.  When the President is replying, perhaps he would explain the grants from the Empire Marketing Board accorded to University College, Dublin&mdash;£3,250 capital, £1,100 per annum for five years and £1,550 capital, £425 per annum for five years.  That is not a bad return to get for the payment of £960.  On that side, I think we have a fairly substantial margin of profit.  On page 85 of the report there is this suggestion by the Conference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been suggested, therefore, that a Conference, representative of the various parts of the Commonwealth and consisting partly of the responsible administrative and scientific heads of research organisations and departments in those countries and partly of such other persons as the several Governments may select, should be summoned at an early date for the purpose of formulating a programme of such forms of research as it may be considered should be conducted on an inter-imperial basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The only reason I refer to that is to express the hope that if this suggestion is given effect to and such a conference is called, the unwisdom of sending the Minister for Lands and Forestry to it will be obvious to the Government.  He would, probably, if he arrived there, insist upon presenting each member of the conference with a &ldquo;historical background&rdquo; which would be ruled out of order.</P>
    <P>We are asked to approve of certain recommendations in this report which are set out very clearly.  As I said, I thoroughly approve of these representations, but I take it that there is general approval of the report of this Imperial Committee on Economic Consultation and Co-operation by the Executive Council.  The President, in his statement in the Dáil, did not dissent from any part of the report.  It <Col N="2006" /> may be that he overlooked certain parts of it.</P>
    <P>There is one part of the report to which I desire to refer in case the President has overlooked it.  I think it is important to draw his attention to it before he is committed to an irrevocable step.  I think he should look up the draft charter suggested for the Imperial Economic Committee. It begins on page 125 and continues into succeeding pages.  It is suggested there that in the event of a vacancy in the office of President, from whatever cause arising, such a vacancy shall be filled by the nomination of a successor under the Sign Manual of the Sovereign for the time being.  Is this what we are asked to approve, and by whom are we asked to approve it?  Or are we contemplating setting up a rival dynasty and that it will be the Sovereign for the time being of the Royal Irish Republic who would nominate this person? These are matters that need to be cleared up.  We cannot sit between two stools without coming to the ground.  We cannot to-day be approving of a motion which is going to bring together, weld together and strengthen those contacts between the different elements of the Commonwealth and, logically and consistently, to-morrow ask the people of this State to take a step that is going to smash up that Commonwealth, nor can we with dignity write to Mr. Thomas and ask for his permission to establish a Republic outside the ambit of the Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to know where we stand; the people of this State should know where they stand.  There was a time in the history of this State when, if it were a choice between an Irish Republic and the state of government that existed, I would not hesitate for one second as to which I would vote for.  But we are not in that position to-day.  We are in a position where the people of this State have full control of every power and authority and resource within their own territory.  If that is not national freedom, if that is not a true conception of human freedom, I do not know what is.  There are other problems, <Col N="2007" /> such as the problem of the division between the North and the South, that have to be dealt with; but it is not by creating a spirit of embroilment with our neighbours across the water and a spirit of disturbance in our own area, it is not by confusing standards and projecting conflicting views, that we are going to bring the North in.</P>
    <P>We have a great opportunity to make a great State of this land in which the Oireachtas rules.  I believe sincerely that the making of that great State depends very largely, if not entirely, upon the spirit, the ideal, that is embodied in this report, the approval of which is asked by the Minister for Lands and Fisheries.  I have the greatest possible pleasure, for the first time, in strongly supporting what the Minister now proposes in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to the House and to Senator Milroy, who seems to have overlooked it, that this is an entirely voluntary matter of entering into co-operation, as recommended in this report.  We are not threatened with any pains or penalties if we do not co-operate, nor would we suffer any immediate war if, at the end of a period of three years we thought fit to withdraw.  If Senator Milroy will cast his mind back to Item 2 on the Order Paper of to-day he will find we were there enacting a Dangerous Drugs Act, and that is merely implementing a Geneva Convention in connection with drugs which have their uses and which also have their misuses.  I have no doubt that parties to that Convention included China, Italy and Russia, but in enacting the Dangerous Drugs Act we are not paying tribute to the principles of Confucius, or to the political systems of Fascism or Bolshevism. My business has for a number of years made it advisable that I should keep my eye on the operations of the Empire Marketing Board.  I think it would be a very good thing for this country and it also would be a very good thing for Australia and New <Col N="2008" /> Zealand, in the marketing of what is called in England Empire Dairy Produce, that there should be co-operation between the three countries.</P>
      <P>I will go a little further so as to explain to Senator Milroy what the Minister for Finance said in that speech about the community of interests.  It was pointed out that one person who would co-operate most heartily with Australia, New Zealand and this country in getting a better price for what is called across the water Empire produce, would be Major Elliot, the Minister of Agriculture in England, Mr. Elliott, as he is now called here.  I have heard him referred to as the first English Sinn Feiner.  I suggested more than once to the late Minister for Agriculture that he should enter into voluntary co-operation with New Zealand and Australia so as to get what this new co-operative Empire organisation is intended to secure and, I have no doubt, will secure.  But the idea of trying to read into this a political significance which it has not is such as I do not think even deceives Senator Milroy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there is any value whatever in political consistency and I do not claim it for myself.  I do not think there are many members of this House who could absolutely claim it, even if it were a virtue.  It is much more important and valuable to do what is the right thing at the time, having regard to the circumstances, than to prove you are absolutely consistent in the particular action which you are taking. I take it the Government ask us to approve of this proposal because they believe co-operation in these particular institutions will be of value to this country and its people.  I propose to consider the matter from that point of view.  I do not think it is a matter of very vital importance, but I think it is a matter which should give considerable satisfaction to the members of the House that the Government do see their way to co-operate with the members of the British Commonwealth even to the extent recommended in this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2009" /> I think Senator Dowdall in his anxiety to reply to Senator Milroy was not, strictly speaking, correct.  To implement a Geneva Convention which is of an international character is not quite the same thing as to approve of the recommendations of the Report of the Imperial Committee on Economic Consultation and Co-operation. If I read it correctly&mdash;and I do not want to go into a lot of extraneous matters even though they may be kindred&mdash;it means that this Government believes that there are certain matters in which this country should, in its own interest, freely co-operate with the members of the British Commonwealth. It is not as if you were implementing a Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>I have believed, and I stated again and again in this House, and it has been my absolute conviction, that on the basis of freedom this country will be happier, better, more contented and better governed as a member of the British Commonwealth under present world conditions, than in any other way.  I believe that that would be the view&mdash;I do not know whether it is now the view of an absolute majority or not&mdash;but it would be the view of the majority if it were clearly and squarely put to them.  To my mind, the regret is that far too much emphasis has been laid on certain things which are relatively unimportant. I regret too, that nobody in this or even in the last Government, has gone to the trouble of enabling the ordinary people to know the extent to which we can gain by co-operation. This debate, the fact that this matter has come before the House, and that it is proposed by the Government, may do a considerable amount of good&mdash; not because of the importance of this document itself&mdash;if it makes the people begin to inquire and see what they may gain by membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>I do not want to follow Senator Dowdall into the question of coercion or force.  Still less do I want to go back ten or 11 years, but as the matter has been raised and as I have the opportunity, I should like to say that I have spent a good deal of my time in studying political developments <Col N="2010" /> inside the British Commonwealth, and that I am absolutely convinced that the members of the Commonwealth have a constitutional and moral right to secede if they believe that it is in their interests to do so.  But I am equally convinced that it would be the most foolish thing that this country could do to secede.  To my mind, it is a matter of the greatest regret that our leaders&mdash;and I am not questioning their sincerity&mdash;feel it necessary to put before this country the belief that we are here because we were forced to be members of the British Commonwealth. I believe that we should consider the matter as a legislature who are prepared, no matter what anybody else says, to do what the majority of our people want.  As far as I am concerned, if the majority of the people declared for a republic, I would be as loyal to that republic as I am to the present form of government now.  I believe that is the only correct attitude which an Irishman can take.</P>
    <P>It is, I believe, unfortunate in some ways that this matter comes before us when certain kindred public questions are being discussed.  A few weeks ago I expressed the view in this House, when three Bills came before us, that we were acting within the Treaty and the Constitution.  I am still of the same opinion.  I think, that the value of the Resolution that is before us, if properly viewed, is seen in the fact that the members of this Government, while holding the views which we know they hold, are prepared to lead the people of this country so that they can see a way in which the people of this country can at present co-operate.  I believe that the only future for the British Commonwealth&mdash;and I believe it has a future&mdash;is on the basis of absolute free co-operation.</P>
    <P>I would join issue with Senator Milroy on one point.  I cannot agree personally with the reservation of Mr. Lemass, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not think centralisation would be good for us or good for the British Commonwealth.  I do not think, as a matter of fact, that there is any very serious danger of any kind of centralised control or centralised <Col N="2011" /> government.  But the danger of imperial councils, other than the Imperial Conference at which the actual Governments come and meet in free consultation, would be if people would believe that they were being governed from some central source&mdash; a belief that would be completely contrary to the facts.</P>
    <P>I think this House should pass this Resolution without any reservation or exception, which would question the motives of the Government in doing so.  I believe they should pass it because they believe it is of value to this country, and for that reason I welcome the fact that the Government has put it before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting the motion.  What I have got to say has rather to do with the details.  The Empire Marketing Board for the last four or five years has given certain grants for research.  These grants have been referred to by Senator Milroy. But the items which have been allowed to this country seem to me not to be of sufficient merit, having regard to the items which were allowed to other countries.  I can very well understand so far as the Empire Marketing Board is concerned that we have no right to demand from them that they should subsidise research work in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer now to the grant to &ldquo;Animal husbandry research, mineral content of the natural pastures for such research and to certain deficiencies in the soil and their effect on the growth of livestock&rdquo;.  That research has been carried out in Aberdeen, and a sum of £10,000 has been given to Edinburgh.  What do we receive?  We receive a grant for the production of strong straw in barley and oats, and also grants for some research work for diseases in potatoes. I contend that this particular research work will now be placed under the agency of the Imperial Agricultural Bureau.  Our representative will go there and he will endeavour to get grants for research work carried out here, research which will have reference particularly to animal husbandry.  While I do not say that <Col N="2012" /> the two items that are being investigated at the moment are not of importance, I believe that the animal industry overshadows entirely the questions which are being investigated. The report says here: &ldquo;We recommend that the Executive Council of the Imperial Agricultural Bureau shall be entrusted with the supervision of the various activities&mdash;such research activities in the United Kingdom as the participating Governments may agree should in future be adopted on a cooperative basis.&rdquo;  It further says that it is not possible to get these particular Governments represented.  In the meantime it says that the Imperial Council of the Agricultural Bureau shall freely submit proposals on the matter.  I believe that we have representatives on the Imperial Agricultural Bureau.  There are eleven members, one from each participating Government. I daresay we have our man there, but the British Isles, or Great Britain and Northern Ireland, have representatives.  There is a representative of the Department of Agriculture in England, there is a representative of the Department of Agriculture in Scotland, and a representative of the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland.  One can very well understand how, in the allotment of grants in the case of any particular award as between the different countries&mdash;in what direction is not material&mdash;they would not be likely to send much in our direction.  I hope when these things are being considered it will be in the mind of our representative to try and get as much of the research carried out in this country as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Connolly) Joseph Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to say very much with regard to this motion. As the President is here himself, I expect that we will have a statement covering most points.  However, I would like to make a few remarks in view of the fact that, first of all, I moved the motion and, secondly, that the moving of that motion by me has called for certain comments from certain Senators.  I would like first of all to suggest to Senator Douglas, as regards his remark about political <Col N="2013" /> consistency, that I do not accept his repudiation of political consistency.  If the suggestion is that it should be applied to me I do not see any justification for apology as regards political consistency.  The position of all of us in the Fianna Fáil Party and Government is quite clearly known to Senator Douglas and to the people of the country.  What is that position?  It is clearly that, with a very definite viewpoint which in no way repudiates anything which we have done in the past, we accepted a system as an inheritance from our predecessors in office and proceeded to operate within that system without any repudiation, as I say, of our definite political aims which involve the ultimate position of this country, and the position that we aspire to as a political party.  I would like Senator Douglas to keep that in mind when he is referring in a rather subtle way to political consistency and political inconsistency.  I would also remind Senator Milroy that the formal moving of a resolution does not necessarily imply that one is 100 per cent. heart and soul with it.  Often a resolution is moved with the deliberate purpose of having certain decisions and certain opinions expressed on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the report itself, I may say frankly that I was at the various conferences when the discussions on this report arose, and in spite of my bad historical background I was not ruled out at those conferences. Nobody at the conferences had any illusions as regards my point of view. It had already been made clear.  I presume Senator Milroy's desire would be that I would take the opportunity of making certain statements on certain issues which did not arise.  That is all I have got to say with regard to the historical background that the Senator refers to.  I can say, I think, with safety that at the inter-Commonwealth conferences at which this report was discussed and at which the decision of the British Government was made known, when it was indicated that the British Government did not propose to go on financing the Imperial Marketing Board, as it was called, there was a considerable amount of opinion, apart from the Irish Free <Col N="2014" /> State, expressed there by the other Dominions. I do not, as I say, wish to go into the other details, which I am quite satisfied the President will deal with, but I would like to make my own point of view, my historical background point of view and my consistency point of view clear to the Seanad lest any misunderstanding should arise with regard to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inevitable that in a discussion on a report of this sort the question of the terms on which co-operation between peoples and between States should be entered upon might be expected.  The co-operation that is indicated in this report is the type of co-operation in which at no time would we have any hesitation in entering, because it is a co-operation based upon the absolute equality of right of the parties, and the freedom of choice of the parties, both to enter and to leave.  Now that is a form of co-operation which is consistent with the dignity of the parties participating.  It is a very different type of thing from forced co-operation. Now the co-operation that is envisaged here is the type of co-operation that, if we saw advantage in it, we would be prepared to have with Denmark, Holland, France, or with any other country.  The special group of countries with which this co-operation is envisaged is a group with which we have come into association as a Government in relation to their Governments because of the position that Senator Connolly has adverted to.  Everybody in the country knows the attitude of this Government.  They know our attitude with respect to the Treaty. We have stated it in official despatches. We have stated it time after time to the people.  Everybody knows that we inherited a certain position; that we said to the people we intended to operate that position and to use it to the fullest extent possible until we went to the people and, if we considered it desirable, asked them to give us liberty to go farther.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I have not changed in my view as regards the type of association that would be consistent with the dignity of this country, with its traditions and <Col N="2015" /> with the desires, I believe, of the vast majority of its people.  But the foundation of any such co-operation must be a clear understanding on the part of the other countries with which we were being associated that we are free agents in the matter; that the choice is ours whether we co-operate or not. Senator Douglas has said that we have the moral and the constitutional right to secede.  Now I would like to have that clearly understood and accepted by the other States with which we are associated at the moment.  The purpose and the intention of my last despatch was, in fact, to get clearly that position defined, but the British Government ran away from it and on every occasion on which that question has been put up straight to them they have burked it.  I think the most astonishing speech that I have ever read, I read in the Press this morning. I am sure it is astonishing to Senator Douglas and even to Senator Milroy.  It is almost to me incomprehensible that a British Cabinet Minister would speak as he spoke, and it is because we have people like Lord Hailsham speaking in one set of terms and people like Senator Douglas speaking in another, that I sent that despatch to the British Government.  It is time, I think, that we should have, using a rough phrase, a show-down upon it.  It is quite time that we should be clear about where we stand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Now Lord Hailsham, in his speech, is guilty of just that type of interference with our constitutional development here which I referred to in my despatch, and which I make bold to say the people of this country are not going to tolerate. Either he has forgotten the Statute of Westminster which Mr. Thomas referred to a day or two ago in his communication to me as the culminating point in the constitutional evolution of the Dominions, or else the Statute of Westminster was a fraud upon the Dominions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lord Hailsham is a lawyer.  When he speaks he speaks as a Minister of the British Government and one would <Col N="2016" /> imagine that he would be careful enough to express exactly what he means.  I take it he expressed the view of the British Government in this matter.  He said for example that there is a long series of legal decisions&mdash;that is in reference to our Act abolishing appeal to the Privy Council&mdash;under which it has been laid down that the right to petition for special leave to appeal to the Privy Council was a right which could not be taken away by an enactment of a Dominion Parliament without the express authority of an Imperial Statute.  Just think of that, two years after the passing of the Statute of Westminister.  And, if you please, he invites the Privy Council to say whether an Act of our Parliament is or is not invalid.</P>
    <P>Now it is too much of a hypothetical question for me to answer and say what would happen if that course were pursued.  But this thing I can say: that if Lord Hailsham's view is right then neither Canada nor South Africa nor any other of the British Dominions could abolish appeal to the Privy Council without coming to the British Parliament.  Is that the position? Perhaps some of you will say these remarks have special reference to our position under the Treaty.  He does not quote it, if that is his view of the Article of the Treaty that he is relying on, but from previous statements made by certain British Ministers we conclude he is referring to Article 2 of the Treaty.  I do not think it is necessary for me to quote for members of the Seanad what Article 2 is, we have referred to it so often in these Constitutional debates.  That, I am sure, is clear to everybody.  The effect of it, at any rate, is that in matters pertaining to relationship to the Crown the position of the Free State is the same as the position of Canada. Is it suggested then that Canada could not, if she wished, pass an Act just like the Act we have passed?  Is there any doubt about its that she could? And we hold that what Canada can do we can do and that is the position from which we are not going to recede.</P>
    <P>Lord Hailsham has not merely forgotten the culminating point that was <Col N="2017" /> referred to in the British Government despatch signed by Mr. Thomas, but he has also clearly forgotten the agreements arrived at in the Conferences of 1929 and 1930.  In these Conferences the legislative sovereignty of the States of the commonwealth was recognised and the only matters upon which it was agreed that any one of them would not legislate without consulting the others was any enactment altering the Succession or the Royal Style and Title.  Except in these matters, on which there was common agreement not to legislate without consultation, it was quite clear that each of the States could pass any measures that they chose and there was no obligation of any kind for consultation in reference to them.  Now in that extraordinary speech Lord Hailsham goes somewhat further.  In a most undignified way he mixes himself up here in our political differences. He applauds the efforts of those who are opposed to us here and hopes that their efforts will be successful. But this I can tell him, and I think I know the Irish people, that he is going just the right way to make any such efforts as he has in mind, any question of co-operation, quite impossible.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil we passed these Constitutional Bills almost unanimously. There was dissent on one occasion on the part of two Deputies.  One of the two gave it as his reason that there was some agreement&mdash;an agreement which nobody knows anything about and about which no one has any record.  I know of none, and nobody to whom I have spoken about it in public has ever been able to point to any such agreement.  There was one case of almost complete unanimity in a House divided by political differences and Parties, as everybody knows.  Here in the Seanad you had practically the same unanimity.  We agreed about this.  Everyone takes the view Senator Douglas took and we insist that the British Government will publish its view upon the matter, and if it does not do that that it will not be able to ride away and have it both ways.  That is the position.  The British Government are trying to have <Col N="2018" /> it both ways.  They want, whether we will it or not, to force us into certain association, and then when we are in it they tell us we are equal partners while they deny us the rights equal partners should have.  It is right that we should know where we stand&mdash;I agree with Senator Milroy to that extent&mdash;that we should know clearly where we stand and that the Irish people should know where they are. And if they think we have a moral right to secede, and a constitutional right to secede, that secession is a matter for us and not a matter of grievance for any one of the States. It is for the Irish people to decide what their association with other countries will be.  They will only decide that question when it is put to them on the ground whether it is to their advantage or their disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas expressed his views. Others of us on such an occasion would express perhaps different views. What we want is to have a situation in which these views can be expressed on the ground whether it is to our advantage to join or not.  I want to be clear about it that if there was to be a joining then let us not be forced to a compulsory joining such as was brought about in 1921.  I do not think it would serve any purpose to go at any further length into this matter.  I would point out to Senator Milroy, who is very anxious to point out inconsistencies, etc., that he should read this report very carefully.  The framework, which he seems to think we are adopting, actually was rejected.  That centralising type of constitution, which he seems to think would be admirable, has been rejected and, therefore, this question of the appointment of a President by a Sovereign, and so on, does not arise.</P>
    <P>The position taken up by our representatives was that we are prepared to co-operate on equal terms.  We are not going to have any centralised secretariat.  We are going separately to meet and decide for ourselves the extent of our co-operation, and that co-operation is to be co-operation by coming together for the purposes as required each time, being free to co-operate or not.  We have decided on <Col N="2019" /> certain co-operation.  The machinery for carrying it out is a simple one and does not involve anything like what Senator Milroy has suggested.  I have pleasure in recommending it.  It is the type of co-operation for which we have always stood.  I will admit that there is a certain point in saying that it is inconsistent to co-operate in one case if you are not prepared to co-operate all round.  It may come to that.  If the attitude of the British Government continues to be what it is, it may come to a situation in which we will have to tell our people definitely that to co-operate even in these cases, as long as there is doubt as to the terms, would involve us in misunderstanding.  That has not come yet.  I hope that the British Government will begin to see a little light on this and to understand that the Irish people are not content to be a slave people; that they are not content to have any dictation from any Government except their own, and then only to the extent to which they have authorised that Government to dictate to them.  I hope that friendly relations will be established.  I am satisfied, and I am sure that every thinking person in this country is equally satisfied, that the only basis for co-operation or for friendly relations, the only basis for lasting peace and friendship, is the basis that we are equals whenever we deal with them, and that we are free to judge for ourselves whether the co-operation proposed is for our advantage or not.</P>

I should like to ask Senator Connolly does he approve of this or does he not?  Incidentally, as I am on my feet, I should like to make it quite clear that I agree in most things with the President in the speech he has made.
