      <P>Schedule.  Paragraph 4.  Before sub-paragraph (b) to insert two new sub-paragraphs as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  that there shall be a managing director of the company, and, subject to the next following subparagraph, the directors of the company shall from time to time appoint one of their body to be managing director of the company;</P>

      <P>I am asking the Seanad to make this recommendation to meet a point of substance which was made, I think, by a number of Senators during the discussion on the Second Reading, when it was pointed out that the managing director was by far the most important member of the Board of the proposed industrial credit company, and that he might, under certain circumstances, be more important than the chairman, if the chairman happened not to be the managing director. Accordingly, I am asking that the Seanad should make this recommendation to the Dáil, so that specific provision should be made for the appointment of managing director and <Col N="700" /> that the first managing director should be appointed by the Minister.  I may say that arising out of the discussion here a provision similar to this has been incorporated in the Sugar Beet Bill which is already before the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise not so much to oppose this recommendation as to query the wisdom of having it before us to-day.  It is rather startling to me to hear that there was any request from this House to the Minister that a recommendation of this kind should be inserted at this stage.  Undoubtedly the managing director will be the man &mdash;the key-man.  I think this is a radical factor in the provisions of this Bill and, for that reason, I suggest that such a proposal as is embodied in this recommendation should have been submitted to the Dáil before it came to this House.  I ask the House to give attention to paragraph (c) of the recommendation (paragraph read).  I do not know if there is within the statutes of the Saorstát a precedent for a recommendation like this.  In one measure which passed through the Oireachtas, the Cork City Management Act, a specific manager was mentioned. We know that that individual was mentioned because of his outstanding qualifications for the position; that he was appointed because, above everything else, he was fitted for the position, and the appointment was not one that could in any way be described as having been made through political or Party influence.  Here an appointment is going to be made of a person who will be the major influence in the handling of £5,000,000 and the appointment is going to be at the discretion of the Minister.  I question if it is wise for this House to confer such power on any Minister, and especially I question the wisdom of the House in inserting this recommendation in this Bill, inasmuch as it has not been submitted to the Dáil and has not received the approval of the Dáil.  We have no evidence of what the disposition of the other House will be to such a recommendation.  I do not want to suggest that there are political motives in this, but I suggest, if there was ever an opportunity for an appointment on political grounds, <Col N="701" /> using a large sum of State money, here you have it.  For that reason, before the House assents to the proposal, I would like to have some more convincing reason given by the Minister than he has put forward in recommending it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>We should remember what sort of Bill we are considering, an Industrial Credit Bill.  As far as I remember its object, there was to be an underwriting company, to provide industrial credit &ldquo;and for the acquisition by the Minister for Finance of share capital of such company and for other purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.&rdquo;  The share capital of this company is to be issued, I take it, to the public.  There was an idea that the Government was to give £15,000 to pay the expenses of formation and that afterwards by Section 4:</P>
      <P>No issue of the share capital of the Company (other than share capital issued to subscribers of the Memorandum of Association of the Company) shall be made at any time, unless the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has authorised such issue.</P>
      <P>I did not understand that the Government intended to stop the issuing of shares in the company to the public. As there was going to be £5,000,000 of State money dealt with by the company I thought the public would probably like to take an interest in it by taking shares.  Now when I read Section 4 and the recommendation on the Order Paper, I see that it practically means that the Minister is going to veto the public coming in and buying shares in the company.  Section 5 states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, subject to such conditions as he may think fit, agree with the Company that, if any shares in the Company about to be offered at any time for subscription are not within a specified time taken up by the public, he will take up and pay for such shares or some specified proportion thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A company which underwrites shares always undertakes to take up any balance not subscribed by the public. <Col N="702" /> Looking at the Government recommendation and at Section 5, it seems as if the intention of the Minister was to make this industrial credit company, to which the Free State is going to give £5,000,000 of capital to be applied to the promotion of various companies, as Senator Milroy stated, a Government controlled company, into which public money cannot go, and in which the Government are going to appoint the directors and the chairman.  In fact, we are establishing not an underwriting company but a Department of the Free State Government.  There is no question whatever about that.  I agree with Senator Milroy that it is a difficult thing for the Seanad to deal with this question, without wishing to interfere in matters in which probably we should not interfere.</P>
    <P>Supposing we do not like it and we divide against it, then we are raising up another quarrel.  If we endorse it and agree with the Minister, we are giving our approval to a scheme of which honestly we do not know the ins and outs.  There has been no discussion or debate here as to whether this Industrial Bill, this Department of Government, for the management of £5,000,000 of Free State money, is a wise thing.  I thought the Bill in its original shape was going through; though we could not put forward amendments, we criticised it.  Individually I did not like it and I thought it a great risk, but it was impossible for the Seanad to oppose it or do anything useful with it.  I doubt if we can give our approval to an amendment which really makes this a new Government Department.  I think Senator Milroy is quite right in his contention.  It is not a question on which the Seanad ought to be asked to vote or be asked to decide.  An amendment of this nature is very serious in a Bill in regard to which we can only make suggestions.  If we knew that the matter had been fully discussed and that the questions which arise in our minds had been dealt with in the Dáil it would be another matter, but it is an astonishing thing that the Seanad should be put in this position and asked to approve of recommendations which, unless several other Senators are going to be as long-winded <Col N="703" /> as I have been, can never really be adequately considered by the Seanad.  We only got these proposals the other day and I think the Seanad ought to hesitate a good while before they pass this recommendation.  I say that without any desire to embarrass the Government.  The manner in which this recommendation has come before the Seanad interferes with the critical examination of a proposal which completely alters the aspect of the whole Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand that the industrial projects that are to be pushed forward under this measure are of a very important character.  It seems to me that they will require to be under the direction of very competent men indeed.  From the amendment put down by the Minister, it would seem to me that he has a doubt himself as to the competence and the wisdom of the men who would be put in charge of these various companies. Surely it should be in their hands, and in their hands alone, to select which one of them should manage such an undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is to be only one company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one company of which there may be a number of subsidiary companies.  Is it not fairly obvious that if you are going to appoint a board of directors, you must leave a great many matters in their hands?  A most important matter I should say would be the appointment of the man who is to be managing director.  If the managing director is forced upon them by the Minister, these people will be able always to tell us if they do not succeed, as we hope they will, that it was not because of their incompetence but that the project fell through because of the gentleman who was put in as managing director on the direction of the Minister.  I think it is a serious position for the Minister himself to take up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the difficulties enumerated by Senator Jameson owing to the fact that the Seanad is asked <Col N="704" /> to approve of this recommendation. Otherwise, this is a Money Bill. Without going too closely into details, I think the Seanad can accept the position that the Government is making an effort to meet what everyone knows is a serious problem in this country, that is, the difficulty of getting Irish investors to put their money into an Irish enterprise.  I have looked at the recommendations, and I am not at all certain that the Minister is not making a serious mistake in this recommendation.  If there is going to be any smooth working in a company of this kind, it is, to my mind, essential that the exact relations between the managing director and the directors should be beyond question.  If I read this recommendation aright, the Minister is not only to nominate the managing director, whether the directors like it or not, but he is also to lay down his terms of office and the conditions of his employment.  What is the position going to be then?  Who is really to control the investments which this company is to undertake?  For the sake of argument, we will assume that the Minister in the first instance does not get the majority of the shares subscribed for by the public.  I do not say that would be the case but there is a possibility that it may be so.  In that case, the Minister of course will have control.  How is he going to exercise that control?  He will have that control even apart from the special powers given to him in this Bill.  How is he going to exercise it? Is he to exercise it directly himself or is he to exercise it in the same way as any other shareholder or group of shareholders would exercise control of the company&mdash;by the removal of the directors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that it would be better either to make this a Government Department, for which the Minister would be directly responsible&mdash;I mean better from the point of view of making it work&mdash;or adopt the other plan of making the managing director responsible.  Let us say that the directors meet once a week to consider the matters that normally come before them.  They are in the <Col N="705" /> position that the terms and the conditions of office of the person who is to be managing director and over whom nominally they have control, have been fixed by a person whom they cannot obviously control.  It seems to me that they will have very little control in these circumstances. It is obvious that with the powers which are given him in this Bill, apart from the powers which he would have if he has the majority of the shares, the Minister will have the whole say in the nomination of these directors.  I would suggest to the Minister that he is not only putting the directors in an almost impossible position but he is putting himself in an extremely difficult position by taking the powers proposed in the recommendation.  I did not intend to speak on this Bill at all until this recommendation came along and, in speaking now, I am only putting up certain difficulties to the Minister.  If the Government are quite satisfied that this is the way they are going to manage the company I, for my part, am not going to do anything that would wreck the scheme that they have in their mind.</P>
    <P>Closely connected with the proposals in the recommendation lies the question as to the exact functions of the company in relation to the other companies in which it will have investments. This company may either directly provide portion of the capital or provide all the capital of the other industries in regard to which its function will be to provide shares. It may propose to underwrite them, which I think in most cases would be the better course, in order to get the public to take up the shares, say either in the cement industry, in the sugar beet industry or in other industries.  Supposing the Minister has 51 per cent. of the shares in the cement or sugar beet industry&mdash;I mention these only as instances&mdash;what exactly is his position?  Has he each year to nominate the directors of these particular concerns or is he definitely excluded from these functions?  It is well known, I think, that the banks are very reluctant indeed to accept responsibility for the exact management <Col N="706" /> of concerns of which through force of circumstances they may get control.  Is this board to have the function of nominating directors for the other companies of which it finds itself in control after taking up the shares?  That would be again a matter which will come to a large extent within the scope of the managing director&mdash;to find suitable persons as directors.  I can see room for a very serious difference of opinion between the managing director and the directors on a matter of that kind. I am perfectly certain that, as Senator Crosbie says, any managing director will try to find the most competent persons he can, but there is a possibility that a really serious difference of opinion may arise between the managing director and the directors on this question.  The managing director, who derives all his powers directly from the Minister, will presumably, in the case of difficulty, come back to the Minister and the Minister will find himself in the position that he will have directly to control both this company and the other companies which were financed.  I do not want to paint too black a picture, but I am putting it to the Minister that if a really serious difficulty like that should arise he would be better out of it unless he takes this over as a Government Department and manages it as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do not understand the opposition of Senator Jameson and Senator Douglas to the proposal contained in this recommendation. The Bill provides for the expenditure of £15,000 of public money to form a company of which the capital shall be £5,000,000.  That may be £5,000,000 of State money.  Is it unreasonable that the Minister who represents the public should appoint the first managing director?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unreasonable!  I wonder when the question of the Electricity Supply Board was before the Dáil and the Seanad whether my friend was of the same opinion?  Here is public money.  Is there to be no control of public money?  Is the <Col N="707" /> managing director of that company, which may have £5,000,000 of public money, not to be a person having the confidence of the Minister who is the person who has the confidence of the public?  I think that position is unreasonable.  I think Senator Douglas, if he has any real opposition to this, as distinct from a factious opposition, which I never attribute to him, should state it plainly, because to the ordinary person where a question of £5,000,000 of public money is concerned, surely it seems the Minister ought to have a voice in the first appointment of the managing director of that company?  I can assure Senator Douglas that this recommendation may have the effect of inducing a greater number of the public to subscribe.  I would suggest to the Seanad that it is a reasonable recommendation and a reasonable precaution where public money is involved.  I do not question what Senator Douglas and Senator Jameson say about the advisability or otherwise of the State taking an interest in enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to be necessary at the beginning of an industrial period.  I do not hope and I do not desire that we should become a highly industrialised country, but I think that a little stimulus to industry is necessary, and I think that, to the extent of £5,000,000, we ought to go, but if the £5,000,000 of public money is to go in the stimulation of industries, I think it ought to be looked after by some person who is in the confidence of the Minister.  Senator Douglas asks &ldquo;what about these subsidiary companies?&rdquo; If these subsidiary companies are to get money from this central parent association, surely the parent association ought to have control corresponding to the amount of money which it puts into concerns that <i>ex hypothesi</i> are not going well.  The Bill does not deal with that, but I hope that with the administration of this measure, in these subsidiary companies, which get money from the parent company, there will be a certain amount of control following the investment of the capital in these companies. I see nothing at all wrong with this <Col N="708" /> recommendation.  I think it is necessary to perfect the plan of the measure as it has come before this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not usually interfere in these questions where high finance is concerned, but it appears to me as an ordinary individual that the Minister is asking for a little too much in this recommendation.  I do not at all agree with the remarks of Senator Milroy on this matter.  There is no question of a person being mentioned in this, and I think the reference to the name of the individual who was to be the first city manager in Cork has nothing whatever to do with the matters contained in this recommendation. It seems to me that the Government seek to have this Bill passed for the purpose of setting up this Industrial Credit Corporation; that the Government are guaranteeing £15,000 as preliminary expenses for the flotation of the company, and that they propose that if the share capital is not taken up by the public, they will underwrite it and take the share capital themselves.  If the public do not subscribe and take the share capital, the Minister has power to appoint a managing director or directors under any condition he likes if he holds the majority of the shares, but if the public subscribe and if they hold the majority of the shares, it is not fair to say that the Minister is entitled to appoint a managing director for life.  It says &ldquo;the first managing director&rdquo; but the sting is in the tail of the paragraph which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>.... and shall hold the office of managing director for such period, on such terms and subject to such conditions as the Minister may direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may appoint this managing director for 30 years.  As I say, I do not usually interfere, but what made me intervene was the objection that was made that this matter was brought forward in the Seanad and not in the Dáil.  If we are going to admit that, there is justification for the introduction by the Government of the Bill which they introduced a few weeks ago.  I hold <Col N="709" /> that we are entitled to express an opinion on matters of vital importance, irrespective of whether the Dáil has considered them or not.  This recommendation ought not to be negatived just because it was not considered in the Dáil.  It ought to be considered on its merits and, if the House thinks fit, sent forward to the Dáil for its consideration. I think the Minister is asking a little too much.  I personally believe that the Government have in mind the possibility that they will have to underwrite these shares themselves and that it will practically be the company run on State funds.  If that is so, the responsible Minister is entitled to appoint the managing director under such conditions.</P>

      <P>It is not what the Minister is likely to do that we ought to consider, but what the Minister has power to do if this Bill becomes law, and I am certainly astonished to hear a lawyer say that he is not likely to do that.  If the public subscribe the bulk of the shares for this company, the Minister is not entitled to this.  He is, I think, entitled to suggest the appointment of the first managing director, but he is not entitled to the whole of it, and if he stopped at the word &ldquo;appoint&rdquo; and left out the rest of it, it would be reasonable.  I have no concern with it other than this, that judging by the directors I have met from several companies, it is only fair to say that I am perfectly satisfied that the Minister, if he is appointing the managing director, will appoint one as good as any that have been appointed.  I do not mean that for the present Government.</P>

      <P>The situation which arises out of this Government recommendation is a peculiar one, and I do not know that we have any precedent for it in this House, but, in connection with it, I should like to remind some of the speakers, including the last two Senators, that there are many of us in this House who are not entirely without experience in matters of this kind, and we are horrified at the prospect of State trading which is opened up by this Bill.  It is impossible to make a speech on that subject without going over ground already covered by countless works on the subject and a great many speeches in this House, and I do not propose to do so, but what I do say is that those of us who hold that view profoundly resent having to take any responsibility for a Bill of this kind, and we are perfectly justified in taking that attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been quite interested in the speeches made on this recommendation.  Senator Milroy and other Senators, if we are to judge by their statements and suggestions, seem to be of the opinion that the present Government are going to remain in office for at least 50 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a great change about for some of the men who are making those statements but, in any case, it would appear to me that the insertion of this recommendation would influence people to freer investment in this proposition.  When the Bill was first introduced and during the various debates here, it was pointed out that the idea of the Bill was to make capital available for certain purposes and it was admitted, I think, by Senator Sir John Keane that there was plenty of money in the country but that the difficulty was that people were not inclined to invest it in Irish industries for various reasons.  In my opinion, the insertion of this recommendation will be an inducement to people to invest. It will do away with that uncertainty which has caused this lack of investment in Irish industries by people who hold money in this country and who hold a good share of it.  It is ridiculous <Col N="711" /> to state, as has been stated here, that the Minister may allow this condition of things to endure for a period of 50 years.  Anybody knows that, regardless of what Party is in power, the Minister is responsible to the people and has to answer for his actions to the Dáil and that no responsible Minister would adopt the attitude that it must endure for such a period.  This, I believe, is quite a reasonable recommendation and one which will add considerably to the working of the Bill as a whole.  I believe it will induce people to invest their money because they will have the assurance of having at least a competent managing director.  As so many people, however, seem to be worrying about the length of time this Government are going to stay in power and as to whether it will be 50 years or ten years&mdash;for myself, I believe it will be 50 years&mdash;I am sure the Minister would agree to appoint the first managing director for a shorter period, say, three years.  I am sure that would meet with the approval of the House and I would recommend that the House agree with such a recommendation if the Minister were agreeable to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I half seriously suggested, on the last occasion, that Senator Jameson, in his opposition to the Second Reading, had really in mind that private corporations would take up the whole of the shares in this company because of its almost certain success as a dividend earning institution. I am not quite so sure now whether that ought not to be treated quite seriously because I see that the Articles of Association set out in the Schedule already provide that the Minister, so long as he holds not less than half of the nominal value of the shares, shall appoint the majority of the directors.  There is no question in that statement up to now of a managing director but if they have a majority of the directors, I suppose they could appoint a managing director without it being in the Articles of Association.</P>

That being the position of a company of which a majority of the directors were appointed by the Minister, it would suggest itself to me that the fact that the Minister is going to appoint the first managing director would leave the appointed directors in a freer position than they would otherwise be, that is to say, the Minister is going to appoint four of the seven directors and if there is no such provision in the Bill and if he feels it important that there ought to be a managing director, he can use what influence he has in making the appointment of the four directors to ensure that they shall appoint a managing director.  Is it not better that the managing director is to be appointed at the instigation of the Minister by the action of this Bill rather than by the influence he might bring to bear on the appointees?  If that is feasible at all, and I think it is, the question resolves itself into a question of the conditions of the appointment which are referred to in the latter part of this paragraph (c).  I think the Minister is asking too much power. Even though it were assumed that the Minister will always hold a majority of shares, I do not think he should take power to appoint the managing director for such period as he wishes &ldquo;on such terms&rdquo; as he wishes and &ldquo;subject to such conditions&rdquo; as the Minister may direct, such a provision to be inserted in the Articles of Association <Col N="713" /> of a company which ostensibly is going to be somewhat free from Ministerial authority.  I think it is too far-reaching in the circumstances unless we have the whole of the Articles of Association before us.  Not having the Articles of Association before us completely, I think the Minister should not ask for these detailed powers, while I agree that he should have the right to appoint the managing director, whether he has a majority of the shares or not, for the first period of the company's existence.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that in introducing this amendment I left the House, possibly, without as full information as may have been desirable.  I would like to get back to Senator Jameson's speech because it went to the root of the whole matter.  He pointed out that under Section 3 the Minister is to provide £15,000 for the formation of the company: that that money is to be provided by way of loan and is ultimately to be repaid to the Exchequer, and that there is no other primary commitment in the Bill beyond the contingent liability of having to underwrite such issues as may from time to time be sanctioned under Section 4 by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Now what is the conclusion to be drawn from that? It is this: that the Government has no desire that its commitments in respect of this company should at any time exceed the £15,000 which it is lending in the first instance.  It is anxious that, so far as possible, the issues of the company will be fully taken up by the public, and it has to take all the measures which in its opinion are best devised to secure that end.  The Minister is charged under Section 2 with the formation and the registration of the company.  That means that he must draw up the prospectus.  In doing that and in issuing it he has to place before the general public in the first instance, before any money has been subscribed by the general public to this <Col N="714" /> company, a board which will secure public confidence and attract public money.  I said that the importance of the post of managing director had been stressed by a number of Senators including I think Senator Jameson during the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill.  It has been stressed here to-day.  It has been pointed out that this is the most important appointment that can be made, and that upon the personality of the individual who fills the post, his reputation and experience as a businessman, will depend the success or failure of the public issue which it is anticipated the company will make shortly after it is formed.</P>
      <P>I have said that the Minister is charged with the formation of the company.  He has to submit his proposals to the public in detail.  He has to show the public that the company is going to be provided with a competent managing director, and how can the Minister do that unless he is empowered under the Bill to enter into negotiations with such person or persons as he thinks will have the necessary qualifications to fill this post?  I have no individual in my mind for it at the moment.  I do think that it is going to be a very difficult post to fill, and that I may have to cast my net very wide.  I shall certainly have to go and ask some person who at present is occupying an important position in the business world either here in Ireland or elsewhere.  I cannot go to him unless I am in a position to enter into a definite and specific agreement with him for a term of years, an agreement which would provide, amongst other things, that he was to be paid a definite salary, that in the event of the board of the company deciding to dispense with his services at any time before the expiration of the period for which he was engaged he would secure adequate compensation &mdash;such a sum as would compensate him for the loss of position which we may have to ask him to resign in order to take an appointment with this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear from what I have said that the responsibility for finding this managing director will, in the <Col N="715" /> first instance, rest upon the Minister who is charged with the formation of a company.  I think myself it is doubtful whether I should have power to take that essential and necessary step for the formation of the company unless this recommendation were made by the Seanad and were inserted by the Dáil in the Bill when it goes back to the Dáil.  That is the whole position, and that is the justification for the recommendation.  On the question of the period, I would be prepared to accept a reasonable amendment in regard to that, but &ldquo;on such terms and subject to such conditions,&rdquo; I do not think it would be possible for us to draw up any form of words that would cover every contingency and every point that might arise during the negotiations. Again, I would like to say that the one purpose of the recommendation is to ensure that when an appeal is made to the public it will be clear that there will be a competent person in control of the management of this company.  It is not with any ulterior motive, or any motive beyond that, that I am asking the Seanad to make this recommendation to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be desirable for me to deal with the points which were raised by Senator Milroy: that it was unfair to the Seanad to ask them to do this.  I think that has been very effectively dealt with by Senator Farren.  After all, it seems to me that in giving the Seanad the opportunity first of considering this recommendation in an atmosphere which does not prevail elsewhere, I am endeavouring to utilise to the full extent of its capacity the powers the Seanad has, and I do not think that it should be regarded as in any way a slight or a reflection on this House that I should ask them in the first instance to consider this matter. I have told the Seanad exactly why this recommendation has been considered necessary by my advisers if I am going to appeal effectively to the public to subscribe for the shares of this company when it is floated. I do not know that it is necessary for <Col N="716" /> me to say any more.  I only ask the Seanad to decide the question on its merits.  Should it happen that it does not meet with your acceptance, we may have to find some other way to do this thing than this plain straightforward way which I am asking the House now to give me power to do it.  We may have to have a certain amount of intrigue and hugger-mugger, such as Senator Johnson referred to, which I, personally, have a great distaste for, and in which I would not like to be involved.</P>

      <P>There is just one point that I would like to put to the Minister. The Minister has power under the Bill to appoint the chairman of the directors.  The recommendation that we are discussing concerns the position of managing director.  Could not the powers which the Minister is taking under the Bill in regard to the chairman be transferred, so to speak, to apply to the position of the managing director?  I gathered from the Minister's speech that the reason why he thinks that cannot be done is that he may have to go outside for the managing director and he wants to be in a position to offer attractive terms.  Before the Minister says his last word on this I would like him to tell us what is the great point as regards the managing director, and this power of appointing him for such a long period?</P>

      <P>There were one or two points raised by a number of Senators on the Second Stage of the Bill, and I promised if I could to have some information to give them on the concluding stages of the Bill.  The first of them was, I think, raised by Senator MacLoughlin as to the present position of the Foyle fisheries as to which he said, amongst other things, that the Government were doing nothing in the matter.  The Minister for External Affairs is not able to be here, but he has instructed me to say that there is no foundation for the statements; that the Government, on the contrary, have had this matter of the protection of the Foyle fishermen under consideration, particularly within the last 12 months, and that the point of view of the Saorstát in regard to it is being pressed as strongly as possible. Senator MacLoughlin also referred to the question of a flour licence.  I have consulted with the Minister for Industry and Commerce on that matter, and he asked me to assure the Seanad that there was no foundation for the allegations of the Senator in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell raised a considerable number of points in connection with the broadcasting service in which he asked whether the sum of £43,350, which is the amount of the estimate for wireless broadcasting for 1933-4, <Col N="719" /> covers the salaries and operation of the stations and programmes, and whether, in addition to the revenue from the wireless licences and the tax on wireless apparatus, there was any other revenue.  The position in regard to that is that the total cost of the service is the £43,350 which appears on the Estimate, and that, as against that, we have estimated receipts from wireless licences of about £20,000; from advertising programmes about £18,000; and from customs tax on apparatus, £50,000, I should like to say in that connection that the tax on wireless apparatus is a customs tax imposed for the needs of the general revenue and it is not appropriated in full for broadcasting.  In fact, it has been quite clearly pointed out to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs that the Minister for Finance anticipates that the wireless broadcasting service will become a self-supporting one, and that, in time, it will derive its maintenance entirely from the receipts from wireless licences and from advertising programmes, and that more and more of the receipts from the import duties will be allocated to the general purposes of the revenue.  The Senator also asked whether the Broadcasting Advisory Committee had been abolished.  It has not been abolished.  But the statutory term of the membership of the committee is, I think, two years.  That term has just run out and the Minister has deferred making further appointments until he has time to consider the general constitution of the committee. It is anticipated that that constitution will be amended and that a new committee will shortly be formed.</P>
    <P>Some adverse criticism was made also, I think, by Senator O'Farrell with regard to the broadcasting station orchestra.  The station has an orchestra of nineteen members, which costs approximately £5,000 per annum.  I do not ask the Seanad to take my judgment as being worth anything in the matter, but I am informed that it is a first-class combination and that it is adequate for the general requirements of the programmes, particularly as it is from time to time augmented to symphony orchestral strength for <Col N="720" /> special programmes.  However, considering, as I have said, that the revenue which is derived from the broadcasting service this year under the normal categories is estimated not to exceed £38,000, I think that the amount which we are spending at present on the orchestra represents practically our limit under existing circumstances. If the revenue from wireless licences increases, or if the advertising programmes are continued and are developed, it may be possible to increase the orchestra.  But at present it is felt that the expenditure of about £5,000 is all that is warranted.  The question of adding an organ in addition to the orchestra is under consideration.</P>
    <P>As to the sponsored programmes, these have been introduced in order to derive additional revenue for broadcasting, particularly in view of providing more money for general programmes. As I have already pointed out, we feel in the Department of Finance that this service should be a self-supporting one; that its revenue should be mainly derived from wireless licences or, if that be inadequate, it has to be made up in some other form; that we cannot continue to subsidise it, as we have up to the present, out of the public funds; that it must justify itself, and that, so far as there is any customs revenue derived from the import duty upon wireless apparatus, that has got to be reserved for the general purposes of the Exchequer and for the benefit of the taxpayer generally and not particularly for the small section who may be interested in wireless reception.  On the question of the sponsored programmes, out of a six-hour programme daily only one hour is given to the sponsored programme, so that the station programme occupies five hours per day.  Except for the Hospitals' Trust programmes, for which foreign bands and artistes are occasionally engaged, in all other sponsored programmes local bands, orchestras and artistes are almost exclusively retained.  The artistes in these programmes, moreover, are for the most part artistes who would at other times be employed on the official programmes and, therefore, to that extent their employment on sponsored <Col N="721" /> programmes represents a certain saving on the general expenditure of the station.</P>
    <P>I know that there is a fairly general complaint that there is a certain sameness and monotony about the programmes which are broadcast, due primarily, I think, to the repeated appearance of the same artistes.  That, however, is due entirely to the relative scarcity of local talent with satisfactory qualifications for broadcasting. We are a comparatively small community, and it is difficult to find a sufficient number of artistes to give a great variety of programmes within it.  This is particularly true in regard to the Irish items in the programmes, owing to the comparatively small quantity of Irish music which has been published for orchestral performance, so that the Irish side of the musical programmes is largely confined to violin and pipe music and, even on these particular instruments, the number of artistes who would be competent to perform and who are procurable is extremely limited.</P>
    <P>As to the question of the news service, it is largely governed by the same considerations as affect the question of the orchestral side of the programme.  The cost of providing an extensive news service would be a prohibitive one and the position is complicated by the difficulty of the organisation and publication of news matters.  I understand, however, from the Minister that the question of the news supply has been under consideration for some time and that everything possible has been done to improve it.  On the question of the nature and scope of the news broadcast, it will be understood, I think, by most Senators that the officials responsible for this side of the programme are placed in a position of difficulty and some delicacy as they must use a careful discretion with regard to the items included and the manner in which they are presented. Very stringent instructions have been issued to these particular officials to avoid discrimination of any kind in favour of any interest or any party in the drafting of the news bulletin. It will be understood that broadcast <Col N="722" /> news must be presented in a very summarised form and that only the essential points and matters of fact, without qualification or comment of any kind, can be included.  But the correspondents who supply this news to the station and those who are responsible for its editing there find themselves faced with the great difficulty of selection.  I think Senators will agree with me that it is impossible, for instance, to present all the aspects and details of general news or of a Parliamentary debate in such a way as would give to the general public a fair representation of everything that took place.  But, notwithstanding that, every possible care and precaution are taken to ensure against giving any implication of bias or favour or discrimination in the selection of news.  I am asked by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to say that there is no foundation whatsoever for any suggestion that the broadcast news is used in any way for propaganda or Party purposes. I should like to repeat again that officials who are responsible for this service are in a very difficult and delicate position.</P>
    <P>I am not at all questioning criticism of the kind which Senator O'Farrell made himself responsible for, and quite fairly&mdash;I am glad he has given me this opportunity to make a statement&mdash;but, it seems to me, the only way in which we could avoid any possibility of criticism of that kind, ascribing bias to the News Bulletin, and the news service generally, would be to do away with it.  We are compelled to take general news and to put it before the public, I am quite certain, without many important points.  Arguments in favour of one side or another of a question must be lost sight of or suppressed.  It is not possible, as the time will not permit, to give a full disquisition on matters under consideration in the Seanad or by the Oireachtas, or when treating, say, a speech in the country by a Minister or by any other person who might not be a Minister.  It would be quite impossible in the three or four minutes at the disposal of the broadcasting people to give either the arguments <Col N="723" /> for or against, and the attitude taken up by one of the parties to a controversy.  I do not think there are any other points calling for comment. These were the main criticisms of the Appropriation Bill.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill I intended to deal with the teaching of agriculture in the national schools.  I am taking this opportunity to do so, and to ask the Minister to convey my remarks and the feeling of this House on this question to the Minister for Education.  I am not sure if it was the case in the city schools, but in my young days in a national school agriculture was taught. It has been discarded for some reason that I am not aware of, and in its place have been substituted nature study or other subjects dealing with agriculture, which are not as good.  We have very useful text-books on agriculture, and it would be all to the good if the Minister could provide in the programme of national schools that there should be lessons on agriculture, and that these text-books be studied, at least in the rural districts.  If it is the feeling of the House I would be glad if the Minister would convey my remarks to the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with another point in connection with the Report of the Department of Agriculture.  I do not think sufficient attention is given to research work, even to simple research work.  I have had many complaints that a cure does not seem to have been found for simple diseases in pigs, such as swine erysipelas, swine fever, and how to inoculate pigs against these diseases.  This is a very important matter, and sufficient attention does not appear to be paid to it.  Great loss is occasioned to pig-breeders and others by erysipelas.  Some attempt should be made to find a cure for that complaint by the Veterinary College and the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>In the discretion of the Chair Senator Counihan was allowed to deal with the question of teaching agriculture in national schools.  The Senator's statement was useful, and with great respect, was the most useful statement made for a considerable time in this House.  Agriculture should be taught, and the pupils in a national school should be made to feel that it is a noble profession, the principal profession in this country.  When I was at a national school, I had a standard book, &ldquo;Baldwin's Practical Farmer,&rdquo; which gave me information which has enabled me on many occasions to encounter my friends.  The principal part of the book was devoted to the selection of breeds of cattle for milk and for beef.  Another portion was devoted to the cultivation and the fertilisation of the soil, most useful things for farmers and their sons to know, and much more useful than many of the subjects which they are required to know under the present curriculum.  It may be of interest to the House to learn that the people of Manchuria or Manchukuo are better agriculturists than we are.  They know more about the cultivation of the soil than we do, although they are supposed to be a benighted people.  We seem as a nation to be interested in everything except the main thing.  I believe in Ireland agriculture is number one.  I hope it will for ever remain our first care, and that agricultural science, as far as it can be taught, will be taught in national schools.  I believe that subject was abandoned about 25 years ago, much to the detriment of this country, and that boys and girls were encouraged to believe that agriculture was of secondary importance, to be left only to the stupid son of a family.  The clever boy was sent to a clerkship where he had a miserable career.  The stupid son of the family was supposed to be the man upon whom the main industry of this <Col N="725" /> country was to rest.  An end should be put to that.  I hope the Minister will take a note of what Senator Counihan has said.  I do not very often agree with Senator Counihan on minor matters, but this is a vital question in which I absolutely agree with him.</P>
      <P>In regard to the research work of the Department of Agriculture, I agree with Senator Counihan that more money should be devoted to research, and to the collection of the knowledge which farmers possess in the various counties.  I only acquired some of that knowledge a short time ago.  It appears that it would be desirable to have a horse chestnut tree on every farm.  The reason is curious, the flies will not go near it, so it is a haven of refuge for the cattle.  I wonder if Senator Counihan knows that.  I hope the Department of Agriculture may be informed of it.  I am sure Senator Miss Browne knows about it.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture have spent a lot of money on experiments from time to time, as to the value of fertilisers.  Their experiments have cost a lot of money both to the Department and to individuals.  They have cost me a lot of money.  The basis of their experiments is the solubility of the various fertilisers.  For instance, ground phosphate they put against super-phosphate.  They put 5 cwt. of super-phospate against 2½ cwt. of ground phosphate, which costs just quarter as much as the super-phosphate.  They solemnly give us returns of the results, not alone for one year, but for a series of ten or fifteen years, during which they have carried on the same absurd experiments. I hope there will be research work carried on by the Department of Agriculture, but I hope it will be intelligent research, because the work of this Department is probably the most important work of the Government. I am very glad to have the opportunity of supporting Senator Counihan.  It is not often I have such an opportunity, but on this question I thoroughly agree with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators seem to forget that the teaching of rural science <Col N="726" /> has been substituted long since in schools for the teaching of agriculture. It is generally recognised, by those most conversant with the position, that the programme of the national schools is, at present, so overcrowded that it would be impossible to teach agriculture effectively.  In the old days, to which Senators referred, I remember that agriculture was taught in theory, but there was nothing in the way of practice, for the simple reason that plots were not available. The teaching of a subject like agriculture by theory, in the absence of practical demonstrations, has been proved to be very ineffective.  The programme in the elementary schools is so over-crowded that there is no place for that subject.  Provision is made to give the teaching in rural schools an agricultural bias, in the books, in lessons and in lectures. Under the new vocational education scheme ample provision is made for the teaching of agriculture to pupils between 14 and 16 years of age.  These vocational schools are only a short time in existence.  They are established in many counties and are doing effective work.  The one drawback is that the farmers' sons and daughters will not attend the classes. Very efficient work is being done by the Committees of Agriculture in the vocational schools in the rural areas but, strange to relate when agriculture is looked to as the one industry on which we could fall back, these schools are not as well attended as they might be.  The average attendance is ten or 12 pupils in intensely rural localities.  Until the sons and daughters of farmers accept a bias for rural life I think agriculture will not develop.  There is ample provision made for the teaching of agriculture in a practical way and also for helping the dairy industry and giving poultry instruction.  That is valuable work, which these classes are capable of doing, but, until some measure of compulsion is exercised over boys and girls who are roaming the streets, spending their time in picture houses and in other frivolous amusements, progress will not be made.  In Germany, Denmark and other intensely <Col N="727" /> agricultural countries the pupils have to attend these classes until they are 21 years of age.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senators have been gratified by the mood of accommodation and the inclination to listen to reason which the Minister has exhibited in connection with the matter which we have just disposed of.  I hope the same mood will animate the Minister in considering this recommendation.  It was only by an oversight that I did not table this recommendation on the Committee Stage when, possibly, it might be more appropriately considered.  It is, however, better late than never, and I hope the Minister will not resist its acceptance.  It is a recommendation based upon the ideas embodied in the concluding remarks I made on the Second Stage of the Bill, that it is important that the Executive and the Legislature of this State shall be above suspicion in matters such as those with which the Bill deals.  Certain questions have been raised as to the propriety of the procedure that is <Col N="730" /> proposed in this Bill for the repayment of certain moneys.  It has been suggested that behind this Bill is the desire or the wish of the Executive Council to utilise their power to manoeuvre State funds from the State Exchequer into the coffers of a Party organ.  I think, sir, that no matter to what Party one belongs&mdash;and I certainly am not raising this from a Party point of view&mdash;once that suggestion is made everything possible should be done to secure that there will be no basis upon which such a charge can be established.  If this Bill passes without some such recommendation as this, I am afraid there will be in the public mind a misgiving that such procedure as I have suggested is undesirable has been indulged in.  I do not want to block the operation of this Bill in regard to its effectiveness in paying back money to the subscribers who, the Minister for Finance stated in the Dáil, are in dire need of the funds.  I want to facilitate that procedure.  I want to facilitate the repayment of these moneys, if the Minister feels that this is the time and that the State can afford these payments.  It is difficult I know to accept his assurance that this is the best time to indulge in such expenditure in view of certain other circumstances he has disclosed to the Oireachtas.  He, however, assures us that this is the time and that we can afford it.  If that is so I want to put no impediment in the way of these moneys being paid as soon as possible to the people who subscribed the money.</P>
    <P>I am also interested in this recommendation to secure that there will be no impediment in the Bill which will prevent the transmission of these moneys to the people who are justly entitled to them.  If I might just allude to the suggestion that has been made that one of the driving forces behind the Bill is that certain funds shall go into the coffers of a certain Party organ, I say I am reluctant to believe that is so, but I cannot acquit the Executive Council of being above the ordinary frailties of human nature and of being politicians who were politicians before they became statesmen. I do not know if they have yet <Col N="731" /> reached that high altitude in the evolution of human beings as to be above such failings, but viewing this matter from the lowest and basest consideration, that they really do want the Bill through in order to enrich the depleted exchequer of their Party organ, there is nothing in the recommendation that will prevent that, assuming that the people who made these transfers to the President of the Executive Council are still prepared to retransfer their moneys.  If the Minister wants to secure these moneys without giving these people an opportunity of saying whether they will transfer them to the coffers or the resources of that organ, then it is clear proof to me that he does not want to give these people a chance of reconsidering how they will dispose of the money.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the recommendation that, as far as I can see, should be resisted or that gives the Minister any grounds for resisting it.  There is every reason, I think, for its acceptance in order to eliminate from the atmosphere that has been engendered by the discussion on the Bill the suspicion that people in Executive authority are using that Executive authority for Party purposes in a direction which is most undesirable&mdash;I mean the direction of finance&mdash;I have not put forward the recommendation as a Party matter.  I have sole responsibility for it.  I have put it forward with the desire of assisting the Minister, if possible, in securing that this Bill, when it becomes an Act, shall leave the Oireachtas free from any taint whatever of the suspicious aspect that has been thrown around it during its passage through the Oireachtas.  I hope the Minister will meet this recommendation in the spirit in which I am trying to put it forward, that is, a non-Party spirit, and with the desire to make this Bill one that this Oireachtas can stand over without any shade of regret.</P>

      <P>I second the recommendation, and I should like to say that, like Senator Milroy, I regard national honour as coming before Party advantage.  If we wished to bring forward something that would damage the present Government, we could have thought of nothing that would damage them to anything like the extent that this collaring of £100,000, this manoeuvring to get £100,000 into a Party enterprise, damages them.  This is something that we all feel ashamed of, although we know that nothing we could do as a Party would damage the Fianna Fáil Government.  Still, I should like to see that out, because I regard national honour as greater than any advantage that this Bill could give the Party I belong to.  I support Senator Milroy on that account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear Senator Milroy say that he is not bringing forward this motion as a Party motion. He said he would have brought the motion forward on the Committee Stage if it had not been for an oversight. I quite accept that, but I should have expected that Senator Milroy would have been satisfied with the clear and ample statement in respect of these loans which was made by the Minister on the last occasion.  What was it that emerged in the course of that discussion? It was that, in December of last year, the American Minister, as representing his nationals, demanded payment of the money due in respect of these bonds.  Senator Milroy, on that occasion, said that he accepted that letter as a genuine demand, and not alone was it a demand for the payment of the money, but it was a reminder that other demands had been made throughout a period of two years.  It was an urgent demand made by that great American people for payment of a debt due to them from this country.  They have made demands on other countries&mdash;on Great Britain, France, Italy and Finland and the various countries of Central Europe&mdash; and I am glad to say that we are going to pay the American people to the last shilling.  We are not going to default; <Col N="733" /> we are not going to make a token payment. We are an honest people, and we are going to pay the Americans the amount that is due to them.  That is the position so far as the main portion of the debt is concerned.  It so happens that a certain amount of that money, a certain number of these bonds, were assigned three or four years ago to Mr. de Valera, but not as representing a Party, and it is there that Senator Milroy is wrong.  This newspaper is not a Party paper.  Mr. de Valera got the assignment of a certain number of bonds.  The people in this country who subscribed to the newspaper company subscribed their money on the true representation that a number of the American bondholders had also agreed to put their money into the enterprise.  It is a great enterprise, I think, it is the largest enterprise started in Ireland in the last four or five years.  It employs 300 or 400 people.  Senator Milroy made the point that, in the first year of its trading as a newspaper, there was an apparent loss of £40,000 or £50,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>That loss was not unreasonable having regard to the way in which newspapers have to spend money in establishing themselves.  The Irish subscribers subscribed with the knowledge that a certain number of Americans had assigned their bonds for the purpose of having the money applied to this industry.  They subscribed their money on the faith of that.  What does Senator Milroy propose?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Milroy is a very able man and a great lawyer although not a professional lawyer.  He says that he has no statutory evidence of that, but all the people who subscribed money to that paper were aware that a number of the American bondholders had assigned their money for the purpose of establishing this paper. Now, Senator Milroy says, as proof of good faith, that the Executive of this country should deprive the shareholders in this paper of the security <Col N="734" /> which they had under the assignment to Mr. de Valera of some of these bonds&mdash;I do not know what the amount is.  Here is what he asks:&mdash;</P>
      <P>.... no assignee or person claiming to act under a power of attorney shall be entitled to claim or to be paid any sum or security under this Act.</P>
      <P>I ask Senator Milroy whether that would not be a great injustice to the Irish subscribers.</P>

      <P>I am not a subscriber to this paper.  I am not personally concerned, but if I had subscribed £100 or £200, with the knowledge that the American bondholders were to subscribe £50,000, £60,000 or £70,000, I would certainly feel that I was very unfairly dealt with if that money was now withheld in order to satisfy the sentiment which Senator Milroy has expressed.  I think the Government would have no right to do that.  They would have no right to treat the Irish shareholders with injustice merely to show that in the mind of Senator Milroy they were above suspicion. There is no suspicion attaching to the Executive in this matter.  The Americans demanded payment.  We are making payment and we are paying in full, and the Irish subscribers are entitled to say to the Government or to Senator Milroy: &ldquo;We subscribed our money; there is more money needed, and there is more money available from the proceeds of these bonds that have been assigned.  We say that we are entitled to have these assignments respected.&rdquo;  Senator Milroy is most unreasonable because when these bonds were originally litigated and when it was stated that the money should be repaid to the bond holders, there was an enquiry as to who the bondholders were, which lasted three or four years. Does Senator Milroy wish the Government, to the prejudice of the subscribers to this newspaper, which is not a party paper, to go now on a wild goose chase looking for the personal representative of every individual bondholder?  Senator Milroy has said that this is not a party motion.  I accept absolutely his statement, but I <Col N="735" /> think he is unduly exiguous on the present occasion and I am perfectly satisfied that he sees the position more clearly than I do.</P>

      <P>A good deal is said about national honour in this matter. I think it would be far better if Party disputants, in view of the course this controversy has taken, would say less about their regard for national honour in taking the line they have taken in this matter.  I cannot understand, except on one contention, what the reason for this recommendation is. The only presumption is that because the President of the Executive Council, and the Executive Council itself, are leaders of a political Party and because there is in existence a newspaper organ which supports that political Party and which, whatever Senator Comyn may say, is a Party organ&mdash;not necessarily owned by the Party but, nevertheless, a Party organ and quite justifiably so because there is no shame in being a Party organ so long as the Party agrees with the editors and proprietors of the organ&mdash;and because there are bonds in the possession of the supporters of that Party, given to <Col N="736" /> them for the purpose of financing that paper, there is something unjustifiable or indecent in passing this Bill at the present time.  The whole stress, I take it, lies on the fact that, because these gentlemen are Ministers of State, this Bill ought not to be introduced at this time.  Essentially, that is, I think, the suggestion.  As to the appropriateness of the time, I think that was dealt with effectively and completely by the statement of the Minister on the last occasion regarding the demand that has been made for the fulfilment of the promises of the previous Government to the American Ministers.  The question is then raised as to the date on which these bonds were transferred or assigned.  If this appeal for the transfer of the bonds were made at the time these gentlemen were Ministers, there would be some real gravamen in the allegations and suspicions that are levelled against them.  The most important feature of this whole question lies in the fact that Mr. de Valera was in opposition in 1929 and 1930 and, from all appearances, there was no likelihood at all of his being in a position to command the disposal of these bonds.</P>
      <P>Every feature of the political situation at that moment, from the point of view of the present leaders of the Opposition, was that Mr. de Valera and his cause were going down. Nevertheless, these bonds were assigned to him in the knowledge that the then Government, which would probably be the succeeding Government, had bound themselves to pay off these bonds.  That is the position. Because of the accident of circumstances, because of political success, Mr. de Valera and his Government have the responsibility for carrying out and fulfilling the promises of the previous Government, and it is now suggested that, because, when in opposition and with no prospect of being the Government, certain properties came into his hands, he should not, as Minister, fulfil the obligations which, as Minister, he is bound to fulfil.  That seems to me to be the question, brought down to its realities, and it disposes entirely of the suggestion of anything being dishonourable in this.</P>

      <P>I attended a meeting of the Gaelic League some years ago when the question of these same debts was brought up and discussed. A proposition was put forward at that meeting that all this money should be handed over to the Gaelic League. Mr. de Valera was in favour of that. The President at that period and a good many of the Ministers who belonged to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party strongly opposed the proposal. They expected, I suppose, that they would be able to get a hold of this money themselves.  At any rate, they opposed the proposition, and the result was that instead of the Gaelic League getting a very large sum of money, with which it could have done immense work for the Irish language, the matter went into the American courts. where it was decided that the money should be handed over to the original subscribers.  If the last Government had done what was reasonable and sensible they would have asked that this money should be handed over to the Gaelic League.  It would have been of great benefit to this country and to the Irish language movement. They would not agree to that because they were jealous of the idea of Mr. de Valera getting a hold of it.  They wanted to get a hold of it themselves. I think that at this stage it is most unreasonable and unjust to be dragging up this thing and inventing specious attacks on Ministers, but it is only in consonance with a lot of things that these same people have done.</P>

      <P>It certainly is very pleasant this afternoon to hear the mildness of Senator Milroy, and to notice that Senator Miss Browne is less vigorous than usual where the present Government is concerned.  When this Bill was getting a Second Reading in this House on Thursday night of last week the benches opposite assumed the appearance of the ten little nigger boys.  Even the benches around me were not over thickly populated when the Minister took up his papers and bid Senators good night on the stroke of 11 o'clock.  But something has happened since.  A mildness has been displayed <Col N="738" /> by Senator Milroy which does not often overtake him.  I am not going to go into the history of these bonds, but so far as I can remember they were issued in January, 1920 and in November, 1921.  In the discussions which have taken place the fact has been lost sight of that these bonds were taken up by Irish exiles, mostly exiles of very little wealth.  A great many of them were taken up&mdash;they were sneeringly referred to in the other House&mdash;by servant girls.  The reason for the issue of these bonds was to supply funds to meet the attack of the British Government at the time.</P>

      <P>I expect, a Chathaoirligh, you would without the help of Senator Milroy.  This money was subscribed mostly by servant girls in America, if you wish, to counteract the attack of the British Government at the time, but principally to counteract the attack and the atrocities that were being committed during the Black and Tan régime, an attack led by the British Prime Minister at the time, Mr. Lloyd George, that will go down to history as a black record on the British Government.  One stubborn fact has come out of this discussion, which is undoubtedly an honourable fact: that the members of the other House with the members of this House, of all parties, say that they are prepared that we should honour the honourable undertaking given by President de Valera.  An admission by some of my friends on the left of honouring any undertaking given by President de Valera must be gall and wormwood to a great many of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I happened to be in America when these bonds were issued and to come into close contact with the late Harry Boland who had control of the issuing of them.  In passing, I may say that I never met a man who had a truer spirit of honour or a more childlike simplicity, and after so many years <Col N="739" /> I find it difficult, even still, to associate Harry Boland with death.  Without egotism I can say that I happened to be in the principal bureau in New York when these bonds were taken up.  The sole spirit that prompted the people in America to take them up was to help Ireland.  I remember meeting an old Fenian in Philadelphia who said to me: &ldquo;I am glad that I shall be able to purchase one of these bonds.  I will put it side by side with the bonds which were issued during the days of the old Fenian movement.  I never expect to be paid, and I do not want to be paid so long as I am satisfied that I am helping Ireland.&rdquo;  I would not mention these facts, but for the sneers that have been made against the people in America who purchased these bonds.</P>

      <P>I can fully understand the spirit that prompted the bondholders in America to assign them to President de Valera.  They were assigned to him, in the words of subscribers, in many cases &ldquo;to do as he wished with them,&rdquo; and, undoubtedly, to help, whether it is entitled to the name or not is another question, the promotion of a national organ.  I can understand the spirit that prompted them.  I think it is a pity that President de Valera should be subjected to what he was subjected to in the other House.  I think it is a pity that he should be taunted with acting in this matter for personal gain, and in the language that Senator MacLoughlin used on the Second Reading of the Bill, when he said: &ldquo;In other countries the Government which would authorise its Minister for Finance to pay its President £80,000 or £100,000 <Col N="740" /> for Party propaganda would not last a week.  Here public opinion is so demoralised as to be numb.&rdquo;  I am not here to give President de Valera a certificate of character, but I felt that in reading up those debates that what was said was unfair to him.  He may have committed many political sins.</P>

      <P>Well, when he has committed as many political sins as Senator Milroy, I will say no more. The historians of the future will deal with his mistakes.  I am speaking now as one who in days of danger was in very close proximity to President de Valera, and if he has committed political sins he certainly has never committed the sin of acting for personal gain.  Never.  It is pitiable that debates cannot be carried on without this sort of personal abuse being indulged in.  President de Valera may have his faults, but he is an ennobling spirit doing what he can for the people of this country, and particularly the lowly people, and what he is doing shall not be forgotten.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that this amendment has been put down, notwithstanding the soft and suave manner in which Deputy Milroy spoke to-day, out of an excess of spleen and without any consideration whatsoever to the effect if it were carried. On the Second Stage of the Bill I indicated that on a certain date in 1929&mdash;the date for which I have the last returns&mdash;almost 34,000 bond certificates had been assigned and that the aggregate value of these bonds was almost £900,000; that those which had been assigned in exchange for shares in the holding company in America which holds the shares of the <i>Irish Press</i> on behalf of the assignors were less than half the total number and much less than half of the total value.  But, in order to get at this comparatively small number, Senator Milroy under this amendment would deprive every assignee of all benefits in these bonds, no matter how the interest was secured; whether it was for full value and consideration, as it was for full value and consideration <Col N="741" /> in the case of those who assigned the bonds for the purpose of securing an interest in the <i>Irish Press;</i> or whether it was given purely voluntarily as a gift, as it was in the case of those who assigned a considerable number of bonds to those who were responsible for the Chinese Mission, to those responsible for the Yorke Memorial and other projects. All of these, if Senator Milroy's amendment were carried, would suffer. It is noted that there is one class that he would exclude from his proposed disqualification and that is those who might claim to be the executors or administrators of a deceased subscriber. Once again I should like to emphasise that of the 34,000 that have been assigned, scarcely 6 per cent. represented bonds in respect of which claims have been filed by administrators or executors or agents.  He will except from the scope of the amendment that 6 per cent., but every one of the remainder, no matter how they came by their bonds, whether received as gifts, acquired through death or otherwise than being mere executors or administrators, whether as donations to charitable organisations, whether assigned to the Friends of Irish Freedom, or the <i>Gaelic-American</i> newspaper, or whether filed by relatives of residents in Ireland, would be immediately deprived of what is at present their property, under Senator Milroy's amendment. He is asking, in order that he might gratify, since he has put the amendment down on his own personal initiative and not at the desire of his Party, his personal spleen against those who have founded and established the <i>Irish Press</i>, the Seanad to pick the pockets of people in America, most of whom have received their assignments of the bonds because they have rendered services directly or indirectly to the Irish nation in the past.  I think that in itself would be sufficient reason why the Seanad ought to reject the amendment.  There is, however, a more far-reaching consideration. Could we at any time take up the attitude that we are asked to take up by Senator Milroy here?  If this Government were in <Col N="742" /> the market to-morrow for money and we asked people to subscribe to our national loan what position would we be in if the Seanad accepted this recommendation?</P>

      <P>That when the time came to repay the loan some Party, whether in the Government or in the Opposition, would get up and say that we would refuse to honour our bond when it was presented because we did not like the way in which those who had taken our bonds had dealt with it afterwards; that they had transferred their interest in it for the benefit of such-and-such an undertaking that we did not like, or for the benefit of such-and-such a Party to which we objected.  How could we possibly face the public and ask them to lend us money, if we were to accept this, when they would know that that principle had been accepted by one of the Houses of the Oireachtas and that it was going back as the considered recommendation of that House, which is supposed to represent the more responsible section of the community, and supposed to represent that section of the community which has the greatest experience in dealing with financial matters?  I see a smile on the face of Senator Milroy.  I know now that he does not mean the Seanad to take this seriously; that it has been put down as a mere political demonstration.  I think that in matters of that sort it is better that political demonstrations should be confined to the other House. Senator O'Neill has indicated the pain which all sections of the people, who stood aloof more or less from one side or the other in this quarrel which occurred ten years ago, and which it is time the Irish people were permitted to forget, felt at the proceedings in the other House and the disgust aroused in the mind of every decent Irish man and woman.  I am sure that Senator Milroy, when he reconsiders his position in the matter, will not press this recommendation to a vote. But, if he does press it to a vote, I hope the Seanad will deal with it in <Col N="743" /> the manner which it deserves and that it will lay this down as a principle&mdash; that when we borrow money upon our bond it is no concern of ours what the bondholder does with his interest in it afterwards; that the only thing we are concerned with is that when the bond is presented for payment it will be duly honoured no matter who holds it.</P>

      <P>I simply echo the Minister's hope that this House will deal with this recommendation as it deserves to be dealt with and, in my opinion, the only way in which this House can deal with it in that respect is to pass the recommendation and enable the matter to be considered by the other House.  In moving the recommendation, I disclaimed any idea of being animated by political or Party motives in this and I repudiate the suggestion made by certain speakers that that is behind the recommendation. I know of no reason why, if the Minister is so concerned with the honour of this State as one would gather from his concluding observation, this could not be accepted by him; indeed, it should be welcomed by him.  This recommendation is not intended to prevent or even impede the honouring of the obligations of this State.  It is rather to secure that the obligations of this State, in so far as they have been incurred, shall be discharged to the people to whom this State really owes them, and that they shall not be discharged to a third party who has secured the transmission of certain funds in a roundabout and, I think, rather dubious way.  I think that I have tried to keep the discussion of this particular matter detached from Party politics and Party considerations. I have tried to indicate why, in moving in this way, I am concerned with the reputation and the honour of this State, and that those responsible for Executive administration and control shall not be allowed to act in such a way as will bring their responsibilities under the shadow or imputation of Party manoeuvres.  I see no reason why this recommendation should be resisted by the Minister.  I see every <Col N="744" /> reason why he should have not only accepted, but welcomed it as a way out of the situation created by the discussion in the other House, which has been referred to, I think, in a way that is not exactly desirable in this House.  I do not think it should be within the competence of one House of the Oireachtas to comment, either adversely or otherwise, upon the conduct or procedure in the other part of the Oireachtas, and I hope that this will not be taken as a precedent.  If there is a danger of that, I hope there will be something put in the Standing Orders that will prevent a repetition of the rather unseemly reflections made upon the proceedings of the other House of the Oireachtas.  I would be tempted, if I wanted to deal with certain questions, to deal with them in a Party spirit.  I am going to refrain from that, for various considerations. In the first place, I think it is undesirable that there should be that kind of Party consideration imported into this discussion; secondly, to enlarge on that would not strengthen the case for the recommendation; and, in the third case, I believe it is necessary to allow the House to dispose of its business before it rises.  I want to say that I am urging and, if necessary, I will press this recommendation to a division, but there is nothing in it that in any way reflects, or that could be considered to reflect, upon the integrity of the Minister or of his colleagues in the Executive Council.  I think there is a provision in it which will help to safeguard the position of the Executive Council and the honour of this State, and for these reasons I am pressing it, and hope the House will give it a favourable decision.</P>
