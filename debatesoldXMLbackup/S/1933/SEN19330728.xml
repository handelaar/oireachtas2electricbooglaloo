      <P>With the permission of the House I wish to say a few words of a more or less personal character. When the discussion on the Agricultural Products (Regulation of Export) Bill was proceeding yesterday a division took place, 33 Senators being present and voting.  Immediately afterwards the Moneylenders (No. 2) Bill was under discussion and was of very great importance to the poor.  During the discussion you, a Chathaoirligh, left the Chair, the Leas-Chathaoirleach also left the House, and very few Senators remained.  It appeared to me that there was a boycott on, for what reason I could not decide.  I felt that it was an insult to the Minister, was against the dignity of the House, and that it was heartless to those that the Bill we were discussing affects.  I drew attention to the fact that a quorum was not present, and I fear that I made some caustic remarks on the absence of some of the Senators. When you returned to the House, a Chathaoirligh, you told us that you and many members of the Seanad, with the Minister, had been endeavouring to create a bridge to deal with the situation which had arisen on the Agricultural Products (Regulation of Export) Bill.  I want to withdraw now, unreservedly, any remarks I made in reference to the absence of so many Senators.  I wish further to have it placed on record that the absence of the Senators when we were dealing with the Moneylenders <Col N="822" /> Bill was amply justified by your statement.</P>

      <P>On the same matter I wish to say that I was one of those&mdash; in fact the one&mdash;who drew particular attention to the fact that many Senators were absent from the Opposition Benches.  While stressing the valuable assistance they could have rendered if they were here on that occasion, I passed various remarks, to the effect that if we were discussing a Bill in which provision was being made to increase income tax, super tax, or where monetary interests would be concerned, the Opposition Benches would be full, but when discussing a Bill to protect the poor people of the country from moneylenders&mdash;the wolves, as I termed them&mdash;men with valuable knowledge at their command were not here to assist us.  Unlike Senator O'Neill, I am afraid I cannot withdraw substantially what I said yesterday.  In my statement I did not include those who were concerned in the conference which was going on at the time with the Minister for Agriculture to bridge over a difficulty which had arisen.  Apart from those who were implicated in that conference, there are various other Senators on the Opposition Benches who, on every occasion that any legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I meant my remarks to be directed to those who were absent from the debate, and who did not remain over for the Moneylenders Bill, which was really a Bill for the betterment of the condition of the poor people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have some explanation from the Minister regarding this section.  I would like a more explicit definition of the Minister's proposals regarding licences and quotas.  If exports of cattle are to be brought under a quota in Great Britain, what procedure is the Minister going to adopt regarding the allotting of quotas to individual exporters from this country?  There are over 3,000 exporters directly interested in the live cattle trade or connected with it.  How many of these will get licences or quotas?  How does the Minister propose to deal with the balance?  Is any provision to be made for people whose livelihood may be taken from them if the quota system comes along?  When setting up consultative councils what class of people will be nominated on them, and whose recommendations will the Minister take for the members to be put on these councils?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I endeavoured to explain this matter rather fully on two or three previous occasions.  Something like this will happen.  If Great Britain prescribes a quota for cattle, or for any particular class of cattle, for this country, we would then issue an order, under this Bill, setting out in detail the various steps that would be taken. <Col N="824" /> We would, of course, have to follow, more or less, the provisions of this section, by asking those who intended to export cattle to register.  I take it that every single person in the trade at present who is exporting would apply for registration.  If not, we would take it for granted that they did not want to continue in the trade. They would only have themselves to blame if they did not register.  We will take it for granted that all will apply for registration.  Having been registered we would send a form to each person asking what quota would be applied for for 1934.  Having got the returns, we would tot them, and if the figures did not reach the global quota we got for the trade, we would urge people to go ahead and to export the number applied for.</P>
      <P>If the applications were more than the total which we would be entitled to export, we would have to cut them down in some way or other.  We come now to the point which I take to be the vital point with Senator Counihan &mdash;how we are going to cut them down. In the meantime, we would have set up a consultative council.  The consultative councils in the Department of Agriculture are always selected in a certain way.  They are always selected by calling the members of the particular interest together but not necessarily in the Department.  They are asked to hold a meeting and to submit names to the Minister out of which he could select his consultative council. We did, for instance, call every exporter of pigs and bacon together and we asked them to submit names to us out of which we could select the consultative council, and we would do the same thing in relation to the cattle trade. We would have to ask everybody interested in the cattle trade.  Perhaps they could not all be got together at the same time and we might, for instance, get the cattle trade in Cork to submit names, the cattle trade in Limerick to submit names and the cattle trade in Dublin to submit names.</P>

      <P>And what about the producers?</P>

    <Col N="825" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the producers have to come into it too.  Having got all those different lists together, we would have to make the best hand we could of giving a fair representation to all the interests concerned.  The consultative council having been selected, these applications would be submitted to them and we would point out, say, that we were entitled to export 10,000 cattle every week, but that the applications amounted to 10,500 per week and we would ask the consultative council what, in their opinion, would be the best way to cut them down.  When I put that question to the pig and bacon industry they said that the best way to regulate it would be to take the returns over two years and try to base it on those.  If we did the same with regard to the cattle exporters, we would ask them to give us returns over two years and if any applicant had then exceeded the trade he had been doing for the previous two years we might bring him down to that and we would eventually get down to the 10,000 figure.  If that was not sufficient, however, we might have to make a cut over the whole lot of, say, 5 per cent, but all those steps would be taken in consultation with the consultative council and no individual member of the cattle trade would be wronged in any way.  If the members have been doing a certain trade over the last two years and if they are all anxious to carry on exactly the same trade for the next year and if we come along and say &ldquo;We have to make a 5 per cent. cut on the whole lot&rdquo; no individual has a grievance above any other.  We are treating them all alike.  I do not know if that covers the question Senator Counihan has put to me but I think that is the point he wants to get at.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Minister may, whenever and so often as he thinks fit with the consent of the Minister for <Col N="826" /> Finance and after consultation with such bodies and persons as he may consider most representative of the several interests concerned, establish by order a consultative council for giving advice and assistance to him in relation to such matters (being matters relating to or concerned with the making, revoking, and amending of export orders) as he may specify in such order.</P>
    <P>(2)  A consultative council established under this section shall consist of such persons having experience or special knowledge of the matters on which such council may give advice or assistance to the Minister as the Minister, after such consultation as aforesaid, shall from time to time nominate to be members thereof.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every member of a consultative council established under this section shall retain his membership during the pleasure of the Minister.</P>
    <P>(4)  A consultative council established under this section shall meet whenever summoned by the Minister and also on such other occasions as such council shall from time to time determine.</P>
    <P>(5)  Payments may be made by the Minister out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, to members of a consultative council established under this section or of a committee thereof, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, in respect of repayment of travelling expenses and payment of subsistence allowance.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to move my amendment but I should like a little further information with regard to the consultative council.  80 per cent. of the cattle bought in the Dublin market at the present time are bought by English nationals or North of Ireland exporters.  There is a greater percentage of North of Ireland <Col N="827" /> exporters and I want to know from the Minister if those exporters are going to get licences or is he going to give licences to nobody but Free State nationals.  It would be a terrible disaster if the English exporters who have been coming to this country for a lifetime were to be prevented from getting licences.  That would lie, to a great extent, with the consultative council and I want to impress on the Minister again the necessity of having a consultative council which would represent all sections of the trade and the producers.  He said that licences would only be given to exporters.  In that case, where will the producers come in who want to export and who will not have any record of any exports to their credit for the last two years?  They will get no exporter's licences and will have to sell their cattle to the exporters no matter what price they offer.  I can visualise our quota from Dublin being, say, 3,000 cattle and 5,000 cattle in the Dublin markets and, when that happens, the exporters need not give anything like the market value in the British market because, in all cases, we must remember that prices are regulated by supply and demand and if the supply is one and a half times greater than the demand prices will fall very much.  The producers in this case are, in my opinion, more important than the exporters although I do not want to take from the importance of the exporters, because if you have not got producers you will not require any exporters.  With regard to the setting up of the consultative council, I think the Minister should give us some assurance that the producers will have equal representation with the exporters.  If he wants to keep the balance of power in favour of the Government, he could take powers to appoint three but I think that he should definitely state that he will have an equal number of producers and exporters on that council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not, of course, considered the matter of the cattle consultative council very much yet.  We <Col N="828" /> have been working on other consultative councils but we have not come to the cattle council.  I do not know that it would be advisable&mdash;it might, perhaps, when we come to consider it &mdash;to have an equal number of producers and exporters because, after all, it is the exporters who would be mainly concerned in giving the advice. I do think it would be necessary to have producers on them so that their point of view might be expressed and so that the whole business would not be run in the interests of the exporters but in regard to the details upon which we want information and advice, in reference to the month of the year, for instance, in which cattle had best be exported, the place to which they had best be exported and the type of cattle that should be exported during that particular month and to that particular place and all sorts of little details like that, I think the exporters would be more valuable to us on the technical points, at any rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will they not have the recommending of the persons who are to get licences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they will, as long as things are going smoothly, as I explained, I think, yesterday, but under this Bill the Minister for Agriculture should always have to take full responsibility. If any particular exporter thinks that he is not getting a fair deal it is the Minister he is going to blame, so that the Minister will have to take full responsibility and will have to consider any appeals made to him by an individual exporter that he is not getting a fair deal.  He will, perhaps, from time to time, have to go to a consultative council and ask them to explain why such a quota was given.  Senator Counihan also raised a point with regard to producers coming in to the export business themselves. That, of course, is a great difficulty under all quota systems.  In every country there is that same difficulty of new people coming into the trade.  In some places, they provide <Col N="829" /> for that by allotting a small percentage&mdash;perhaps 2½ or 5 per cent.&mdash;of the whole quota for new applicants who would be considered as suitable to enter the trade.  They give them a certain small quota to start with and if they make good, as some of the existing members fall out of business, they gradually build up a small quota.  It is a very difficult question and one on which I should not like to give any definite view now.  It is a question that arose in connection with the pig and bacon conference and the people in that trade were quite willing to give a fair consideration to any new person entering the trade.  It was a simpler matter there, because a person coming in to the trade could show a bacon factory and it was good evidence of his bona fides, but a person who wants to start in the cattle trade has no premises or buildings to show and one cannot be very sure whether he is genuine or not.  It is, therefore, more difficult to deal with new people in the cattle trade than in the bacon trade.  In all countries, however, in which they had to deal with quotas, they had that difficulty and had various ways of getting over it.  It is a matter that will have to be considered as a new question put to the cattle trade consultative council when it arises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not raising the question of new people coming in to the cattle trade.  I want to point out that producers who are not satisfied with the prices they are getting should have permission to export their own produce and should get a licence for that purpose.  That is the point I want to make.  Last year, when the bounties came on, a large percentage of the cattle producers in the country exported their own cattle.  They have not had any export trade for, perhaps ten years and some of them never exported in their lives before. I contend that the producer of livestock should get a licence as well as the ordinary cattle trader.  You can confine it, if you like, to the export of his own produce, but he should have the right to get a licence to export that produce.  That is what I <Col N="830" /> want to impress on the Minister as being a matter that should be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I think that the matter which Senator Counihan is raising now is a matter that could possibly be raised when the Order is laid on the Table with regard to cattle.  All the details will be set out then and it can be discussed. This Bill really gives permission to lay an Order on the Table. All the details will be in that Order, and when it is laid on the Table these details can be discussed.</P>

      <P>I think this amendment hardly requires any explanation.  It was debated at great length yesterday. In drawing up this Bill we never had any intention of including intoxicating liquors.  In the first place, the Department of Agriculture is not supposed to know anything about intoxicating liquors.  That is a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce. If whiskey were to be quota-ed then that would be a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce, <Col N="832" /> and not for my Department, and I presume the Minister for Industry and Commerce would deal with it. But meantime intoxicating liquors are exempt from this Bill.</P>

      <P>There are two reasons for this amendment.  The first is that it is not considered to be good English to speak of &ldquo;exporters in.&rdquo;  The phrase should be &ldquo;exporters from.&rdquo; The second reason is the important one.  The point was raised by Senator Counihan that it might possibly be held that an exporter living outside the country could not come in under the Bill if the section were to read &ldquo;exporters in,&rdquo; but when the section reads &ldquo;exporters from,&rdquo; then exporters living outside can come in under the Bill.  The amendment indicates our intention of giving an exporter's licence to those from outside the country if they are in the trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable, I think, that these two amendments should be taken together.  We had no intention under the Bill of compelling anybody to export unless they had applied for permission to export, that is, applied for registration.  Therefore, we confined paragraph (c) to registered persons.  I think some Senators feared that if a person had registered and applied, say, to export 200 cattle per week that the Minister could go to him and say that he must export 1,000 cattle per week.  Of course, we never intended to do that.  What we do intend is that he must export the 200 cattle per week that he contracted to export.  Otherwise, the whole quota arrangement would go. Because of that, paragraph (c) of the section is very important.  In fact, I think I might go so far as to say that it is the operative clause of the Bill. If we get a quota from a country, then that country will insist that we should fill the quota as the British Act says &ldquo;within reasonable tolerance.&rdquo;  That means that, say, a 5 per cent. variation would be allowed if we got 5,000 cattle.  They would allow you to go 5 per cent. above or below the quota each week, but the total would have to work out at the end of the year at 5,000.  In the same way, when we sub-allocate our quota each exporter must stick to his sub-allocation also &ldquo;within reasonable tolerance.&rdquo;  If he does not, of course, it will mean that our quota has not been filled for the period and immediately the country that we are exporting to will tell us that our quota is reduced for all time to the level to which it has dropped.  Because of that our exporters must be kept up to their contract.  With these two amendments the exporter is protected.  He must be registered.  We cannot compel him to export any number of cattle or quantity of meat greater than what he undertakes to export during the period.  The word &ldquo;undertake&rdquo; there has a legal meaning; what he has signed an undertaking to do.  When an exporter applies for a quota we send him back a form asking him to sign it and to have it witnessed.  He is asked to undertake to export so many animals or so much meat during each <Col N="834" /> period.  Having given that undertaking, we are taking power here to compel him to stick to his undertaking during the period.</P>

      <P>I was asked yesterday about the consultative councils and I said that, so far as I knew the law, the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the sub-section means &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  I have since seen the draftsman and he has confirmed me in that view.  But he says, in order to remove all doubt, the House can insert the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>May I suggest that it is rather futile to pass this amendment, if we look at the words that follow &ldquo;whenever and so often as he thinks fit&rdquo;?  The section will now read: &ldquo;The Minister shall, whenever and so often as he thinks fit,&rdquo; set up a consultative council.  What does that mean, but that the Minister may set up a consultative council?  I suggest that we ought not to make ourselves look foolish by insisting on an amendment of this kind.</P>

      <P>Before the Bill is finally passed I wish to say a word with <Col N="836" /> regard to the general outlook and as to what this Bill means to the country. I think some expression of opinion should go from this House on these matters.  The best informed opinion in the country believes that if a competent, honest Government had been in power here it would have made a good trading agreement with Great Britain, and that this quota system would never have been applied to us.  That is at any rate a strong possibility.  In this morning's newspapers figures are published which reflect the great decline in the trade of this country during the past year.  In fact one may say that they are staggering figures.  The trade of this country for the year ending June, 1933, as compared with the year ending June 1932, has declined by over £27,000,000.  The cattle trade alone has declined by about 50 per cent.  It is highly probable that the quota for this country will be based on the figures for last year: on the number of animals exported and the quantity of produce exported.  If that is so, and it is almost certain that it will be so, then the outlook for the country is terribly black indeed, blacker than it has ever been in its history.  The people ought be made realise what it means to them.</P>

      <P>We are dealing now, Senator, with a quota system that may be imposed by some other country. This Bill proposes to meet that situation.  I submit that you cannot discuss the whole question of the economic war on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to discuss the economic war.  Take farmers who have a large number of cattle at the present time.  At present they can sell them at half their value or less, but when the quota system comes into operation many of these people will certainly be left with a number of cattle which they canot sell at all. How is the Minister going to meet that situation?  I think attention should be called to this so that the people may realise what is facing them.  At present they can sell their <Col N="837" /> cattle at some price, however unsatisfactory that price may be, but when this quota comes on, then a large number of the cattle in the country cannot be sold at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In consequence of your ruling, a Chathaoirligh, it will not be possible for me to say very much on this stage of the Bill.  I have considered where all these quota regulations as well as the different Acts passed by the present Government are going to lead to.  The Minister is taking dictatorial powers in this Bill to deal with almost every class of producer in the country, and to control him, and to deal with and control every trader in the country.  As mentioned by Senator Jameson, there is no record of a Government in any country, outside Russia, taking such dictatorial powers as the Minister is taking in this Bill.  I am afraid that the whole policy of the Government is leading up to a dictatorship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid these quotas will not be very much required in a short time.  With our declining trade, and seeing what has happened to the pig trade, I think the same thing will happen to the cattle trade, and that the quotas will not be very much sought after in a year or two if this continues.  I see by to-day's papers that our cattle trade for the first six months of 1932 amounted to £4,974,808 and for the first six months of this year it was reduced by more than half, to £2,000,000.  The only way that the farmer will be able to save himself from loss is by not producing and at the present time farmers are beginning to adopt that policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prompted to refer to Senator Miss Browne's remarks <Col N="838" /> because she assured us that this Bill or nothing of the kind would be required but for certain events which took place.  She was referring to the imposition of retaliatory duties.  I think if the Senator made herself a little more acquainted with the circumstances, without prejudice, she would understand that, even though the Treaty of 1921 resulted in the setting up of a Government here with fiscal powers, if, in fact, the Free State part of Ireland had remained under the Act of 1920, as Northern Ireland has done, we would be in exactly the same position, because it so happens that it is intended to apply a quota in regard to bacon and pig products to Northern Ireland, even though Northern Ireland has not imposed retaliatory duties upon Great Britain.</P>

      <P>I intend in a very few words to take up a different attitude from that taken by Senator Miss Browne.  I should like to congratulate all concerned on the manner in which what appeared to be a nasty crux yesterday has been got over.  It only goes to prove what can be accomplished by a give-and-take spirit on both sides, free from Party and personal bitterness. That the crux has been got over proves that it would be a great factor in this country if, when a crux arises, the same spirit of give-and-take were displayed.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on his excellent handling of this Bill and, in particular, on the way he dealt with the master minds at the conference held yesterday evening.  There must be a great deal in the Minister when he was able to win over to his side a financial expert like Senator Jameson, a man of such clear and decisive vision as Senator Douglas, a man so broadminded and <Col N="839" /> having such a great deal of natural commonsense as Senator Wilson, a man of the pertinacity and &ldquo;stickability&rdquo; of our friend, Senator Counihan, and, above all, a man with the philosophy of Senator O'Hanlon. When the Minister can do that, the least we can do is to present him with a sprig of four-leaved shamrock.  I am sorry that Senator Miss Browne has left, as we might by special request have asked her to pin the four-leaved shamrock on the Minister.</P>
