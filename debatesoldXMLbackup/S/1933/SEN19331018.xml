      <P>The main practical purpose of Article 37 of the Constitution is to give the Executive Council control over financial proposals submitted to the Dáil.  The control of financial proposals in the Dáil is, as Senators are aware, the function of the Executive.  Where legislative proposals involving the expenditure of public moneys are introduced by private members the financial resolution must originate with the Executive Council.  This amendment of the Constitution is simply to enable the Executive Council to move directly in sending any decision of the Executive Council to the Dáil without the intervention of the Governor-General.  It in no way changes the ordinary formality of the advice or the recommendation on the financial measure being sent, but it does leave to the Executive Council, without the intervention of the Governor-General, a method of approaching the Dáil itself. It is felt that it is in keeping with the whole policy that is being pursued. The Dáil agreed to it without any <Col N="1534" /> discussion, and I hope the Seanad will also agree.</P>

      <P>I must make my protest against this measure.  I agree that it is implicit in the whole policy of the Government and is only one further step along the road to a republic.  It further gains colour from the manner in which the Governor-General himself has been placed in a position of utter isolation and obscurity.  I deplore the policy which is rapidly leading to a situation when the declaration of a republic will be little more than a mere formal act.  I would ask, if possible, for my name to be recorded on the records as dissenting.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Bill, but, in view of the fact that I totally disagree with the view held by the last speaker, I think it is only right that I should make my own personal view with regard to this Bill clear.  This really applies more to the next two Bills on the Order Paper.  My view is and always has been that it is much better to have removed unreal formalities which mean nothing, but which may make people who have not got the constitutional knowledge imagine that the Governor-General and Great Britain have certain powers which they have not, or which may enable certain politicians to pretend that those things mean something that they do not mean.  I do not at all agree that the removal of any formalities which mean nothing is a step towards a republic.  I should take exactly the opposite view. My opinion is that the more you make it perfectly clear that it is possible to remain in the British Commonwealth and maintain the constitutional monarchy without in any way interfering with your independence, the more it strengthens the position inside the British Commonwealth rather than being a step towards a republic.  In this case, I read carefully the speech made by the President in introducing this Bill in the Dáil and I find myself in complete agreement.  As he pointed out, this particular Bill has no effect <Col N="1535" /> whatsoever except in form.  I think at the present moment it may be necessary for the Executive Council to send a formal note to the Governor-General and to say, &ldquo;We instruct or advise you to sign this.&rdquo;  That note will no longer be necessary.  As far as the actual power of recommendation is concerned, the effect of the Bill is absolutely nil.  There is always a danger, as I said before, that certain forms which are of no importance themselves may be used to suggest outside interference with this country which, in fact, does not exist.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the general principle because it applies to the three Bills&mdash;possibly more to the other Bills than to this particular Bill.  I should like to make it clear that my attitude ever since I was on the Constitution Committee, and I have not changed in any way, is that within the terms of the Treaty we should make the actual constitutional position as clear as we possibly can. I am personally even in favour of extensions of the Treaty which would make the position clearer, but I am not in favour of any step taken by this Parliament which, although it was only a form, conflicts with the Treaty unless there has been either an agreement or a repudiation of the Treaty.  While the Treaty is there I believe it should be kept even in form.  As far as these three Bills are concerned, I am utterly unable to see that they conflict in form with the Treaty and, for my part, I am prepared to support them.  I need hardly say that in what I say I am speaking only for myself.</P>

      <P>Just one word ought to be said before this Bill passes from the purview of the Oireachtas, because, while it is undoubtedly a matter of form, it is the removal of a symbol that has hitherto been believed to have very considerable significance.  In the theory of the past which was embodied in the Constitution we had the Crown coming to the people's representatives to ask for money for a specific purpose, and that approach to the people's representatives <Col N="1536" /> was through the Executive Council, nominally the Ministers appointed by the Crown to advise it. Under the new regime, which I think is all to the good, that formality will be removed and we shall then have the position of Ministers who have replaced the Crown coming to the representatives of the people asking for money for a specific purpose.  No longer is the Crown coming for money for a specific purpose; it is in effect a republican executive.  No other words can describe it so far as I can understand.  That is a very great change, a change that took place some years ago and has been part of our procedure, but with the passing of this Bill we are formally renouncing the influence of the Crown as an institution in respect to taxation or the spending of public moneys.  That, I think, is a very great change which ought to be recorded as being consciously realised by the members of this House.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is anything more for me to say.  Senator Johnson has expressed, I think, what is in the minds of most of us, though perhaps not all of us.  He has stated in effect what always did take place, namely, that the Executive Council, being the responsible authority in the country, naturally made the decisions as regards what was to be done with regard to the finances of the country. An unnecessary formality, in my opinion, is now being removed.  I personally feel considerable satisfaction that it is being removed.  As I said earlier, the Dáil passed this Bill without any dissenting voice and without any criticism, and I feel that this House will probably do the same.</P>

    <Title>Constitution (Amendment No. 21) Bill, 1933&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That this Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Connolly) Joseph Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Constitution (Amendment) Bill deals with Article 41 of the Constitution.  The amendment to it is that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Article 41 of the Constitution shall be and is hereby amended as follows, that is to say, by the deletion therefrom of all words from the words &ldquo;and such Representative&rdquo; to the end of the said Article, and the said Article shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
      <P>This will mean that Article 41 will then read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;So soon as any Bill shall have been passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses, the Executive Council shall present the same to the Representative of the Crown for the signification by him, in the King's name, of the King's assent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this Bill is to repeal the provision in Article 41 of the Constitution which conferred on the Governor-General of this country power to withhold assent to Bills passed by the Oireachtas or to reserve Bills.  Under the provision of Article 41 of the Constitution, as it stands&mdash;the Article now being amended&mdash;the Governor-General has the legal power both to withhold assent and to reserve Bills. The Government regard the continued existence of the Governor-General's legal powers as anomalous and out of harmony with the present constitutional position.  No Bill has, in fact, ever been reserved by the Governor-General <Col N="1538" /> of the Irish Free State, and in no case has assent to a Bill been withheld. Indeed, in accordance with constitutional practice, assent would not be withheld and a Bill would not be reserved save upon the advice of the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>This Constitution (Amendment) Bill represents our view of the situation. It is another removal of formalities. We feel that this Bill is in keeping with our policy and with the mind of the country on these matters.  We are asking the House, therefore, to pass this as a necessary removal of another formality which should be eliminated from the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The same arguments, practically, can be used in regard to both of these Bills, the one to which we have just given a Second Reading and the one now before the House.  The reason that I did not intervene in the case of the last Bill was because what I have to say will, I think, come with a greater degree of appropriateness on this particular Bill.  First of all, I should like to refer, in passing, to the discovery of Senator Johnson that we are now going to have, in effect, a Royal Irish Republic.  He informed us that the last Bill dealt with the demand of a Republican Executive for funds so that when the Republic functions under the headship of the State, which is the Crown&mdash;a curious and strange anomaly if it is a correct description of the situation&mdash;it must surely call for a further number of Constitution (Amendment) Bills before the situation is in harmony with the views of the Minister who is charge of these Bills to-day.  I do not anticipate that there is any likelihood of a hectic disputation in regard to this present Bill which merely implements and gives effect to agreements arrived at at Imperial Conferences held in 1929 and 1930.  This Bill removes no existing barriers to our onward march to national freedom.  It confers no power which we do not possess at present, and in no way expands the national freedom which the Saorstát enjoys in its relation to something which has grown obsolete by lack of use.  Any belief that this Bill or the previous Bill marks an achievement <Col N="1539" /> of the Fianna Fáil Government is quite illusory.  It is, I think, a case of the Fianna Fáil mountain having been in labour and later on producing a mouse, or shall we say twin mice, of which they cannot prove authentic parentage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The trail was blazed for this assertion of national authority, in so far as it could be deemed to be such, by the predecessors of the present Government, in their masterly handling of Ireland's interests at the Imperial Conferences to which I have referred.  I will go this far and say that if the same spirit had been manifested by the present Government's predecessors in their dealings with these matters as has marked the diplomacy of the present Government in its dealings with Great Britain, it is safe to assume that this Bill, instead of being merely an inconspicuous termination of an anachronism, would be a potential storm centre of controversy, saturated with all the evils of suspicion, distrust and antagonism which, unfortunately, the present Government has succeeded in infusing into any inter-State relations they initiated since they came into office.</P>
      <P>The questions I want to ask in connection with this Bill are: Is this Bill adequate for the purpose for which it is ostensibly introduced?  Will the provisions which it seeks to remove from the Constitution not remain binding in law, even when this Bill becomes an Act of the Oireachtas? This consideration also applies to the other Bill, the Second Reading of which has just been agreed to.  These are certainly matters which want to be clarified and I am intervening in order to give the Minister an opportunity of clarifying them.  I call attention first to Article 73 of the Constitution which says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Subject to this Constitution and to the extent to which they are not inconsistent therewith, the laws in force in the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution <Col N="1540" /> shall continue to be of full force and effect until the same or any of them shall have been repealed or amended by enactment of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask the Seanad carefully to mark the words of the Article.  One of the laws in force when this Constitution came into operation was the Treaty, which, by Section 2 of the Constitution Act, was given the force of law.  I direct attention to that section of the Constitution Act which, though repealed by the Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act, has still a vital bearing on the matter I am considering.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The said Constitution shall be construed with reference to the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland set forth in the Second Schedule hereto annexed (hereinafter referred to as &lsquo;the Scheduled Treaty&rsquo;) which are hereby given the force of law....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is as far as it is necessary to quote.  This section was repealed but it is important to remember that when enacted it gave the force of law to the Treaty.  I want to emphasise that point, that it gave the force of law to the Treaty.  A question arises on which I want a clear and explicit answer from the Minister.  Did the repeal of Section 2 withdraw from the Treaty the validity and force of law which it had given to it?  It seems to me that it is strongly arguable, it did not; that the Treaty still stands in all its provisions with the full force of law in this State.  It seems to me very questionable if law can be repealed, either by implication or inference, as would be the case if that Treaty as law was repealed by Section 2 of the Constitution Act.  So far as I understand the matter a law must be repealed in specific terms, and so far as the Treaty is law and as this State is concerned that has not yet been done.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Constitution Act was the instrument by which the Treaty was given the force of law. Did the scrapping of the instrument nullify the function it had discharged before it was scrapped?  That is a fundamental question.  One might as <Col N="1541" /> well argue that because a scaffold around a building was the instrument, so to speak, by which the building was brought into existence, when the scaffold is taken away the edifice ceases to exist.  As I understood the argument of the President when presenting his case for the removal of the Oath from the Constitution, his contention was that that Bill in no way affected the Treaty position, that it stood as it was before the introduction of the Bill, with the full force of law according to the authority which had been conferred upon it when the Constitution was enacted.  If that is so then by Article 73 of the Constitution the Treaty is one of the laws continuing in full force and effect, having been neither repealed, amended nor removed, except in regard to the Treaty (Confirmation of Supplemental Agreement) Act of 1924 and Treaty (Confirmation of Amending Agreement) Act, 1925, which are not relevant to this point.  It has still the force of law if my contention is accurate, and if it is not accurate I want the Minister to prove that I am inaccurate.  It is a moot question if Article 17 has not still the force of law in this State.</P>
    <P>To deal directly with this Bill, and the amendment which it proposes to make to Article 4 of the Constitution, I refer to my contention that the Treaty still stands with the full force of law and, therefore, is binding as law in this country.  I come now to the particular Article of the Treaty which is relevant to this Bill, Article II, which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions hereinafter set out, the position of the Irish Free State in relation to the Imperial Parliament and Government and otherwise shall be that of the Dominion of Canada, and the law, practice and constitutional usage governing the relationship of the Crown or the representative of the Crown and of the Imperial Parliament to the Dominion of Canada shall govern their relationship to the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The provision which this Bill proposes <Col N="1542" /> to delete or amend was framed in conformity with that Article of the Treaty. The provisions which will throw light on what has been the constitutional practice of the law of Canada are contained in Articles 54, 55 and 56 of the Constitution of Canada.  It may be that the law, practice and constitutional usage connected with these have grown obsolete by disuse.  The fact remains that they are still the letter of the law set out in the Article of the Treaty and, as this Bill deals primarily, if not entirely, with the letter of the law, it is well to enquire exactly how matters will stand when this Bill passes.  Certainly, it appears to me very undesirable that we should retain in our Constitution provisions which perpetuate certain things which our statutes purport to terminate.  Therefore, I should like to have from the Minister a clear explanation and answer to three questions: (1) Did the repeal of Section 2 of the Constitution Act repeal the Treaty?  (2) If not, is not Article 73 of the Constitution insistent that the Treaty is one of the laws continued in full force and effect at the present time?  (3) If so, is not Article 2 of the Treaty still legally binding and is not this Bill, in these circumstances, defective in that it is not adequate in itself to effect what it proposes to do?  I hope the Minister will give an explicit answer to these queries.  If my argument is not sustainable the Minister should be able to prove that and, in doing so, to clear up certain ambiguities to which I have drawn attention. If my contention is sound, then, obviously, this Bill is defective in the sense in which I have argued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow Senator Milroy in his somewhat difficult line of argument except to say that, as far as I am personally concerned, I am perfectly satisfied that the Treaty has not been repealed and that it is still law.  That is my personal opinion.  I am not going into the details, but I am of the opinion that Article 2 is still a fact, but I am not of the opinion that Article 2 prevented the deletion of the particular words which it is proposed to delete in this Bill. <Col N="1543" /> Speaking generally, this Bill has no effect.  Certainly, as far as the ordinary man in the street is concerned, it has no effect.  I am not quite sure whether the Government gave as much consideration to the form of this Bill as was desirable and that in making the change they would not have been better advised to make it clearer than it has been made in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Milroy is anxious that it should be made clear that the present Government cannot claim any credit for any changes that are being made in the Bill.  As I cannot see that any change has been made, the question of credit does not arise and, likewise, it does not arise as far as the late Government are concerned.  To the best of my opinion and reading no power to reserve or withhold assent except on the advice of the Executive Council existed at the time the Treaty was made and, as far as constitutional practice is concerned, that there is an absolutely clear position that in the matter of assenting, withholding assent or possible reservation, the function could only be carried out specifically on the advice of the elected Executive. That being the case, I hold that there has been really no change in this particular matter whatsoever since the Treaty was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I read this Bill first I was a little puzzled.  I think everybody will agree that it is quite clear that the words which involve power to reserve Bills ought never to have been in the Constitution at all.  That practice of reservation, once the power could only be exercised on the advice of the Executive, became an absurdity.  No Executive was going to advise the Governor-General to reserve a Bill and, in practice, no such reservation had taken place for a very considerable number of years before the Treaty. Therefore, we may rule that out. There is no question that it should never have been there and that it should certainly go.  This Bill purports to remove the power to withhold assent.  It is strictly constitutional. It keeps strictly within the Treaty because it still provides what, I think, is essential, that the assent of the <Col N="1544" /> Governor-General shall be obtained before Bills become law.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister for his opinion and the Government's opinion as to whether this is intended to provide that under no circumstances could the Governor-General withhold assent even on the advice of the Executive Council.  When I read the Bill first I was inclined to think that it had that effect, but on more careful consideration I think it has not that effect.  If you wanted to make the matter clear beyond all doubt it would have been much better to add the words that such assent could only be given or withheld on the advice of the Executive Council.  You may ask would any Government advise the Governor-General to withhold his assent.  My answer is, yes.  I can conceive of circumstances in which that might be a useful provision.  If you will read the Constitution carefully you will find that if a Bill has been passed by both Houses in the same form the Executive shall present it to the Governor-General.  If a Bill had passed both Houses and if then a general election took place before the formal assent had been given, a new Executive might consider it desirable to advise that the Governor-General should withhold his assent.  In doing so they would be acting as the representatives of the people and in a strictly democratic manner.  I discussed this with a legal friend of mine &mdash;I am not referring to Senator Brown &mdash;and his attitude was that there was no need to worry about it, that it was quite clear that the Executive Council could still advice the withholding of the assent.  Circumstances could arise in which a new Executive could be elected who might wish to stop a Bill. The Seanad could refuse to agree to an amending or repealing Bill, and therefore, if this provision was only for assent, the Government might be left with a law that was against their policy and which they considered undesirable.  That is not likely to happen, I know, but, leaving out the question of the Executive form of our Government, the whole function of the assent by the head of the State&mdash; whether it be the President of a republican <Col N="1545" /> form of government or a king with strictly limited powers, is immaterial&mdash;the whole function is to correct errors and not to give either a president or a king a veto.  If there is any doubt in the Government's mind that the power to withhold assent still exists, I think it should be remedied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we understand pretty clearly that these Bills do not affect the matter fundamentally.  I have listened with great interest to Senators Milroy and Douglas, but it seems to me that there is something more behind these Bills, just as there was something behind the Bill for the removal of the oath.  The Government is in a position like this: They have to keep up delusions in certain people's minds.  There are people who like to believe that the Government is advancing gradually, step by step, towards the Republic.  These are the expressions we hear and it is in the interest of the Government to encourage that delusion.  When a mad bull chases you, you are advised to throw your hat or coat to him so as to divert his attention from the fact that you are trying to escape from him.  Satisfy him for the time being&mdash;that is the plan.  That is the position in which the Government find themselves.  The Government have behind them a mad bull in the shape of certain people with guns who are driving them on.  The Government have to keep these people in hands and satisfy them.  We know that the abolition of the oath of allegiance taken by members of the Oireachtas does not remove the allegiance we owe to the King&mdash;not in the least. It is there still.  We admit our allegiance every day.  The oath was only a form signed when we were coming in here.  The removal of the oath does not alter the fact that the allegiance still stands.  These are little sops to the people who like to believe that we are advancing to the goal of a Republic.  These Bills do not matter much in the long run.  We do not worry very much about them and that is the reason we do not offer any great opposition to them. But the object of these proceedings is <Col N="1546" /> as I have stated.  We may make speeches and try to explain the matter scientifically but, in the long run, that is the object of these Bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to pay much attention to what the last speaker has said.  This Bill is in keeping with the definite policy of the present Government.  It is true that it does seek to remove, step by step, those impositions which were put upon this country by the Constitution which was eventually agreed to but which was not, in effect, the Constitution which was originally submitted.  If we have taken the line of removing step by step from the Constitution such things as are offensive, such things as have given offence to our people and have been the cause of trouble and disunity, then we are only carrying out what is the logical and desirable thing to do in this country.  Whether it is or not, it is the policy on which this Government has been put into power.  In so far as that is the case, that policy is going to be carried on.  The point mentioned by Senator Douglas with regard to the power to withhold assent is an interesting technical one.  What we want to make clear&mdash;we are perfectly frank and above-board about it &mdash;is that we have a Governor-General inherited from the years of the Treaty &mdash;from the Treaty itself&mdash;and we do propose, while working within the constitutional and Treaty position, to take constitutional steps to reduce that office to what we think is the negligible factor it ought to be while it has to be there at all.  We do not propose to pretend to the Irish people that there is any necessity in the world for a Governor-General, whether he is to have the works and pomps of the Viceregal Lodge, as formerly, or whether he is to be reduced to the terms of living of an ordinary citizen. That is not the point.  The point is that it is an anomaly and an anachronism to have a Governor-General in this country.  The power in this country properly rests in the Executive Council selected by the people.  Within that body only should such power be.  It is our purpose to take every step at the earliest opportunity to remove any <Col N="1547" /> semblance of authority which is not arising from the people, vested in the Executive Council and carried out by them, without any representative of any external authority.</P>
      <P>The points which Senator Milroy raised do not require an explanation within the terms of this particular amending Bill.  I do not propose to go into the arguments with regard to the position under Article 2 of the Treaty. I should, however, point out to the Senator and other Senators that we have accepted the position&mdash;that our position, like the position of all the other countries of the Commonwealth, is one of gradual growth.  So far as we are concerned, we want that gradual growth to be as speedy as possible.  I refer the Senator to the reports of the different Commonwealth Conferences that have been held.  At the Commonwealth Conference of 1929, the proceedings of which were approved by the Commonwealth Conference of 1930, it was laid down as a recommendation with regard to discretionary reservation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>As regards the continued existence of the power of reservation, certain Dominions possessed the power, by amending their Constitutions, to abolish the discretionary power and to repeal any provisions requiring reservation of Bills dealing with particular subjects and it is, therefore, open to those Dominions to take the prescribed steps to that end, if they so desire.</P>
      <P>It is in the spirit of that recommendation we are immediately acting.  I quote that partially as justification for our line of action in bringing in these three amending Bills to-day.</P>

      <P>This Bill proposes to do a certain thing and only one thing. It is quite within the competence of this House of the Oireachtas to pass the Bill to do that specific thing. Senator Milroy referred to Article 73 which states:</P>
      <P>Subject to this Constitution and to the extent to which they are inconsistent therewith, the laws in force in the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution shall continue to be of full force and effect until the same or any of them shall have been repealed or amended by enactment of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Even Article 73 indicates, by implication, that there is power within the Oireachtas to amend any law whatsoever, because there is no qualification therein.  Even under Article 73, we are empowered to do this.  But irrespective of whether that Article does stipulate that or not, we have and we mean to maintain the right of the sovereign authority of this Oireachtas and it is for that purpose more than anything else that these amending Bills are here.  I do not think there is anything in Senator Milroy's statement.  If there were it would be adequately covered if we <Col N="1549" /> want to refer to the Statute of Westminster which further confirms the powers within this State to carry out what measures it likes either in regard to constitutional amendments or otherwise, and that is the accepted position everywhere else in every other Dominion.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to terminate the right of appeal to the Privy Council.  The scheme of the Bill is simple.  It proposes, first of all, <Col N="1550" /> to delete the provision to Article 66 of the Constitution.  That proviso is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that nothing in this Constitution shall impair the right of any person to petition His Majesty for special leave to appeal from the Supreme Court to His Majesty in Council or the right of His Majesty to grant such leave.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill further proposes the insertion of a new enactment in Article 66 of the Constitution in lieu of the proviso now to be deleted.  The new enactment is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And no appeal shall lie from a decision of the Supreme Court or of any other court in the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) to His Majesty in Council, and it shall not be lawful for any person to petition His Majesty for leave to bring any such appeal.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The House will observe that this new enactment is being made part of the Constitution itself.  When this Bill becomes law not only will the proviso to Article 66, which preserves the right of appeal, have disappeared, but there will be enacted in its place a new law of the Constitution expressly providing that no such right of appeal exists and making it unlawful and unconstitutional for any person to apply for leave to bring any such appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing the principle of this Bill I must emphasise, first of all, the constitutional and international necessity of the step we are now taking.  It is the policy of the present Government to place the judicial sovereignty of the Irish Free State beyond all question.  A fully organised modern State contains within itself all the institutions of government, the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary.  A State, from the decisions of whose courts an appeal lies to any court of tribunal or authority outside itself, cannot be said to possess judicial sovereignty in the fullest sense. Can any Senator visualise an arrangement between, say, France and Germany, whereby an appeal from the tribunals of supreme jurisdiction in one of those countries should lie to some <Col N="1551" /> authority in the other?  I think the House will agree that the continued existence of the Privy Council appeal constitutes an invasion of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of this country, the decisions of which should, as the authors of the Constitution originally intended, be final and conclusive and not subject to review or appeal by any other authority whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to labour this question any further.  The Bill itself has been under discussion for many years.  It was the intention of our predecessors in office to introduce this Bill long since.  For some reason or another it was held up.  We feel the time has now come when any question of appeal to the Privy Council or to any court at all outside this country should go and that we, exercising our full functions in the judicial and in every other sense, must prevent any appeal going to any outside court.</P>
    <P>I might mention that in the discussion on this Bill certain statements were made and these were confirmed by an article that appeared in one of the papers, the <i>Irish Times</i>, on last Saturday.  I would like to refer briefly to this.  In the last ten days it has been definitely stated by Professor Thrift and by the <i>Irish Times</i> that the concession of regarding the right of appeal to the Privy Council was part of a bargain which won ex-Unionists' assent for the Irish Treaty of 1921. I wish to use this opportunity to state categorically that, having examined all the records of the negotiations and discussions of that period, I can find no trace whatever of any such bargain.  Perhaps I should also express astonishment that an Irish newspaper could warn the British Government to be careful about tolerating constitutional advances in Ireland lest the precedent should be used to the disadvantage of the British in India.  That such anti-national views could be expressed is, in itself, an example of the unparalleled tolerance existing in this State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> Talking about the matter of tolerance, most of us will remember that in 1930, when this question was up before, two eminent ecclesiastics contributed a letter to the paper.  I will read the letter for you to remind you of what happened:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We would remind you that memories in Ireland are long and that the removal from the Constitution of the safeguard referred to, or the consent of Great Britain to its exercise only with the consent of the Supreme Court in Ireland (as has been suggested), or any similar abrogation or limitation, while it may gratify the desire of Irishmen for independence, will inevitably weaken the security enjoyed by the members of a vulnerable minority, and as time passes lead most certainly to infringements of their liberty which they would be powerless to withstand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it can be reasonably argued that the statement by Professor Thrift in the other House and the leading article to which I have referred more or less reiterate that point of view and I think it is quite unfair and would be quite wrong on my part to let such statements go by without denying them in the way I have.  I have gone to considerable personal trouble to examine all the records and there is no vestige of foundation for the suggestion that any such bargain, as I think Professor Thrift called it, was even discussed, and for a leading morning paper to write in the terms the <i>Irish Times</i> did indicates something that is, to say the least of it, decidedly undesirable in this country.</P>
    <P>I think that those of us who have lived in Ireland realise how little legal protection those in the minority need in order to safeguard their interests in the Twenty-Six Counties of Ireland. The Bill, as I say, definitely refuses to any citizen the right of appeal.  That, I think, is only fair and just.  It is only fair and just that our Supreme Court should be really supreme.  That is the feeling of the Irish people.  Of <Col N="1553" /> that there is no question.  It is the feeling of the two big Parties, irrespective of anything else, and I think it is the feeling of the big majority of the minority.</P>
    <P>The other question that may arise on this Bill is with regard to any steps that may be taken to allow appeals to the Privy Council pending the passing into law of this Bill.  Every necessary step, whether by legislation or otherwise, will be taken to nullify any attempt to go to the Privy Council. The Bill is clear.  It had been long under discussion by our predecessors and we feel that the time is now ripe to put it into operation.  We ask your assent to the passing of this Bill which amends the right of appeal to the Privy Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>With this Bill, as with the other two Bills, it is a matter of yes or no.  The Bills do not lend themselves to amendment.  As far as I can sense the feeling of the House, I think that these Bills will pass by a large majority and largely on their merits, in the minds of the members of the House.  In such case what is the proper course for a member of the House who, like myself, holds that such legislation is hurtful to the national and true interests of the nation?  Should I sit down and say nothing?  No.  I hold an opinion which is shared by very few others in this House.  Knowing, however, that there would be no question of an effective division on the issue, I hold, rightly or wrongly, that I ought to give expression to my views on these Bills, so long as the members of the Seanad will listen to me.  I shall be as brief as possible because there is no hope of altering the views of the members by what I have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My remarks may be taken as having the same reference to the other two Bills.  My objection to this Bill is not on strictly constitutional or legal grounds.  I do not propose to criticise it on strict constitutional or legal grounds.  On that issue I see no use in going into anything beyond the text of the Treaty, the text of the Constitution, and the text of the confirming Acts.  These are the three things to be considered in connection with this <Col N="1554" /> Bill.  In a matter of this kind it is no use bringing in anything that has been said or is alleged to have been said during the negotiations out of which the Treaty arose.  I think that is a waste of time and in any case I have no special information.  Therefore I do not propose to touch on those matters at all.</P>
    <P>The question of an appeal to His Majesty in Council is not in the Treaty at all, so that this would not be an infringement of the Treaty.  If it were it would not constitute a precedent. It does not constitute a precedent for indeed the Treaty has been effectively broken already.  I do not think that this Bill should be criticised very much on those lines, but it can be criticised having due regard to these matters. Such a provision as providing for appeal to the Privy Council would be useless unless the relationship between the Governments concerned is friendly and unless the Governments concerned are prepared to implement whatever judgment may be passed by the Privy Council.  Otherwise this right of appeal would be quite useless. Because unless you implement that judgment you might as well not have it.</P>
    <P>As regards the Treaty, I think this Bill is strictly opposed to its spirit. What I have in mind is the spirit of the thing that is expressed by the last of the Confirming Acts of 1925&mdash;this kind of thing:&mdash;&ldquo;Resolved mutually to aid one another in a spirit of neighbourly comradeship.&rdquo;  This legislation is opposed to that spirit and to that extent these Bills are ethically open to criticism.  That is why I am opposed to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The question is whether all this is in the true interests of the nation.  All this legislation, as the Minister has told you, is one step further away from England, out of what is officially described as the Community of Nations known as the British Empire.  Many Senators in this House may want that. A great many in the country no doubt do not want it.  The Minister certainly does want it, but it does not follow necessarily that it is the wise course or the right course in the long run.  I venture to assert that hatreds are the producers <Col N="1555" /> of bad judgment.  This is admittedly a whitling process.  It amounts eventually to the issue whether we remain in the Empire or go out or in effect be put out.  You cannot always continue to eat your cake and have it.  There is not admittedly very much cake.  Those who want to gratify their antipathies and go out of the Empire should count the cost of going out.  Many think it is better to be isolated, to go out and go on hating.  I think myself it is extremely foolish and time will show it, though I hope it will not, because if the matter gets to that it will be too late.  I think it is greatly to the detriment of this nation to go in for that sort of policy.  It is immeasurably more important to us to try even at some sacrifice of prejudices and antipathies to be on good terms with our neighbours.  I feel bound to ventilate these views which I hold, which are the views held by a great many in this House and held by a great many in the country.  I think these views ought to be expressed and that is why I have given expression to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have believed for a great many years and I am still absolutely of the same opinion that the largest amount of freedom and the greatest amount of happiness and success for this country will be found in association with the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Yet, nevertheless, when a member of the Constitution Committee I felt strongly when any form of words which suggested domination by any outside authority was at stake even if that might have little or no effect in itself, if it was something which would make it harder for many people in this country to appreciate my view of our position in the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular question of an appeal to the Privy Council is a matter which I have opposed both in writing and in speech ever since I have been a member of this House and I can assure Senator Bagwell that I do so not because I believe that it is desirable to quarrel with our neighbours, or because I want to get <Col N="1556" /> outside the British Commonwealth.  I am sure, however, that what he says is true&mdash;that views somewhat like those which have been expressed by him are held by a number of people and that they have been held by a number of people through some very grave and very serious misunderstanding. I spoke at very considerable length years ago in this House on the general merits, or otherwise, of an appeal to an outside court, and I do not propose to go in detail into the matter now, but even if the Minister had not referred to it, it was my intention when this Bill came before the Seanad to refer to a speech made by Professor Thrift and to a leading article in, I think, the <i>Irish Times.</i> The Minister referred to a letter which was written by two Protestant Archbishops some time ago and I felt, as one who is in a minority and expects always to be in a minority in this country, that it was my duty then to put in the Press a contrary view to that expressed by them.  I am still of the same opinion, but I should like particularly to refer to the view expressed by Professor Thrift that some kind of a promise, some kind of an agreement, had been made to the small minority in this country commonly referred to as ex-Unionists, that their support for the Treaty could be won by maintaining not a right to appeal, because that never existed, but a right to ask for leave to appeal to the Privy Council.</P>
    <P>I can in some measure confirm what has been said by the Minister.  I was a member of the Constitution Drafting Committee and I think I can say that I did not miss any meeting of that committee.  We had consultations with the then Ministers of the Provisional Government, and this matter of the Privy Council came before us and a very considerable time was spent in considering it.  I am perfectly satisfied that if the members of the Provisional Government had been a party to, or had actual knowledge of, any such promise or agreement on their part, we would have had knowledge of it, particularly in view of the fact that we had reached the conclusion that to make a provision for applications for <Col N="1557" /> leave to appeal in the Constitution would be a mistake and that it would be much better that it should not be included in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that there is a suspicion that there may have been certain people in another country who gave assurances because there are few members of this Oireachtas for whom I have more respect than Deputy Thrift and I am perfectly certain that he did not make the statement he did make without having some reason to believe what was stated in it.  I am also quite certain that certain other people who believed that some such pledge or promise was given would never have made the statement without some reason.  Personally, I am convinced that the promise, if any, was not made on behalf of the Provisional Government and was not made on this side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. MacEllin Mr. MacEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say, but it was stated that some such promise was made.  I am not expressing the opinion that any such promise was made, and I feel certain that there must have been some misunderstanding, otherwise the statements would not have been made.  It must have been made in some other country.  I am giving that only as my own personal opinion, but what I want to say is that even if any such promise was made to the minority, it would have been a farce because you would have been promising something which could not have been, under any conceivable circumstances, effective.  The inherent right of the subject in the British Empire, as it was then called, to ask His Majesty for leave to appeal in order to redress some legal injustice was part and parcel of the Colonial development of Great Britain, and so long as the British Parliament was supreme and had powers over the Colonial legislatures, that appeal was an effective appeal.  I am not dealing with its merits but with its effectiveness. As soon as it became established that the Parliament at Westminster had no power to pass laws against the wishes of the Dominions, it became <Col N="1558" /> perfectly plain that the appeal would be useless.  I should like to draw the attention of persons who are interested in the position of minorities here and who feel that they have a grievance to a letter which was published in <i>The Times</i> almost immediately after the publication of the Irish Free State Constitution and sent to <i>The Times</i> by Professor Berriedale Keith in which he pointed out that no power whatever existed to force the Free State Parliament to implement any decision of the Privy Council.  It is quite true that pressure was brought to bear and with some reluctance a provision was inserted&mdash;I forget the exact article&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>A Senator says &ldquo;Canadian.&rdquo; It might have been held on a very strict reading that because of the reference to Canada in the Treaty, the Canadian precedent should have applied, but it was clearly understood at the time&mdash;and I have the clearest possible recollection of the discussions &mdash;that the Canadian precedent would not apply, the Canadian precedent being not applicable in view of the fact that Canada was a federal State and that the Irish Free State being a unitary Dominion, the only proper precedents that could apply would be those from South Africa.  As the House may possibly remember, it was in fact the South African precedent that was held to apply in the first case that came, I think, from the then <i>Freeman's Journal</i> newspaper, in which an attempt was made to ask for leave to appeal.  That application for leave to appeal was refused and a long judgment <Col N="1559" /> was given by the late Viscount Haldane almost entirely on the ground that the South African precedent applied and that, therefore, leave could not be given against the wishes of the Attorney-General as representing the Government of the Free State.</P>
      <P>At a later date&mdash;we all know the history&mdash;certain leave was given and the Executive, feeling themselves aggrieved and feeling that what was a clear understanding was not being carried out, decided to make the position clear beyond any possible doubt, and legislation was introduced after leave had been granted, but before any actual appeal took place.  I think it is perfectly obvious to every person, whatever be the general point of view in this House, that that, though perhaps inevitable, was a bad way and an unsatisfactory way of doing it, and that it is very much better that the position on which we are practically unanimous here should be dealt with as it is dealt with in this Bill.  For that reason it unquestionably has my approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite sure whether we have completely got over all the difficulties, but that will have to wait.  It is clear in this Bill that any citizen of the Saorstát who asks for leave to appeal will be acting illegally, but it is not clear that there is any penalty for acting illegally.  If there is a dispute involving Irish law here and one of the litigants is a citizen of Great Britain and if that citizen asks for leave to appeal, and if the Privy Council grants that leave he would not be acting illegally, but what is clear is that if he is foolish enough to do that, the position will be the same as it was before because there is no power whatever either in the British Parliament or the British Privy Council to enforce any of its decisions and any such application or any such appeal would only be most unfortunate.  It would seem, of course, a vital matter to minorities in this country if they thought they could not get protection within the country to seek to get that right through an outside court.  If the law, as a result of judgments of the Supreme Court here, proved unfair to minorities, it is <Col N="1560" /> the duty of the Oireachtas to right that as soon as possible, and if the Parliament of a country is not willing to do so minorities would be helpless or would appear to be helpless.  But I want to emphasise the fact that I think a wrong impression is given by well-meaning people if they lead others to believe that some kind of safeguard for minorities is taken away by this Bill.  I am satisfied that nothing of the kind is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Bill.  I was very glad that the Minister in his explanatory remarks made such emphatic assertion of his determination, and the determination of the Executive Council to uphold the sovereignty of the Saorstát.  It is indeed a welcome change from the conditions that existed when the only challenge to the Saorstát supremacy came from the Minister and the colleagues and associates of the Minister, when the predecessors of the present Government had not only to uphold the sovereignty of the State, but maintain its existence against the attacks of the now stalwart defenders of the authority and sovereignty of the Saorstát. I am glad to see that change. There is more joy in heaven at one sinner doing penance than 99 just men. As penitence has resulted I think we will have to apply either to the Minister for Agriculture or to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries to kill one of our fatted calves in order to celebrate the conversion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer in passing to what I mentioned in connection with the previous Bill: that the situation which makes for the passing of this Bill is the fruit of the work of the predecessors of the present Government. The gentleman whom Senator Douglas quoted, Professor Berriedale Keith, referred to this matter in a book which he wrote in 1929.  He said: &ldquo;The Minister for External Affairs has worked patiently for the aggrandisement of the status of the Free State.&rdquo; I do not want any misconception to emerge from the debate or from the impassioned declaration of the Minister in support of the sovereignty of the State.  I do not want any misleading <Col N="1561" /> ideas to emerge, such as, that this Bill and what it proposes to secure is the work of the gentlemen in the possession of a very brief authority&mdash; very brief indeed&mdash;in the Irish Free State.  I think it is a good thing that this Bill should pass.  I think it is a good thing that appeals to the Privy Council should disappear.  I think it is a bad principle that a citizen of one State should appeal to the authority of some tribunal external to the State, for redress if he feels aggrieved.  Not only is that a bad principle but, as Senator Douglas pointed out, it is futile.  That particular provision is futile so far as anything could be done to give effect to any decision which such an appellant might secure in an external court.  The retention of such a provision, which some of our friends will desires, gives no safeguard in appeal to what they consider a higher tribunal than the Supreme Court of this country.  The existence of such an appeal is futile as it would place the Supreme Court of this State in subordination to some external tribunal.  That, I think, is entirely undesirable.  I think that the term &ldquo;minority&rdquo; ought to fall into desuetude like some other formalities in the Constitution and ought to be forgotten. There ought to be equality of citizenship, and categories and classifications, by which men were known in pre-Treaty days, should be forgotten, and new alignments made regardless of creed or political opinions or bygone days.  As long as they are good citizens there is no necessity to consider them as minorities, looking outside the State for sustenance and support.</P>
    <P>One other point which I shall put in the form of a query to the Minister. I have still the temerity to interrogate the Minister though my last queries addressed to him received very scant attention or courtesy, so much so that doubtless it will seem to him great effrontery on my part again to address an interrogation to him.  I think it is important that he should give an expression of opinion upon a matter that I am going to raise now.  In 1930 the Imperial Conference in discussing the question of appeal to the Privy <Col N="1562" /> Council, more or less, came to an agreement for its abolition and were considering some kind of alternative tribunal, somewhat differently constituted from that of the Privy Council, for the consideration of disputes that might arise between different members of the Commonwealth.  There was general agreement amongst the delegates of the Dominions that such a tribunal was desirable.  The proposal was supported by the representative of the Irish Free State with the reservation that the International Court of the Hague should be available as a final court of appeal.  I should like to know, and I think it is very pertinent to this case, as this matter was raised at the Imperial Conference in 1930, and as we are discussing the matter of abolition of appeal to the Privy Council, what is the attitude of the present Executive Council towards the idea of the Dominion of Commonwealth Tribunal to discuss matters that might be at issue between the different Dominions. I think it might possibly help to throw a gleam of light on the possible solution of some of our present urgent problems if an intelligent and clear answer to that query were given now by the Minister in charge of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to say as regards queries to Ministers, that it is hardly fair on the Second Stage of a Bill to ask any query which would possibly require a good deal of research. On other stages of Bills the Minister in charge has notification of the matters likely to be raised and I should never urge the Minister to answer questions on the spur of the moment which would involve perhaps an amount of research.  I do not think it is fair or reasonable.  For that reason, it must be left to the discretion of the Minister whether he desires to answer the Senator's question or not. I shall certainly not urge him to do so.</P>

      <P>I was rising to make a statement somewhat similar to that which you, sir, have just made because it seems to me that the questions which were asked by Senator Milroy on a previous Bill raised very important matters of constitutional law.  It <Col N="1563" /> would be quite impossible for any Minister, unless he had been thinking of nothing else for some months, to answer such questions on the spur of the moment.  Further than that, I have not fortified myself with the material, but I think Senator Milroy is misstating the position of the representatives of the last Government at the Imperial Conference, when the question of the Inter-Commonwealth Tribunal was proposed.  If my memory serves me aright, I am fairly clear on this point, that the report of the tribunal indicates pretty clearly that some members, indicating the representatives of the Irish Free State, did not approve of the proposal to set up such a tribunal.  It was agreed that if a question arose which required to be determined as between the members of the Commonwealth, and such a tribunal were set up, it should be of a certain character.  I am very nearly certain that the attitude of the Saorstát representatives was against the setting up of an Inter-Commonwealth Tribunal.  That can be verified perhaps by the Minister on later stages of the discussion of the Bill, but certainly I should not like it to go out from this House, without contradiction, that statements of British Ministers, appropriate to other subjects and other disputes, are being confirmed in this House.  I am very confident that statements made by British Ministers, and apparently confirmed by Senator Milroy, are not based on a proper reading of the records of that time.</P>

      <P>I feel, like Senator Bagwell, that although in a minority I shall have to make some remarks on this Bill before we finally pass it into the limbo of treaties or understandings <Col N="1564" /> that are no longer to be honoured.  It stands in a different category to the first two matters.  The first two matters you might say are like certain heraldic emblems that no longer serve a purpose and those who object to their passing away do so on sentimental grounds but, as the President himself said in the Dáil, there is substance in this Bill.  It deals with the form of appellate jurisdiction which is recognised and valued by several of the Dominions as evolved out of old historical associations.  Its need was shown when less than 100 years ago the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was put on a more or less systematic basis.</P>
      <P>I propose to make a few remarks on the three heads&mdash;first, on the sanctity; secondly, on the utility; and thirdly, on the opportunity that the opposition to this Bill suggests that it can afford to those who are opposed to it.  The President said that there was no bargain.  Senator Douglas, who was behind the scenes at the time, has no knowledge of any understanding.  That being so, why is it that the provision in the Constitution appears under such a rather unusual form?  It appears as a proviso, and there is a strong suggestion that it was not in the original draft but added subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest it was on the representations, perhaps, on the pressure, of certain parties, and with a certain object that it was inserted, with the object, if you like, of affording a safeguard to certain citizens who thought it was a safeguard. The other contracting party accepted it.  I do not suggest for a moment that it was put there of their own volition.  To that extent I suggest it constitutes an undertaking and its removal now is a breach of that undertaking.  After all, there is a bargain.  Bargains are made on the Stock Exchange purely by word of mouth and very seldom repudiated. Bargains are frequently made in vague writing, a vague form of words, that would never stand the <Col N="1565" /> test of law and they are honoured by all right-minded people.  In fact, out of that we evolved the term &ldquo;gentleman's agreement&rdquo; and I suggest a great many things that have been put in this Blue Paper, even if they might not strictly stand the test of law, are in the nature of &ldquo;gentlemen's agreements,&rdquo; just as binding between those who have agreed to them as any formal legal contract. For that reason I place very little value on those metaphysical points, as to what the reading of the Constitution is or what the reading of the Treaty in relation to the Constitution should have been.  I prefer to apply to these documents the reading of the ordinary plain citizen and I suggest the reading of the ordinary plain citizen gives to these things the character of what I am pleased to call &ldquo;gentlemen's agreements.&rdquo;  I need not go at any length into what has happened since the Treaty in relation to appeal jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>From the very first it was clear the Government did not intend to accept the understanding, whatever it was, but I would point out, just for the purpose of historical accuracy, that the late Kevin O'Higgins, as Minister for Justice, said that although his Government objected to any general arrangement for an appeal, he conceived certain cases in which an appeal would be appropriate.  He cited in that connection the Wigg and Cochrane case, which was obviously a most appropriate case for appeal to such a tribunal.  That went to appeal. It went to rehearing, yet the Government did not honour that judgement.  The effect of the whole of its action up to date in connection with this matter has, I suggest, been most unfortunate.  However much gratification we may take to ourselves it has materially damaged our prestige abroad, and we cannot live in blissful and happy isolation of what other people think about us.  I suggest that it has marred the otherwise very good work of the first ten years of national reconstruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the utility of this right of appeal, certain speakers regard this attribute of sovereignty as <Col N="1566" /> a pearl, so to speak, beyond all price. I would suggest that while sovereignty may be valued it has to be taken in relation to actual fact and that, to put it metaphorically, very few people would prefer an Irish hair-shirt to a softer substance of foreign manufacture. I think there are very few people, however much they may talk about sovereignty, who would not welcome and enjoy the good things of this world wherever they may come from. I suggest that sovereignty is not an absolute test; it is the service, what you get out of any arrangement.  I strongly suggest to the House that there are cogent reasons for some form of appellate jurisdiction, not necessarily this kind, but that this should be taken as sufficient until something different and better is put in its place. When certain interests in the past pressed, as they press to-day, for this form of appellate judicature, it is not because they believed our courts were corrupt.  They did, however, feel that there are big issues, not alone of domestic concern, which can be better tried by a court on which men of wide judicial experience and knowledge habitually sit.  Indeed our own judges &mdash;and I mark this&mdash;might sit there if we accepted the Commonwealth bond in the proper spirit.  It is absurd to suggest that such a court is political or biased.  Before the Treaty the then Irish Court of Appeal was reversed five times in one year by the House of Lords.  It seems to me as a layman that our judicial system would be better for a third court as a kind of referee between the present High Court and the Supreme Court when they do not agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently we had the extraordinary case where two judges of the High Court on full hearing and two judges of the High Court on a substantial partial hearing were reversed by two judges of the Supreme Court on an issue of great importance and great legal complexity.  I suggest that appellate jurisdiction of this kind is most appropriate to deal with such a case.  You have another case now very much of the kind suggested by <Col N="1567" /> the late Kevin O'Higgins as suitable for appeal, that is this Killester case, where the money involved is British Treasury money, where the whole of the machinery set up was under British Acts, where this Government has really no concern at all except almost technically as trustees, which should and could appropriately be dealt with on appeal to the Privy Council.  I can also conceive in the future, without any apprehension as to the justice and integrity of our courts or their judicial eminence, that cases might arise where a body, say, like the Church of Ireland, having assets on both sides of the Border, might be seriously embarrassed by a judgement in this country and where some form of appeal would only be just and proper.</P>
      <P>I should like to examine for one moment the arguments put forward by the Government in defence of this measure.  The first is that this is a derogation of sovereignty.  Where, all down the ages, has sovereignty ever been complete?  I do not know to what extent we are tied into the Locarno Treaty.  If we are in any way tied into that, our sovereignty is most substantially imperilled.  I take it we are tied into the Kellogg Pact.  There, of course, our sovereignty has been largely surrendered.  If we really wanted to be logical in this matter, we ought to get away at once from all the limitations of sovereignty that the Treaty involves, not in dribs and drabs of matters which are more or less technically vestigia from old practice, but substantially come out and declare a republic and do something definite to mark that desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another argument applied is this test of national prestige.  We all like sovereignty, we all value nationality when it gives service, but to take nationality as a test, irrespective of consequences or fact, is to apply the test every bit as tyrannically as the old religious tests which have been abolished long ago as archaic and unjust.  Of course the Government are on much safer ground when they apply the example of their predecessors.  I can only say that I am sorry they should follow them only in the bad.  If <Col N="1568" /> they would also follow them somewhat in the good I think they would be somewhat more consistent.  The Statute of Westminster, I have no doubt, gave legal sanction for a measure of this kind; but I would remind the House that when it was suggested to put into the Statute of Westminster certain limitations of its use the then President Cosgrave wrote a letter asking that that should not be done and said the people could be trusted to honour their obligations.  I am not quite certain that in all cases that trust has been amply fulfilled.</P>
    <P>I come to the last heading now, that of opportunity.  In this respect I make no appeal to the present Government or its supporters.  Their attitude is consistent up to a certain point.  They in no way wish to cultivate better relations within the Commonwealth, or, if they do wish, they are going a very strange way about it.  I say that their attitude was consistent up to a certain point.  It appears to be leading to the brink of a republic.  They hesitate for some reason to take the final step.  I do, however, make a very serious and heartfelt appeal to the new Party.  I make it at a not inappropriate time, at a time when fusion is taking place and their policy is being recast and reconsidered.  Now, I would ask that Party seriously to consider whether it has ever paid, as one may say, to talk with two voices, to go over to conferences and plead wholehearted devotion to the Commonwealth, admittedly maintaining its dignity and independence, and to honour the Sovereign in all sartorial externals and yet, at the same time, come back home and sort of explain away that action in the hope of attracting some waverers or moderate people from the republican cause.  I would suggest that ten years' experience of that policy has yielded very little result, and what I would suggest to this Party is to leave all that&mdash;let it be the province of the Left or of the Republican Party or whatever you like to call it&mdash;and to make no attempt to capture young people so minded, but on the other hand to acknowledge frankly and in full spiritual feeling allegiance to the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> I would suggest that policy is sound for two reasons.  First of all, it is good business.  As Senators know, there is great competition under the new tariff proposals to get a stand in the British market, and it is only natural that the British people will be more sympathetic to those who are sympathetic, and honestly and openly friendly, to them. I would suggest also that in doing so we have regard to the side on which our bread is buttered.  Not long ago some people were doubtful of the wisdom of this policy, in view of the suggested collapse of Great Britain, but I think the last two years have shown that Great Britain is rather one of the bright spots in the European group of nations.  Its currency is sound; its prestige at Geneva is certainly high; its trade is recovering, and in every way it is good business to cultivate, and not just on one side of one's face, frankly and openly these good relations.  I suggest further that it is good politics.</P>
    <P>I may not know Ireland as well as some people in this House, but I doubt that those who claim to know Ireland very well know it very much better than I do.  I would suggest that a very large number of people in this country&mdash;I do not say a majority but a very large number not far short of a majority&mdash;are as loyal to the Commonwealth and the Empire&mdash;you can take whichever word you like, but do not let us split words about Empire domination and all that nonsense&mdash;as the people of Australia or New Zealand, and all that they are waiting for to-day is a lead.  It would be good politics for the new Party to give them that lead.  For that reason I do suggest, although it may be too much to ask them to vote against this measure in view of their past commitments, that now is the time for the new Party to take stock and say: we stand for a wide open outlook, we have the healthy cosmopolitan outlook of getting the good things whenever we can, and of bringing our country forward into the comity of nations in its full general spirit, and of leaving all these rather narrow introspective tests of nationality and sumptuary conditions to the other Party.  Let us <Col N="1570" /> have a new orientation and no longer the old divisions.  Let the Fianna Fáil policy be that of introspection and of intensive nationality, but let the policy of the new Party, the Fine Gael Party, be that of generous co-operation with the world.  Let it not be ashamed of being accused of being pro-Britain and all the rest of it, because whatever it does it will be accused of that. I do hope that the discussion on this Bill will open up that point of view and that it will be pursued by the new Party in the future.</P>

      <P>The last speaker has provided any Minister with ample scope to forget all about this Bill and to go on to a political discussion.  I have not, for a very long time, heard such an interesting professorial lecture on what the different Parties ought to do.  As I am not a member of the Party apparently to which Senator Sir John Keane has referred, I suppose I ought not to take any interest in that, but I have no doubt that the remarks the Senator has made will be taken note of in the proper quarter.

      <P>I merely mentioned that I am sure that the advisory remarks which the Senator addressed to the House will be taken note of by the Party concerned.  At this stage I would like to express my satisfaction at finding such a complete, an almost complete, unanimity in the advice that we of the Fianna Fáil Administration are getting to be out and out Republicans.  It seems to me that the Seanad is going to turn turtle altogether and to become the extreme Republican House of the two&mdash;the extreme Republican voice of the country.  That, however, does not divert me from the main thing that I would like to deal with arising out of Senator Sir John Keane's remarks in connection with bargains or agreements, verbal or other agreements. In dealing with that I want to make it clear that I am also dealing with Senator Douglas's analysis of Professor Thrift's statement and the leading article which appeared in <Col N="1571" /> the <i>Times.</i>  Senator Sir John Keane indicated that something may have happened in the way of a gentleman's agreement during the discussion on the Constitution.  Senator Douglas referred to the fact that no such agreements arose during the discussions on the Constitution.  I want to make it clear to Senators that what I think Professor Thrift had in mind was something entirely different, namely, something that arose at the time of the Treaty discussions.  With a view to trying to get clarity on what Professor Thrift did say in the Dáil I shall read for the House portion of his speech.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I cannot imagine myself as being a party to any appeal to the Privy Council, but the fact remains&mdash;and it is a very simple fact&mdash;that this is part of a bargain.  I do not refer to the bargain made with the British people; I do refer to the bargain made with your own nationals.  The support of those nationals was obtained to the Treaty very largely because certain concessions were made by those who were going against the British Government at the time.  This was one of those concessions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now it is specific, it is definite, and links up the supposed bargain with the Treaty or pre-Treaty position.  What I want to make clear is that I have examined in detail all the discussions. There is no correspondence with regard to these discussions and communications, apparently, dealing in detail with what took place with the Southern Unionists.  In no case is there the slightest reference by implication or suggestion that the question of the Privy Council was discussed either in correspondence or verbally. There are reports of verbal discussions, so that when Senator Douglas refers to the fact that these matters did not arise when discussing the Constitution he is not right. What I wanted to make clear, when Professor Thrift indicated that they were a preceding factor before the Treaty was effected is that such is not the case.</P>

Senator Sir John Keane has indicated that a great many of the minority felt that this was a safeguard.  I want to reiterate that the minority in this country have got their own courts, their own Parliament, and proportional representation.  I want to know of any country in the world where a minority has the same privileges, the same protection, the same freedom, and the same equal justice handed out to them as exists in the Twenty-Six Counties of the Irish Free State.</P>

      <P>I have just quoted from a newspaper.  Senator Milroy has been very emphatic about the fact that this proposal to amend the Constitution in the form in which we have put it before the House was conceived, intimated, declared, decreed and all the rest by our predecessors in office. We have never attempted to dispute that.  We claim no credit for putting this ordinary measure of adjustment through the Oireachtas.  One of the most satisfactory statements made in <Col N="1573" /> this House was made to me by the late Minister for Finance when a certain case was being discussed in 1929. When I asked him then in a comparatively brief speech, what they proposed to do with this measure and with this problem of the Privy Council, he indicated clearly that they intended to abolish the right of appeal to the Privy Council.  He also intimated, at that time very definitely, having a certain case in mind, that they proposed to take such steps by legislation or otherwise as would annul the effect of any decision of the Privy Council itself.  I should point out, however, that that was in 1929, and that this is 1933. What the reason for the delay was I do not know.  The fact remains that we have taken as early an opportunity as we had of having this measure brought forward.  We feel that the fact that it was brought forward or conceived by our predecessors in office is not an argument against the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Milroy asked some specific questions.  He complained that there was perhaps scant courtesy in dealing with an earlier question, on one of the other measures.  There was no discourtesy intended.  As Senator Johnson pointed out, the fact remains that a highly technical and legal problem arose on which I, certainly, would not presume to speak without having taken the precaution of being adequately briefed and having studied the question he put up.  The Senator then raised a question with regard to an appeal to the Inter-Commonwealth Tribunal.  This Bill deals with a different matter altogether.  The discussion on the Inter-Commonwealth Tribunal revolved around the problem of inter-Government disputes, disagreement between Governments, and even upon that it has to be remembered that certain agreements were essential before such a court or tribunal could be established.  The disputing parties had first to agree to go to such a court, and then they had to agree to the constitution of that court. The whole matter was entirely one of voluntary agreement, on which both parties would have to agree, first on the submission of their case to the court and, secondly, on the constitution <Col N="1574" /> of the court.  It has no relevancy whatever to the matter we are discussing.</P>
    <P>I submit that is all that has to be said with regard to the points that were raised.  The Senator made several references to matters that, I think, are hardly worth noticing, such as &ldquo;gentlemen dressed in a little brief authority,&rdquo; that one can hardly take seriously, or worry about.  Senator Sir John Keane's mind was running on somewhat similar lines when he spoke about attending various international conferences and consulting with other countries.  I think such discussions and such conferences as have been attended have been attended without any breach of either national dignity or giving away of national credit, that anything done at them has been open and above-board, and that our position has been clearly defined to all concerned, and to our people at home.</P>

    <P>This is a formal matter which provides that motor vehicles registered in the territory of one contracting party and circulating temporarily in the territory of another shall be exempt from taxes and charges levied on the circulation or possession of motor vehicles in the country visited, for a period of 90 days in the year.  Customs taxes on importation are not affected by the Convention; nor are charges on consumption, nor does the Convention apply to vehicles used for the public conveyance of passengers for payment or for the transport of persons and goods on a commercial basis.  Persons claiming the benefits of the exemption must hold an international fiscal permit, valid for one year from the date of issue, in a form prescribed by the Convention. The fiscal permits would be issued by the country of registration.  The Convention does not require anything, so far as its main obligations are concerned, that is not already provided for by the laws and regulations already in force in the Irish Free State.  Other European States have not, however, been so liberal.  It is considered, therefore, that advantages may result to Irish tourists abroad from the accession to the Convention by the Irish Free State and other States.</P>

      <P>The Unemployment Assistance Bill embodies provisions designed to secure that assistance will be given to able-bodied workers who are involuntarily unemployed and, consequently, unable to provide for the maintenance of themselves or their families.  This measure is one of a series of steps taken by the Government in order to deal with the unemployment situation existing in this country.  The Government came into office with a mandate to deal with unemployment and, to that end, adopt any course, no matter how original or drastic, which might be required. When we acquired office in March of last year we were hampered by the considerable difficulty that no reliable information as to unemployment existed.  For reasons not necessary to go into at this stage no attempt had been made prior to that to gauge the size of the problem or to procure information as to its nature, by which I mean classes of workers who were <Col N="1577" /> most affected by unemployment, their location, or other facts about them.</P>
      <P>The Government took steps early in 1932 to establish a reliable register of the unemployed by various administrative measures.  In the first place, facilities for registration were extended and, secondly, inducements to register were extended and, particularly, it was made conditional in respect of all work financed wholly or partly out of State funds that only persons registered as unemployed at employment exchanges could be considered.  The result of these measures meant that we established for the first time in the Saorstát a register of all the persons in the country who were seeking employment, a register which, although it was unreliable and inaccurate in certain respects, nevertheless gave us an opportunity of examining the unemployment problem in detail.  I say that the register was unreliable and inaccurate because, of course, it contained not merely the names of those in hardship because of unemployment but of all persons, no matter what their means, who were willing to take employment if offered to them.  It was also inaccurate because of certain administrative breakdowns which occurred in consequence of the greatly increased pressure of work upon outlying parts of the industry and commerce organisation&mdash; a breakdown which was, however, very quickly rectified.  When the information relating to unemployment had been secured and analysed a Committee of experts was established from the different Departments of State likely to be in a position to advise on the matter, to examine in detail proposals which, in broad principle, were similar to those now embodied in this Bill. That Committee met through last winter and reported to the Government. On receipt of its report the Government decided upon the outline of the measure now before the Seanad. The drafting of the Bill was then proceeded with and it was introduced in the Dáil at the end of the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is, of course, one of major importance.  It will bring about changes in the economic organisation <Col N="1578" /> of this country more than those which the Bill will directly effect.  On that account, it deserves very careful consideration. It got careful consideration from the Government before introduction and it will, I am sure, get equally careful consideration from the members of this House.  I give that account of the history of the measure in order to prevent, at the beginning of the discussion, any member of the Seanad from making the same mistake that other members of the Oireachtas appear to have made and which certain people, not yet in the Oireachtas, have also made.</P>
    <P>It has been asserted that this Bill represents the failure of the Government policy to provide employment through industrial development or otherwise.  I stated in the Dáil that, on the contrary, it represents the fulfilment of the Government's policy for dealing with unemployment.  When the Dáil met after the General Election of February, 1932, one of the first matters discussed was a motion moved by a member of the former Cumann na nGaedheal Party asking the Dáil to accept the principle that the obligation rested upon the State to ensure that work or maintenance be provided for all those who were unable to provide for themselves. That motion was adopted unanimously by the Dáil and, in the discussion on it, the Government's policy was made clear.  It was stated that our preference was to provide work, that we were proposing to carry out a certain industrial reorganisation which we expected would increase employment and, at the same time, that we were organising State schemes of work to deal with those who had to be provided for while industrialisation was taking place. We realised, however, and pointed out that no scheme for providing work which human wit could devise would be so elastic as to deal with the unemployment problem in every part of the country with equal fairness; in other words, that it was not possible to build up an organisation which would provide in each district the exact amount of employment required at the time it was required; <Col N="1579" /> that, consequently, it was necessary to have as a background to all our schemes for providing work some measure of this kind, the operation of which would ensure that while the organisation for provision of work was coming into effect, the hardship occasioned by involuntary unemployment would be alleviated.  Once the principle of providing for those who are deprived of the opportunity of providing for themselves is accepted, the scheme of the Bill before the House must also be accepted.  It is, I think, certain that any body of persons who accepted that principle and were given the task of devising a scheme for putting it into effect would produce a measure almost identical with that before the Seanad. If we were starting <i>de novo</i>, if we had in this country no measures for dealing with unemployment at all, a somewhat different scheme would be suggested.  But, having regard to the fact that there is in existence an organisation, built up with great care, extending throughout the whole country and staffed by a highly trained personnel, for dealing with unemployment, it naturally follows that we must try to graft the new scheme on to the old organisation to get efficient and speedy operation.</P>
    <P>The organisation to which I refer is that of the employment exchanges, through which the Unemployment Insurance Acts are administered. Members of the House are, I am sure, fully conversant with the general provisions of the unemployment insurance code and have some knowledge of the manner in which the employment exchanges work.  These exchanges are situated at all the principal centres of employment and are surrounded by branch offices extending into the rural towns.  These branch offices themselves maintain contact with the rural areas by a system of communication through the post office, so that even workers in remote parts of the country can, without trouble, register for employment and be notified where to present themselves when employment offers.  These employment exchanges have, of course, a special function to <Col N="1580" /> perform, apart altogether from the matters concerning the Unemployment Insurance Acts which affect them. Their original function, when brought into existence, was to provide an easy means by which employers seeking workmen could be put into touch with workmen seeking work.  To a large extent they are fulfilling that function. That is certainly the case for the last 12 months.  For some time earlier than 1932 that particular function of the employment exchanges was falling into abeyance and, on the average, only about 15,000 or 16,000 persons were placed in employment through the exchanges in each year&mdash;1931, 1930 and earlier.  In consequence of the changes effected by the present Government, that number increased last year to just 100,000.  The figure will be almost as large for the present year.  Through these exchanges the Unemployment Insurance Acts are administered.</P>
    <P>These Acts provide for the payment of contributions in respect of persons in insurable employment by employers and employed in equal measure, with an additional contribution by the State in respect of all such persons for each week of employment.  These payments go into the Unemployment Insurance Fund, from which insured workmen, when unemployed, become entitled to receive benefits at certain fixed rates. It is clear that these Acts do not adequately provide for our unemployment problem any more than they were found to provide for the unemployment problem of Great Britain, or the unemployment problem of other countries where similar schemes exist.</P>
    <P>There are two very distinct limitations upon the operation of the Acts. In the first place, no worker can secure more benefit than one day for each week in which he had been in employment. A stamp was affixed to his unemployment insurance card for each week he had worked and in respect of that stamp he got a day's benefit when unemployed.  The second limitation was that no matter how many stamps he had accumulated during his period of employment he could not receive benefit for more than 26 weeks in any one year.  In order to secure efficiency <Col N="1581" /> of administration and to take full advantage of the training in a very intricate code which a number of officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce have acquired, we have designed this Bill so as to make the method of administration as similar as possible to that of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  We have provided that every worker who complies with certain conditions will be entitled to get, on demand, a qualification certificate.  That qualification certificate can be secured by the worker at any time whether he is employed or unemployed and it corresponds to his insurance card under the existing Acts. When he is employed, the qualification certificate is in his possession, but when he wants to claim assistance under this measure he lodges his certificate with the appropriate exchange or branch exchange and, subject to conforming with certain other conditions, he becomes entitled to assistance.</P>
    <P>The qualifications for securing a qualification certificate are set out in Section 10.  There is the usual qualification that the person must be of Saorstát nationality and must be over 18 and under 70 years of age.  The main qualification, however, is that contained in paragraph (c) of subsection (3) of that section, which provides that the means of the person must not exceed £52 per year, if the person is resident in a country borough or the borough of Dun Laoghaire, or £39 if he is resident elsewhere.  There is, therefore, a means test.  A person who is the owner of land or property or has any other means exceeding the amount set out is disqualified from receiving assistance.  A person with means less than the maximum fixed there can only secure the scheduled rates of assistance less the amount of means which that person possesses, as calculated under this measure.  There are other qualifications which we can discuss in more detail on the Committee Stage.  My concern at the moment is merely to give you a general picture of the scheme of the measure.</P>
    <P>A person, having secured his qualification certificate, holds that certificate until he becomes unemployed. <Col N="1582" /> If he has been engaged in an insurable occupation, an occupation insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, he claims unemployment insurance benefit.  A person cannot secure unemployment assistance while he is entitled to receive unemployment insurance benefit.  Having secured unemployment insurance benefit for the period to which he is entitled to it, a person then makes a claim for unemployment assistance.  If a person has not been engaged in insurable employment such as, for example, an agricultural labourer, he applies forthwith, on becoming unemployed, for unemployment assistance. At that stage he has to comply with certain other conditions which are set out in Section 15.</P>
    <P>The main provision is that the person has been continuously unemployed for a period of six days.  In order to protect the casual worker and to prevent any person who has lost his job refusing a day's work if offered to him, we provide for a qualification of the term &ldquo;continuously unemployed&rdquo; by defining it to mean any period of unemployment of not less than two days followed by two days' employment and a further two days of unemployment being regarded as a period of continuous unemployment. He must, however&mdash;and this is the principal condition&mdash;prove that he is capable of working.  In other words, he must be physically fit for work.  If he has lost employment through ill-health or any physical or mental infirmity, then he is not entitled to unemployment assistance.  His claim for assistance to enable him to live must be directed to some other authority than the authorities administering this measure.  This is designed to assist only those whose unemployment is involuntary, such as persons who are able to work but who are unable to obtain it.  A man must show that he is genuinely seeking work but is unable to obtain suitable work, having regard to age, sex, physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence and family circumstances.</P>
    <P>He must also comply with one condition of considerable importance.  If he applies for assistance in an urban <Col N="1583" /> district, a county borough or the borough of Dun Laoghaire, he must prove that he has been resident in that urban district or county borough for not less than one year, or has had three months' employment there.  The main reason for that provision is to prevent the measure operating so as to induce into the larger towns or cities unemployed persons from rural areas, an inducement which might be aggravated by this measure, having regard to the fact that a higher rate of assistance is payable in the towns and cities in contrast with rural areas.</P>
    <P>In connection with that part of the Bill there is one other section of considerable importance to which I wish to draw attention.  It is provided that the Minister may at any time make an order in respect to any part of the country or any class of persons, declaring a particular period of the year to be an employment period.  When such an order is made no person in the area or of the class concerned will be entitled to receive unemployment assistance for that period.  As Senators are no doubt aware, one of the main difficulties in the administration of the Unemployment Insurance Acts has been that of determining that certain classes of people are unemployed.  A person who is a small landholder and takes work on roads or does other public works that are offered to him frequently claims unemployment benefit at the end of his period of road work and is disqualified from getting it. The insurance officer or the court of referees holds he is not unemployed. That person is usually very indignant and he writes to the local T.D., but it does not get him any further because at certain times of the year these small landholders must be regarded as being employed on their own land and therefore not unemployed and available for work, if offered.  In order to prevent that difficulty arising in the administration of this measure, it is proposed to declare in respect of landholders and certain other classes of workers, possibly fishermen, and other classes of workers that cannot be enumerated at the moment, that certain periods of the year will be regarded for them as <Col N="1584" /> employment periods and while these periods exist they will not be entitled to unemployment assistance.  In other parts of the year they will of course be entitled to unemployment assistance if they demonstrate to the satisfaction of the home assistance officer that they are unemployed and if they comply with the other conditions.  The necessity for that provision is, I think, obvious.  Not merely will it simplify the administration but it will also prevent the possibility of fraud and keep down the costs of the measure.  There is no doubt, of course, that in certain cases the operation of a provision of that kind will mean hardship and injustice.  An individual in a particular district may be affected by the order who should not be.  In any general scheme of this kind it is necessary to operate on general rules regardless of the effect on individual cases.  Then the individual must be carried by the board of assistance in the area if the members of the board consider that destitution is likely to result.</P>
    <P>The next question that undoubtedly arises in relation to this Bill is the measure of assistance which it is proposed to give.  The rates are set out in the Schedule to the Bill and I think most members of the Seanad will admit that they are not over-generous. They are, however, the most that we can afford to provide having regard to our present estimate of the number of persons likely to claim unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The unemployment situation in this country is improving.  It is improving to this extent that there are so far as our statistics show, a greater number of people employed now than previously. These statistics relate to persons who ordinarily follow insurable occupations.  But as the majority of those who are ordinarily to be regarded as workers take these insurable occupations, if we are to regard the statistics as not being accurate in respect of the totals, they are fairly reliable in so far as they indicate the trends.  They show that employment has been considerably increased during the past year.  The figures to which I refer are the figures relating to the number of <Col N="1585" /> insurance stamps sold.  There are also the figures relating to the number of insurance books exchanged during the year.  The figures themselves do not give us a reliable index of the number of persons in employment, but they do give an indication of what is happening and they show a considerable increase in the number of persons employed.</P>
    <P>You must bear in mind that within the past couple of years the population of our country has increased by 30,000 and is still increasing.  Emigration has stopped and, in fact, it is now a case of our getting returning emigrants so that a much more rapid increase in the number of persons in employment is necessary now in order to deal with the position than would have been necessary, say, in 1929 or 1930.  The number of persons unemployed, while undoubtedly less than at this time last year, is still very substantial.  It is, of course, impossible to say with any certainty in respect of that number the proportion which would represent those who are definitely in urgent need of work in order to maintain life.  A substantial number of them would be persons owning land and with pensions, persons owning small shops or being maintained by relatives or persons owning boats and having some other means of livelihood.  These persons register at the exchanges because they are willing to take any work that offers, particularly public work on the roads and the like.</P>
    <P>In determining in a scheme of this kind the amount of money we can afford to spend we must take a most conservative estimate in relation to the number of persons and the cost per head.  No definite figure can be given. I told the Dáil when we were trying to estimate the cost of this scheme on the basis of our unemployment experience of last year, we had in that calculation 15 figures which were only estimates. Any of these might be grossly inaccurate.  It was on the basis of a calculation of that kind that the figure was arrived at.  In the first instance when we determined upon the scheme we had in mind a figure of £1,000,000 a year as a maximum payment and as the payment which we <Col N="1586" /> could afford.  The scheme before the Dáil, while based on last year's experience, will cost more than that. In so far as the employment situation may improve or change or any changes in the nature of the unemployment problem may take place the cost will be diminished or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Any increase over the year in the number of unemployed to the extent of 5,000 will increase the cost of the scheme by about £30,000.  On that figure, therefore, you can estimate what is likely to be the position.  On our estimate on the basis of last year's experience this scheme is going to cost more than £1,000,000.  It is quite obvious that we cannot contemplate any increase in the rates of payment set out in the Schedule.  When the depression is passed and the reorganisation of our own economic system has been completed and when the employment position here improves it may be possible to revise these figures and to put this scheme upon a somewhat different basis.  That is a problem for the future.  At present we must plan in the light of our existing knowledge. On that basis this Schedule was prepared.</P>
    <P>The fact that I want to emphasise is that in 95 per cent. of the cases that are likely to be affected by this Bill the payment which will be made under it to unemployed persons will be very considerably in excess of what they are entitled to get from the home assistance authorities.  In the majority of cases those who are likely to be benefited by this Bill may not be getting assistance from the home authorities at all.  In other cases they are getting home assistance at rates varying from 5/- to 6/- or 7/- a week. There will of course be this difference that whereas a person gets home assistance at the absolute discretion of the board of assistance and only on establishing destitution to the satisfaction of the officer of the board, under this Bill when it becomes law a person will get unemployment assistance as a right.  He is given a statutory right to it, a right of which he cannot be deprived by administrative action subject of course to the conditions laid down in the statute.  He is as much <Col N="1587" /> entitled to that payment as any servant of the State is entitled to payment for services.</P>
    <P>The manner in which it is proposed to finance the scheme is, I think, also fairly clear from the measure.  In the first place, the Unemployment Insurance Bill, which is the next measure on the Order Paper, provides for an increase in the contributions in respect of people in employment under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  The rates of contributions from people under these Acts were reduced in 1931. In that year the debt which had accumulated on the Unemployment Insurance Fund was being rapidly liquidated because of the surplus income which had arisen since 1926 when payment of the extended benefits ceased.  The rate of contribution was cut in 1931 and it was cut too fine.  Those who were responsible for determining the amount by which the rate should be reduced erred to the extent that they overdid it and with the reduction of the contribution, the debt again began to accumulate and one of the first administrative acts that I undertook on becoming a Minister was to sanction the borrowing of money to make good the deficiency in that fund.  Apart from that, however, the raising of the rate of contribution to the old level will bring in a sum probably slightly in excess of £250,000 a year and we propose to take from the Unemployment Insurance Fund that sum of £250,000 for the purpose of financing this scheme.  Senators will understand that the raising of the rate which is propose by the Unemployment Insurance Bill merely restores it to the level which existed up to 1931, a level which is lower than the existing rate in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In addition to that quarter of a million pounds, it is proposed to levy on the four county boroughs and the borough of Dún Laoghaire, a rate of 1/6 in the £, on the towns other than the county boroughs and Dún Laoghaire, the population of which at the latest census exceeds 7,000, a rate of 9d. in the £, and nothing on the rest of the country.  The total amount which will come in from these two rates <Col N="1588" /> will be, roughly speaking, £200,000. That gives us a sum of £450,000 or perhaps a little more and the balance it is proposed to make up from the Exchequer.  The balance would, of course, be a variable sum fluctuating from year to year with the total amount paid out.  It is hoped that when normal conditions have been restored in the country, the scheme will be able to finance itself with little or no contribution from the Exchequer but I have no doubt that if we ever get to that stage it will be deemed more advisable to recast this system of unemployment assistance so as to link it up with other forms of State insurance.  These are the main provisions of the measure.  There are certain other matters which aroused some discussion in the Dáil and appeared to have caused some controversy elsewhere but they are not really matters of principle and can be discussed more properly in Committee.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is one which, I think, should commend itself to everybody because it provides for the stopping of a very definite gap in our various schemes for the relief of distress in the country.  We have provided for destitution and hardship occasioned by old age, blindness or infirmity.  Up to the present, we have not adequately provided for destitution or hardship occasioned by involuntary unemployment. That is, I think, due to the fact that it was not until post-war years that unemployment in its present form made itself apparent.  It is true that there always has been a large number unemployed but those persons were not unemployed for long periods at a time.  They were in work and out of work in varying periods.  It is only since the war that in this country and in other countries we have had the phenomenon of persons being unemployed through no fault of their own for years at a time.  These persons are in all cases able to work and genuinely and anxiously seeking work but because of the defects in our social organisation, for which the whole community must accept the blame, they have been unable to obtain work.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that if the State <Col N="1589" /> takes the line that it is going to entrust its resources in land and its instruments for working the land to a limited number of private owners and its resources in industrial equipment and technical skill to a limited number of private owners and these groups of private owners between them cannot find work for everybody seeking work, then the State must step in to prevent hardship arising, if we are determined to continue making work a condition of livelihood.  At the present time, we say to our people that in order to live they must work.  We have not contemplated the possibility of people, that is, the broad mass of the people, living without work.  So long, therefore, as we take that attitude, there is on us an obligation either to provide work or if we are unable to do that, to ensure that hardship will not follow on our own inability to do so.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a step in that direction. I grant you it is not a complete step. It is undoubtedly open to criticism on the ground of its inadequacy, but the only answer that can be made to criticism of that kind is to point to the figures available at the present time to support a measure of this kind.  If the financial position should improve, the measure can be improved but not otherwise.  In so far, however, as the principle is sound and as an effective scheme of bringing that principle into operation is enshrined in this Bill, I am sure it will get here, as it got in the Dáil, the unanimous support of all Parties.</P>

The Bill is a lamentable necessity and we all regret very much indeed that the conditions of the country should be such as to make a Bill of this kind necessary, especially as we have to go back less than two years to remember hearing from every platform in the country, from every cross-road in the country and from every chapel gate in the country that as soon as a Fianna Fáil Government came into power 86,041&mdash;down to the one&mdash;people would be immediately employed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The one was all right perhaps but the 86,000 were not all right as this Bill proves.  Now we have from the Minister a confession of despair and failure which none of his eloquence can cloak and I may say none of his nerve can cloak because he has considerable nerve to come here and give us the figures he gave us to-day to prove that this Bill is not the result of his policy.  I must say that I admire his courage and I compliment him on the admirable way he handles the situation and tries to cover up the tracks of his own failure.  I have some figures here.  In October, 1931, the number of unemployed was 23,427 and in October, 1932, the number was 40,132.  In my own county with which I am familiar, the number of unemployed in 1931 was 429 and it is now 820.  I can judge by the figures in respect of my own county how far the Minister's argument about registration and all that goes because anybody can see that far greater numbers are unemployed.  Take the foundries in the town of Wexford and take the number of rural workers unemployed.  We can see those figures but, as a matter of fact, we do not need any figures.  More than that, almost in the last three weeks, the official figure gives the numbers of unemployed on September 25th, 1933, as 58,937; and on October 9th, as 64,866, an increase of 5,929 so that the increase in unemployment is going on very rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was within the last three weeks. However I am not going to oppose the Bill.  People cannot be allowed to starve, and nobody here, as far as I know, is going to say a word against providing people who are involuntarily unemployed with sufficient to keep <Col N="1591" /> body and soul together.  I shall have to refer at this stage to statements made with regard to agricultural labourers, from time to time, by Minister and echoed by Government satellites in the last week.  Deputy Norton has stated that for the past 18 months a deliberate policy of victimisation has been carried on by the big ranchers because members&mdash; that is of the Labour Party&mdash;had put out of office the Party which the big ranchers had supported.  I think that is not correct.  What Deputy Norton meant to say was that the big ranchers carried on a policy of victimisation in order to be avenged upon the labouring people, or that the Government in order to put about a false idea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The quotation is:&mdash;&ldquo;For the past 18 months a deliberate policy of victimisation has been carried on by the big ranchers because the members had put out of office the Party which the big ranchers had supported.  Labour would see that all that would be stopped and that people would be entitled to vote according to their consciences.&rdquo;  That statement is a mean, lying statement, no matter who made it.  There is not the slightest foundation for the statement that anyone put out of employment any person because he did not vote according to the way that other person wished.  I wish to repudiate that, and deny it.  That statement has been made by Ministers over and over again and the quotation I have given is the last echo of it now.  No man has been put out of employment for any such reason by any farmer or employer on any kind of farm&mdash;&mdash;</P>

One of the saddest things that comes to one's mind about this is that certain small farmers who formerly held up their heads in the days when they were independent can no longer do so.  Independence is a greater thing than freedom or anything else.  It is the finest thing in the world anyone can possess, but because of the policy of the present Government these small farmers are turned into paupers and they will be eligible now for unemployment benefit under this Bill.  That is to my mind the saddest thing about it all.  Under ordinary conditions numbers of people would be unemployed, but that feature in regard to small farmers never occurred in this country before. It is the outcome of the deliberate policy of the Government.  The Government has proved that the one flourishing industry in this country is the manufacture of paupers.  A great deal of the Government's failure has come about from its agricultural and tariff policy, which has contributed very greatly to unemployment.  We have had various Acts passed by this Government.  We had a great outcry when the Cereals Act came up.  A greater failure could not be thought of. A great number of people will have to be left unemployed by the farmers who were foolish enough to walk into the trap provided by the Cereals Act.  A number of farmers have become paupers this year through it.  We have had an outcry about the wonderful benefits and the great employment the beet factories are about to give.  A great deal of what has been said is deception.  The people have been deceived.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the Bill in a general way, as one is entitled to do on Second Reading. There are various aspects of it that will be dealt with on the Committee Stage.  It is being represented that great relief is going to be given to local rates.  The Minister did not touch upon that.  In reality neither the unemployed nor the local councils are going to get any appreciable benefit from this Bill.  Everyone knows that.  It is one of those measures that may catch votes from the unwary.  That is its principal object.  However, so far as it goes, and so far as it will relieve the destitution which is coming about in the country, and the misery that is being developed, I welcome it, and am prepared to vote for it.  No human being with any heart or feeling could refuse to give to the starving and the destitute.</P>
      <P>There is one point that I am not sure about: whether a person in receipt of home assistance is eligible under this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister would enlighten us upon that.  I want to know from the Minister is a person in receipt of home assistance going to receive unemployment benefit under this Bill&mdash;I do not mean a man whose wife or children have been in receipt of home assistance.  I would like to have that point made clear.  There is also the question of Section 2 and the rate of 1/6 in the towns.  The councils in these towns will have large numbers of new houses which are not rated. How will the money be made up&mdash;the 1/6 on these buildings?  They are not rateable property.  I should like the Minister to reply on that point because it seems a defect in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing more that I can say except that I regret very much the necessity for such a Bill.  However, when the people have got what they asked for, what they voted for, I suppose they cannot complain.  I hope that the Minister's final statement, that the necessity for giving unemployment benefit will pass away, and his hope that when the Government's policy of economic national self-sufficiency will be put into full force, the unemployed will melt away as snow <Col N="1594" /> under the sun, will not meet the same fate as the promises in regard to the 86,041.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to speak on the Bill at all but I am afraid Senator Miss Browne has forced me to defend a colleague from the attacks that have been made upon him by Senator Miss Browne.  I think it is a great pity that when we are discussing measures of such great importance as this, measures that contain such a big principle as this bill contains, they would not be debated on their merits, without all these Party cries that we are continually hearing from Senator Miss Browne.  Senator Miss Browne by the way did not refer to the Bill at all.  She referred in the first place to what she thought Deputy Norton intended to say.</P>

      <P>I can tell you there was intimidation.  I am not raising the matter at all.  Senator Miss Browne alleged that the statement made was <Col N="1595" /> not true.  She is not entitled to say that without bringing in proof to that effect.  She is not entitled to say that she knows what every employer in Ireland did.  If she wants proof, it can be proved.  This particular measure sets up for the first time in this State a principle that we have been clamouring for for many years&mdash;the right of the individual to work or the right to be maintained, if he is able and willing to work and cannot get work.  That is the principle that is involved in the Bill.  I must say that I am very pleased that the Government have for the first time introduced a measure that brings that principle into operation.  Senator Miss Browne sometimes tells us about all the wonderful things the late Government, the Government that she supported, did.  We were clamouring incessantly for years to the late Administration to do something on these lines and it did not do it.  Up to the year 1929 in the City of Dublin, with its huge army of unemployed, there was no provision for assistance for genuinely unemployed persons at all.  In the country areas from 1924 the local authorities were entitled to give home assistance to able-bodied persons but in Dublin until 1929 there was no Act under which the local authorities could give home assistance to able-bodied persons no matter how destitute they might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure, as the Minister has said, proposes that where people are able and willing to work and where they cannot find employment and have not sufficient means to maintain themselves, the State steps in to see that they get some measure of assistance. Our only regret is that the amounts of assistance that are being given under the Schedule of this Bill, are not what should be given.  The Minister says that the amounts of assistance to be given are as much as the State at this stage of its economic development can afford to risk.  I agree with the principle of the Bill but I do not agree that the amounts set out in the Schedule are nearly adequate to meet the position.  Notwithstanding that, I am prepared to support the Bill in all its stages because it enshrines a principle <Col N="1596" /> that every Christian man and woman must support&mdash;that every man and woman in this country has the God-given right to get employment if they are able and willing to take it and that if they are not able to get it, the State is bound to do something to maintain them in some decency.  There are various matters that may arise on the Committee Stage of the Bill that need not be dealt with at this stage. What we have to consider to-day is the principle involved in the Bill and I certainly wholeheartedly support that principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say against the Bill.  In case the Minister might think that I am too nice for a start off I suppose I had better say that the Government promised us work and that now they are starting to dish out the dole.  As I was ill for the last week I did not get time to study the Bill, but there is one clause in it concerning the City of Dublin to which I should like to draw attention.  That is, I think, Section 26.  The people of the old City of Dublin, under Acts that have been passed for many years, have suffered more than the people of other localities. Generally speaking, the other people got the plums and we have now arrived at the time when the old City of Dublin can only be compared to a sucked orange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old City of Dublin for years had been supplying water to Bray, Dún Laoghaire, Greystones and Pembroke at much less than it was costing the citizens here.  Amalgamation came along and, in order to coax these people into Greater Dublin, they had to get special terms.  Their rates cannot be increased for a number of years. The old City of Dublin must make up the deficiency.  This applies, of course, to Greater Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and other boroughs.  New houses have been built, as was referred to by Senator Miss Browne.  Some of these houses are free from rates for a number of years&mdash;five years, I think, and some of them are on a sliding scale for 20 years.  That is the reason I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the word &ldquo;rateable&rdquo;<Col N="1597" /> in Section 26, line 25.  It is an innocent looking word, but I should like to know if this 1/6 in the £ would apply to people who are free of rates or to people who are paying rates on a sliding scale.  In other words, will there be another injustice done to the poor unfortunate citizens of Dublin who have been mulcted right through? Will they have to make up that £7,000 or £8,000 deficiency and, instead of paying 1/6 in the £, will they have to pay 1/9 or 2/- in order to make up for the people living in the new houses and those business premises&mdash;I know it applied to the 1916 buildings and I suppose it applies to the 1922 buildings&mdash;which are rated on the old valuation for a certain number of years and which naturally is much smaller than the new valuation?  There is, of course, in present circumstances a necessity for this Bill, but I think every person should be made pay his reasonable share of it.  Of course, this matter could be raised better on the Committee Stage and I intend to put down an amendment in connection with it but, as I object to it, it is just as well to mention it on this stage. The rate should be spread evenly over all the people.  This is a case where it is everybody's duty to come to the assistance of these poor unfortunate people who have no employment.  We cannot let them starve; we must feed them; but the expenditure should be spread out fairly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to ask the Minister as to the incidence of this 1/6 to which Senator Staines has referred.  I did not gather from the Minister how much was eventually to come out of the pockets of the State and I am not clear either as to what Senator Staines has been referring to. At present in the City of Dublin we are paying a rate of, I think, 1/6 in the £ and about that sum is also being paid in some of the urban districts. Is it that the amount that is to be paid over by Dublin to this new fund is the amount of the rate that is at present being paid and that there is not going to be an increased rate because of this Bill; that the 1/6 rate now being paid when collected will be <Col N="1598" /> handed over to the Minister instead of to the authorities in Dublin or in the urban districts to spend themselves? If that is so, then there will be no increase on the ratepayers because of this Bill as we are at present paying that 1/6.  It is easy to see how the national insurance contribution comes in.  That £250,000 is to be got by an increase in the rates of contribution. Does that mean that £450,000, £250,000 from the Insurance Fund and £200,000 from the 1/6 rate, will now go into this fund and that the balance of about £550,000 is to come out of State funds? Am I to conclude that the 1/6 rate does not represent an increase in the rates; that the national insurance contribution does represent an increase in the rates of contribution to the extent of £250,000, and that the balance of the money will be found out of the Exchequer to the extent of something between £500,000 and £600,000?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to enlarge on the basic principles involved in this legislation.  I think that psychologically they are quite unsound, but I realise that we have to move with the times and do the best to put on the brake in some practical manner. I am one of the old school who still believes that necessity is to a great extent an incentive to work and that if you destroy necessity you let in other factors; you encourage people to get benefits as easily as they can to the sacrifice of effort and production.  I feel that a measure of this kind very largely strikes at the root of character; weakens and enfeebles character; but still, there it is.  We know it is the policy of the Government; it has got to go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to place before the House very briefly another aspect, and that is the effect on the moral responsibility of employers.  At present employers, although some people may doubt it, have a distinct moral responsibility to employ more people than they would sometimes like to employ.  I know personally from resident owners in the country that they say, &ldquo;I am hard up; I would much rather spend this money giving my children opportunities, but I do not <Col N="1599" /> like to see people destitute and so I have to keep more people in employment.&rdquo; That is a practical, social quality to encourage.  I think it will be largely undermined by this measure. I can see large numbers of employers now saying: &ldquo;I no longer feel that moral obligation.  These people will not be kept in affluence by any means, but they will be saved from destitution by the State.  To that extent I can live a more selfish life.&rdquo;  That is thoroughly bad.  It is a big psychological aspect of the whole problem which I think should be regarded and should to a certain extent act as a caution to put a brake against the extension of the principle in this measure.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are other matters which we shall not go into now; they will arise in Committee.  I hope the Minister has examined all the loopholes that are implicit in a measure of this kind, all the possible evasions and all the possible abuses.  I should like the Minister to say whether he has ever visualised the position where, say, three or four able-bodied sons of a farmer will be qualified for assistance under this measure&mdash;perhaps quite a substantial sum will be going into a small farmer's house&mdash;and the effect that may have on production; the effect it may have on the effort of people to support themselves and, indirectly, of course, on their whole character and their whole social life.  In that direction there may be great abuses.  You might have a comparatively large proportion of State income going into a household.  I do not know if the Minister has considered whether the household test may be further strengthened. It is referred to in one section only.  The Minister has power to alter the means by order and that seems to be most dangerous.</P>
    <P>Under Section 10 (3) (c) one of the conditions for a qualification certificate is that the applicant's means do not exceed £52 in a county borough or the borough of Dun Laoghaire and £39 elsewhere &ldquo;or such greater or lesser amount as shall for the time being be prescribed.&rdquo;  So that it is entirely <Col N="1600" /> within the Minister's power to alter that amount and to impose indirectly a very large measure of taxation on the country.  If you reduce the means from £52 to, say, £26, obviously a much larger number would become qualified and the burden would be pro tanto increased.  This Bill got very scant discussion in the Dáil.  That, I think, is explained by the fact that it would be bad politics for either side to oppose this measure, which involves a lot of votes, and no popularly-elected person would care to be too critical of it; but a special responsibility rests on this House, the members of which are not directly dependent on the franchise of the people to examine it with much greater care.  In view of that I propose to ask the House, at the appropriate stage, to have this Bill referred to a select committee for examination.  In proposing that I think we should all agree that the committee would report back within a reasonable time and that the enquiry should not drag on for a long period.  I think everyone will agree that there are a number of very technical and complicated provisions in the Bill, and that an examination of it by a select committee would be of very great value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has been generally approved.  I am going to add my voice to the approval of the Minister's act in introducing such a Bill, because of the embodiment in it of the principle to which Senator Farren has referred.  It is accepting a very definite and clear responsibility, on the part of the State, for the principle of maintenance of the unemployed able-bodied person, and it is an indication that he should not be left to the poor law code for assistance. There is another important feature of the Bill, and it is that it departs from the British and Northern Ireland precedent by extending assistance to non-insured persons, agricultural labourers, domestic servants and such like.  But, having said that, I am afraid there is a good deal in the Bill, particularly in regard to the rate of assistance, that deserves dissent and protest.  I agree that it is a gesture of good faith.  It is rather more than a <Col N="1601" /> gesture, because there is a certain substantial financial backing to the gesture.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that the Minister, when speaking in this House, did not say what was said in the other House that the effect of the Bill would be to relieve the local rates.  Now I am afraid that will be the effect of it and I would rather it were not.  I will explain what I mean.  The amount of assistance that is given under the Bill is substantial.  It is higher, in the main, as the Minister has pointed out, than the amount of home assistance that is being given in all parts of the country, with the exception, perhaps, of Dublin and possibly Cork City.  But the amount of assistance that is being given in the country is lamentably deficient and utterly inadequate.  It is practically inviting people to continue to exist, to help to starve their children and themselves and, generally, to get into a state of low physical disability to work when work is offered. Some of the complaints that one hears of are due to that very fact: physical inability because of long-continued underfeeding and undernourishment. The Bill goes some way to help the man with a family, but when we think of a man with a wife and two children, expected in all parts of the country outside the larger urban areas, to live on 11/- a week, well, that is quite inadequate.  Therefore, I hope that local assistance will continue in addition to the assistance that is to be given under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that some day the Ministry will decide to institute a scientific inquiry on a physiological basis, leaving out the question of cost altogether, on the variety of food and the quantity of food that is required to maintain a family, and having ascertained that then to look into the question of cost. This is being done by numerous bodies, semi-official and entirely unofficial, and there is a certain unanimity about their reports.  Those inquiries have been held in different parts of England and Scotland.  I hope the Minister will institute such an inquiry in this country.  I believe it is only by an ascertainment of that kind that you are going to get the basis for the financing <Col N="1602" /> of such a measure as this.  There is almost universal medical testimony that a growing child ought to have not less than one point of milk per day.  If you take a pint of milk per day per child and relate it to the figures in this Bill, you will see how utterly inadequate for healthy maintenance even this contribution is, leaving out of account entirely the home assistance that is being given in the counties.  I hope, at least, that the local authorities when they feel themselves relieved somewhat by the operation of this Bill will say: &ldquo;We will at least add to our contribution towards the cost of supplying milk for young children.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Bill, as I have said, and echoing what others have said, does accept a new responsibility and that is a very big move forward.  The question of adequacy, which the Minister has hinted at, will have to be considered at some later stage when the economic factors are more favourable, but it ought not to go out that this is by any means an acceptable contribution to what is required by healthy men and women to maintain them and keep them in health.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Browne and others have followed the lead of their colleagues in the other House in supporting the Bill and, strange as it may seem, in doing so they have committed themselves to what their leader has told us was &ldquo;tending directly towards Communism.&rdquo; I am sorry Senator Miss Browne is not here because she is so consistently opposed to anything that she imagines tends towards what she calls Communism that she ought at least to take to heart what her leader has declared in respect to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amused.  There are a number of details in the Bill that I would like to have examined.  I almost think it desirable that the Minister should get some hints of these points, so that he could examine them before the Committee Stage, as it would be difficult perhaps for a layman who has no technical assistance to draft amendments.  One point was raised by Senator Staines, about what, in effect, is the immunisation of Rathmines and Pembroke from any charge in connection with the rate of 1/6 that was mentioned.  There are questions regarding disqualification which are more or less matters of detail.</P>
      <P>I would like to have from the Minister some justification for the rate to be paid by local authorities in urban areas, meaning urban districts outside county boroughs, and Dun laoghaire, which have a population of 7,000 or over.  Fixing 7,000 seems to me, inevitably, to lead to a great deal of trouble later, because that brings in two or three towns for which I cannot think of any reason that would justify their inclusion, while excluding other towns that are not worse off.  Take a town like Athlone.  Why should Athlone be required to pay £550 when towns not quite as large, but of a similar character, are entirely exempt?  I am curious to know the principle that fixed upon the figure of 7,000.  I can understand the position of larger towns, such as Dundalk and Drogheda, where it may be said there is an industrial population that have a larger proportion of people calling for home assistance or unemployment assistance.  I could understand a case being made on that score, but I cannot understand it with respect to some other towns.  I would like to have from the Minister some clue as to the reason why he arrived at a figure of 7,000&mdash; was it merely on the population basis, without any other factor intervening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is then a question which, perhaps, the Minister would be able to answer, as to whether it is contemplated deliberately that persons will be eligible for the receipt of benefit under this scheme who are citizens or <Col N="1604" /> Nationals of the Free State, but who have given their labour, say, in Northern Ireland or in England, and who come over to reside here?  They are immediately eligible, supposing they do not reside in the larger towns. Is there any reciprocal arrangement with the Free State on that basis?  As far as I can see, there is nothing to debar an agricultural labourer or a domestic servant who have given their services to employers for a certain period of years in Northern Ireland, on being disemployed, coming over to live in the Free State, and immediately drawing benefit, provided they do not live in one of the larger towns.  There may be some reciprocal arrangement.  I would like to know if that is correct.</P>
    <P>The feature of this Bill which distinguishes it from related Bills in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, apart from the extension of the classes of persons eligible for assistance, is that it is not an extension of insurance, and has only an indirect relationship to the insurance system.  Because it has no relation to the insurance system, I presume we are faced with the fact that there is no possibility&mdash;or barely a possibility&mdash;of the assistance given under this Bill reaching the amount of assistance given under unemployment insurance, in the manner in which it operates in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. There is a distinct and definite reduction in the amount of income that will go to a family man running out of insurance.  I take the view that as the man's labour is offered the liability is on someone else if he is not engaged. The Minister, inferentially, at least, accepts that position.  I do not think we are fulfilling the obligations which acceptance of that principle involves to anything like an adequate extent by the scheme of this Bill.</P>
    <P>On the question of adequacy I draw the Minister's attention to facts that appear in the report recently issued by the Department of Local Government and Public Health for 1931-32, regarding the cost of school meals.  Notwithstanding the fact that they can purchase materials at wholesale prices, either by contract or through the <Col N="1605" /> Central Purchasing Board, the cost of the materials alone amounted to 1.15d. over the whole country for all kinds of school meals.  In many cases the meal consisted of cocoa, or milk, and a piece of bread and butter.  At that rate alone, and on that method of calculation, a child's food for a week for three meals a day would cost 2/-.  We are assuming in this scheme that a man, his wife and children, have lived through a period of unemployment insurance.  That kind of person is left with less than unemployment insurance benefit, having been living meanly and inadequately, from the point of physical sustenance, and he is expected to feed his children on less than the cost of the wholesale price of school meals, where the materials alone cost 2/- weekly.  We are bound to look at that fact.  While £1,000,000 is a lot of money, and hard to afford, nevertheless it seems to me to be an obligation on the community to provide a more adequate standard of life than those figures will allow.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Browne and others, following the lead of the Party in the other House, talked as if the need for a Bill of this kind only arose during the last two years.  I can bear a good deal of Party controversy and I enjoy the kind of sword-play that Party controversy often involves and which does not mean so very much. It is really play, but that kind of statement is so utterly false and distant from any relation to fact that it is a pity that responsible people should give vent to it.  Senator Miss Browne herself should know that General Mulcahy called for a figure such as this, that in 1931 the number of able-bodied persons in receipt of home assistance was 5,408 in one week. Whether that has been increased or not does not matter, but in the last week of July, 1931, there were that many persons receiving home assistance &mdash;able-bodied men.  Surely, that itself is a proof that there was need for a Bill of this kind and it is utterly nonsensical and quite unreasonable controversy to speak of this Bill as only being called for because there was an increase, as alleged, in the number of unemployed owing supposedly <Col N="1606" /> to the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane makes the kind of statement that I wish he would look into before he makes it.  According to the Senator the employer will be induced, perhaps, because of the operation of such a Bill as this, to say: &ldquo;I can lead a more selfish life.&rdquo; He can dispose of the services of his men and decline to pay them any longer.  The effect of a statement of that kind seems to me to be that his less selfish life is only possible because he has a number of men that he is saving from the workhouse and that there is a large number of men outside not being saved from the workhouse and that it is necessary to have a large number of unemployed men half hungry or wholly hungry so that he can lead a less selfish life.  The logic of it is lamentable, but I would also like to remind the Senator that if the ideal of union with Great Britain had been maintained, or the policy of union with Great Britain, the cost of maintenance of unemployed persons would have been on a much higher level than it is even under this Bill. We would have been paying unemployed persons under this Bill as much, in at least 50 per cent. of the cases, under the extension of unemployment insurance, as they would be getting under the Insurance, which means that a family of a man and his wife and four or five children would be receiving 33/- or 34/- per week.  The Union would have involved Senator Sir John Keane in that awful state of social depravity!  I think the Senator should adjust his thoughts and look at what we have been saved from as a result of the abandonment of the Union.  We have been saved from this moral depravity of paying unemployed men 30/-, or 35/- a week which we would have had to pay if we had maintained the Union.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to speak on this stage of the Bill but some of the remarks made by senator Johnson seem to me to be so extraordinarily crude and so entirely oblivious of economic considerations that I think some reference ought to be made to them.  I do not think they <Col N="1607" /> ought to be allowed to pass as if everybody in the House agreed with them. Unemployment, of course, is a dreadful thing.  Any proper man ought to feel unhappy when he is unemployed, as a great many of them do; and when it reaches the stage of children being unfed it is dreadful; but to think that the way to attack the problem is to see that nobody should be unfed is to lead the country into bankruptcy.  In the long run you can only finance unemployment assistance of this kind out of wealth or, in other words, out of production.  In so far as your maintenance policy tends to undermine production, which it may very easily do if it goes too far, you are undermining the whole body politic, and eventually it leads to the misery of everybody.  Senator Johnson said that he hopes the ratepayers will not be relieved.  That seems to me to be a most extraordinary remark.  I am quite certain that if he were in the position of a great many of the ratepayers in this country he would not make that statement, because he would know better.  How does he suppose that the class of ratepayer, whom I have in mind&mdash;the agricultural land ratepayer&mdash;who is losing money on his farming and losing money to a considerable extent, I think, through the policy of the Party which Senator Johnson supports&mdash;how does he suppose that class of ratepayer will be able to pay?  Anyhow, there it is. Large numbers of farmers are losing money.  How are they to pay the rates which would be required to maintain the standard of unemployment assistance equal to what Senator Johnson or to what I dare say a great many others of us would like people to have?  Of course he cannot pay it unless he pays it out of money in the bank or some other money, and eventually he will not be able to pay it.  I think it is a wrong thing that anybody in this House should look at things from that point of view&mdash;simply that you have got to set a standard and pay it somehow or other.  In the long run that policy would bring any State to ruin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of work or maintenance is <Col N="1608" /> not a new one.  It is not an ideal of this Government or of any recent Government.  It is more than a hundred years old and it has been tried over and over again, but has always broken down and must break down in the end.  I had not intended to criticise this Bill in a wholesale way and I do not propose to do so now.  I am not qualified to do it, but I think that to discuss the thing on the lines that you are first of all to set a standard of maintenance and have no regard to ways and means is harmful.  You must consider ways and means.  If you ignore ways and means you will be &ldquo;broke&rdquo; as a Government in the long run, which will involve the misery of everyone.</P>

      <P>There is one matter which I would like the Minister to throw some light on.  I followed what he said with reference to the small landowner who does not own enough land to keep himself and his family and who has habitually to work for wages during some portion of the year.  I understand that he is a person who would be qualified for a certificate. What is troubling me very much is the case of the farmer's son who lives on the farm and who does not at any time of the year work habitually outside the farm for wages.  Would he be qualified for a certificate under Section 10?  If so, that would open an immense addition to the persons who might qualify under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I gather from the speeches which have been made that the majority of members either accept or are prepared to pay lip-service to the principle of the Bill.  In fact, most of the points raised were minor points affecting the details of the measure, apart from one or two statements made by Senator Sir John Keane.  If I take the points in order it will, I think, be simpler.  We can deal later with the one general matter raised.  I do not think it is necessary that we should have any prolonged discussion on this stage as to whether or not such a measure was needed in 1931.  I do not think that any member of the <Col N="1609" /> House is foolish enough to believe that unemployment only became a problem in this country with the advent to office of a Fianna Fáil Administration.  The available statistics show that unemployment only began to diminish as a problem with the change of Government. Although it is quite true that in 1924, 1925, 1926 and the following years the actual number of people without work may have been less than it is at the moment, that was due entirely to the emigration which was then proceeding at the rate of 30,000 per year.  That emigration has stopped. It stopped in 1931 and, at the end of 1931, unemployment was a very serious problem in this country&mdash;so serious that the Government in office quite contemplated the possibility of an outbreak of Communism arising out of the conditions then existing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position was, as I have said, that no reliable information about the unemployment problem was available. Our predecessors not merely took care not to find out the truth about unemployment, but even the few meagre statistics they had they kept to themselves and refused to publish.  It would be obviously impossible for anybody to prepare a plan for dealing with unemployment until they had measured the problem&mdash;measured it not merely in absolute dimensions but also in its relations to particular districts and particular classes of the population.  That was the first step. We took that step and, having taken measure of the problem, we have decided that we can deal with it&mdash;deal with it not merely by the provision of work, directly and indirectly, but also by a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; measure of this kind. I said that there are more people in insurable employment than there ever have been since the Free State was established.  Figures&mdash;incontestable figures&mdash;prove that.  I mentioned the figures relating to the number of unemployment insurance books exchanged and new books issued in each of the insurance years.  To some extent, these figures give us a total of insured people but it is an unreliable total. It is only of interest in the comparison of the figures for one year with another.  For the 12 months of 1931, <Col N="1610" /> that number was 294,800.  For the year ended March, 1933, the number was 363,800, an increase of 69,000.  The revenue from the sale of unemployment insurance stamps in 1930 was £703,000. In 1932-33 the revenue, if contributions had remained the same as they were in 1930, would have been £760,000, an increase of over £60,000.  As Senators are aware, one stamp must be sold for every week's employment by an insured person.  Having taken the measure of the problem, having satisfied ourselves that it is diminishing in size and that the cost of the unemployment assistance scheme in this year will be its maximum cost, we decided upon the introduction of the scheme. It may be that abnormal conditions will arise in the future, that the progress now being made towards greater industrialisation, and the improvement of our economic system will be arrested or even reversed but, so far as we can see ahead, studying the prospects of the immediate and ultimate future, we are convinced that we can look for a rapid improvement to the extent that will enable us to be satisfied that the average annual cost of this scheme will be considerably lower than the estimated cost of the first year.</P>
    <P>The matters raised were numerous and varied and, as I said, I propose to deal with them in the order in which I have taken them down.  The first matter of importance raised related to the term &ldquo;rateable valuation.&rdquo;  That is defined in sub-section (5) of Section 26.  I gather that Senator Staines dislikes the Act introduced by his Party in 1930.  He said that the Government then in office offered an inducement to certain townships on the border of Dublin to come into the Greater Dublin organisation, and that that inducement took the form of reduction in rates for a number of areas.  I do not know if Senator Staines was implying that another agreement was made to secure that amalgamation, like the agreement that Senator Keane and other Senators were referring to&mdash;the agreement that was made at the time of the Treaty.  In any case, I do not know if it is desired that we should break that agreement they made.  The Bill proposes to preserve the reductions <Col N="1611" /> in valuation made by the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930.  I do not think it is possible for us to work on any other basis.  We have fixed in our minds the amount we want.  That is the amount which 1/6 in the £ on the rateable valuation, as defined, will produce.  If Dublin Corporation or any other local authority wants to induce house-building and, in order to induce it, gives concessions in respect of rates over a number of years, or in some other way reduces its actual ability to secure rate-payments, that is its own look-out.  The amount we want is 1/6 in the £ on the rateable valuation as defined there and 9d. in the £ on the rateable valuation for urban districts.  Whether that amount will be secured by a rate of 1/6 in the £ or 9d. in the £ or some larger rate is not a matter of great concern.  The important thing is not to have the rate fixed and the amount variable, but rather to have the amount fixed and the rate variable, so that we can reckon in advance in each year to the exact penny the amount we are going to get in from that source.</P>
    <P>Senator Bagwell talked about the rate that would have to be paid by small farmers to maintain a standard of living for unemployed people of the kind contemplated by Senator Johnson. There is no rate arising under this Bill on any farmer.  The effect of this Bill must be to reduce the rate-charge on agricultural land.  In so far as the charge for the maintenance of able-bodied unemployed is taken off the rate on agricultural land, there is going to be a reduction in the rate-charge. Senator Brown and, I think, Senator Jameson referred to that matter in so far as it affected the City of Dublin and urban districts.  In the four county boroughs and Dun Laoghaire, last year the average rate for home-assistance purpose was 1/6 in the £.  I do not know what the actual amount expended was.  That was the average rate for the different areas.  A large part of the amount expended was given to able-bodied unemployed.</P>
    <P>Before 1929, as the Senator remarked, the Dublin Corporation <Col N="1612" /> could not give assistance to able-bodied unemployed.  A large part of the amount expended last year went in consequence of the additional powers extended to local authorities.  That amount was given by the Board of Assistance at its absolute discretion. There is nothing in this Bill which would prevent the Board of Assistance giving assistance to any family or individual they believe requires it.  We have assumed that in the majority of cases the receipt by these people of the amount provided will take them out of the class that the Dublin Board of Assistance would deal with.  Perhaps that would not be entirely so and there may be exceptional cases. For instance, there are persons at present in receipt of pensions as large or larger than any payment under this Bill and at the same time they are getting home assistance because of the size of their families or because of certain obligations or other charges on their revenue which might result in hardship.  In so far as certain cases of that type will arise, the Board will continue to give relief.</P>
    <P>The Board of Assistance have means of determining the amount of relief that should be given that the Department of Industry and Commerce have not.  They have officers who visit people in their home and who report to the Board on each individual case so that the Board can properly assess the measure of relief to be given.  The Board is in a position to adjust the amount of assistance to individual circumstances.  The Department could not do that.  We fix a general rate and, subject to certain conditions, those in need get that rate.  It may be that in certain cases the amount will be inadequate to prevent destitution. In such cases the Board of Assistance will have to give additional help.</P>
    <P>The rates in Dublin will, I think, be considerably reduced by the taking of these able-bodied unemployed on this scheme, but the extent to which the rates will be reduced will be determined by the Board of Assistance itself.  It will have to continue to meet its obligations in respect to the sick poor and those with whom it <Col N="1613" /> dealt prior to 1929.  The extent to which the Board decides to supplement the amount payable to able-bodied unemployed under this Bill will determine the rate which will have to be struck in Dublin.  In a number of the urban districts where there is a rate of 3/6 in the pound for home assistance it is almost certain there will be a substantial reduction, but the amount will be determined by the manner in which the Board of Assistance regards its functions in the future.</P>

      <P>Quite.  I was asked how much comes out of the Exchequer. It is not possible to give a definite figure, because the Exchequer will just make up the difference between the total expenditure and the sum received from rates and the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  The question of possible evasions was mentioned.  I am quite satisfied that we have stopped all the loopholes that experience of the Unemployment Insurance Acts has shown may occur.  In fact, reading the comments made upon this Bill by English trade and other papers, all of which commented on the severity of the tests and the rigidity of the system, I think we have gone as far in that direction as we possibly could go.  We are adopting a much more rigid system and we are imposing more severe tests than the British system requires.  That fact has been commented upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have in mind the scheme of extended benefits grafted on to the insurance scheme which is, in effect, the same as this, except that it operates on a different basis.  The reason for all that from our point of view is that we regard this scheme as experimental, and it must be experimental for a year or two.  We have embodied in the Bill power to vary the <Col N="1614" /> means which qualify a person for benefit and power to reduce the amount payable under the Schedule. We are also taking power to make adjustments that ordinarily could only be fixed by law.  There is little doubt that after a year or so we will have to introduce an amending Bill effecting the changes which, during that period, will be shown to be necessary. Ultimately, we will fix the code in a manner that may be regarded as permanent.  We would need to get power to vary almost from day to day the various aspects of the scheme so that we will be able to deal with the various types of fraud, which no doubt will be attempted, and to get the total cost within the limit contemplated. The other matters that were raised in the course of the debate to-day can be more effectively dealt with in Committee.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnson asked what justification there was for the levying of this rate on the county boroughs and urban districts.  He referred to the urban districts and the provision which requires that the rate can be charged only on urban districts where the population is in excess of 7,000.  We were anxious to provide that there would be payable in the urban districts a rate of assistance slightly higher than would be payable in the rural areas. We had in mind that the cost of living and rents would probably be higher in the urban districts than in the rural districts.  It was considered necessary to have from certain towns some contribution towards the cost of administration. In the case of the county boroughs a larger contribution is to be exacted.  It was obvious that we would have to include Drogheda, Dundalk, Cobh and other towns of that size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We got a list of towns from the census taken in 1926 and we went through the figures of population for each town, trying to fix the point at which we would stop without causing any dissension as between the last town included and the first town excluded.  We found that 7,000 was the obvious point, because there was a big gap there.  Whereas you get towns with 9,000, 8,750, 8,500 and so on, down to 7,000, the next had a few hundred <Col N="1615" /> over 5,000.  There appeared to be quite a clear gap, and it was the obvious point to select.  We selected that point and, having examined the list of towns included and the list excluded, it seems to me to be a fairly good division, because the towns included are all more or less industrial towns; they are towns centred around certain industries or commercial activities with only an indirect relation to agriculture, although some of them are market towns.  The towns below were, in the main, market towns, towns which live upon the agricultural community surrounding them, and towns in which the big event would be the monthly fair or the weekly market. It seems to me that although it was selected for one reason, that it suited administration, the point is also justifiable on other grounds.</P>
    <P>The other point raised by Senator Johnson is undoubtedly one of importance, although I do not see any way of dealing with it.  He referred to people going to England to get work as agricultural workers and domestic servants, becoming unemployed there and returning here.  Then, if they lived in a rural district, they might become immediately entitled to unemployment assistance.  That is so.  It is true that they can do that.  I think it would be impossible to devise any system which would prevent that. The nationals of the country have merely left to take employment abroad.</P>

      <P>Yes, but I do not see that there is any way to prevent that unless we have some prolonged waiting period and that is not practicable, I think, although one would easily contemplate cases in which one would not like to give this assistance because the person had long ago left the country and had earned his living and made his home abroad, and stayed abroad when employed. The most obvious cases are workers <Col N="1616" /> who go periodically every year to Scotland and other countries.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane said it would be bad politics to oppose this Bill.  I presume that is the explanation for the tactics of the Opposition Party.  It is the only explanation that has been given.  As Senator Johnson said, the extern leaders of the Party have been opposed to it and have been making speeches against it whilst members of the Party in the Dáil and Seanad have paid lip service to it.  Certainly none of them has voted against it.  I would like to remind them, however, that their policy in that regard is only typical of their policy in other matters.  It is very hard to determine what their policy is or to be certain about it. If it is difficult to determine their policy, it is equally difficult to determine the motives which inspire it. It may be that their attitude to this Bill is determined by the fact that it is bad politics to oppose it.  They did not say that themselves when accused of being deficient in moral courage in connection with their attitude to the Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a big measure.  It is going to involve the creation of administrative machinery which, although it will be grafted on to the existing machinery of the Department will nevertheless be very difficult and it will take a long time to bring it into being.  The officers of my Department told me that they will require at least six months from the date on which it will become law until it will come into operation.  I told them that we could not possibly contemplate that delay especially in the cities and towns.  It is possible in the cities and towns to put the Bill into operation earlier than in the rural areas because the same machinery is not required. We have to provide for bringing it in early in rural areas.  A long period will be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the hardest time for the unemployed is the winter time and the earlier we can get this scheme into operation the better it will be.  It will take at least three <Col N="1617" /> months to bring it into operation. This is because of the drafting of the regulations, the preparation of forms and the training of staff that will be required to operate the Bill.  If the Bill now passes that will bring us into the New Year before a single payment under the Bill will be made. It will be only in a limited number of centres that payment will then take place, so that it will be well before the middle of the winter before it will be brought into operation.  If we go too fast we run the risk of considerable losses arising out of payments being made that should not be made.  Then there will be the further fact that it will have to be handled by people who have only recently been recruited to the public service.  We must go slowly and we must plan our organisation with great care.  We must bring the scheme into operation only when we are satisfied that it will work well. At the same time we must do it as quickly as possible so as to relieve distress.  These are the considerations that gave me alarm when Senator Sir John Keane suggested a Select Committee. I suggest now that the Senator should reconsider his proposal of referring it to a Select Committee. The Bill is not a technical Bill in that sense of the word.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I was hoping to have the Bill law within three weeks from now.  Again, let me refer the Senator to the fact that the Bill was not opposed by any Party.  It may be that that arose from base motives but I was giving them credit for higher motives.  The Bill was generally accepted in the Dáil and very little attempt was made to amend it there. That is because no amendment was possible.  When I explain that statement the Senator will see the force of the argument against the appointment of a Select Committee.  Every phrase in this Bill is a phrase taken from the Unemployment Acts.  These phrases have very frequently been the subject of legal proceeding both in Great Britain and here.  Everybody who is familiar with the Unemployment Insurance Acts, every trade union official or every employer of labour on <Col N="1618" /> a large scale will have no difficulty in interpreting the Bill.  It will be a simple measure, the purpose of every section being clear.  It is only somebody who has come to consider this matter for the first time who would regard the measure as a complicated one.  To such a person it would be hard to explain some of the phrases without reverting to the legal decisions and the administrative regulations and reasons on which they are based. There is not a day in the week on which I do not get questions sent up as to whether a particular type of employment is an insurable form of employment and the decision is given. The Department bases its administration on the cumulative effect of all these legal decisions and the answers given by the various Ministers and their interpretation of the various phrases in the past 13 years.  The special significance of these phrases could not be altered without wrecking the idea which underlies the Bill.  We based the Bill upon the idea of making it conform closely to the Insurance Acts.  Under this measure there will be the same method of checking, the same method of payment and there will be the same court of referees to decide questions. If you try to upset that you upset the whole idea underlying the Bill.  You might as well reject the Bill as do that.  That is why no attempt was made to amend the Bill in the Dáil because if you go to alter it you upset the whole structure of the Bill and you change the whole thing.  I ask therefore that the suggestion that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee should not be pressed.  It would mean great delay in bringing the Bill into law.  I am anxious to avoid that delay.  The pressure to commence payments at an early date will daily grow stronger now.  The earliest date will be some date in January, 1934. Every week's delay now may mean something more than a week's delay then and I think that is something all parties are anxious to avoid.  I will be anxious to give the members of the Seanad any information concerning any part of the Bill during the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I wonder is the <Col N="1619" /> Minister right in saying that a week's delay now would mean a week's delay in bringing the Bill into existence? Whatever one may say about the Bill, there is agreement about it and, therefore, I think while the Seanad was quietly examining the Bill to make sure there were no things in it that we did not understand, the Minister would have perfect justification for going on with the regulations and so on.  It would be well that the Bill were examined, so that we may be sure it did not contain more than we thought. While that is being done with the knowledge of the Minister he could go ahead with his arrangement and in that he would be acting perfectly correctly. A week's delay while we are examining the Bill will really not interfere with the bringing into operation of the Bill.</P>

If I am assured there will be no amendment following on the examination it can go ahead, but everything that can be done in advance of the passage of the Bill has been done.  We cannot, however, recruit the staff and proceed to train the staff until we know precisely what the Bill is going to be in its final form.  We have to get out instructions, to prepare the regulations and to prepare the different forms and indices that will have to be used, and proceed to train people on the basis of the Bill as passed, but even these people themselves cannot be recruited until the Bill is law.</P>

      <P>That is only two or three weeks ago.  This is a very huge scheme, and the Minister himself admits that it is a brand new departure in relation to unemployment relief.  The Minister has studied this subject and knows all about it, but I doubt if there is a single member of the Seanad who is prepared to stand an examination on what this Bill really means.  The Minister tells us that all the loopholes are stopped but we do not know that that is so, and I do not think it is wise for the Seanad, much as we respect the Minister and trust his word, to take that for granted.  It would require much more than sitting down now&mdash;and this is Wednesday&mdash;and going through the <Col N="1621" /> Bill and settling amongst ourselves what amendments we would bring forward by Monday next to make us consider that we had done our duty by a Bill of this magnitude.  Remember, this is going to put £500,000 at least of extra taxation on the Free State.  I am not going to refer to bygones, but quite recently in this House we heard small sums like £30,000 debated and we were told that the Seanad in taking the action it did take was doing a terrible thing.  Here we have £500,000. The State is not wealthy and it is not making much money, and if we proceed to put huge amounts of taxation on the inhabitants of the State who are not earning the money to pay, it means that that taxation will have to be met out of the capital of the State and if we once proceed on that line, we are undoubtedly taking a risk.  A serious amount of thought is required in relation to what we are doing and its cost to the State, and I do think that the Seanad should have a little more time than three or four days to consider these matters.  I still hold that we will not be doing any harm to the Minister if we take an extra week to consider this.  We will be doing less harm than if we came in here half prepared and adjourned things or were not ready for the discussion which ought to take place.  I believe that we will be doing more good and will get through our job much more quickly if we take a fortnight instead of a week.</P>

      <P>This Bill is designed to give effect to two International Conventions which have been ratified by the Saorstát and by every other country interested in shipping, one dealing with safety provisions and the other with loadline provisions. The British Government have brought this into operation and particularly with relation to the Loadline Convention, we are anxious that this Bill should be law before the end of the year, because the British Government has delayed operating this measure until the 1st January of next year and it is important that we should have our law corresponding to theirs and to the international law on the matter by that date; otherwise Saorstát ships going into British or other ports will find themselves in rather a peculiar position.  There is nothing controversial in the matter.  It is the product of international harmony.  Other States have given effect to it and I do not think there is any objection to our doing so.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to a matter which I have been asked to bring forward because a Deputy who intended to bring it before the Dáil was more or less caught napping by the rather unexpectedly speedy adjournment of the Dáil.  In Section 1, in the first line, the words occur &ldquo;where by reason of the wreck or loss of a ship.&rdquo; The wording of the Convention itself was &ldquo;lost or foundering.&rdquo;  The wording &ldquo;wreck or loss&rdquo; is the wording used in the British Merchant Shipping Act.  The usage of the latter, that is, the wording that the British have incorporated in their Shipping Acts, gives a much wider scope, I am informed, to the operation of the payment of an indemnity.  The practical effect of the use of the British wording is to make an indemnity payable in many cases where the vessel does not become a total loss and is merely stranded.  If the Minister is prepared to give the matter consideration, I shall go into it on the Committee Stage.  The purpose of the Convention was to restrict this indemnity to conditions where the vessel was a total <Col N="1624" /> loss.  I do not want to rush the Minister into saying whether he would agree to that or not, but if he would undertake to consider it I should table an amendment to enable him to give a considered opinion on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is purely formal.  It is really a validating Bill. Last year as Senators will remember the Government made special provision for the relief of rates on agricultural land, on £10 valuations and under and on the first £10 of all valuations.  For that purpose a sum of £250,000 of the Agricultural Grant was earmarked. The Bill at present before the House is to give statutory effect to the same provisions regarding the smaller valuations in the special relief of rates and the first £10 of all valuations that was given last year.  Owing to the advanced state of the rate applotment when the Government decided on the special relief last year, it was necessary to authorise the county councils to adopt a credit note system.  The present Bill provides that the county council can either adopt a credit note system or it can give relief when the demand note is being made out by a reduction in the amount of the demand.  It is held by some authorities that the credit note system was an inducement to pay within the financial year.  It is now entirely at the discretion of the local authorities to adopt either system, whichever they consider more calculated to bring about the best results.</P>
