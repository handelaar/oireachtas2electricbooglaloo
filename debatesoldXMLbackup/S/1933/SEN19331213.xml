      <P>Senator Johnson raised a point on Section 2 on the Second Reading as to what would happen if, by any chance, either House of the Oireachtas&mdash;I presume he intended to put it in its widest terms&mdash;were to make a standing order with which a newly-elected member would feel bound in conscience to refuse to comply.  It is admitted that under the Constitution the Houses of the Oireachtas have power to make their own Standing Orders.  If, however, a standing order were made which would conflict with the spirit of the Constitution by preventing a member, who was otherwise properly elected, from taking his seat&mdash; I do not think that that position could arise at all in regard to the Dáil, for which the Government is primarily responsible&mdash;but if it did arise in the Seanad, then I think a constitutional issue of very grave magnitude would be raised and that would have to be solved by whatever means and in whatever way seemed best at the time.  I have not any doubt that the Executive Council elected by the Dáil would be able to resolve the crux in a satisfactory manner.  However, I think that the whole question raised by Senator Johnson could be properly and safely left to the good sense of either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the whole of this matter we have to remember that one of the principles laid down for those engaged in the task of drafting Bills for the Oireachtas is that it must be assumed that the bodies or persons who are to exercise the functions in <Col N="2023" /> connection with the Bill when it becomes law will act reasonably. Otherwise, I submit it would be quite impossible to draft a Bill at all.  To refer in this connection to Article 20 of the Constitution, to which the point raised by Senator Johnson is related, I should like to point out that when that Article gave power to the Houses of the Oireachtas to make their own Rules and Standing Orders it did not expressly seek to prevent either House from making absurd Standing Orders, Standing Orders which would be objectionable to members on conscientious grounds or Standing Orders which would be in conflict with the Constitution.  The Article assumed that the Houses would carry out the duty of regulating their own procedure in a reasonable and intelligent way. When we bear these facts in mind, I suggest that the whole issue raised by Senator Johnson is disposed of satisfactorily. For the reassurance of members of the House, I may say that the Bill now before the Seanad was drafted after consultation with the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach and that it represents, in the view of those interested, the best possible measure which could be introduced. The point raised by Senator Johnson was discussed between the Attorney-General and the Parliamentary draftsman, and they could see no other practical way of meeting the situation that has arisen in consequence of the amendment of the Constitution deleting the Oath therefrom.</P>

      <P>I agree with what the Minister has said, but in the rather unnecessary distinction made between the two Houses it might easily be understood by persons outside that someone or other in this House contemplated in the near future some such proposal.  I know that the Minister admits that there is no truth in that whatever.  While I agree with the Minister's statement, I do not agree with the suggestion that because the Government happens to be responsible to the other House, you might not get intolerance towards a minority in the other House as easily as you would get it here.  I agree that good sense <Col N="2024" /> would prevent that and that if either House attempted to use its powers to prevent members taking their seats in accordance with the Constitution, a way out would be found.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to accept the view that there are practical difficulties in the way of an alternative, but I still think that the effect of this Bill will be to make a Standing Order, passed by a majority of one House, superior to an enactment.  I think that that is undesirable as a matter of Parliamentary practice.  I shall say no more on that, though I am tempted to do so.</P>

      <P>Section 3, sub-section (3).  To delete in line 5 the words &ldquo;has made or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think that the Minister is accepting this amendment.  It is intended to give effect to the promise which he made in introducing the Bill, and which he has carried out in Section 5.  As amended, the clause will read: &ldquo;Whenever the Minister proposes to make, amend, or revoke a harbour rates order,&rdquo; he will, if he thinks fit, cause an inquiry to be held.  As it stands the Bill states: &ldquo;Whenever the Minister has made or proposes to make a harbour rates order.&rdquo;  This amendment ensures that the inquiry will be held before the order is made.</P>

      <P>I take it that the objection to the words in the Bill is the assumption that they might by implication give the Minister power, despite the terms of Section 5, to make a harbour rates order before notice of the intention to do so had been published.  I do not think that the inclusion of the words in the Bill would carry that implication.  In any event, there is no objection to their exclusion. I do not think that their exclusion will make any substantial difference.  I accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move recommendation 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 7.  To delete all after the word &ldquo;unladen&rdquo; in line 31, page 4, down to and including the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in line 36, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;and which is accompanied by a certificate signed by the authorised assembling agent showing that such vehicle was assembled in Saorstát Eireann in a manner and to an extent specified by order made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and in force at the time such vehicle was assembled.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I fairly well explained on the Second Reading the object I had in view in putting down a recommendation for this Stage.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was not present on that occasion, and perhaps I had better explain again briefly that my principal object is to try to evolve an arrangement which will be quite workable. This is one of the sections under which a person has got to deal with two Ministers, and that is generally more or less unfortunate.  The Minister for Finance has just disappeared.  It is no reflection upon him if I say that one would prefer to deal only with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or alternatively with the Minister for Finance.  When you have two Ministers to deal with, quite a lot of things are involved.  The rating of 16 h.p. will be under the control of the Minister for Finance and the tax of £16 will be collected by the county councils for the Road Fund.  The point as to whether a car is qualified for a tax at the 16 h.p. rate will be in the hands of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. That is a difficulty which can be comparatively easily got over in administration and I have no doubt every effort will be made to make the arrangement workable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have at the present time a case where a certain kind of car is entitled to pay the road tax at the lower rate. <Col N="2029" /> That is a car that happened to be manufactured in a particular year. The late Minister for Finance made a concession, which he did not continue, and we have therefore a peculiar position under which, if your car was manufactured in a certain year, you are entitled to a reduction of 25 per cent.  This new arrangement is to be carried out by means of a certificate which will be accepted by the various county councils.  I do not know what penalty there will be, but I have no doubt that agents will be liable to a fairly substantial penalty if they give a false certificate.</P>
    <P>I take it the object of the Minister will be to get as many cars as possible assembled under these new regulations, in order to increase employment, and he will probably wish to have the car so assembled made as readily saleable as possible.  The experience of most motor traders is that when a person makes up his mind to buy a car&mdash;he may be thinking over the matter for weeks and eventually decide to buy one&mdash;he must have it to go home with, and he expects to be able to get the tax paid and everything arranged on the spot.  It is, therefore, essential that there should be no question of doubt as to the payment of tax on one of the cars assembled here; otherwise, a purchaser might not be inclined to buy such a car.  There should be some machinery by which the certificate can be issued and attached to the car. One can easily recognise a car by means of the chassis and engine numbers.  As the section stands, it is extremely vague.  It may be purposely so, but I think it is unsatisfactorily vague.</P>
    <P>As the section stands, a car is entitled to the lower rate of tax if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the vehicle was assembled in the Saorstát in a manner for the time being approved by the Minister.  I expressed a doubt here as to the meaning of the words &ldquo;for the time being.&rdquo; I have been since informed that the meaning is at the time the car was assembled.  I understand certain cars are being assembled here at the moment, and no definite authority as <Col N="2030" /> to what is to be regarded as assembling has been issued yet by the Minister. No doubt that matter is in contemplation. In the absence of such an authority, it might be difficult to prove that a car assembled to-day is assembled in what the Minister may regard as a satisfactory manner.</P>
    <P>I am going on the assumption, which I took from the Minister's speech in the Dáil, that it is the intention to fix a particular standard of assembly, and ultimately he intends to make that provision stiffer in order to increase employment.  I am not disputting the wisdom of that.  I am merely assuming that the standard assembly will be greater or higher, as the case may be, in the future.  If it is going to be possible for motor traders to make arrangements with American manufacturers, they will have to be able, immediately, to get something in writing which will be definitely authoritative and which they can send to those manufacturers and so endeavour to make arrangements with them.  Otherwise, unless they are very wealthy, they could not take the risk of getting in considerable numbers of parts and find afterwards that the work they have carried out could not be regarded as an assembly.</P>
    <P>The reason I put down the recommendation is to try to set out the only practical working arrangement, and that is, that the Minister should make an order and that order, when made, shall be at any rate an understanding that it will operate for three or six months, so that firms getting parts will have reasonable time to assemble them.  When a car has been assembled there should be some easy way in which a certificate could be given to the effect that the car has been assembled in accordance with a specific order made by the Minister.  I think it is exceedingly important that there should be an order made, because then it will be scrupulously fair to all firms and there can be no doubt about it. I also think it is very important that the Minister should give some undertaking that when he makes any order he will not make it stiffer for a reasonable period, and when I say a reasonable period I mean such period as <Col N="2031" /> would give security to the firms who get in their parts to get them assembled.  Otherwise the risk of getting in parts of cars would be very considerable if they did not come under the order.  I need hardly point out that the effect of this order will be to make it increasingly difficult to sell American cars that have not been assembled here.  That, I take it, is the Minister's desire and is the object of the order.  Therefore any firms who bring in parts and then find, owing to the lapse of time, that they cannot assemble them, will be placed in much difficulty because they will be liable to the 26 or 28 horse-power tax when a similar car would be only subject to the tax at the 16 horse-power rate.  My object is to make the tax fair to all firms.  When the Minister is replying I would be glad if he would make a statement as to when he will be in a position to make a public statement on these matters.  Senators know that I am connected with one firm of motor car people, and I have also been approached by another firm who asked me to find out what will be regarded as assembling a car or what is meant by the assembling of a car.  The Minister's speech was purposely vague. He used the word &ldquo;knock-down.&rdquo; That can be very vague.  It would be a great help in speeding the matter up if he would say when that statement would be available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the speech to which I have listened from Senator Douglas, and also his remarks on the second Reading, which I have seen in the Official Report, that the questions he wants answered are (1) is there to be a certificate attached to the car, something which can be transferred with the car, so that the assembler can sell something, the existence of which is known to be there and cannot be questioned? (2)  who is to issue the certificate? (3) what the life of that certificate will be?  Is it liable to cancellation or revocation, under any circumstances?  Then in the next group he wants to know what is to be the degree of assembly which would qualify a car for a certificate, and <Col N="2032" /> whether that degree of assembly is to be prescribed by order or otherwise? It is intended that there shall be a certificate issued to the person who assembles the car, a certificate which will be attached to the car, and which will be to the effect that the particular car, setting out its engine number, body number, seating capacity and such information which may be set out, has been assembled to the satisfaction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in Saorstát Eireann, in the manner and to the extent approved of by the Minister.  That certificate, when issued, will not be subject to revocation even if a new definition of an &ldquo;assembly&rdquo; is brought into operation at a later date.  That certificate will still hold good even if there is a new definition of &ldquo;assembly,&rdquo; and under that certificate the terms of this Bill will operate in respect of the car.</P>
      <P>We cannot say that at no time in the future will the rate of taxation upon cars be changed.  It may be changed, and we cannot give any guarantee that no variation in taxation will be adopted, but so long as the law provides for a differential rate of taxation upon cars assembled in Saorstát Eireann, then that certificate will qualify that car for the benefits of that differentiation.  I do not think that we should agree to the certificate being issued by the assembler.  I do not think Senator Douglas will press that view.  I gather from his remarks that he put forward that suggestion in order to ensure that that certificate would be available for the car and that it would not be necessary for the owner to make his case to the Minister for Industry and Commerce direct when the occasion for paying the tax arises.  The person who assembles the car will, no doubt, when it is ready for sale, seek a certificate and obtain it. I gather that no special difficulty of an administrative kind will arise in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will issue that certificate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce. When the purchaser comes in to purchase a car he purchases the <Col N="2033" /> car and the certificate and he pays his tax at the rate required, getting whatever benefit he is entitled to get in consequence of having this certificate.  Settling by order the amount of assembling that must take place to qualify the car for the certificate is one of considerable difficulty.  I would prefer that we would not have to make a general order to apply to all classes and makes of cars and liable only to variations by another order which would be equally applicable to all makes of cars. The scheme of construction of the different makes of cars varies considerably. Whereas in the case of one car the definition of &ldquo;assembling&rdquo; might permit of certain facilities being granted to the assembler to get over mechanical difficulties, a similar concession might not be required by another assembler but another concession instead.</P>
      <P>The experience arising from our efforts to secure the assembling of cars in this country show that there is a very wide variety in the designs and very frequently what is a simple operation in respect of one make of car is very difficult in respect of another.  Consequently we have to frame the certificate in such a form that it will enable us to meet these difficulties when they arise.  Our intention, subject to minor variations of that kind, is to permit the concession to be secured by any person assembling a car in respect of the chassis on the basis of the importation subject to the minimum rate of duty of certain assembled parts, that is, the &ldquo;knocked-down&rdquo; chassis, as it is called in the trade.  In the case of persons importing the body in the shell, that is, unpainted and un-upholstered shell, we may at a later stage require that the shell be completely assembled and that the engine and transmission of the car will also be assembled.  But for a time we will be quite satisfied with the assembling of the chassis and the completion of the shell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The granting of facilities under this Bill in no way affects the import duty. The person who imports the chassis and the body completely unassembled <Col N="2034" /> gets them in free of duty.  The person who gets the assembled parts mentioned in the Finance (No. 4) Act, 1932, pays 10 per cent. of the duty provided for in the Bill. If he imports other parts he pays the full rate of duty.  It is similar in the case of the body.  On the completely unassembled parts of a body, no duty is chargeable but on the shell, unglazed and unfitted in any way, there is another rate of duty&mdash;26 2-9ths per cent. duty&mdash;chargeable.  That duty will continue to be chargeable.  The position, therefore, in regard to the import duty is that the inducement to persons engaged in the assembling of cars, to import the different parts unassembled, or only partly assembled, will remain.  This concession will be given for a considerable time to come in respect of cars where the chassis is assembled subject to certain of the more difficult parts being imported at a lower rate of duty and the body is imported in the form of a shell and finished here.  I agree it is desirable that no change in that position should be made without due notice and that firms likely to invest capital in the business of assembling cars in consequence of that definition will not be prejudiced.</P>
    <P>Those who are at present interested in this business have been in touch with my Department and have been fully informed as to what the intentions are.  Other firms have also approached us with a view to getting information and exploring the position. Any firm that is likely to be interested in the matter can get from the officers of my Department full information as to our intentions.  No difficulty will be experienced in committing the Government in the manner in which we frequently commit ourselves, in relation to customs duties and other matters, not to effect changes within a defined period: not to effect changes without prior and adequate consultation with the parties who have acted on the position created by us and who have invested their money in certain processes.  Consequently, I think interested firms will be adequately secured, or can get themselves adequately secured, against any violent <Col N="2035" /> change in the definition of assembly before embarking upon the enterprise. They can embark upon the enterprise with the full knowledge of what is intended.  I can assure them that it is not intended that there should be any change at all in the original position fixed for some very considerable time, and I have a much longer period than six months in contemplation in that regard.  Certainly before any change is made the firms who are engaged in partial assembly work will be fully consulted and their difficulties investigated with a view to seeing that nothing is put in their way as regards getting them to give more work in the Saorstát than had been the case previously.  In the majority of cases there are technical difficulties which are easily recognisable and in respect of which certain concessions have to be made.  Up to the present no difficulty has been experienced in giving those concessions.  In every case, where the volume of business, the make of car or the equipment of the firms concerned permits of a much more substantial degree of assembly without increased cost or great hardship, then we take a different line, but up to the present the arrangements made have been found to work fairly satisfactorily, and I am satisfied that they will be found to work equally satisfactorily in regard to this concession.</P>

      <P>I am glad that I put down this recommendation if it was only to get from the Minister the statement he has just made, a statement which will go a long way to clear up the position for some people who have approached me.  To make the position if possible still more clear, I want to ask him a very specific question.  I gather from the Minister's remarks that the test of what is to be an assembly will not be the same in every case.  It will, of course, have to be a substantial assembly, but I gather it will have regard to particular circumstances, either to the peculiarities of a particular make of car or to the circumstances of the firms who are the agents here and propose to have the assembly work done here.  In view <Col N="2036" /> of the Minister's statement I would not think of pressing the recommendation which was put down on the Order Paper on the assumption that the Minister intended to have the one standard.  Naturally, I was anxious that that one standard should be made clear as soon as possible.  A number of firms, as a result of reading the report of the Minister's speech in the Dáil, were not certain whether it would be at all possible for them to assemble cars here under this arrangement. Up to a few days ago they had not been able to get an authoritative statement as to what would be regarded as an assembly here.  Can one state now that any firm that is considering the question of assembly here will be quite justified in writing at once to the manufacturers stating that, provided a substantial assembly is done here, the Minister will be prepared to give a concession to the extent indicated?  I know that one or two firms that I am acquainted with were waiting until they got a definition of what was to be an assembly, and then intended writing to the manufacturers to know if they could manage to send in the parts in the manner specified.  I take it from the Minister's speech that it is the reverse procedure that will be correct: that the firms here should write to the manufacturers at the other side to ascertain what is the maximum amount of breakdown chassis and body that it is possible for them to export.</P>

      <P>The general principle will, of course, apply in all cases; that is, that a certain minimum assembly will be required both in respect of chassis and body.  There is, however, the power to meet the difficulty of particular types of cars.  What I suggest is that the parties interested should endeavour to get in touch with their principals and ascertain the manner in which parts of chassis and body can be exported so as to permit of the greatest amount of assembly here.  Having got that information, they can then get in touch with my Department and find out if that particular kind of assembly is sufficient to qualify for the issue of a certificate under this section.  I think that all <Col N="2037" /> possibility of loss arising through misunderstandings or doubts will be removed if that procedure was adopted.</P>

      <P>Section 8, sub-section (2).  After the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; in line 39 to insert the word &ldquo;knowingly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 8, sub-section (2).  To delete the word &ldquo;of&rdquo; in line 47, where it first occurs, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;not exceeding.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This deals with a totally different matter.  I dealt with it briefly on the Second Reading of the Bill.  My real objection is not to the general provision in the section.  I agree that if a person deliberately tries to get away with a lower rate of tax than is proper that he ought to be made subject to a substantial fine, but what I do suggest is that &ldquo;twenty pounds or three times the difference between the amount of the said duty&rdquo; as a minimum fine is too high.  In the case of deliberate fraud, I would be prepared to agree to a higher fine, but as regards many <Col N="2038" /> cases which I know can arise I think the penalty laid down is far too high. Because of the inclusion in the section of the words &ldquo;excise penalty&rdquo; I believe I am correct in stating that the District Justice has no option whatever but to enforce the payment of the actual fine provided.  I do not know whether the Minister has ever had to fill in the forms for the road tax on his car.  If so, I wonder did he ever trouble to get the two types of forms, the one dealing with private cars and the other with a car used for business purposes.  If he got the two forms he would find that, in certain cases, it is extremely difficult to differentiate between them.  The reason why I noticed this immediately I read the Bill was because I was summoned myself for having used a car at a lower rate of tax than was, in the opinion of the Guards, the correct rate of tax. Fortunately for me the District Justice held my view and did not take the view of the Guards, and I was not subject to any fine.  Although the District Justice took that view, I confess now, having read the section more carefully, that I do not know if he was right in the view he took.  I do not consider that the car I was then using, and the purpose for which I was then using it, was clearly defined under the section.  It certainly was not clearly defined in the form.  I think the reason why the Justice decided in my favour was because, while it was not by any means clear that my car, used as it was used, came within the definition of a private vehicle, it certainly was clear that it did not come within the definition of a commercial vehicle.</P>
    <P>I also mentioned on the last day the case of the taxi-man.  In the strict sense, if he took his family for a ride in the car then he would be using the car as a private vehicle and would become subject to the higher rate of duty.  No man in his senses objects to a taxi-driver, occasionally, taking his family for a drive, and it certainly would be absurd if such a man was liable to prosecution and to incur a heavy penalty.  But the law is certainly not clear in some cases as to what tax should be paid.  There should be a limit; and a minimum penalty of <Col N="2039" /> £20 is certainly too high.  I have put down two amendments on this question, and I should like that what I have said should be taken as applying to both.  I shall be glad to hear what the Minister has to say about them.  One recommendation is to insert the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; and the other the words &ldquo;not exceeding.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support either of the amendments, but especially the second as the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is a difficult word generally to interpret.  It is not right, in my opinion, to have a minimum penalty of £20.  I would prefer one that would give the court discretion as to the size of the penalty, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, and that would be best carried out by the second amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to find myself in disagreement with Senator Brown in this matter.  If the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is inserted it will be impossible to enforce the section, for every man will be entitled to say &ldquo;Well, I did not know.&rdquo;  It is like the dog having one bite.  If you give a man one free offence I think it would be very hard, indeed, to enforce this section which is so necessary.  In regard to the second matter, I am sure the Minister will inform us whether the excise penalty is a rigid one, that is, the sum of £20 or three times the difference.  I was under the impression &mdash;of course the Minister knows for certain&mdash;that that is a penalty that might be mitigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  However, as Senator Brown thinks it is a penalty that could not be mitigated, I certainly would not undertake to differ from him, but my impression was that these excise penalties can be mitigated to one-fourth.</P>

      <P>I may be wrong in this, but I was under the impression that this penalty could be mitigated to one-fourth, and still further mitigated by the Minister to any sum he thought proper.  Moreover, I would say that in <Col N="2040" /> the case of excise penalties the Revenue Commissioners have power to compromise in a case, and that there is the same power here to compromise fines to any sums they consider proper.  If the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; is here inserted, indicating that the justice can impose no greater penalty, but that he may impose any smaller penalty he might consider proper, it would be contrary to the whole spirit of the revenue code and would lead, I think, with all respect to judicial persons, to considerable abuse.  The justices in former times, who were country gentlemen, never would impose excise penalties if they could possibly avoid it, so it was necessary in all these cases to have the penalty heavy because the revenue was concerned, and vast sums of money were concerned.  It also had to be rigid in order to prevent the justices letting men off with a nominal fine.  I do suggest to the House that in matters of these revenue penalties they ought to be very careful before making any alteration in the regulations as drafted. For all these reasons, I am sorry that I cannot agree with Senator Brown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with both these amendments in order, the first answer is that the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is regarded as objectionable in principle, and would not achieve the purpose the Senator has in mind, because a man must know how he is using a mechanically-propelled vehicle. The Senator is relying upon the second of his amendments.  The position is that, in the absence of any provision to the contrary, the court has power to reduce the excise penalty to the extent of 25 per cent. of the amount fixed by statute, but not to a greater extent.  Again, in the absence of provision to the contrary, the complete power of mitigation or remission rests with the Minister for Finance or the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners have, of <Col N="2041" /> course, no function in relation to penalties for breaches of the law relative to the Motor Vehicle Duties Act. The powers in these instances are transferred to the county councils, and the power of remission under Section 8 will rest with the county councils, and in neither case does the power rest with the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that this measure, while increasing the material penalties on poachers, does not seem to make adequate provision for the capture of these poachers. We all know that along our coast these trawlers come in almost within a stone's throw of the land and, as far as I can see, this measure makes no <Col N="2042" /> adequate provision at all for the prevention of this.  The Minister talked of a second &ldquo;Muirchu.&rdquo;  I cannot see that that would help very much.  The &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; may be very valuable from the point of view of protection, although I do not think any of us are aware of what she has done.  Beyond the material she provides for jokes in the comic papers I do not see that her services really have been remunerative in comparison with the price we pay for her.  As I say, she may be very valuable, but I am unaware of the work she has done.  However, should the suggestion I have to make be put into force, I quite believe that the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; would be of very great benefit.  My suggestion is, shortly, that motor boats, costing anything from £1,200 to £1,500, should be placed in service&mdash;perhaps ten or a dozen of them&mdash;all around the shores of the Free State, and that in that way every foot of the coast of Ireland would be patrolled daily.  That would make adequate provision to prevent any poachers from coming within the prescribed limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that, in his reply on the last day, the Minister talked of the herring and the mackerel fishing.  They are two very important items of our fishing produce, but I would point out to the Minister that there are also other very valuable fishing industries which, in my own time, have been threatened practically with extinction.  Pollock is still to be found on our coast but not at all in the proportions in which it used to be found.  Sole, whiting and plaice are disappearing rapidly.  Haddock and hake are practically unknown now on the south-west coast of Ireland. Gurnet were not to be found at all around our waters this year and the same can be said of bream and cod. What I would point out is that there has been no special reason why these kinds of fish should be steadily diminishing beyond the fact that these poaching trawlers undoubtedly are now bolder than ever and are coming in and fishing our waters.  The Minister talked about the value of our fisheries being so small.  Well, I can remember a time when that was not so.  I admit that it was due principally to herring and <Col N="2043" /> mackerel, but I remember a time when a grant of £5,000 was given and within a very short period of that time Cape Clear, which had no boats or gear of any kind when that Vote was made, had gear and boats to the value of £60,000.  I am still convinced &mdash;and of course in saying this I am really only reiterating what every man engaged in the industry believes&mdash; that if we could keep our coast clear from poachers we would have a return of all that fish that was most valuable as food for the people.</P>
    <P>It is a very remarkable fact that year by year our fresh-water fishing has deteriorated in a most alarming way. In fact, in a very short time, if things go on as they are going at present, the occupation of fishermen in the south-west coast of Ireland will be gravely affected.  You cannot make a fisherman in one or two years.  It is a very highly skilled trade, and it is a very serious outlook to find that in West Cork the fishermen there are engaged at the moment in breaking stones for the roads.  I believe, although if I were asked to give proof of it I could not do so, that the effect of having our sea fishing destroyed is reacting upon our fresh-water fishing.  The salmon, as we all know, feeds in the fresh water and, as far as I have heard, for the six months he is in fresh water he feeds on a very thin diet indeed.  I believe that the disappearance of the salmon is not due to poaching, which a number of people put it down to, because I maintain that to-day poaching is no more prevalent than it was during the time I remember.  I think that it is highly probable that one of the causes of the disappearance of the salmon from our rivers is the fact that around the coast the food they existed on during the winter is no longer there, and the obvious cause of that is the interference with our coastal waters.</P>
    <P>I would press on the Minister, accordingly, that he should go very closely into this question of having the coast patrolled.  I would make the suggestion also, if the Minister thinks that is too large an order&mdash;and I maintain it is a small order considering the interests involved&mdash;that he should patrol even the coast from Wexford to <Col N="2044" /> Berehaven, which would involve a comparatively small sum.  In a year or two he would very soon find out whether keeping the trawlers away from that coast had any effect upon the fish produce of our waters or not.  It is a matter that I press very strongly on the attention of the Minister, and rather than go in for a second vessel, as he seems to think would be necessary, I would urge him very strongly to put on, say, four boats costing £1,500 at the outside, all of which can be built within the Free State and which could be run at a cost per boat of certainly not more than £700 a year.  I think that would be a very valuable experiment indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Crosbie's suggestion, if it is practicable, and I do not see why it should not be.  His suggestion that an experiment should be made on the coast from Wexford to Cork should include the important fishing town of Arklow.  Perhaps that is what Senator Crosbie meant.  Really this Sea Fisheries (Protection) Bill is a kind of pious aspiration on the part of the Minister because, as it stands, there is nothing in it to make any great improvement in the position.  I heartily approve of the increased fines that it proposes to impose, because one of the causes why trawlers have not kept away has been the very small fines that were inflicted in the past.  A fine of £100 means absolutely nothing to a fast-sailing trawler, because that amount is made in one catch.  I approve of that part of the Bill.  It reminds me of an old-fashioned cookery book in which there was a recipe for making hare soup, the first paragraph being, &ldquo;First catch your hare.&rdquo;  The Bill is something like that.  However, it is a terrible national reproach that our sea fisheries only amount to the very small sum mentioned by the Minister when we were discussing the Bill last week.  As we have the longest coast line in Europe the state of the fisheries here has been a great reproach. The Act dealing with sea fisheries passed by the previous Government did a great deal, but unless we have some means of catching trawlers Bills are of no use.  I am <Col N="2045" /> afraid there is a good deal in this Bill that is meant as a bait to catch the votes of fishermen.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to explain the remarks he made about oysters, as since people read the report of his speech they are afraid to eat oysters, as if they were affected with some terrible disease.  As I did not quite understand what the Minister meant, I would like him to be more explicit.  I suppose he is aware that a very fine oyster bed existed in Wexford Harbour until it was completely carried away by French trawlers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like any impression to get out that there was anything whatever wrong with oysters.  Fearing that that impression might get out from the speech made here, all I said was that the oysters were not multiplying as they did, and that we did not know the reason why.  There is nothing wrong with oysters as food.  It is rather farfetched to suggest that this is a vote-catching Bill.  After all I suppose against any Bill that a Government brings in an accusation of the same kind could be made.  I do not know to what part of this Bill that accusation could apply.  The example Senator Miss Browne gave about first catching your hare is a good one, but if people are not allowed to catch the hare the law has first to be changed.  That is the position we are in.  We have to change the law before we can even catch votes.  The next thing is to provide adequate coastal patrol boats.  There is no necessity to put that in the Bill, even if we intended to get 20 boats like the &ldquo;Muirchu.&rdquo;  Seeing that there is no such provision in it, it does not indicate what our policy might be.  At the last meeting of the Seanad I did <Col N="2046" /> point out, taking the value of our sea fisheries, that it was hard to justify so much expenditure.  The present value of our sea fisheries is £700,000.  Of course, the potential value is much more, as we are importing three times that amount.  If we could develop the sea fisheries for our own market that would represent 300 per cent.  Consequently, if there were any good prospect of developing our sea fisheries to that extent, it would be worth while increasing the patrol services very materially.  That question is under consideration.  In the Bill we have extreme penalties and provisions whereby we can bring up boats after the offence if they are identified by anyone who can be taken as a reliable witness to prove that such boat was within the limit on such a date, and at any time after that the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; or any other boat can arrest and have a case tried for that particular offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the provisions in this Bill.  It is thought with an extreme penalty, and with such a provision, we should get a little experience of what we can do with the &ldquo;Muirchu.&rdquo;  Then, if necessary, we may have to get more boats.  The question arises whether we can increase our efficiency in that respect without purchasing large boats like the &ldquo;Muirchu,&rdquo; or, as Senator Crosbie thinks, do a great deal with small motor boats.  That question has been examined but, as far as our knowledge in the Fishery Department goes, up to the present we think these motor boats would not be useful, because they would not be fit to face rough seas on many days that trawlers would be out.  In fact, we must have just as seaworthy vessels and as fast as trawlers.  The &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; fulfils that condition.  Small motor boats do not.  If we had only small boats the trawlers could do as they liked on wild days.  It may be possible to get motor boats to do something in that connection. If we do it would be more economical than using boats like the &ldquo;Muirchu.&rdquo;  A boat like the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; would cost about £40,000 and would take about £8,000 a year to run.  Senator Crosbie suggested that motor boats could be got for £1,500 and run at a cost of £700 yearly.  If <Col N="2047" /> they were effective they would be more attractive from that point of view, than the &ldquo;Muirchu.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That question has been examined.  I believe it has been tried in other countries unsuccessfully, because seaplanes were not able to make an arrest.  We are in a different position.  If a seaplane went out and identified a boat we would then have sufficient powers in the Bill.  The question of using a seaplane could be further examined.  However, the first thing was to get these powers of arrest, even after an offence had occurred, and also power to inflict heavy penalties.  Having got these powers, we can consider the question of patrol boats.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 4.  To delete the section and to substitute therefor a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>4.  Any stallion which is entered in a prescribed stud book shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be an exempted stallion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between my amendment and those that come after it is that mine cuts the whole thing short and leaves every thoroughbred stallion free from the necessity of having to get a certificate and so on.  My reason for bringing it forward is that I think the situation has been misunderstood. Those who have spoken in favour of the section seem to think that there are a large number of thoroughbred stallions, some of which are unfit for breeding purposes, in addition to those bought by the State.  It is also suggested that these are hidden away and used surreptitiously; that it would be an extremely difficult matter to discover them and still more difficult to prove that they had been used as stallions. Those are the main reasons given for bringing forward this Bill and this particular section of it.  I believe that these ideas are very far from being the case.  I doubt if there is any single thoroughbred stallion, the possession or use of which is not well known in any district.  It would not pay anybody to keep a stallion in secret.  They are generally advertised in the local papers, and anybody who has a stallion is anxious to get fees and, therefore, is not likely to hide it away or to hide its light under a bushel, so to speak. It is a mistake, to my mind, to suppose that the possession of a stallion could not be known.  Everybody in the district in which there is a stallion knows perfectly well that the stallion is there, and even if it is not advertised, it is generally known. <Col N="2049" /> Farmers are not so silly or so ignorant as not to know that there is a stallion next door or within five miles of them. My experience is that they do know and they will not use any stallion which is not useful for their purposes.</P>
    <P>Some of the discussions that took place in the Dáil show what the opinions of some Deputies were.  I think there was a general idea that something ought to be done in the matter and that the thoroughbred should be exempted or certain conditions applied to it.  One Deputy asked &ldquo;What is to be done with the stallion wandering about the roads alone and not belonging to anybody?&rdquo;, and another Deputy said &ldquo;Put him in the pound.&rdquo;  The Minister settled that question by saying &ldquo;The pound may be full of such stallions.&rdquo;  When I read this, I began to think that I am in Central Asia, because I never heard of stallions running wild about the roads of any country in the world except Central Asia, where I believe there is a type of wild horse.  Besides, if any of these people had to catch a wild stallion running about the roads they might find it a very difficult job. Some stallions are very fierce.  I knew a stallion down in Roscommon some years ago called Buckshot.  No one could enter his stable.  He was fed through a window, and certainly, I should not like to have to catch him and put him in a pound.  There was another stallion, a very celebrated racehorse, called Chanticleer, long ago, who used to roar like a bull at times, and there was a trainer called Harry Stebbings who said that he liked being off Newmarket Heath when this horse was on it.  I do not think it is possible for these things to be kept quiet, and my view is that it would be very much better to leave the thoroughbred stallion alone altogether.  Some of the other amendments do not go so far as that, but that is my idea.  My opinion is that officials should not be interfering in trade of any sort.  If everything is going well, there is a great disadvantage in bringing in officials, but if, as is often found to be the case, an industry is being very badly managed, not being used properly and the country is at a loss as a result, <Col N="2050" /> naturally something must be done, and the Government and their officials ought to do it.  But the exact opposite has happened in this country.  So far from anything being wrong with the horses in this country, we have the best throughbreds in the world; we win more races than any other country and our horses are exported to all parts of the world.  You will have evidence of that when Senator Parkinson, who knows all about these matters, comes to speak.  Large numbers of stallions are being exported to India and America and other places. When I was in South Africa, I was given a free hand to choose racehorses when I came home here and to send them out there.  I did not venture on such a step because I would get myself into trouble if I brought out a horse that would not win a race.  I would not be very popular, so I left the matter alone.</P>
    <P>Then, there is the case of the breeding of the stallions with half-bred mares in the country.  They produce practically all the hunters in the country.  We all know that hunters in Ireland fetch a fine price.  That shows that there is nothing wrong with that business, so why should we bring in Bills to interfere with stallions in an industry which is succeeding and which has succeeded for the last hundred years excellently, without any of these Acts?  I spoke on Second Reading on the same subject, so I do not think it is necessary to prolong the matter further.  Certainly, it is my opinion that it is better to leave the thoroughbred horse alone altogether, whether crossed with half-bred mares or not.  I pointed out on Second Reading that some of the amendments we have now before us are useful, no doubt, for the big studs such as are found at the Curragh in Kildare, but we do not want to put any stoppage on the small studs round the country. There were many of them in my time round the country, and many of the best horses were brought there.  The owner of the stud may have a thoroughbred horse and he may have four or five mares breeding from that stallion, but if he were bound down in such a way that the stallion could not <Col N="2051" /> be crossed with any other than his own five mares, it would not pay him.  He, therefore, lets out his stallion to suitable half-bred mares.  He cannot do that now, unless he has permission from some official to do so.  I do not deny that there will be difficulties in any arrangement which we make, but there is less difficulty in making one clean sweep of this provision than by trying to make all sorts of ins and outs with arrangements and permits and various things of that kind.  I, therefore, propose the amendment which is to free all thoroughbred horses from interference by officials. It simply says that a stallion which is entered in a prescribed stud book shall be deemed to be an exempted stallion.</P>

      <P>Senator Colonel Moore's amendment has one merit, namely, it is perfectly clear&mdash;&ldquo;any stallion which is entered in a prescribed stud book shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be an exempted stallion.&rdquo; That amendment is free from the defects observable in some of the other amendments where the phrase &ldquo;recognised stud book&rdquo; is used.  The meaning of Senator Moore's amendment is this: that any stallion no matter how weedy, no matter how defective, no matter how ugly, may be used without restriction for the purpose of mating with farmers' mares and for the purpose of producing hunters.  I am opposed to that certainly and for this reason.  Senator Colonel Moore seems to think that the only thoroughbred stallions which would be used for mating with farmers' mares would be stallions that would be kept in a small country stud.  He has experience of one side of horse breeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have experience of another side of horse breeding and I do know that if a blood horse is found to be a weed, is found to be blemished or defective, is unable to win a race, the subsequent history of that blood horse is very interesting.  It probably comes down from the Moore stud&mdash;a stud that used to be probably one of <Col N="2052" /> the greatest in the British Isles&mdash;and that horse having filled the owner with disgust, having lost a race in which probably the owner lost a lot of money, is abandoned to a farrier or a blacksmith. Then he comes down from Mayo or King's County and finds his way into Clare.  He goes into the possession of a smith.  He is a weed, but the country people will be informed that the horse is splendidly bred.  They are not very expert on the points of a thoroughbred.  They will not know all the defects he has.  They will not know he is an absolute weed.  Of course all the farmers' mares in the country will be sent to be covered by this very splendid thoroughbred.  When they expect saleable hunters, good hunters, what will they have?  They will have ugly, weedy, defective, knock-kneed, spavined animals.  They go to the fair with their three-year-olds, having taken the utmost care of them, having brushed them and curried them. They bring them to the fair but they are offered nothing for these hunters. That is the other side of the picture. For that reason I submit that the amendment of Senator Colonel Moore, properly drafted as it is in order, supported clearly by the arguments from his side&mdash;that is from the first-class stud side&mdash;of the picture, should not be accepted by the House, and that the Bill as it stands is preferable.  It is preferable for the reason that farmers and people with good mares should be protected from these roving thoroughbreds that are to be found in possession of smiths and farriers all through the country in areas where there are no great stud farms.  I do think at the same time that the section should be amended in the sense of some of the amendments which will come forward before the House.</P>

      <P>I thought perhaps, a Chathaoirligh, that you would take all the amendments together, because they all deal with the same matter; but if you wish we shall deal with this amendment first.  I think that the case put up by Senator Colonel Moore has been answered by Senator Comyn, as I should like to answer it.  I am not saying that I should be able to do it as well.  Senator Comyn has <Col N="2053" /> answered it, however, as I should like to answer it, that there is a danger that these thoroughbred horses if exempted would eventually fall into the hands of persons who would use them for the service of ordinary mares. As Senator Comyn has said, the owners of ordinary mares are sometimes deceived by a great deal of the talk in regard to the high breeding of horses of that sort.  They are not perhaps as competent to judge the good points of a stallion as people who own thoroughbred horses would be. We do mean to exempt the owner of a thoroughbred stallion entered in a stud book which is being used for the service of mares, entered in a stud book also, because we feel that the owner of a thoroughbred mare which is entered in a stud book is quite competent to make up his mind in regard to the stallion to which he will send his mare.  We feel also that for a particular type of stallion a rather high service fee will be charged in most cases.  It would seldom go below £20. If he is badly formed or made or likely to beget faults in his progeny, it is not likely that he will have good mares sent to him.  I think there is no necessity for the State or State inspectors to interfere in such cases.  When, however, these thoroughbred stallions for any reason go down the country and are used in the service of ordinary mares a certain amount of protection is required.  I might point out that as the law stands that is the position.  If a thoroughbred stallion at present is used anywhere for the service of other than thoroughbred mares entered in the stud book he must be licensed.  We are not changing that in the least. Senator Moore's amendment would have the effect of loosening the regulations as they are at present instead of tightening them.  Our object in bringing in the Bill was to tighten the regulations to a certain extent.  If we were to accept the amendment it would have the opposite effect&mdash;that things would be much easier than they were before.  In no circumstances could I accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This picture which has been drawn about a little skeleton thoroughbred being brought down to <Col N="2054" /> some far country place might do very well for some auctioneer in the back lanes, but farmers are not such fools. They know something about horses, and they know that this wretched animal is not going to do them any good and they will not send their mares to it.  The whole of this part of the Bill is just built on the fiction that everybody is a fool, and that a countryman does not know which are good stallions and which are not.  My experience of farmers is that they are wise people and know a great deal more than they get credit for.  They are pretty good judges of what is suitable.  As far as the particular formation of an animal is concerned I showed the other day that it is very difficult to presume beforehand without experience what a particular animal is suitable for.  I gave the other day the case of the dam of Birdcatcher. There is not a thoroughbred horse in the stud book that has not some of the blood of Birdcatcher.  His dam was Wytcherley.  The owner of Wytcherley did not want her because she seemed to be of no use.  He offered to sell her for £30 and no one would touch her.  It was said that this wretched little mare would not be able to breed a hunter.  That mare bred the best horses that have ever been at the stud or that have ever been raced in England.  If we had had no Birdcatcher half the racehorses in the country would be the worse off.  These are merely presumptions.  No doubt people like to get control of something or other by establishing committees and such like things.  The ordinary country person is well able to manage his own business and the less he is interfered with the better.  He has done well for himself up till now.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 4.  To delete the section and to substitute therefor a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>4.&mdash;A stallion which is entered in a recognised stud book and which&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  is used for the service of no mares other than mares entered in a recognised stud book, or</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2055" /> (b)  is of or over the prescribed age and is used exclusively for racing or is in training for racing is exempt from the provisions of this Act.</P>
    <P>This Bill will have a very big effect on the future of horse breeding in Ireland.  If anything is done under the Bill to interfere by way of regulation or anything else, in the production of thoroughbred horses used for racing purposes we shall run the risk of gravely injuring one of the biggest trades that we have to-day. Irish thoroughbred horses were sold to twenty-three foreign countries last year.  The thoroughbred horse is the only thing produced in Ireland to-day that we can claim has a world-wide market&mdash;world-wide in the sense of wherever horses are used for racing purposes.  We have the soil and the climate.  We have developed the necessary technical skill in the production of thoroughbred horses that compels the world to admit to-day that the Irish thoroughbred horse is the best. Herr Becker of Hamburg, who has written a monumental work on the thoroughbred horse, in summarising the position at the end of the book says that taking the best places to breed thoroughbred horses Ireland was the first.  I shall not hurt the feelings of the various nations that produce thoroughbred horses by quoting the order in which he places them.  In America to-day an Irish-bred stallion, in its first season serving in America, is easily at the top of the record of thoroughbred stallions in America.  That horse was bred in the County Dublin.  Blandford, who was bred in County Kildare, is the sire of three Derby winners and is recognised as the stallion of the best two-year olds which ran in England this year.  I could quote innumerable instances to prove that, as far as the production of the thoroughbred horse goes, you cannot improve on the technique of the people connected with it here.  That is proved by the number of people anxious to buy our horses and by the fact that the horses produced here get the highest prices at the Doncaster sales.  A mare that was sold for £8,200 last week in England <Col N="2056" /> was Irish-bred.  In every single country people are anxious to buy the stock of an Irish horse, if they want horses.  Where I disagree with the other amendments and with Section 4, as it stands in the Bill, is on the question of a recognised stud book.  The prescribed stud book is one thing and one thing only&mdash;that is the general stud book, the British stud book as it is to-day.  Other countries have stud books and, even outside of the general stud book, there is a stud book in England&mdash;Miss Prior's half-bred stud book&mdash;in which there are registered 2,700 horses, of which 700 are brood mares.</P>
    <P>Of those 700 brood mares in Miss Prior's book, 300 are located in Ireland. From those 300 mares horses as good as any that have come from the Wetherby Stud Book have been bred. If we had an Irish stud book, the majority of these animals would be included in it.  Our biggest market has always been the British market. Our second biggest market to-day is the Indian market.  The Indian market was brought to us by a horse which, if this Bill had been in existence and administered strictly, could not have been produced here.  I refer to Mayfowl.  That horse was exported to India in 1909.  In 1910 it won the biggest race they have there, the Viceroy's Cup.  It won it again in 1911.  It dead-heated with an Irish horse in 1912, and it won it again in 1913.  To-day, instead of a monument to some great patriot or politician, the greatest monument in Calcutta is the monument to Mayfowl &mdash;the Irish horse which started off by making Ireland known to the Indians. If we were to exclude all but those on the prescribed stud book, which is now regarded as Wetherby's Stud Book, we would run a big risk of losing our trade&mdash;a very considerable trade&mdash;with many countries.  The countries which take our horses without inquiring whether or not they are on the prescribed stud book are India, Ceylon, South Africa, Egypt and Norway. They represented more than half the horses sold from Ireland this year. They do not ask if the horses are on Wetherby's Stud Book or not.  They accept them for what they believe they <Col N="2057" /> are, judging them by their form in the various racing calendars which they look up.  It is absolutely vital that Miss Prior's Stud Book, including all those mares here in Ireland, should be accepted as a stud book for the purpose of this Act by the Minister.  That is the reason why we are not asking at the moment for a prescribed stud book. We want the stud books of France, America, South America, Austria-Hungary and the books of all those countries in which racing takes place and in which they have an official stud book recognised, as Wetherby's was recognised in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the administration of this Bill is going to be the same as the administration of the 1918 Act.  But the people who bred these half-bred horses in Ireland were acting against the law.  I admit that the law has not been enforced against the people who did so and I am sure that while the Minister and his Government are in power it will not be enforced against them.  But my view is that when we are putting through an Act we should make it wide enough and clear enough to comprise all these matters so that they will cease to be illegal.  These people did not engage in this business for the purpose of breaking the law but because they believed in this particular line and considered that they would get results from it.  It is for that reason I am so persistent in asking the Minister to accept a recognised form of stud book for the purpose of the Act.</P>
    <P>On the question of the prescribed age for horses in training and racing, we can only to-day sell colts&mdash;they will not receive geldings&mdash;to Brazil, Panama and Venezuela.  If they are geldings they have to pay duty in France, and if not colts they are not allowed into Brazil and Panama, which are the new markets and which are capable of a lot of development.  For that reason I ask the Minister to except the 400 colts, and two and three-year-olds, which are used almost altogether for racing purposes.</P>
    <P>I need not further emphasise the facilities we have in the country for breeding horses.  Lord Furness, the Aga Khan and England itself has selected a place in County Kildare for <Col N="2058" /> the National Stud.  These things clearly show the utility of Ireland as a breeding place.  The people managing these studs are natives of this country and they have clearly proven that they have sufficient technical knowledge to run the business here in the estimation of people outside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. It would appear to me that any slowness or hesitation in accepting the amendment would amount to a suggestion that there is something wrong with the present condition of affairs in regard to the breeding of both thoroughbred and half-bred horses. What is wrong?  Can the Minister say? Those who are in a position to know and who speak from long and expert experience, both on practical and technical sides, say that the present methods are suitable for general conditions, suitable in regard to breeding the best material and economically suitable in regard to the countries with which they have dealings.  I ask the Minister to point out where the trouble lies.  It all hinges, it appears to me, on the difference between a prescribed stud book and a recognised stud book. Who is to decide which is the better? Wetherby's Stud Book is a long time in existence, no doubt.  Are the people responsible for getting horses on to that stud book any more expert in horse-breeding than those other people who have shown their expert knowledge by the stuff they have produced &mdash;horses that made a name in all parts of the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very act of hesitating to accept this amendment would be a suggestion that there was something going wrong now with Irish horse breeding that never went wrong before.  It would tend to make suspicious people who are sending their mares to this country in great numbers.  The influx of mares into all parts of Ireland has been a source of great revenue.  If the owners of sires are interfered with in the management of their business, those people who send these horses over will naturally think that there is something wrong.  We will not make progress in this way.  We must depend for that on the skill of the people who know their business.  We are satisfied that they <Col N="2059" /> know their business.  The performance of our team of Irish horses all over the world has shown this.  Some of these horses were bred in the county from which Senator Parkinson comes and, as they have proved their effectiveness and utility, I do not think there should be any hesitation in dealing with the matter in the manner suggested.  There is a resolution lower down that we should take into account, in addition to the prescribed stud book, a recognised stud book, because these other horses have proved equally effective. These have proved themselves equally effective.  In doing what they are doing the breeders and owners are doing an illegal thing and, instead of compelling them to continue this illegality, the Minister should legalise the present process, and that would be all to the good.</P>

      <P>I gather that all sections of the House are agreed that this measure is necessary for portion of the horse-breeding industry in the country. It is necessary to protect the ordinary farmer, the ordinary man who owns a horse&mdash;to protect him and his horses and the progeny of those horses from injury.  To that extent we are all with him.  I think it is also clear that every section in this House wants this measure to do no harm, if it can possibly be helped, to the thoroughbred industry.  What I think we are anxious to do is to send this Bill back to the Dáil in such a form that it will do as little harm as possible, if any, to the thoroughbred industry.  The amendment is designed for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Parkinson and I have used the word &ldquo;recognised&rdquo; because we object to the word &ldquo;prescribed.&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; has hitherto been confined to a particular stud book. It is only one out of a number of stud books, the mares in which are sent to this country in very large numbers and, as the Bill stands, if the practice carried on under the 1918 Act up to the present, with only the Wetherby Stud Book as the prescribed stud book, were to continue, then every stallion in this country to which a French mare <Col N="2060" /> in the French stud book or an American or Indian mare in an American or Indian stud book would come, would be put outside the protection of this Act; he would have to get a certificate, and in that way the industry would be hampered.  That is what we want to avoid.  If the Minister can devise any way of avoiding that in a better form than is presented in the amendment, I am sure Senator Parkinson and myself would welcome it.  I know he is as anxious as we are that this great industry should not be injured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principle of this amendment, and I am sure the Minister is endeavouring to see how he can put into proper form the idea that is here set out.  If any advocacy were necessary to induce him to do anything, it would have been the very interesting speech made by Senator Parkinson.  I would like to point out to Senator Brown that in the section of the Act of Parliament under discussion the phrase is not &ldquo;the prescribed stud book&rdquo; but &ldquo;a prescribed stud book&rdquo; and it would be quite open to the Minister to prescribe more than one stud book, to prescribe in fact all the stud books which are recognised in Ireland, the two that are recognised in Ireland and the stud books which are recognised in other countries.  Senator Brown objects to the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; and he has used instead the word &ldquo;recognised.&rdquo; My difficulty is in relation to the word &ldquo;recognised.&rdquo;  Recognised by whom? &ldquo;Prescribed&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;prescribed by the Minister,&rdquo; but &ldquo;recognised&rdquo; is put in here without being linked up to any other word, without being defined.  Suppose that this legislation were subject to legal decision.  The first question asked would be &ldquo;Recognised by whom?&rdquo; Would it mean recognised by the owner?  He might have in his private possession a pedigree of his own horses, and it might mean recognised by him.  Therefore, while I am in favour of the principle I find a difficulty in regard to the word &ldquo;recognised.&rdquo;  I would like to carry out in its entirety what is desired by Senator Parkinson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2061" /> Another matter to which I would like to call attention is this.  The amendment finishes with the phrase &ldquo;is exempt from the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;  In the Bill the phraseology is &ldquo;may apply to the Minister for a certificate of exemption.&rdquo;  Is there any particular reason why the Minister should not be applied to for a certificate of exemption?  There is one argument in favour of the section.  It may be of advantage to the State that the Minister should at least know where all these thoroughbred horses are and he never can know if you simply say a stallion is exempt.  He never can know, otherwise, where all the sires are.  Has Senator Parkinson any particular reason for using the phrase &ldquo;is exempt&rdquo; instead of the phrase &ldquo;may apply... for a certificate of exemption&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>I do not think Senators appear to recognise the fact that in this Bill we are doing exactly what was done in the 1918 Act.  The wording of Section 4 is not exactly the same as the wording in the 1918 Act, but we mean to administer the law in the same way, to make the regulations the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to make it possible to prescribe Wetherby's, which was the only book prescribed for the last ten years, I would be prepared to recommend the Seanad to accept amendment No. 4, which is Senator Quirke's.  That means the very same <Col N="2062" /> words as in the 1918 Act, and if the section were amended in that way we could then prescribe any book, Wetherby's, French or American, or anyone we thought fit to prescribe.  I can state, however, that for the last ten years it was only Wetherby's that was prescribed, and if I were to be asked whether I meant to change that I would say no, because I do not know enough about the horse breeding industry to take it on myself to change it.  On the other hand, I intend, if this Bill passes, to set up an advisory council from those who know most about the horse breeding industry in general.  And after consultation I think we might decide to prescribe other books as well as Wetherby's.  That is our position.  We make no change whatever.</P>
    <P>There, however, appears to be a fear that we may administer the law differently in the future.  Whether this Bill passes or not, I think the Department was under the impression that the law was being administered.  They may not have gone out of their way to go to certain horse breeders to see if they were obeying the law.  Most of the horse breeders were obeying the law, and whether they had the horse registered in Wetherby's and wanted to mate that horse with a mare not registered in Wetherby's a certificate of exemption was sought from the Department and that was granted.</P>
    <P>The point mentioned by Senator Brown was that when a mare was being imported in order to be served by a stallion there is a certificate required for the importation of the mare.  The same happens in regard to the stallions. At any rate we are dealing with the mares first.  A mare that is brought across to be served by a stallion here must get a certificate in order to be imported.  Of course, it is usually stated by the person importing the mare what the purpose is and if it is to be served by a stallion here, then permission is given for both things at the same time.  I take it that the difficulty Senator Parkinson has is with regard to the 300 mares in Miss Prior's Stud Book in this country.  He thinks we should have Miss Prior's <Col N="2063" /> Stud Book prescribed.  That is a matter that will be before the consultative council that I intend to set up. That can be done.  It was not because the door was being opened too wide that we prescribed this stud book. Then we can give a certificate for any number of mares out of that book which were being sent to one of these stallions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recognition of stallions not in Wetherby's the position is at present that they would be mostly imported in the first instance.  A permit would have to be sought to have them imported and at the same time a permit would be asked to have them used for service under this Section 4.  That would, of course, be granted where advisable as was the practice in the last ten years. A difficulty, however, arises in the case where that stallion would pass on from one person to another.  It would be quite all right to give a certificate and a permit to import&mdash;a certificate of exemption to the person importing the horse&mdash;but we must keep track of that stallion.  If he passes from one particular owner to another we have to trace him and keep account of where he is.  We differ from Senator Parkinson as to whether &ldquo;exempt&rdquo; would be sufficient.  We think it is not sufficient.  The big difference between us appears to be &ldquo;recognise&rdquo; and &ldquo;prescribe.&rdquo;  We all appear to be aiming at the same object and that is to have as little interference as possible with the bloodstock breeders.  We are all agreed on that.  Every Senator here is agreed on it.  We hold, however, the amendment moved by Senator Quirke, instead of the amendment moved by Senator Parkinson, would meet the case and that the word &ldquo;recognise&rdquo; will get just as far, because &ldquo;recognise&rdquo; will have to be defined.  If we were to leave &ldquo;recognise&rdquo; as it is now, it would mean that the register of Clydesdales would have to be included so that Senator Parkinson would be quite free to have his mares served by a Clydesdale stallion.  Otherwise, any person could come along and make a register.  It was attempted in this country ten years ago.  Any person <Col N="2064" /> could come along and could build up a stud book.  That was attempted ten years ago.  The person was not very particular so long as he could get 10/-. He got all classes of breeders.  He got a thousand people altogether to recognise his stud book.  However, he was afterwards recognised by the Civic Guards.  But his was a recognised stud book and it would be recognised so far as this amendment stands.  You would have to come down and define &ldquo;recognise&rdquo; and you would have to prescribe what &ldquo;recognise&rdquo; means, so that the word &ldquo;recognise&rdquo; would have to be one of the words prescribed in this Bill.  But we would arrive at the same conclusion as we all aim at the same purpose.  As the word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; appears to be the most suitable word, the amendment by Senator Quirke brings us back to the same word as in the 1918 Act and ought to be adopted.</P>
    <P>The case should really be argued by Senator Parkinson and others before the advisory council because the advisory council will be consulted about the regulations under this Bill. The advisory council will make recommendations to the Minister for Agriculture as to what the regulations should be.  It is, therefore, before the advisory council that the Senators here should make the case they are making with regard to the different stud books that should be recognised and with regard to the free movement of stallions.  All these matters are matters that would come more properly under the regulations than as amendments to the Bill.</P>

      <P>Now that is one of the serious interferences with this industry &mdash;having to go and apply for a certificate. What we put in our amendment, and what Senator Moore has in his, is to strike out the section altogether. It would, therefore, take away the <Col N="2065" /> necessity for the application for exemption altogether.  I also suggest to the Minister and I admit that the word &ldquo;recognise&rdquo; implies that it must be recognised by somebody just as the word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; means that &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; must be recognised by somebody. Practically all our Acts mean prescribed by the Minister.  If the Minister is setting up a consultative council he will put on it those in the industry of horse breeding.  Why should any question of recognition be dealt with?  After all the number of stallions that are recognised by the Board, subject to the Minister accepting the advice of the Board, will be the ones that will be prescribed.  It is not as good a word as &ldquo;prescribed,&rdquo; but there is no reason why the same practical result could not be brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator Brown, it is true that these owners will have to apply for exemption, and the reason is that we want to keep track of every stallion in the country.  It is a very simple matter. They have only to apply for exemption once.  As I said before, in a good many cases stallions will be imported and an exemption will be applied for at that time.  In other cases a stallion may be racing in this country and after some time may be sent to the stud. An exemption may be applied for then, but it will not have to be applied for annually.  As regards certain studs, there will not be any trouble at all about exemptions being granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trouble is likely to arise only where there is a doubt, where the Department is not satisfied that a stallion is being used entirely for the service of mares in a recognised stud book.  In such cases there may be a doubt as to whether the Department will give an exemption or not.  In these cases the Department would have to proceed and bring the parties concerned to court to make them prove their case.  In such cases these persons must apply for an exemption and the Department will give its decision.  If the persons concerned feel that they have a grievance, that the decision given against them is <Col N="2066" /> a harsh one, they can bring the Minister to court.</P>

      <P>On the question of recognition as against prescription, when the regulations made under this Act are put into force, will it not be possible for the Minister, after getting the opinion of his advisory council on the matter, to have a recognised stud book embodied in the regulations? If that is possible, there ought not to be any difficulty.  Under the 1918 Act there has only been one stud book prescribed, namely, Wetherby's.  If the 1918 Act had been administered strictly in the legal sense, it would have done an infinite amount of harm to horse breeding in Ireland, but in the year in which it was passed Ireland had only a few representatives in the British House of Commons.  In view of that, we did not expect that we would get anything like fair play. Indeed, we only got fair play in the lack of administration of that Act.</P>

If the Minister means by that that he is going to put the penal clauses in the 1918 Act into operation I can see very grave trouble ahead for a lot of stud farms now in existence in the country.  As I said before, we in this country had nothing to do with the passing of the 1918 Act.  At that time we had hardly any representatives from Ireland in the British House of Commons.  The only bit of comfort we got from that Act was that it was not enforced either by the British Government or by the Government that we had here during the last ten years. Surely the Minister does not mean that he is going to treat us worse than we were under the British Act, with which we had nothing to do in regard to its passing?</P>

      <P>This section refers to the forcible castration of horses.  If a person does not fulfil the order to castrate a horse it may not be his fault.  The order may not have been delivered although some one of the Minister's subordinates may have sent down such an order. Then, again, it is very serious to castrate a very expensive horse.  If a man is forbidden to use the horse here he might take it with advantage to another country.  But if this section is allowed to remain in the Bill a man may come back from a journey abroad and find that a valuable horse has been castrated in his absence.  I think that is very strong action to take, and cannot be accepted.  If it were provided that a man should be fined or something of that sort for not carrying out the order I would not say anything against it, but it is too strong a step to insist that the horse should be castrated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to amendment 11&mdash;Section 25: To delete the words &ldquo;certificate of exemption&rdquo; in line 15&mdash;I ask leave of the House to allow it to stand over until Report Stage and I shall tell the House why. The Minister has certainly done his best to meet us in this matter. Although we have passed an amendment altering Section 4 and altering it in such a way that the necessity for a certificate of exemption no longer exists if that section were put into the Act, the Minister has met us so fairly that I think we ought to meet him again between this and the Report Stage, even if that stage is taken to-morrow.  I think, with the help of the undertaking he has given to introduce into the Bill an advisory council, and, also, with the chance of getting what we want, even though the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; is to come in, it will be a very different proposition.  Even with the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; we have this advisory council, and both Houses have a final say on the Minister's order, and have a right to say whether that order should be carried out or not.  Therefore, I suggest that this amendment should stand over because, although it will make the industry a little more troublesome, I do not think they ought to object to an initial certificate, after this Bill becomes law, when the horse starts on his career first.  I think they would object to applying every year, and we might probably come to terms with the Minister as to that.  I see a very good chance of an agreement that would make this a really good working Bill, and I think it would be better not to have us fighting over words when our purpose is the same. If the House would give leave for it to stand over for the Report Stage I would be willing to withdraw it at present.</P>

I think it would be a very great pity that this Bill should be lost by reason of a difference which, I confess, I cannot understand now.  I think they should go back on that.  I think the Minister is right that there must be one certificate at all events, so that he may have what the Minister has described as a track of all these horses.

Humane slaughter for all animals, except pigs, is compulsory in Scotland since October, 1929; in Northern Ireland since January 1, 1933.  The same conditions will apply in England and Wales as from January 1, 1934, as the result of an Act of Parliament passed last summer.  Amongst other European countries with laws compelling the humane slaughter of animals are Finland, Holland, Switzerland, Bavaria and many of the States in Germany, Turkey, Norway, and a number of other countries.  In the Saorstát, Bray is the only township in which humane slaughter is compulsory.  The Commissioner, Mr. P.J. Meghen, has made the use of the humane killer for cattle compulsory since August, 1932, and for sheep since November, 1932.  It is true, of course, that under the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930, the use of the humane killer for cattle is compulsory in exporting slaughterhouses. It is true also that most of the well-conducted butchers' shops in Dublin, and in many parts of Ireland, have voluntarily used the humane killer for many years.</P>

      <P>Practically the majority of well-established butchers use the humane killer.  It is a significant fact that countries to which we <Col N="2074" /> send our live stock have passed legislation enforcing humane methods of slaughter, while the country that has produced the stock, and that should show more consideration towards them than the buyers of the fat beasts, because of their more intimate association with the animals, is the one country that has not enforced humane slaughter.</P>
      <P>I hope the Bill will be considered on its merits.  If it is, I am sure there will be no difference in principle, and very little difference in detail.  It is merely an appeal to our common Christianity, and to our conceptions of right and wrong, which should prevent us from inflicting unnecessary pain and suffering upon animals which are placed at our complete disposal.  They are undoubtedly part of the great scheme of creation and they have rights within that scheme, although they are unable to plead.  While exercising our rights, that should not make us lose sight of our responsibility towards them.  The civil laws of most lands recognise these rights, and the wilful infliction of cruelty is punished not only by fines but by imprisonment.  A man cannot work a horse that is lame, or otherwise indisposed, but he can sell that horse to a dealer in horseflesh and turn it into the knacker's yard and subject it to the exquisite mental torture of seeing its own kind slaughtered.  Afterwards the animal itself will have to submit to execution by methods which are barbarous, cumbersome and cruel in the extreme.  We have heard a great deal about horses in the Seanad to-day. When we consider that noble and beautiful animal, one of man's greatest friends in the animal world, and consider the brutal methods adopted in some of the knacker's yards when days of service are past, it makes one disgusted at man's inhumanity towards these dumb creatures, which are placed at his mercy, which have no advocate to speak for them, and no court to appeal to no matter how cruel the decision may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already inflicted a mountain of suffering on the brute creation; more or less as a matter of necessity, by vivisection, where we operate without an anæsthetic on the <Col N="2075" /> quivering flesh and tissues of live animals.  The only excuse is that that is necessary to the welfare of humanity.  There is no such excuse, where unnecessary suffering is inflicted on animals to be killed for human food or for any other purpose.  We would do well, when dealing with this question, to remember the inscription that appears over the entrance of one of the great continental slaughterhouses. It reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Thine is a task of blood&mdash;</P>
    <P>Discharge that task with mercy&mdash;</P>
    <P>Let thy victim know no pain</P>
    <P>But let the sudden blow bring death,</P>
    <P>Such death as thou thyself wouldst ask.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I may be told that hunting is cruel, and that it should be stopped if we are to be consistent.  It is cruel, but you cannot have hunting without cruelty.  If hunting is forbidden we will be told that we are damaging the horse breeding industry.  On the other hand, we can slaughter all the animals we require for human use with the infliction of a tithe of the suffering now inflicted upon them. One section we have always with us, those who are in opposition and who are known as &ldquo;he-men.&rdquo;  I think the definition of a &ldquo;he-man&rdquo; would be a person who is callous to everyone's suffering but his own.  They will tell you that those who advocate consideration for the suffering of animals that cannot speak for themselves, are &ldquo;old women.&rdquo;  Having said that they have said the last word on the subject, in their opinion.  The late Patrick Pearse would not even fish because it would cause suffering.  I do not think anybody would accuse him of being an &ldquo;old woman.&rdquo;  Let any of these great &ldquo;he-men&rdquo; go to have a tooth extracted and watch how they jump in the chair if the dentist suggests taking it out without an anaesthetic.  I wonder what would happen if they suffered from appendicitis, and if the surgeon suggested taking out the appendix without administering an anaesthetic, but just tying them down to the operating table.  Their attitude is reminiscent of a certain Irish absentee landlord who, on one occasion, <Col N="2076" /> was written to by his exasperated and frightened agent.  The agent stated that he could not collect the rents except at the expense of his life.  The landlord wired back: &ldquo;The tenants are sadly mistaken if they think they can intimidate me by taking your life.  Collect the rents.&rdquo;  That is the attitude of &ldquo;he-men&rdquo; who denounce anybody who favours humane methods as being &ldquo;old womanish.&rdquo;  They exhibit a striking feeling of tenderness for themselves but none for others.</P>

      <P>The main discussion upon this Bill will turn upon the relative merits of the humane killer as against the pole-axe.  I submit that there can be no serious doubt at this stage as to the actual merits of the two methods.  The comparison is similar to that of the axe with the guillotine or the bow and arrow with the modern rifle or machine-gun. Wherever an efficient and scientific experiment has been made, and the number of such is legion, the efficiency and the merciful character of the mechanical weapon such as the Cash captive bolt, has been demonstrated beyond all doubt to be superior to the pole-axe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Corporation of London made a number of experiments in public slaughter houses in Islington and they found that with the pole-axe used by experienced and expert butchers, in the case of bulls, it took 250 strokes to bring down 100 bulls; in the case of 100 oxen, 123 blows were necessary; in the case of 100 cows, 127 blows were required and in the case of 100 pigs, 155 blows.  In other words, to fell 400 beasts, 655 strokes of the pole-axe were necessary and that is so when nobody but experts, or so-called experts, are employed.  They then tested 1,255 cases in which a captive bolt was used.  These included bulls and a number of old animals which are difficult to fell, and it was found that for the 1,255 animals, only 1,259 shots were necessary and of these, two were failures because the bullet did not explode, but no suffering was imposed, and in the two remaining cases, pigs, the animals moved their heads just at <Col N="2077" /> the moment of firing.  There you have 1,255 animals with practically no failure with the captive bolt, while you have 655 blows to fell 400 beasts with the pole-axe.</P>
    <P>The Chairman of the Tanners' Federation of Great Britain and Ireland took up 100 hides haphazard, of beasts killed with the pole-axe and found that it took 174 strokes to fell these animals.  There have been numerous experiments of that kind, all of which have gone to show that the pole-axe is an uncertain and cruel instrument and that is when it is used in the hands of experts.  Where it is used by a beginner, of course the position is infinitely worse.  A well-known slaughter man, named Mr. Terry, of Croydon, writes:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have seen a professional slaughter man hit a bullock as many as 12 or 13 times before it was properly stunned.  I have seen bullocks hit several times and go absolutely mad, foaming at the mouth and bellowing with pain.  As many as twenty blows are known to have been made with the pole-axe before the animal was stunned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To become a so-called expert, the beginner has to practise on the living animal.  There are numerous instances quoted of the barbarities that are inflicted while this apprenticeship is being served.  Professor Minton in his book on &ldquo;Humane Slaughter of Animals,&rdquo; giving some of his experiences, says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A heifer was roped and brought to the wall in a killing booth in a large abattoir.  There were present two experienced hands and a learner; the pole-axe was passed to the youth who then proceeded to light a cigarette.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was evidently a he-man!</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Having got this going to his satisfaction he attempted to fell the heifer; after three abortive blows, and the unfortunate animal becoming maddened, one of the experienced hands took the pole-axe and himself failed to bring down the beast with the first blow.  At his second blow, the fifth in all, the unfortunate animal fell stunned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2078" /> He goes on to say that numerous instances of that kind occur which are never seen by an inspector.  That is the way a man becomes an expert&mdash;by first mangling and torturing animals by inefficiency and often by nervousness, often by lack of strength, bad physical condition or numerous other human considerations that enter into the question when a man is using a pole-axe. The slaughter of bulls is a particularly barbarous proceeding where a pole-axe is concerned.  The hide on the front of the forehead is very tough and hard to penetrate and if the blow is not got in with great strength and certainty in the beginning, the skin swells and makes it infinitely more difficult to bring down the beast.  What is done, therefore, in many cases is that, after tying down the beast's head, a knife is used and run under the skin and the whole of the front of the head stripped with the knife so as to lay the bone bare for the axe.  There are numerous confirmations of that.  The same Mr. Terry says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the case of a bull, whose hide is always very thick on the skull, I I have seen the hide cut with a knife and ripped down the skull before the bull is pole-axed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Dodds, late superintendent of the Carlisle slaughter house, says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;.... I have seen three, four, five, and even ten blows levelled at an animal before it has been brought to the ground; and I have known cases, though these are exceptional, where all efforts have failed to bring the animal down through the repeated blows having caused the head to swell; and then a knife has been run into the spine at the back of the head, or a bone laid bare by removing the skin from the forehead while the animal has been standing, so that the weight of the blow is got into the bare bone.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it not a barbarous business to have that type of cruelty inflicted when there is an instrument such as the &ldquo;Cash&rdquo; captive bolt which can be placed on the exact spot on the beast's head, which is not much bigger than can be covered by an ordinary golf ball, and by drawing the pistol, <Col N="2079" /> sending the bolt right into the brain of the animal and rendering it unconscious immediately?  They can be killed even without being tied up.  The bolt flies back into the barrel of the pistol and all that is necessary to keep the pistol in order is to keep it properly greased and oiled.  The highest cost of one of these instrument is £5.  That is the initial cost and cartridges, no matter what size is used, can be bought at 4/6 per 100 so that after the initial expenditure, the total cost is one halfpenny per beast killed.  Some people agree that while these instruments should be used where cattle are concerned, they should not be used in the case of sheep; that they are difficult of use and that no unnecessary suffering is imposed on sheep.  As to their difficulty, that has been proved to be merely mythical.  In the public slaughterhouse in Berlin, from 6,000 to 10,000 sheep are killed every day. These are first stunned with a mechanical instrument.  I have here a copy of a letter from the managing director of Messrs. James Wilson, Ltd., Edinburgh, who says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We in Edinburgh slaughterhouse slaughter annually 30,000 cattle, 5,000 calves, 160,000 sheep and 17,000 pigs all of which are mechanically stunned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If they can do 160,000 sheep with mechanical stunners, it shows that it is quite effective in the case of sheep. Really terrible cruelties are inflicted in the case of sheep.  The sheep is generally laid on a crutch or on the ground and three of its legs tied or held by one or more men.  The neck is then extended and a knife driven in behind the ear by another man.  While the knife is there, it is worked in between the joints of the entrail with a view to severing the spinal cord. Sometimes what the butcher does is to put his finger in to find the cord and break it and very often it is a long time before he finds it.  The neck of the animal in some cases is turned back and in the case of old sheep this is very difficult and involves terrible torture.  It is not done in order to <Col N="2080" /> shorten the agony but to make the head more easily removable when the carcase is being dressed.  Sir Benjamin Ward Robertson, in his book, &ldquo;Humane Slaughter of Animals for Food,&rdquo; says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the case of sheep killed with a knife, the death is comparatively severe.  The thrust of the knife is a keen penalty, and the process of breaking through the cervical vertebræ, though it greatly shortens the agony, is a violent and evidently excruciating procedure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have here, but I am not going to read it to delay the House, a case which was heard in the Kilkenny court last February.  It is reported in the &ldquo;Kilkenny Journal&rdquo; of 25th February, 1933, where an inspector of the Department of Local Government summoned a man employed in a butcher's establishment for proceeding to skin a sheep whilst it was yet alive.  The case has the most gruesome details, all of which were proved, the butcher being fined £4.  So cruelties are inflicted on sheep in this country just as much as in the case of cattle.</P>
    <P>One important consideration in regard to the humane killer is that a body known as the Journeymen Butchers' Federation of Great Britain who, for a considerable time opposed the introduction of the humane killer, at a meeting held in June last passed the following resolution:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That this annual delegate meeting considers that the time has arrived that the Journeymen Butchers' Federation can withdraw its opposition to the use of humane killers as we are convinced that the implements now available are quite suitable and efficient for their purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that objections from the viewpoint of efficiency and ability to use the instrument without any risk have been removed.</P>
    <P>To take the Bill itself, sub-section (1)  provides that no animal shall be brought to a slaughterhouse or knacker's yard except in accordance with the Act.  Sub-section (2)  provides that the animal on being brought to <Col N="2081" /> slaughter shall be conveyed so as to avoid any unnecessary suffering, pain or fatigue.  That is included in the British Act also.  Sub-section (3) provides for the waiting animals to be supplied with water and, where the period of waiting exceeds 12 hours, with food also.  That period may be too short, but, of course, that is a matter that can be dealt with in Committee. Sub-section (4) forbids the dressing of the carcase of any animal within the view of any other animal. Sub-section (5) provides for the proper securing of animals before being struck so as to inflict the minimum of pain where they have to be knocked down in order to be stunned.  Sub-section (6) is the vital one, which makes it compulsory to stun an animal first by a mechanically operated instrument approved of by the Minister for Agriculture.  The next sub-section provides for exemptions.  The first exemption is for a slaughterhouse or a knacker's yard situate more than two miles by road from a barrack or station of the Gárda Síochána.  The only object of that is not to put any undue work or strain upon the Civic Guards in the administration of the Act.  There will be very few slaughterhouses more than two miles from a barrack.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (6) (b) exempts food killed according to the Jewish or Mohammedan method.  I want to utter a personal note here, and it is this, that this section must not, as far as I am concerned, indicate any approval or commendation on my part of the Jewish or Mohammedan method of slaughter.  On the contrary, it is to me rather revolting to think that anybody should imagine that he is going to win spiritual favour for himself in the eyes of an all-Merciful Providence by inflicting tortures upon the dumb but living units of His creation.  Consequently, it is only respect for religious sentiment, in a matter which goes back to the days of Abraham and Isaac, that has caused this exemption to be included in the Bill.  The next sub-section provides that no person under the age of 16 shall be admitted to or permitted to remain in a slaughterhouse during the process of slaughter <Col N="2082" /> of an animal or cutting up of the carcase. Section 2 prescribes the penalties for breaches of the Act.  Section 3 provides that the sanitary authority shall be the body to issue a licence to people engaged in slaughtering animals and further provides that nobody under the age of 18 shall be able to secure a licence.  Section 4 applies the provisions of the Bill to any slaughterhouse established or run by a local authority and enables that authority to make reasonable charges where they do slaughtering work for other people Section 5 makes provision for entry and investigation by the Gárda Síochána or any other person authorised by a sanitary authority or by the Department of Local Government or the Department of Agriculture. Section 6 provides for the repeal of any by-laws that may be inconsistent with the Act.  Section 7 enables the cost of administering the Act to be defrayed from the fund applicable to the purposes of the Public Health (Ireland) Acts, 1878 to 1919.  Section 8 is the saving section and provides for exemption for all cases of slaughter where the animals are killed under the Diseases of Animals Acts, 1894 to 1914.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is the definition section.  It will be observed that pigs are not included.  Although they are included in most countries, certain objections have been put up and it is felt that at this stage they should be left out, subject, of course, to any decision the House may afterwards come to in Committee. It is proposed that the Act shall come into operation in the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire on the 1st May, 1934, and elsewhere in the Saorstát on the 1st November, 1934.  I sincerely trust that the Bill will receive the general support of the House.  It can then go to Committee when the details can be discussed.  I might say that in general it is a very much less drastic measure than any of those already in operation in most other countries.  In some cases it is very much less comprehensive. There is nothing new, original or heroic in it.  We are merely asking that the same laws shall obtain here in the slaughter of animals as obtain in the <Col N="2083" /> various other countries I have mentioned and in many other countries besides.  The idea of using a mechanically operated instrument merely makes for efficiency apart altogether from the question of humanity.  Discoveries in Science have enabled us to relieve humanity of many of the sufferings to which it was otherwise heir.  A few small discoveries in Mechanics and Science enable us to relieve a very large share of the mountain of suffering that would otherwise be imposed on the brute creation. If we were to fail to avail of these, we should be utterly unworthy of our positions as civilised human beings, as Christians, or as owners and masters of these animals.  I beg to move the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>It is with no sense of satisfaction that I am raising this matter. If the Dáil were in session it would undoubtedly be much more appropriately dealt with in that House.  The Dáil has adjourned until the end of next January, and the trend of events and the nature of those events make one speculate sometimes as to whether or not the Dáil will meet at the date appointed on its adjournment, or whether it may not be the policy and the intention of the Government to see that after that time, perhaps, neither that House nor this House of the Oireachtas shall be in session.  I cannot speak with anything more than conjecture in that matter, but certainly this Government moves in a mysterious manner its wonders to perform, and we are entitled to evince curiosity which is perhaps of a somewhat unusual nature in dealing with the meanderings and exploits of an unusual Government.  However, although the Dáil is adjourned, the Seanad is in session and I think it is not only wise but the duty of this House to consider and, if necessary, <Col N="2084" /> pass judgment upon public events, or events affecting the public, such as the one that I am going to refer to this evening, especially when this matter, as I think I shall be able to show, is of grave and urgent public importance. On last Friday a proclamation was issued by the Government which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whereas it is provided by sub-section (2) of Section 19 of Article 2a of the Constitution that an Order made by the Executive Council declaring that a specified association is, in the opinion of the Executive Council, an unlawful association shall be conclusive evidence for all purposes that such association is an unlawful association:</P>
      <P>Now, the Executive Council in exercise of the powers conferred on them by sub-section (2) of Section 19 of Article 2a of the Constitution and of every and any other power them in, this behalf enabling, do hereby declare and order as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Association styling itself and generally known as the Young Ireland Association (also known as the Blue Shirts) is, in the opinion of the Executive Council, an unlawful association.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Interpretation Act, 1923 (No. 46 of 1923), applies to the interpretation of this Order in like manner as it applies to the interpretation of an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>(3)  This Order may be cited for all purposes as the Constitution (Declaration of Unlawful Association) (No. 2) Order, 1933.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Dublin.  This 8th day of December, 1933.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That proclamation raises matters of a very grave nature.  It goes to the roots of the constitutional rights and liberties of the citizens of this State. I have here this Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act, under which the Government have acted.  Section 19 is invoked as their authority.  I want to recall to the attention of the House what is the nature of this section, what authority it grants to the Government. Undoubtedly, it does grant to the <Col N="2085" /> Government the power to proclaim certain organisations as unlawful associations, but it sets out in very specific and clear language the grounds upon which their action in that respect must be based.  I want to prove before I sit down that the Government, in issuing that proclamation, have exceeded the authority conferred on them in this section of this Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act.  Part IV deals with unlawful associations.  Sub-section (1) of Section 19, to which this proclamation refers, reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) Every association which does any of the following things shall be an unlawful association, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  has amongst its professed objects, or advocates or encourages, or professes to encourage the overthrow by force of the Government of Saorstát Eireann or the alteration by force of this Constitution or the law; or</P>
    <P>(b)  without lawful authority organises or maintains or endeavours or purports to organise or maintain an armed force; or</P>
    <P>(c)  promotes or encourages the unlawful possession of fire-arms by its members; or</P>
    <P>(d)  engages in, promotes, encourages, or advocates any act, enterprise, or course of action of a treasonable or seditious character, or promotes, encourages, or advocates the attainment of any object of a treasonable or seditious character; or</P>
    <P>(e)  promotes, encourages, or advocates the commission of offences or the obstruction or interference with the administration of justice or with the enforcement of the law; or</P>
    <P>(f)  promotes, encourages, or advocates the non-payment of moneys payable to the Central Fund or any other public fund whether by way of taxation or otherwise or the non-payment of local taxation.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>An order made by the Executive Council declaring that a specified association is, in the opinion of the Executive Council, an unlawful association <Col N="2086" /> shall be conclusive evidence for all purposes that such association is an unlawful association.</P>
    <P>Common sense will surely make it clear that sub-section (2) is governed by sub-section (1).  If it was not qualified or governed by sub-section (1) then it would confer upon the Government most arbitrary powers&mdash;powers that would jeopardise and subvert the rights and liberties of any organised section of the community&mdash;the Church or any other organised body, such as the Knights of Columbanus.  I presume, however, that the Minister is going to argue that their opinion that such an association is an unlawful association is based upon the commission of some of the offences enumerated in this sub-section (1) by the association in question.  I for one shall listen with great interest to the Minister in his efforts to demonstrate that. I assert emphatically that not a single one of the provisions of sub-section (1) from (a) to (f) can be made the basis of a charge against the association which was proclaimed last Friday night.</P>
    <P>If the Minister contests my allegation, I want him to give us proof that my contention is wrong.  I want him to give proof that that association&mdash; the Young Ireland Association&mdash;advocates or encourages, or professes to encourage, the overthrow by force of the Government of Saorstát Eireann, or the alteration by force of this Constitution or the law.  I want him to give us proof that this organisation, without lawful authority, organises or maintains, or endeavours or purports to organise or maintain an armed force.  I want him to give us proof that it promotes or encourages the unlawful possession of firearms by its members.  I want him to give us proof that it engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates any act, enterprise or course of action of a treasonable or seditious character, or promotes, encourages or advocates the attainment of any object of a treasonable or seditious character.  I want the Minister to give us proof that this association promotes, encourages or advocates the commission of offences or the obstruction or <Col N="2087" /> interference with the administration of justice or with the enforcement of the law.  I want him to give us proof that this association promotes, encourages or advocates the non-payment of moneys payable to the Central Fund or any other public fund, whether by way of taxation or otherwise, or the non-payment of local taxation.  I challenge the Minister to prove that the Young Ireland Association can be indicted on a single one of these counts.  I assert that if he fails to prove that he will show himself guilty of misusing the authority conferred upon him for the purpose of striking, not at an association which was a danger to the State, but of striking at what his Government considered to be a formidable political force opposed to their own organisation.  I have challenged the Minister to do that.  I may be able to assist him in making his case, if there is a case.</P>
    <P>On 30th November, the Government set out, presumably, to discover the grounds upon which they were to proclaim this organisation.  They made numerous raids and &ldquo;Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.&rdquo;  On the evening when these spectacular events took place, this search for treasonable evidence against the Young Ireland Association, there was a discussion on the adjournment in the other House.  I presume that the Minister on that occasion stated as fully as he could the case he had to make against the Young Ireland Association.  He made a great parade of documents.  His words, in introducing some of these documents, seemed very ominous&mdash;as if he had something that would damn the association for all time.  When one reads over this statement of the Minister for Justice, when one weighs up all that he said on that occasion&mdash;I think I am entitled to presume that he presented the most effective case he could; if not, he did not treat the House to which he was speaking with the full confidence which the occasion merited&mdash;there is not one iota of evidence that could be construed as a semblance of conspiracy to effect any <Col N="2088" /> of the objects set out in Section 19 of the Constitution (Amendment) Act. The Minister had one great find, apparently.  I pass no comment upon the manner in which this search for evidence was conducted.  I should like, however, to refer to its results. The Minister said on that occasion: &ldquo;Arms were got and ammunition was got.&rdquo;  He did not tell the House&mdash;I do not think there has been any disclosure from Government quarters yet &mdash;the extent of the supply of arms and ammunition got in these raids.  I am informed&mdash;I should like to know if my information is correct&mdash;that the arms that were secured in that series of raids consisted of one old revolver in an isolated village in the Midlands. I am informed that the ammunition that was got consisted of two boxes of sporting ammunition in Commandant Cronin's office which Commandant Cronin denies having any knowledge of and alleges was planted in his office.  I should like to know if that is a correct estimate of the amount of arms and ammunition captured in these heroic raids.  At all events, a serious step has been taken by the Government&mdash;the proclamation of an unarmed, non-military body.  If what I am asserting to-night cannot be rebutted, then the Government stand convicted of acting in an arbitrary manner and of prostituting the powers they possess for Party political purposes. That is a serious charge to make and it is only the gravity of the possible consequences of this action by the Government that impels me to make it.  They will have to justify their action by facts, not by mere assertions.  There is no security of constitutional right for any citizen of the State if constitutional rights and liberties are to be the plaything of any Minister.</P>
    <P>This Act to which I have referred was introduced for very serious reasons at a very serious time in the history of this country.  Public memory seems to be rather limited in its duration, and it may not recall the circumstances of the time; it may have forgotten that when that Bill was introduced there was an atmosphere, an environment, of outrage, assassination and violence <Col N="2089" /> which was taking a stranglehold upon this country, and which threatened to smash not only the morale but everything that was worth while in this State.  Some months ago a discussion was initiated here on a motion by Senator Sir John Keane.  At that time I recalled a statement made by the President of the Executive Council in 1931 when introducing this measure. Because of the length of the speech I did not inflict it upon the House; I merely made certain brief references to it.  I should like, however, to make more lengthened references to that statement to-night in order that we can get a clearer, a more graphic picture of what were the circumstances and conditions that necessitated the introduction of that measure and contrast them with the conditions of to-day which are alleged to have necessitated the action of the Government on last Friday.  It might be well if Senators would consider how far the conditions on both occasions compare.</P>
    <P>The then President of the Executive Council, Mr. Cosgrave, made an important statement on 14th October, 1931.  I will read certain extracts from that statement, extracts which give an idea of the general tenor of his remarks:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the Bill becomes law no hardship or disability of any kind will be imposed on any law-abiding individual or section of the community whatever his or their political opinions may be.  Nothing in the Bill forbids the advocacy of any political ideas.  We only ask that the advocate shall not speak with a gun in his hand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on he made this statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since the commencement of the present year&mdash;that is, during a period of less than ten months&mdash;numerous dumps of arms and ammunition have been discovered by the police; several murders and attempted murders have been effected; drilling has become common all over the country and numerous miscellaneous crimes perpetrated.  Let me give a summary of the crimes during that period.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the 30th January, Patrick <Col N="2090" /> Carroll was murdered by armed men at Captain's Lane, Crumlin.  He was a member of the I.R.A., but was discovered by that organisation to have been giving information to the police.  Deputies will remember that an attempt was made to attribute this murder to the police, who were in fact attacked during his funeral. On 21st March, Superintendent Curtin was murdered by armed men at Tipperary as he was returning home from duty at night.  He had conducted a local prosecution for illegal drilling shortly before.  On 20th July, John Ryan of Tipperary was taken by armed men at night from the house where he was employed, and murdered on the roadside and the body left there.  He had made statements to the police in connection with the same drilling charge as led to the murder of Superintendent Curtin.  John Ryan was murdered because he refused to commit perjury.  For these crimes it has been impossible to make any person amenable.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On 23rd April, at night, two young men crossing the Dublin mountains were fired upon by an armed drilling party and one of them was severely wounded.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On 1st August shots were fired into a dance hall at Drumreilly, County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On 12th September Mr. William McInerney, of Kilrush, was fired at when entering his own house and seriously wounded.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On 15th September shots were fired into the house of the State Solicitor for County Clare.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On 18th July warders from Mountjoy Prison were attacked, whilst off duty, by armed men and one of them was handcuffed to an iron rail and chained by the neck and legs.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On 11th October, an attempt was made by armed men to release the brothers Gilmore from Mountjoy Prison.  Five or six armed men entered a house adjoining the prison and held up the occupants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are two columns of these events and outrages.  I do not want to <Col N="2091" /> weary the House unduly, but these were the circumstances that necessitated the passing of that Act.  It was the necessity of facing up to, grappling with and smashing an organisation out to intimidate citizens, not merely by violence but by murder and assassination; it was to grip, to strangle and end for ever such a conspiracy that the Act was put on the statute book.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister going to tell us, will anyone who speaks for the Government tell us to-night that the circumstances surrounding the Young Ireland Association have any parallel with the circumstances existing in 1931 which necessitated the introduction of that measure?  Will anyone here have the temerity to try to make that comparison or parallel?  I am fully aware that we are not free yet from violence, from acts of intimidation and outrage.  But there is this peculiarity.  These incidents&mdash;these events; they are something more than incidents&mdash;have been very numerous indeed, but there is this singular aspect of these events, that in so far as the members of the Young Ireland Association have been identified with them, they have been the victims, not the perpetrators, of these outrages and acts of violence.  I have here a list, only a partial list, of acts of violence, many of which have been attacks upon the members of the Young Ireland Association.  I am quite prepared to go through this list if that is deemed desirable.</P>
    <P>In last night's <i>Evening Mail</i> there is a record of</P>
    <P>&ldquo;an extraordinary tale of a holdup on a lonely country road in County Waterford told to-day to the Civic Guards at Kill, a village situated between Tramore and Bonmahon. After midnight a man named Bolton, a native of the Kill district, entered the Civic Guard Barracks in apparently a very excited and agitated condition and lodged a complaint of having been held up by armed and masked men.  Bolton stated when he was returning home from Kill, sometime after 11 o'clock, he was challenged by four men who wore black masks across their <Col N="2092" /> mouths and noses.  They were apparently, according to the man's story, lying in ambush....  Bolton stated that they questioned him at length regarding his movements and were particularly anxious to know if he was a member of the Young Ireland Association known as &lsquo;Blueshirts.&rsquo; Bolton stated he vigorously denied he was a member of any association....  Apparently they would not believe his statement and, failing to get an affirmative answer as to his alleged connection with the &lsquo;Blueshirts,&rsquo; they turned upon him and beat him severely about the body with clenched fists.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is last night.  Possibly they were trying to implement the Minister's proclamation against the Young Ireland Association or, perhaps, it is only what Judge Meredith would call one of the instances in the economic war that another country has forced on us.  We have in to-day's papers the decision of the Military Tribunal regarding one of the men who was the driver of a motor car which was engaged by men for the purpose of inflicting an outrage upon one Daniel Welsh, who was beaten, taken away in a motor car and tarred.  This man has got nine months suspensory sentence.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the 7th October, 1933, several young men going to a Fine Gael dance in the Mansion House were attacked.  Henry Doyle and John C. Mulvey alighted from a Rathfarnham tram at Hume Street and were set upon by a number of men carrying sticks from which nails protruded. Both sustained head wounds and were treated in Mercer's Hospital.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the 17th October a barn belonging to Mr. Henry Goonan, secretary of the Fine Gael branch, Ballingar, Woodford, County Galway, was attacked by armed men and shots fired through the windows and doors, wounding five of the dance party.  Two men were seriously injured.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On October 30th, at Bandon, Denis O'Leary, member of the Fine <Col N="2093" /> Gael, was taken from his home at night by armed and masked men, beaten, escaped and fired after.  His father was struck and felled by a blow on the head from a cudgel by one of the raiders.  Hugh O'Reilly, of Innishannon, near Bandon, was also taken from his home on the same night by armed and masked men and beaten severely.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the 30th October, there was a raid on the house of a Fine Gael supporter (John Hanlon in Kilrooskey, Roscommon) by 16 armed and masked men.  Three of the party were taken out, Herbert Tracey, John T. Tracey and &mdash;&mdash; Casey.  A scuffle took place and John Hanlon received a bullet in the lung.  William Tracey was badly injured about head and body.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On November 22nd, Henry Mongan, aged 70, vice-chairman of a branch of Fine Gael who presided at a meeting addressed by Messrs. P. Hogan and John Brodrick was set upon and assaulted by a number of men, ten or 12 (some of whom it is alleged fired in the air) when returning home about 9.30 with his brother Thomas, aged 63.  Mongan got a black eye and an injury to his ear.  When the Mongans arrived home they found that their home, in which their sister was alone, had been attacked and the windows broken with stones.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, sir, I could go on reading for the next hour incidents or events or outrages of that kind.  I do not propose to stand too long between the Minister and his opportunity of explaining or justifying the action of the Government.  I want to draw the attention of the House to this and I want to repeat that in every event of disturbance with which the members of the Young Ireland Association have been connected, they have figured either as victims of the disturbance of the peace, or as those who wish to preserve law and order, and prevent a disturbance of the peace.  I have here a most illuminating extract from a speech by the present Minister for Justice.  It was uttered on the 14th October, 1931, when he was denouncing this Act which he now undertakes to support:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2094" />&ldquo;You might at least make some attempt when you are bringing in a measure of this sort to give some concrete example rather than the vague, indefinite vapourings about the conditions of the country. One would imagine that the Minister for Justice at any rate would try to keep to some definite statement&mdash; some definite facts&mdash;and that he would have something to put before the House in the way of definite evidence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am challenging the Minister to-night to produce something in the way of evidence to justify the action taken on last Friday.  I am asking him to produce something in the way of evidence much more convincing than the statement which he made on the evening of November 30th.  If the Dáil, instead of being a House of the Oireachtas, had been a court of law and if the Minister was indicting his opponents acting as counsel for the prosecution&mdash;if he were indicting his opponents before a jury and presented the statement that he made on November 30th, as a statement to convict the prisoners, I venture to say that, just as in the case of the Official Secrets Act, the jury would have returned a verdict of &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; without leaving the box.</P>
    <P>The Minister must not imagine either that he is dealing with children or that we have any belief whatever in the infallibility of the members of the Executive Council and especially the present Executive Council.  They will have to take responsibility for their actions and they will have to prove before this State that these actions which they have taken and which have affected secretly the constitutional rights of the citizens, are taken in the interests of the State and not in the interests of Party manoeuvres.  What is this body that has been banned?  It is the Young Ireland Association, an association which I say again, and say with all the emphasis that I can command, is a non-military, un-armed association.  It stands for the preservation of the State and for safeguarding the institutions of the State.  It stands for the observance <Col N="2095" /> of the law and respect for the institutions of the State, for securing freedom of speech and the preservation of public order.  It stands to give the rising youth of Ireland a clean, manly, healthy environment in which to exist and it stands, not least, for the end for ever of the rule of the gun bully in this country.  That is what Young Ireland stands for.  Speaking broadly, these are the objects of the association which was proclaimed last Friday night by the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>I ask what conclusion are we to draw from the action of the Government in proclaiming such an organisation?  If the preservation of the State, the maintenance of freedom of speech, the preservation of order and securing respect for the institutions of the State, and assisting in putting an end to the rule of the gun bully be crimes in the eyes of the Government, then we can only conclude that the Government do not wish the rule of the gun bully to end, that the Government do not wish to have freedom in this State for any except their own spokesmen and supporters, that the Government do not wish to have the preservation of order in the real democratic sense, and that they do not want this State to be preserved and maintained.  If that is the conclusion that we are to draw, then all that one can say is that it is not the Young Ireland Association that has been engaged in a conspiracy against the State or that is engaged in a conspiracy against the State, but that it is the Executive Government itself which is engaged in a conspiracy against the State.  If that is so, then I say that this proclamation of last Friday night is a challenge not to Young Ireland alone but to the whole civic sense of this State, to every decent man and woman who stand for honour and for constitutional liberty in this State.  It is a challenge to these things, and it is a challenge which the Minister and his Government and his colleagues will find answered fully and well when they take that issue to the people.  As I expect I shall have to make some further observations at the conclusion of the debate and as I wish to give the Minister an opportunity <Col N="2096" /> of vindicating his proclamation, I do not propose to say anything more at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief in the remarks which I wish to make. I consider that Senator Milroy was quite justified in moving the adjournment to discuss this matter which, to my mind, raises for the citizens of this country one of the most serious issues which we have had before us for many years.  Senator Dowdall stated here quite recently that the passing of the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act by this House was one of the worst things that this House ever did.  I was somewhat inclined to agree with him, but I think that before very long I shall be in complete agreement with him.  But that, sir, is not the issue which we have now to decide. I am not at present a member of either the Fine Gael Party or of the Young Ireland Party.  The way that I view this proclamation, and the reason why I regard it as of such seriousness, is that I can only see two possible explanations for it, and either of these explanations, to my mind, is about the worst thing that ever happened this country.  One explanation is that the late President, that General O'Duffy, Mr. Dillon, Mr. MacDermot and their colleagues have completely given up their belief in constitutional action and have accepted responsibility for an organisation which is endeavouring to arm itself against the State.  That, to my mind, would be one of the worst possible things that could happen to this country.  We would have no constitutional opposition.  If that is true, then the Government are perfectly justified in this proclamation. If it is not true, and that the leaders and their executive have accepted responsibility for this Young Ireland movement, then this Government have abused the powers handed to them in the worst possible manner for which no language would be strong enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why I have spoken at this stage is that I want the Minister to tell us, does he agree that there is no choice between these two points of <Col N="2097" /> view?  I cannot see any between them. It may be, for all I know, that some individuals who are members of this Party have been found with arms. I think it is quite possible that some members of the Fianna Fáil Party may be found with arms.  The group that I belong to is a very small one, but I do not think you would find any of them with arms.  But, for all I know, you might.  That, however, would not prove for one moment that they were an unlawful organisation. It would be a first-class reason for taking action against individuals, but it would be no reason for proclaiming the Party.  The organisation which has been proclaimed is an organisation for which responsibility is accepted by the leaders of the constitutional Opposition, or of the opposition which seeks to be constitutional in the State, and when it is part and parcel of their scheme and of their plan for organising the country against the existing Executive, then I say that no possible grounds can exist, if you believe in democracy at all, for the suppression even under this Act of that body, but one ground only: that is, that there is conclusive proof that it is a body which is organised in violence and arms against the State itself.  On no other grounds that I know of can such a body be properly suppressed.  Even if it be true&mdash;I have no knowledge of it&mdash;that certain individuals have foolishly bought or been found with or have taken arms, unless their leaders are supporting them and backing them in that, which I personally refuse to believe, then there is no case for this proclamation.  If we are ever going to get real constitutional government in this country, both the leaders and whatever Party be in power will have to respect the absolute right of their opponents to organise and take political action against them.</P>
    <P>Any Party which, in organising itself as a political force, that is foolish enough or, shall I say, wicked enough to encourage its members to carry arms or to procure arms is doing definite harm to the future of the State.  Equally bad with that <Col N="2098" /> would be an attempt to suppress an ordinary political organisation.  I will not say that one is as bad as the other, but both are certainly detrimental to the future of the State. The reason I feel so strongly about this proclamation, far more strongly than about the previous one, is that whatever views people might have about the position, and I have none, that when the responsible constitutional leaders made this effort for a United Irish Party, and to bring the Young Ireland Party into the United Irish Party, they meant one or other of two things.  They meant that it was either strictly constitutional, carrying on its work in a political way or else that it was to overthrow the State they stood by in the past. Have the Government, in these circumstances, proof that General O'Duffy, Mr. Cosgrave, Mr. MacDermot, Mr. Dillon and other people of that character are people against whom action should be taken?  I go further and say that if the Government have proof that these men have been working a revolution against the State they would not require this Constitution (Amendment) Act.  They could bring them before the ordinary courts in Dublin, and if they are able to convince a jury that they have such objects that jury would find them guilty.  If I were on such a jury I would not hesitate to do so. And that is the attitude of the people supporting them to-day.  They support them because they believe they are acting in a constitutional manner. The Government have no need of the Constitution (Amendment) Act, if they can prove that these people have taken armed action against the State, or that they are supporting, or aiding, any men or any body of men to take up arms against the State.</P>
    <P>The seriousness of this Proclamation is that the Government have placed us in a dilemma.  We have either to believe that the late Government and the leaders of this Association are guilty of this lawless action or we have to believe that the Government are using their powers in a most outrageous manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words upon this question.  I remember very well what brought about the institution of the organisation which is now suppressed.  It was, I think, precipitated by a meeting in Cork, at which the ex-President of the Free State, and the senior member for Cork, was refused a hearing.  On a subsequent occasion he came to Cork and was refused a hearing, also by the action really of a handful of people.  I do not complain of the protection he got from the Civic Guards.  He got every protection possible, I believe, but a very small number of people who had been lashed into a state of fury by having been persuaded by some other people that the ex-President of the Free State, and those associated with him, in the City of Cork, were more interested in England than they were in their own country, assailed us with the cries that we were traitors and spies.  I think the Minister will have to realise that the only course open to us was to come together and to see what was to be done about it. We represent the majority of the City of Cork and, in fact, the majority of the County of Cork, but because a number of imported youths were let loose in our city freedom of speech had ceased.  Now where you have no freedom of speech you have no liberty. Some of us quite determined, at considerable cost perhaps, that we will have liberty.  There is nobody in Ireland who is more anti-militarist than I am.  My detestation of soldiering goes so far that I hate boy scouts and girl guides.  But, in present circumstances, I would ask the Minister, seriously, what a political organisation such as the one I belong to is going to do.  We are a peace loving people.  We want to have our views put before the public, and we want to have our views heard by the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is an extraordinary thing that a number of men who declare that they are unarmed, and who I think have been proved, in the majority of cases, where searches have taken place, to be unarmed, and where every Guard and soldier in the country can recognise them by what they wear, are <Col N="2100" /> the people who are to be hunted and driven from political platforms.  I think that is wrong, and I believe the Minister will find it extremely difficult to defend such a position.  He is unable to deny, he cannot deny, that until this organisation came into being we were unable to have free speech in the country.  It was only after great trouble and great care exercised on their part that this political organisation was able to establish political free speech which, but for them, would have disappeared in Ireland.  Is that a situation which any one of us wants to see continued?  I do not believe that any member of the Fianna Fáil Party who has any respect or regard for the reputation or position of his country would agree that such a thing should happen.  I ask the Minister a simple question.  If these Blue Shirts&mdash;who cannot be called conspirators, because the trouble with conspiracy is that it is hidden and secret, whereas everyone can tell whether a man is a member of this organisation or not&mdash;are disbanded, what guarantee will be given by the Government that public meetings can be held in any part of the Free State and that those who attend them will not be in danger of losing their lives?</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>This action of the Government does not surprise me in the least because it is evident that it is the outcome of their ruinous commercial experiments.  As the country is impoverished, the question of £6,000 a week spent upon the factoryless and unemployed Dublin poor increases beyond £300,000 a year, it is evident that a certain amount of misery must be borne by the citizens.  While the sea-green incorruptible President is looking for tyrannies in England and is afraid&mdash;as if any Irishman ever was afraid of controversy with Mr. Thomas and Lord Hailsham&mdash;while he is looking for tyrannies at the ends of the earth and while Senator Connolly is telling us that the Seanad does not represent the wishes of the Irish people although he is still a Senator&mdash;including that amongst his multiple ministerial occupations&mdash;he has some doubts whether a peaceful organisation, or at any rate an organisation which is not <Col N="2101" /> proved to be a military conspiracy, should be allowed freedom to assemble and freedom further to develop.  It seems to me that there is something wrong in the State when we have to seek for tyranny without being able to understand the ordinary amenities of life among our own citizens.  The temper of some of the Ministers in these matters is illustrated by the conduct of Senator Connolly.  Some time ago he warned the Seanad that if they voted against his proposal something worse might happen to them and to me in particular.  And when I asked him did he mean murder he said to me: &ldquo;Interpret it as you like.&rdquo;  It is high time that the country should begin to prick up its ears and listen to what is coming because I think this is only a taste of the tyranny to which the Government's commercial policy is driving us.  You cannot deprive a country of £17,000,000 of its income without providing some alternative. We know that the alternatives provided are about as hollow as the guns and documents that were found in the Blue Shirts' premises, about as hollow as the promises that were made to this benighted country.  If this were a bar of justice, and if it were possible to arraign public men for false pretences, there is no sentence, I think, in terms of years, that would be equivalent to the wholesale confidence trick that was played on this unfortunate country.  Now we have half of the country potentially prison-worthy, if we raise our voices or try to organise an alternative to gun-bullying in the absence of free speech.  It is perfectly impossible, when the country is informed by the usual channels of the further ruin that must emerge from the Government's policy, to keep the country quiet without insurrection, even if it be only the insurrection of an organised and quite worthy opposition without turning the whole machinery of government into the mockery of liberty that is in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It comes about now that Ireland, with all its mouthings and its self-pityings of tyranny, with its President abhorring the faintest tinge of coercion, and with his mandate from the people of which we have heard so <Col N="2102" /> much&mdash;that is, the people and Tom Johnson&mdash;their mandate means now that the Government, without putting it to any public issue, can turn the machinery for obstructing conspiracy and for crushing insurrection into crushing an absolutely innocent movement; at any rate, it should have the benefit of innocence until it is proven to be an armed conspiracy.  That is what we have got, during a period of over a year and a half, from a commercial policy which is equivalent to all the enterprises which the author of the commercial policy has achieved himself. Senator Connolly, as we all know&mdash;it has appeared in print and has not been contradicted&mdash;is the commercial adviser of the President.  He has been endeavouring to turn Ireland into a Garden of Edenderry with the President as the upright snake warning us what will happen if we eat the forbidden fruit.</P>

      <P>It arises out of the condition that the Government's policy has brought about.  I merely say that this is not the end; it is only the beginning.  We were told that there would be no surrender.  I was quite prepared to hear that there would be no surrender, and I also knew that there would be no success for his commercial policy, but until they climb down from this condition of the enforced penury of this country, we cannot expect them to understand that we only ask for freedom to live in a little prosperity in our own land.</P>

      <P>I wish to join my voice in support of this motion.  I am one of those intimately associated with the Young Ireland movement, especially with the women's section, and I am proud to say it.  No crime of murder, robbery, violence or intimidation has been committed by the Blue Shirts.  Everybody knows that, and neither the Minister nor anybody else can prove the slightest tinge of these crimes against them.  Everybody knows the reason for this proclamation. Senator Gogarty has hit the nail on the head in one direction.  It is one of <Col N="2103" /> the &ldquo;stunts&rdquo; of the Government to try to cover up the ghastly and colossal failure of their economic policy.  It is one of the &ldquo;stunts&rdquo; organised for the purpose of taking the people's minds off the realities of the situation, and that is the reason for their anxiety to penalise their political opponents. The Blue Shirt movement was gaining rapidly in the country.  Every young man of honour and decency was rallying to its standard.  Of course, the Government were frightened of it and of course they want, with the flimsiest of excuses, to put it down.</P>
      <P>Senator Milroy has gone into all the details and I shall only mention one instance.  As he said, we could stand here all night giving instances of the Blue Shirts being subject to violence, and of the marvellous control and self-discipline by which they have gained the admiration of every liberty-loving person in the country.  The one instance I bring up is what happened in my own county town.  A man who had offended nobody, who had broken no law, was going home on a Sunday night in a perfectly peaceable manner. He was attacked from behind a wall. Six shots were fired at him.  Four shots hit him and it was only his colossal strength that saved his life.  There is no doubt in the world that these people were potential assassins.  A group of men, armed, avowedly Communistic, I.R.A., living in community, living together, were known to be personal enemies of this man.  No action has been taken against them.  There is one instance of the impartiality of the Government.  That man has been maimed for life.  Only his colossal strength saved his life and enabled him to struggle home when four bullets were fired into him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Side by side with the suppression of this perfectly legal body we have the organisation of a volunteer force of 15,000 men.  We see that certain men have been chosen to be the organisers of this force.  I do not know the records of all these men but I do know the record of one.  I know the number of cold-blooded murders committed, the number of banks he robbed, the <Col N="2104" /> houses of decent citizens he burned or which the gang he led burned.  I know the amount of public damage he did, amounting to thousands of pounds. This is one of the men who has been chosen to organise what is to be a political army, paid by the State.  There is scarcely any doubt that the aim behind that movement is to set up a dictatorship in this country when the people will have come to the conclusion that this Government ought to be put out of power.  So much has been said that I do not wish to say any more. I believe that the honourable and decent people of the country know perfectly well what is behind the suppression of the Blue Shirts, and they will judge the Government when their time comes.  Senator Milroy read out one of the clauses in the Public Safety Act.  It deals with the intimidation of people in order to prevent them from paying their public debts, land annuities, rates, etc.  The present Minister for Justice, who sits here, was notorious at one time in his campaign to prevent people from paying these debts.</P>

When I read the proclamation I thought it was shocking.  I decided that the Government had come to the conclusion that a shock a day will keep the critics away.  If anybody disagrees with me I ask them to read the <i>Irish Press</i> posters.  Every morning I find there is a shock.  If it is not one thing it is another.  In proclaiming the Young Ireland Association the Government is &ldquo;seeing blue.&rdquo; They proclaimed the Blue Shirts, but they might as well have proclaimed the blue ash bowls that are in Leinster House.  There is nothing to prevent me or anybody else coming in with a hair shirt or a hair &ldquo;dickie&rdquo; which would cost less.  There is nothing to prevent me coming in with one side of my shirt <Col N="2105" /> blue and the other side white.  That would be only a half shirt.  The Government should get down to fundamentals. On behalf of the Opposition what I claim from the Government is what we conceded when they were in opposition&mdash;security.  The real thing to get down to is that there must be freedom of speech.  It does not matter what party a man belongs to if he can go out in public and express his feelings.  If the people do not want to listen let them not come to the meetings.  Within the last two days the newspapers stated that the supply of electric light was cut off in Donegal, because meetings of the United Ireland Party were being held there.  Years ago when certain employees of the Corporation threatened to strike and to cut off the water supply to the city, I said at a Corporation meeting: &ldquo;That is an act of war.  Stop the meeting, Lord Mayor, and I will turn on the water.&rdquo;  Cutting off the electric light supply to a town is an act of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unnecessary to talk about the present time at all.  The Government has really to get down to this, that there must be freedom of speech.  I was on the Cumann na nGaedheal side during the General Election in Galway and other people were on the Fianna Fáil side.  Two big meetings were held. President de Valera was to have been present at one meeting but could not attend.  As well as I remember he sent his son and the Minister for Defence to represent him.  That was all right. Certain people on our side were going to go to that meeting as they wanted to hear what was said.  I warned them that, while they could go if they wished, they were not to interrupt. The meeting was quite orderly.  Some of our supporters were there, but they said nothing.  A week afterwards, Mr. Cosgrave, the ex-President, held a meeting in the same place, and a mob attempted to break it up.  The Guards prevented them.  An attempt was made to cut off the electric light by throwing 50 feet of a wire clothes-line over the two wires which conveyed electric current to the section of the town in which the meeting was to be held.  Those who did that knew all about the section to cut off.  They did <Col N="2106" /> not succeed.  The clothes-line only went over one wire instead of over the two wires.  The line reached down to near the ground, and during the night a cow was nosing about and was killed on coming into contact with it.  The owner of the animal, Mr. O'Gorman, a printer, sent a man down to the field in the morning to see what happened to the cow.  When the man touched the wire he was killed.  The field was close to a grave-yard.  The man who was killed was in the grave-yard the following day.  Nobody was ever brought to justice for that.  Twice during the last week wires have been cut in Donegal and, as far as I know, nobody has been brought to justice. That is what the Government should get at instead of getting after the Blue Shirts.</P>
    <P>The proclamation is one against a political party, simply because they are in opposition.  I stated several times that there is room in this country for the Government and for the Opposition. That ought to be understood. There should not be, however, any room for people who break the law, who cut wires in Donegal or Galway, and who sent people into eternity without having an opportunity even of having a priest.  These are the people the Government should get after, and not after people who claim the right of free speech and who are prepared to give their lives in defence of free speech.  After all, there is very little difference between Fianna Fáil and Cumann na nGaedheal.  Cumann na nGaedheal accepted the Treaty in 1922 and Fianna Fáil accepted it in 1926. Leaving these things aside, we have to &ldquo;carry on,&rdquo; and if wires are cut, water supplies interfered with, or if there are similar acts of war, those who commit them are the people to get at, and not people who are prepared to stand by the Guards in carrying out the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion and to associate myself with the censure which is attached to it. censure of the action of the Government in misusing the Constitution (Amendment) Act by the proclamation of what is known as the Young Ireland Association, but much better known as <Col N="2107" /> the Blue Shirts.  I am not a member of that body, or of any similar body.  I think that is perfectly well known in this House.  I speak entirely from what I consider to be a neutral position, as a responsible citizen.  As a responsible citizen I cannot help feeling disgusted with what I look upon as governmental farce, because, to my mind, to proclaim a body like the Blue Shirts, and not a body like the I.R.A., is farcical.  Where there are two bodies in a constitutional country, no neutral person who has any knowledge of what goes on can have any illusions on the subject of their relative dangers.  Whatever danger the Blue Shirts may be to this State, the I.R.A. to a constitutional State are a very much greater danger.  That being so, to proclaim the Blue Shirts and not to proclaim the I.R.A. is, in my opinion, an action which is open to the accusation that it is pretence, that it is humbug and that it is very undignified on the part of the Government.  The Government have laid themselves open to the accusation of partiality, if not of tyranny, and as they are the Government of my country, I very much resent that.  I think it quite right to adjourn the House for the purpose of discussing this question, and I associate myself fully with the censure of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Senators have referred to the statement that was made when this Act was first brought into operation. I recollect quite well a statement that was made by Deputy Professor O'Sullivan at that time, that law-abiding citizens need have nothing to fear from it.  From the way it has been operated since we were compelled to bring it into operation, I do not think any citizen who obeys the law need have any fears that he will be interfered with.  Some play or criticism was attempted to be made with regard to our attitude to this Act originally.  One of the first things we did as a Government after coming into office was to suspend the operation of that Act.  No people were more reluctant than we were to bring <Col N="2108" /> it into operation again, but it is very easy for people to understand that if there is a conviction that we are not going to take certain measures, people of certain dispositions may very easily force the Government, no matter how reluctant they may be to do them, to do certain things.  We saw a position developing in this country, a position which no political Party would have any need for and a position in which a body, admitted by themselves to be a semi-military body, and described by themselves on their circulars as a semi-military body, but which we believe, and have reason to believe, is a body in possession of arms, being set up.  If we are to judge by the statements which I quoted here before and the statements that have been quoted here since in another place and the statements that have been made in <i>United Ireland</i> which, I believe, is the official organ of the former National Guard and, afterwards, the Young Ireland Association, we know what their tendencies along constitutional lines are.  We know what respect they are going to have for free speech. They are not going to allow any discordant propaganda, they say.  I remember one particular quotation in it:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Freedom of speech and freedom of the Press are not good or bad in themselves.  Everything depends on the use made of them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I referred here before to how they are going to set up a &ldquo;diast&rdquo; in this country. I referred here before to the respect they had for the Constitution for which so many lives were lost in this country.  After the Civil War and all the rest of it, the respect they had for that Constitution was that the people who drafted it should be thrown into boiling oil.  That is the view of those people.  That is their view as expressed in their organ known as the <i>United Irishman.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave numerous quotations before and I could give numbers of them now.  I will give anybody who wishes the references to the various dates in that paper from which these quotations can be taken&mdash;the issues of <Col N="2109" /> 1/4/'33, 15/4/'33, 15/7/'33, and again, the issue of 15/7/'33, all trying to lead the people along a certain line to a dictatorship in this country. Elected Governments, as we know them in this country, they say, are of no use; they are past their time.  Why did they not discover that eleven years ago?  There was no word about it while certain people were in office in this country, but when two elections went by and as I quoted the other night, and as I will quote again to-night from another letter, they felt that their Party was finished&mdash;as one of their own people expressed it in a letter at the time to people outside this country, &ldquo;the Cosgrave Party is finished&rdquo;&mdash;we see them turning very enthusiastically in favour of a new method of constitutional dictatorship in this country.  If that was going to be brought about by constitutional methods, nobody could see anything to quarrel with in it.  If we saw that being brought about by people who said &ldquo;We are going to put our policy in regard to that particular thing clearly before the electors and we are going to get their views clearly upon it&rdquo; no Government could have any quarrel with that.</P>
    <P>If they go before the people at a free election and put a clearly defined policy before them by which they would say: &ldquo;if you elect us, then it is probably the last Government you will ever elect in this country, because you are going to elect us to be dictators to frame a constitution which will deny you the right of votes in future&rdquo;; and if the people were prepared to accept that, I see nothing wrong in it.  It is a constitutional way of putting it, but we see forming up here, side by side with that, a body of ex-officers and others in this country assuming or, at least, having the veneer of acting in a philanthropic way and for philanthropic objects and developing along certain lines, and we hear Deputy Doctor O'Higgins, who was then the leader of the A.C.A., declaring that a position may be reached where circumstances will control policy.  I have mentioned that fact in the other House and I have tried to get some idea from him as to <Col N="2110" /> what are the circumstances which will control policy.  He is talking to a body of men who, as I have said, are composed mainly of ex-Army officers.  They come along at a later period, and we have the National Guard formed with a great flourish&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">

      <P>Was that statement made prior to the formation of the National Guard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the formation of the National Guard.  We have the National Guard formed and we see therefore, that the lines on which this body is to be conducted are to be purely and simply a copy of military lines.  You have General O'Duffy at the top as director-general.  He has the appointment of officers throughout the country, and you have that all down the line.  You have the company O.C., the quartermasters, and so on. The method is purely and simply the method of selection as obtains in the Army, and not as we do in a democratic country by election in the ordinary way. It may be to some people a very clear indication of what the people would get if they put a party like that or a person like that in control of the reins of government.  He was to be the judge, and not the people, as to who were best fitted to look after the destinies of this country.</P>
      <P>They are not satisfied to come along in the ordinary way if they are a constitutional body.  They are not satisfied until they get a uniform.  I know it has been said, and a great point has been made about it time after time in the other House, that this is not a uniform, that it is a blue shirt.  I have documents to show that they have described it as a uniform themselves.  Even the other day they sent out instructions in Cork that the description of treasurer must cease in future and that the treasurer of a company must be referred to as quartermaster.  People are talking about this being a political body.  I want to know where in this country or any other country there has been a political body where the treasurer is described as quartermaster?</P>

      <P>So far as this point of legality is concerned, the expression is not illegal, but it is a military expression.  That is the point I make. While I am on the question of uniform it is just as well to have this matter clearly out, when we hear so much talk about what we are doing, prostituting government, and all that kind of thing.  What would the previous Government have done in such circumstances? What would the previous Government have done if people paraded in uniform?  I heard Senator Bagwell objecting on this question. Does he know that General O'Duffy in 1928&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, the Minister is not fair in taking me up like that.  I was very careful to say that why I objected, and the reason I associated myself with the motion of censure, was because the Government suppressed one body and did not suppress another body against whom all the arguments, and even more arguments, could be used with much greater force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that later on.  Senator Bagwell, or certainly some other Senators in this House, would have much interest in or would know something about an organisation in this country known as the British Legion.  I am sure it would surprise some of those people to know that in 1928 General O'Duffy advised the Government of that time not to allow people to parade calling themselves majors or calling themselves by other military terms.  That was when the British Fascisti paraded in uniform. I propose to read the memorandum. It starts with a letter from the Crimes Branch to the Commissioner on the 7th November, 1928, from Colonel Neligan, who was then Chief Superintendent. Attached to the letter from Colonel Neligan is a cutting in which several paragraphs are underlined. He underlines terms such as &ldquo;Major&rdquo; and so on.  Also attached is a cutting showing a small group of British Fascisti marching in uniform through the city.  Colonel Neligan in his letter states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2112" />&ldquo;The Commissioner,</P>
    <P>To see attached cuttings, please. Please note marked portions.</P>
    <P>This &lsquo;commemoration&rsquo; is becoming the excuse for a regular military field-day for these persons.  I direct your attention to the formation of companies under persons calling themselves captains and majors, and the companies are going to march in military formation.  I think attached programme gives these men far too much scope, and certainly if the irregulars adopted these tactics they would be arrested under the Treasonable Offences Act, 1925.  The position this year is far worse than any other year because they are being allowed far more latitude than formerly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>General O'Duffy writes to the Department of Justice on the following day, the 8th November, 1928, and states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I agree with Colonel Neligan. The attached military order is similar to what would issue from a recognised Army Headquarters, and such military activities as detailed should, in my opinion, be confined to the Forces of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what we are trying to do.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is intended much more as a military display than a bona fide commemoration service for the dead, to which latter there can be no objection, though there appears no necessity to perpetuate this form of ceremony in the Saorstát.  If we allow this military display in Dublin we cannot very well object to similar displays elsewhere on the occasion.  I am aware that in certain quarters these activities are looked upon as provocative, particularly in view of the fact that similar activities are prohibited, and punished by imprisonment if indulged in by other organisations.  Were I in a position to do so I would very definitely prohibit all military activities, other than by the recognised Forces of the State.  No section would then have a grievance, and the work of the Police would be made easier.  There can be no doubt <Col N="2113" /> that companies of Baden Powell Boy Scouts marching through the streets in uniform lead to increased activity on the part of the Fianna Eireann, and similarly these 11th November displays lead to drilling and other activities of a military nature on the part of the Irregulars.  I suggest that the Secretary of the British Legion here be very definitely informed that the parade is to take the form of a procession and that no recognised military words of command will be allowed.  I attach a cutting from the <i>Independent</i> of 5th instant, showing British Fascisti marching in uniform.  I consider this should not be allowed.&mdash;Eoin Ua Dubhthaigh, Commisineir.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the position the previous Government took up.  I wonder when, where or how they found the British Legion at this Armistice celebration a menace or a danger?  Did they find them in any way a public body who were likely to overthrow the Government of the time?  Despite all that, I do not blame the Government if they felt obliged, as the present Government has, to inform people that only the recognised forces of the State have the right to wear uniform.  As far as the British Fascisti were concerned there were only about 19 of them. I was trying to count them in that cutting.  There were 19 British Fascisti who marched through the streets in that celebration and General O'Duffy said it should not be allowed.  True, it was a black shirt, not a blue shirt they were wearing.  I can quote a reference in a letter where, however, it is very clearly termed a Fascisti shirt.  That is how it was described by Commandant MacManus in a letter read in the other House.</P>

      <P>I shall read it and I read the whole of it.  It is not a letter to his brother.  That is the position as far as the uniform is concerned.  Then the instructions which they sent out from this Young Ireland Association are in the form of &ldquo;orders.&rdquo;  I have never heard of political parties issuing <Col N="2114" /> what they call &ldquo;orders.&rdquo;  This is a letter of the 23rd November, 1933, to Eugene A. Riordan.  It states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Divisional Orders, Cork City and County.</P>
      <P>A Chara,</P>
      <P>I desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 21st instant together with copies of Divisional Orders issued from your headquarters and to say that I shall be glad to have copies of all such orders forwarded to me in future.</P>
      <P Just="Right">Mise le meas,</P>
      <P Just="Right">E.J. Cronin.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is a letter from Eugene A. Riordan on the 23rd November, to Commandant Cronin which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are now issuing Weekly Divisional Orders in this Division and I have made arrangements for a copy to be dispatched to Headquarters every week in future for your information.  Trusting the same will meet with your approval.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They were divisional orders for Cork City and County Division by Professor James Hogan, D.Litt., B.A., Divisional Commander, issued from 98 Patrick Street.  He makes a reference to the Company Treasurer.  At least, it is attached to a letter which is sent out from Eugene A. Riordan on the 21st November, 1933.  The following is the reference:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Company Treasurer.&mdash;The foregoing rank is abolished as from this date.  Any treasurer at present in possession of funds will disburse same.  In future they will rank as Company Quartermaster.  They will be held responsible that every Volunteer in their Company is in possession of the Regulation shirt.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Organisation.&mdash;In future members of the Young Ireland Association will be known as Volunteers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated several times that anybody is entitled to wear this Blue Shirt.  The people who make that statement know that it is perfectly untrue.  It is all right to make that <Col N="2115" /> statement outside on a platform and say that anybody could wear this regulation Blue Shirt.  Those who make that statement are trying to deceive the people who have not an opportunity of knowing otherwise. They know that that is, to say the least of it, not even fair or middling fair politics.  Nobody can wear a Blue Shirt of this regulation type except he is a member of the Young Ireland Party.  This is a letter dated 20th October, 1933, to M.J. Doolan, 2 Park View Terrace, Emmett Street, Mallow, from which I want to quote one particular thing:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am instructed by the Director-General to acknowledge the receipt of your report dated the 18th instant, and to say that I am very pleased to observe that you have succeeded in forming a Ladies' Branch in Mallow.  You refer to the formation of a Ladies' Branch of the &lsquo;United Ireland Party&rsquo; in your report; it is presumed you mean a Company of the Ladies Section &lsquo;Young Ireland Association.&rsquo; You should interest yourself mainly in your own Association, <i>i.e.</i>, the Young Ireland Association, and it should be distinctly understood that only those belonging to our Association can wear the uniform.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is signed E.J. Cronin.  Why say then that anybody can wear a Blue Shirt?  You dare not do it according to their rules and the position they have taken up&mdash;it is a uniform.</P>
    <P>This matter was debated both in this House and in the other House when this Bill was introduced.  Surely any arguments that might be put forward now would be to some extent a rehash of the arguments we had at that time. We were told immediately after the ban that the ban would be accepted and acted upon properly in the spirit and the letter.  These people who make those statements know that that is not true.  It has not been accepted in the spirit.  I quoted in the other House, and I shall quote now, a letter written by Mr. Seán Ruane of Kiltimagh to Commandant Cronin to show that <Col N="2116" /> there has been no change, that the same body is there except that it has changed the name or changed it on its notepaper.  The words &ldquo;National Guard&rdquo; are used in the text of the letter itself.  I quoted this letter in the debate on 30th November, 1933, in the Dáil:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Are we to refer in public to the National Guard as the Young Ireland Association?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In public&rdquo; it says.  Commandant Cronin writes back and states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The National Guard may be referred to (in public) henceforward as the Young Ireland Association.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In public&rdquo; is in brackets.  But at the private meetings and at the meetings of the inner circles is it referred to as the Young Ireland Party?</P>

      <P>I want to deal with one or two other matters, one with regard to the letter that has been questioned that I read in the Dáil from Commandant McManus.  I have seen a reply to that afterwards saying that it was a personal letter to his brother and that it was not sent to anybody else.  The letter I quoted in the Dáil may have been sent to his brother. I do not want to question that at all, but in other copies that we got his home address is struck out and 5, Parnell Square is put in and there is a note on the margin to have copies made and carbons kept.  He asked why I did not quote the whole letter.  I stated definitely in the Dáil that I was making that letter available to go on the report and that everybody could read it, otherwise, according to the rules I could not quote it at all.  It was obviously intended to have a number of copies made of this letter <Col N="2117" /> I am going to read&mdash;it says so at the top.  This letter is addressed to &ldquo;Dear Hannon.&rdquo;  There are some alterations in it.  He does not seem to be so hard on some people as in the previous one.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want to tell you about the Army Comrades' Association over here, with which I am intimately connected. I enclose a circular I am sending out, so that you will see more or less what we are.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Before the recent election, recruiting everyone who came along, we reached a strength of some 80,000; but since then the out-of-works, ne'er-do-wells, and those &lsquo;on the make&rsquo; have either left or been thrown out.  We have now about 45,000 really good reliable men.  At first we existed to resist the gun-bully and the reign of terror that was commencing.  We did so very successfully.  We forced de Valera to use the police to keep order at meetings and we prevented intimidation on polling day.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I always thought we got in by intimidation.  The letter goes on:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;But it was clear that the Republicans' greatest strength lay in the youth of the country, of whom they had a monopoly.  Every band, every dance hall and every football club in the country is in the hands of the Republicans&mdash;particularly of their left wing, the I.R.A.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is nothing at all wrong with the youth; all they want is leadership, and something by which they can get away from boredom. We have now begun to compete for them, and we are doing so very well, starting clubs and all sorts of activities. They are coming in to us rapidly and enthusiastically, but it all costs money to organise, and that is what we lack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Further than this, it has become more and more clear as we progress that we have a bigger destiny still to fill.  To put it bluntly, Cumann na nGaedheal (Cosgrave's Party) is very demoralised, and has lost the confidence of the country.  Its future <Col N="2118" /> is, under the circumstances, very shaky.  It largely does not exist in the country districts, except in an election, when a patchwork affair gets together and muddles through, very open to intimidation and even to bribery.  The more permanent part of it is&mdash;he has struck out the reference to cliques and other things &mdash;generally weak and inefficient, Cosgrave's personal influence and good work being constantly countered and wasted.  In fact the Party, as a whole, has no real confidence in itself.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Centre Party, that many of us had such hopes in, is in a bad way too.  Frank MacDermot, though very nice personally, has no real knowledge or experience of Irish political life, and is not a good psychologist.

    <P>&ldquo;It is imperative to bring back the fight to the clear-cut and vital issue between socialist republicanism on the one hand and economic sanity on the other.  We&mdash;alone&mdash;can do this, and stiffen the backbone of the flabby.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No one can deny that the Irishman makes one of the finest soldiers in the world, though when &lsquo;on his own&rsquo; he too often makes a fool of himself.  What is the reason for this apparent paradox?  The answer is discipline.  Under discipline he can do anything&mdash;without it he is lost. It is on this principle that we are basing our organisation.  The Republicans have made use of the enthusiasm of a bogus Nationalism, and a spurious attack on England&mdash; our best customer, and a useful friend.  We have behind us the enthusiasm of discipline and of service and loyalty to a virile organisation, no mean driving force, if you look at the history of modern Europe.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We intend to build up to a strength of 100,000 ordinary members and another 50,000 inner members or &lsquo;storm troops,&rsquo; picked men, who are being issued with a blue &lsquo;Fascisti&rsquo; shirt.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I explained already in the other House that the letter was undated.  It was issued from 5 Parnell Square.  Storm troops being issued with blue Fascisti shirts again, called an inner circle, are something that I have not heard of in political parties.  We may be living in a strange country and we may not be surprised at anything that happens, but this is the first time we have seen growing up in this country a body known as &ldquo;storm troops&rdquo; and an inner circle, who are not under the control of the State and who have been allowed to go out in uniform.  I can assure the House that while this Government is the Government of the State that is a thing they will not be permitted to do.</P>
      <P>When I was quoting from one of these documents in the Dáil the other day, I was asked, I think by Deputy MacDermot, what the answer to it was. That referred to a report sent up here to headquarters by a man who said he was on the track of some guns.  I was asked what answer he got back.  I shall tell you the answer he got back-not the answer in that particular case, but a typical example of the answer he would have got back.  This is a letter of the 23rd October, 1933&mdash;it is not the letter that I quoted in the other House, and to which I have just now been referring.  It is addressed to Commandant E.J. Cronin, 3, Merrion Square, Dublin.  I can read the whole letter if the House wishes.  The writer says that &ldquo;there is a lot of private business being carried on in the Mallow Company and only the officers know the extent of same.&rdquo;  Then he says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Recently two members of the district succeeded in procuring two &mdash;&mdash;.  They were purchased for the organisation, not as a private enterprise.  I want to know if I am justified in claiming the possession of same, and not to allow any man to remain in possession of same with sufficient reason.  One of our volunteers claimed the right to keep one, simply because he was in the purchasing of it with a District <Col N="2120" /> Secretary.  I consider it safer to keep them and to hold an officers' meeting before supplying one or two of them to any man.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That letter is signed by Michael Dolan. Commandant Cronin replied on October 25th:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Regarding the question of material recently purchased on behalf of the Association, it should be perfectly understood that in your capacity as District O.C. you are responsible for the custody of such. material.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Certainly any military officer in charge of a company is entitled to hold the arms any member of the company got. I say that Commandant Cronin is quite right in that; nobody is going to dispute that.  But what I call attention to is this, that there are people trying to suggest that Commandant Cronin has sent out no instructions and given no indication to people in the country to try to get arms in every way and as quickly as they can.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does he issue instructions with regard to them? He says &ldquo;You are responsible for the custody.&rdquo;  I suppose that Deputy MacDermot would, in his foolishness, imagine that Commandant Cronin would reply &ldquo;We are purely and simply a political organisation. What business have we with guns?  We will not have guns in our association. Hand back the guns wherever you got them.&rdquo;  But his letter bears out what everybody knew.  Why did that officer, when he got guns, write up for instructions to Commandant Cronin as to what to do with them?  Why did Commandant Cronin write back and say that he, as O.C., was responsible for the material, as he was?  If we had a little more straightness, it would be much better for everybody. People have been caught with guns.  I am not going to refer to that.  If I did, I suppose it would be urged that I was trying to influence the trial. That is for the court to decide and it is not for me to make any reference to it.  Neither am I going to make <Col N="2121" /> reference to documents found on any of those people who are being charged. There is a large number of arms available, at any rate, in the country, if we take General O'Duffy's words, which I quoted already in the other House.  A complaint was made about that time by General O'Duffy that I had no right to quote what was a confidential report.  I felt that it was in the interests of this country that the people should know what he knew in 1932 and what he conveyed to the Government then&mdash;that as he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a membership of 30,000 is now claimed for the organisation.  Regarding armament, it is believed the organisation, as such, has no arms under its control but there is no doubt that a considerable number of individual ex-army officers are in possession of revolvers, and even rifles, held surreptitiously as souvenirs of the pre-truce period. Further, many ex-army men, when leaving the army in 1923-25, brought arms with them.  I have, however, been informed, as already reported to the Minister, that certain members of the organisation hold extreme views and would be prepared to urge the use of force in pursuit of their policy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was General O'Duffy's opinion on the 30th September, 1932.  He talks again of a report he has got from Tipperary; &ldquo;It is certain, however, that Mr. Jerry Ryan, could, should occasion arise, muster a fair number of the arms taken from Templemore Military Barracks during the mutiny.&rdquo; He knew of that.  He comes out to-day and he tells the people that this is an unarmed body.  He has in his organisation the people who, he says, took away these guns as souvenirs.  He has as one of the leaders of his organisation down in the country the man who, he says, could muster a fair number of arms. These people are in his organisation and still we are asked in the most gullible way as if we were the most gullible people, simply because a statement is made by General O'Duffy, or somebody else, that this organisation is purely and simply a political <Col N="2122" /> organisation.  It is nothing of the kind.  I should like to hear from Senator Milroy, in his reply, some explanation of even that one document &mdash;the reply of Commandant Cronin to this Mr. Doolan, district secretary in Cork.  I was taunted in the Dáil and asked what reply this gentleman got back.  Of course, the answer he got back was that he should give back the guns, that he should not have them in the organisation.  And we should be expected to believe that.  General O'Duffy took a very serious view in 1928 regarding the actions of people that, I think, and feel that I can still safely think, are law-abiding people who are trying no stunt of marching on Dublin, as General O'Duffy talked about the other day.  He said he was going to have a march on Dublin. There was a march on Rome and we should expect that he would have something out of the ordinary, that he would not be always copying.  You would imagine that there would be somebody in his organisation with some originality.  Could he not say a march outside Dublin or a march on the Dublin mountains (<i>Interjection by Mr. Milroy</i>).  General O'Duffy is not taken very seriously amongst his own people but those who do not know him might take him seriously.  He took up that position in 1928&mdash;that this organisation, known as the British Legion, were people who should not be allowed to issue orders of command even for one day.  These were simple orders of command&mdash;to form in and to march off in fours.  Those are all the commands I have ever heard issued by them and that was all that was indicated to me when I was approached about this parade.  That matter had no difficulty for me because it had been settled by General O'Duffy in 1928&mdash; before my time.</P>
    <P>Nineteen British Fascisti in black shirts&mdash;these other people wear blue shirts; they call them also a Fascisti shirt&mdash;marched to church in 1928. General O'Duffy said that that should not be allowed.  I am not disagreeing with him.  I agree with him entirely that no people in this country should be allowed either to march or assemble or anything else in a uniform unless <Col N="2123" /> they are under the control of the State. But General O'Duffy was going further; he was indicating his viewpoint even with regard to the Baden-Powell Scouts; he intimated that they were not going along proper lines and their uniform was rather an incentive to irregular activities in the country.</P>
    <P>It has been said by Senator Crosbie and, I think, by other Senators, that this organisation was got up for the purpose of preserving peace at meetings. It is the duty of a State to preserve its own peace and order.</P>

      <P>We are doing our best to do it.  Certain things happened when the other Government were in office and you did not say &ldquo;Why do you not do it?&rdquo;  People were let get out of this country after they had committed very heinous crimes under the other Government and nobody on these benches asked them why they allowed that.  We did, and we are doing, our best.  I challenge here and now any person on the benches of the United Ireland Party here to deny that, previous to the last election, General O'Duffy was sent to by the President of the Executive Council and was told that he was to get all the resources of the State, military as well as the Civic Guards, to ensure the right of free speech at public meetings.  I challenge General O'Duffy to deny that that was the instruction given to him very explicitly and with no ambiguity about it.</P>
      <P>There is always an attempt being made by jaundiced politicians&mdash;I refer to their jaundiced views&mdash;to try to create the impression that this Government is rather trying to encourage disorder at meetings and to encourage intimidation.

General O'Duffy was the Commissioner of the Guards and he was told explicitly that he was to secure the whole resources of the State to ensure that there would be freedom of speech.</P>

      <P>I would like to be clear on that point.  Instructions to the Guards have at all times been explicit; they have been told that it is their duty to preserve peace and order at those meetings.  I think the Tralee people, numbers of them connected with incidents there, have been dealt with as the incidents justified. It is all very well to ask &ldquo;Why was he not identified?&rdquo;  General O'Duffy said he could identify them.  Did we not give him an opportunity?  We paraded a large number of men and we arranged for General O'Duffy to try to pick out the men he said he could pick out and he was not able to do so.  There is no use in people trying to make mean little suggestions that we are not trying to administer the law and preserve order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think his point is worth bothering about. Senator Milroy referred to a number of things that have happened in the country.  I am not saying that a number of things have not happened in the country, but I want to assure this House that we have done and we are doing all we can, and the police are trying to do everything they can, to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice.  The main case made here was about a man named <Col N="2126" /> Bolton.  I happen to have got a report on that case.  That sort of thing will go around as wild propaganda through the country, being believed by people who might think there was some foundation for it. Here you have a responsible Senator making a statement to the effect that this man was assaulted.  I will read the police report that I have received. It is from the Leas-Chomisineir and it is dated 13th December, 1933.  This is the 'phone message from Inspector Harte, of Tramore, sent at 12.30 p.m. on 12th December:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At 6 p.m. on 10th December, 1933, Patrick Bolton, aged 24 years, labourer, residing at Knockaun, Kill, County Waterford, reported to the Sergeant at Kill that at 8 p.m. on 9th December, 1933, when he was going from the village of Kill to Knockaun that he was held up by four armed and masked men who assaulted him and questioned him about his associations with the Blue Shirts.  He stated that two shots were fired at him.</P>
      <P>Bolton has been interviewed by police and in a statement made to Inspector Harte on 11th December, 1933, after a lengthy questioning, has admitted that the story of the hold-up was a fabrication.</P>
      <P>It appears that Bolton was sent for messages on the evening of 8th December, 1933, to the village of Kill.  Instead of attending to his business it appears he spent the time otherwise.  He arrived late at his employer's house and when questioned about the delay invented the story of the hold-up.  He was then directed by his employer, Mooney, to report the facts of the hold-up to the Gárda.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will get people, who think they are responsible, ready to jump at any little report.  They will go to no trouble about questioning it or verifying it so long as it may be used as a dig at the Government in office.  It does not matter what it is so long as that can be done.  Blacken it as much as you can; what does it matter about the country if you can succeed in <Col N="2127" /> having a dig at the Government.  That was the main case elaborated by Senator Milroy.</P>

      <P>I say that those sort of statements should not be made. They do not do any good.  I might refer also to the system which this organisation is building up in the country, a system of intelligence.  They call it military intelligence.  Anybody who refers to the report of the proceedings in the Dáil, where I dealt with this matter, will find from the facts I gave&mdash;and I am not going to repeat them at length to the House&mdash;evidence as to the intelligence that was directed. In building up that military intelligence they say that they are to select their men and they must try to secure such men as postmen and postmasters. The letters that we have captured are simply signed &ldquo;D.O.&rdquo;  The people will not sign their names to these letters. There is &ldquo;D.O.&rdquo; at the end, sent in a covering address and a certain place to go back again.  Those letters we have found.  &ldquo;D.O.&rdquo; means Detective Officer or Director of Intelligence.  I do not know what is the particular position of the men in the organisation, but I want to know do Senators in this House approve of servants of the State, whom one would regard in a way as civil servants and who are in a position somewhat analogous to civil servants&mdash; postmasters, at any rate&mdash;being utilised in this way?  Do Senators approve of this organisation utilising the servants of the State and State officials for the purpose of building up a military intelligence in this State? <Col N="2128" /> Anyhow, how would it have been dealt with by the previous Government if it had been done then?  We know that those people would not remain one day in occupation of these offices, and I might say here and now that any people acting for any banned association, or who allow themselves, while they hold State positions, to be utilised for this military intelligence or any other intelligence that is dealt with by this organisation, will not be very long in the service of the State.</P>
      <P>What is this necessity for military intelligence for a purely political body? What is the object of it?  What is the object of this association with its quartermasters and those other officers?  What is the object of it, if this is a purely political body?  What is the object of storm troops?  Do not be trying to put across people the blue bluff of asking us to take certain things on trust.  You cannot take bucket-shop trust in this country.  It cannot be done.  The Government has realised its position, it has anticipated a development in this country.  We hear people using and people copying methods that may be useful or not in another country&mdash;methods that may be good for a particular country or not. We hear of people copying these methods that have been adopted in modern times.  We see tactics that we would consider illegal in this country according to the Constitution.  These are the tactics of General O'Duffy who said the other day that he was going to have a march on Dublin.  When we hear all this it is no use to say, as some people say &ldquo;You would not mind what he says, he says lots of things.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are poor unthinking dupes under those people who may take them a bit too seriously.  That is the position.  We are satisfied that this body is developing in this country not for a political purpose but purely and simply to bring about a position in the State by which they can overthrow the Government.  Political Parties will not be interfered with, but will get every protection that the Government can afford them, and if necessary the forces of this State will be augmented in order to secure this protection for them.</P>

      <P>I will every time. This is something upon which no Minister should rely.  He has also talked about the mandates which the present Government got.  They got a mandate to remove the Oath.  They got a mandate to retain the land annuities. So we are told.  But there is one mandate they got and there is no question about it, and that is a mandate to administer the law equally between all the citizens and that is what they are failing to do.  Perhaps the Minister would answer a question now if I may put it in this form&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, it is a very necessary question and it is rather a pity he cannot answer it, because I wanted to give him an opportunity of clearing up the matter.  The Minister spoke about Bolton's case.  We had Bolton's first statement and the Minister has given us his later statement. I am not contradicting the Minister, but there is one inference that anybody would draw and that is that possibly he got a little afraid of his skin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not mind the police reports.  The Minister will believe anything except the actual happenings.  Everything is all right in the country!  Who is the judge there? I wonder if certain men came along <Col N="2131" /> and showed their wounds would he believe that certain things happened? If the wounds be shown will he believe it?  Apparently it is rather difficult to rely upon the words of any persons now.  The Minister said that every law-abiding citizen need have no fears. I hope that is true, but there is another fact to which the Minister did not refer and that is that there are certain citizens of this country who are not law-abiding and who also have no fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are looking for a dispensation of equal justice as between all the citizens of this State.  It is a thing which we demand from this Government, a thing which this Government must give and a thing for which this Government is responsible to the people.  The Minister sees in connection with the Blueshirts a certain position developing; he sees certain tendencies in certain directions.  Would it not be more sensible for the Minister to wait for actual developments, for acts of lawlessness on the part of this organisation before taking such strong action as to proscribe the organisation? Would not that be more logical and more reasonable, and would it not be fairer?  No, the Minister is depending on tendencies.  He is depending on such things as a letter which General O'Duffy wrote five or six years ago and on a very foolish letter, referring to storm troops, written by Commandant McManus.  Would it not be better if a different attitude had been adopted by the present Government?  You may have had the A.C.A. and the National Guard, but I do not propose to deal with either.  You have at the present time in this country a political wing, called the Young Ireland Movement, of a political party called the United Ireland Party.  In connection with that you have the assurance of Mr. Cosgrave, Mr. MacDermot, General Mulcahy, Mr. Dillon and of others that this organisation is under the control of the executive of the United Ireland Party.  I think it would be more in keeping with the decencies of public life if the word of men who have held responsible positions in the Government of this country were accepted and acted on rather than to rely on foolish <Col N="2132" /> personal letters discovered, in many cases, in raids on private houses to bolster up such strong action as has been taken by the Government.  Personally, I think that the decencies of public life should be observed.  It would be much better for the State.  I think we should set up a proper tradition in this country.</P>
    <P>We are rather perturbed, in a way, by the absolute failure of the Minister to deal with the position in the country.  He dealt with the Blueshirts. We could all argue the case as to whether the Blueshirt is a uniform or not.  But we will let that pass.  This Government has singled out one organisation in this country and has proscribed it.  The Minister never said a word about the I.R.A., or about the activities of Communists in this country.  He might have said something about these things.  The Government's main activity at the present time seems to be in the recruitment of a territorial force which will be officered by men whose crowning military achievement is that they took up arms against the duly constituted authority of this State.  That is not very much to their credit.  There are lots of other things that they might give their attention to.</P>
    <P>If I had much to say&mdash;and I have not&mdash;to the national policy of the country, I certainly would ban the Blueshirts.  I would have no such organisation.  I would ban the I.R.A. and have no such organisation.  I would ban Communists and their activities.  I would drop this idea of a territorial force and would depend on the National Army and on the Gárda Síochána to preserve peace and order in this country, and if these two forces were not strong enough to do that, then I would strengthen them so that they could do it.  I would set up a tradition that only the forces of a State would be used for maintaining peace and order and for preserving life and property.  I would put the responsibility on the Executive and on the Executive only in connection with these matters and I would hope, ultimately, if I were removed from office, to be able to leave a proud tradition of observance on the part of the <Col N="2133" /> people of the authority of people as represented by the Executive which they themselves had elected to office. I think that would be something to aim at, but as it is, God only knows where we are going, we have so many armies.  In certain respects I agree with a great deal the Minister says, but I do not like servants of the State being used for any such purposes as he mentioned.  I would prefer that there was no occasion to have any Blueshirt section for the purpose of securing and maintaining a hearing for speakers.  I wish that the Government would take its courage in its own hands and deal with all those whose activities may be objected to by reasonable citizens.  Some of us will say that the Government which preceded the present Government in office acted fearlessly and governed well.  I cannot say that the present Government is governing without a certain fear.  I am one of those who wanted to give Mr. de Valera's Government every chance, but if one wants to be as impartial as one wants to be one has to sum up, basing one's deductions and judgments mainly upon what occurred last week, that this Government is not acting fairly and that is a tremendous tragedy.  I wonder where it is all going to end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the speech of the Minister this evening was less lethargic and more energetic than most of the speeches that I have heard him deliver in the other House, but it was also the most unconvincing I have ever heard him make.  I would have liked if, instead of this Chamber, the arena had been a law court with the Minister in the witness box and that it was my task to cross-examine him on the evidence he gave here to-day.  In that event I think the Minister would leave the witness box without a shred of credibility attaching to his statements. Senator O'Hanlon referred to the outstanding feature of the Minister's statement: his point blank refusal to face the issue upon which I challenged him.  It was a definite and unmistakable refusal to show where, when and <Col N="2134" /> to what extent the Young Ireland Association had come within the forbidden grounds outlined in sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act.  The Minister did not make a single attempt to show that.  I venture to say that, even if he had the slightest iota of evidence or proof, he would have played up that evidence for all it was worth.  He tried to make play with a paragraph that appeared in the newspapers, to which I referred, about the man called Bolton.  I only happened to see that last night.  I do not believe all that I read in newspapers, but that case struck me as typical of many incidents that have happened.  The explanation of the Minister is one which I do not intend to question, but will the Minister give a similar explanation with regard to this piece of news which appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i>?  It is a resolution passed by the County Kerry Executive of Fianna Fáil, and it says: &ldquo;The masses of the people feel that freedom of speech and of the Press have their just limits, and that when used in time of war or of national crisis to sabotage one's own country those just limits should be defined and enforced.&rdquo;  Do those people now speak the mind of the organisation in Kerry and of the national executive of that organisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do they not speak the mind of the Ministers whom they support?  At least I have seen nothing yet of repudiation of such an attitude towards freedom on the part of the present Executive Council.  Not only did the Minister fail to answer my challenge but he tried to side-track it. First he introduced General O'Duffy's report in 1932.  I ask him what has that to do with the Young Ireland Association?  He made a rehash of certain arguments used against the National Guard.  If he wishes to raise the propriety and wisdom of banning the National Guard that is an issue upon which I shall be very glad to meet him, but that is not the issue to-day.  The National Guard were banned, and a body of decent, straight young men who formed that organisation believed that they had been <Col N="2135" /> treated unjustly.  I believe so too. They endeavoured to comply with the law, and, at the same time, maintain an organisation that would carry on legitimate, worth-while work.  The Minister brings up a rehash of these old arguments to deal with an entirely new situation.  I am not surprised the Minister has referred to such things as these.  It is very difficult for the Minister, and I think it would be indiscreet of him, to give the really true setting of the Government's attitude in an accurate form. It would be indiscreet and would give away the issue.</P>
    <P>The present Government has indulged in a series of antics and exploits which judged separately seem to be chaotic and irrelevant and, sometimes, savouring of imbecility as unrelated to each other.  The only way I can illustrate this is that taken separately they seem meaningless but when pieced together they fit in and form a definite picture and carry a definite idea.  Since the Minister has failed to give that explanation I would like to endeavour to supply what he omitted.  This suppression of the Young Ireland Association is only a part of a definitely considered and deliberate policy on the part of the Government.  Certain matters which would seem to be an explanation or revelation of their policy take one back some time.  There has been for some time past a definite policy carried on by certain Ministers to defame the leaders who are the spokesmen of their opponents in politics in this country.  That policy is definite and unmistakable.  The Minister for Finance speaking on 19th September last said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am sorry to say that while we have the support of every thinking Irishman, there are unfortunately reactionary and imperialistic elements in the country with the help of a reactionary and imperialistic Press, spreading the spirit of faction amongst us, and in this connection I recall the old saying: &lsquo;It never was the Sassenach that beat us, it was the Gael that beat us.&rsquo; Ireland's cause has often been <Col N="2136" /> betrayed before; but never except when public life in Ireland has been as degraded as in the days of Castlereagh has Irish treachery flaunted itself in the public eye.  In the past we have had Sham Squires, Leonard McNallys and Captain O'Sheas and a host of other furtive secret hypocrites, posing as patriots.  But until Cumann na nGaedheal gave the lead such men did not dare come into the open.  How long will the true Irish farmers, the working farmers, the class whose courage and endurance won the Land War and the Black-and-Tan War allow their name to be dishonoured by such as these? &lsquo;Knaves and traitors stand aside, way for Ireland&mdash;Fág an bealach.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the beginning or at least it was one of the initial episodes of this campaign.  On the 20th January, referring to Mr. Cosgrave's promise that if elected he will reduce the annuities payable by the farmers by one-half, Mr. MacEntee asked &ldquo;if the people would have faith in the oath of a Judas.  Would they be misled by the pledge of a Pitt or the promise of a Castlereagh?&rdquo;  On the 28th September the President intervened with his false charge against General Mulcahy. When questioned subsequently it was perfectly clear, and was of course admitted, that there was not a single shred of truth in that charge.  What was still more striking was that not the faintest means had been taken to ascertain the truth or otherwise of this charge before giving publicity to it. Just before that President de Valera made his charge in Dundalk against the Waterford farmers.  He said it was made generally, but the facts and circumstances made it clear that there was no other case to which he could have been referring except that of the Waterford farmers.  These men were then brought before the Military Tribunal and acquitted on that count. Let me give one more quotation from Mr. MacEntee against Mr. Cosgrave:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That man challenges us to put him in jail.  Well, we are asking the Irish people to jail him in the pages of Irish history.  And we will have <Col N="2137" /> his name spat upon as the names of Carey, Nagle, Leonard McNally, Pitt and Castlereagh and every other man who betrayed the Irish people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I shall give one last citation.  This is from the <i>Irish Press</i> of last Monday&mdash;propaganda by suggestion. The headline across the page reads: &ldquo;Blueshirt Scenes.  Bombs and Destruction.&rdquo;  The bombs and destruction, of course, were in Spain, but to the average casual observer, the headline associates the bombs and destruction with the Blueshirt scenes.  What I want to suggest is that this action of the Government in regard to the Young Ireland Association is simply a part of this policy.  They have so worked themselves up to a pitch of hysteria in regard to opponents of their policy that they are determined that if, by this kind of denunciation, their opponents cannot be silenced, their policy of stifling them shall be pursued by any means that come to their hands until that object is secured.  They were quite satisfied to have the operation of political opposition when that political opposition was met with intimidation and violence and was gradually becoming afraid to open its mouth. They could say, as President de Valera said, that the Government cannot make people or a cause popular.  That kind of freedom of speech is not the kind of freedom of speech the Government would have sponsored, of course, but when that situation was developing and when there arose the organised effort of the youth of the country to cope with these disturbers of public peace and to secure that there would be freedom of speech for the critics of the Government and for those who stood for democracy in this State, then the Government discovered that their idea of freedom of speech, which means in the net result freedom of speech only for the Government and its spokesmen, was something which was likely to disappear. Accordingly, the suppression of this organisation must take place.</P>
    <P>I am almost finished now but I have something to add which, I think, is important.  There is one piece missing from this jigsaw policy of the Government. That piece which was missing <Col N="2138" /> and which has not yet been supplied was the letter which President de Valera expected to get from Mr. Thomas and which would create the atmosphere that would enable them to stampede the country into an election under the cry of definite and avowed aggression from England.  That was the piece of jigsaw puzzle that was missing.  President de Valera, the other night, thought that he would try to substitute Lord Hailsham's rather&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;well, stupid and inaccurate statement for the reply from Mr. Thomas which was not forthcoming. Well, it was no effective substitute, and they realise that now. They talk about maintaining peace and securing freedom.  Mr. de Valera has insisted time and time again that before this country can have peace the nation must have freedom of choice to decide its destiny.  I venture to say that if there is one thing that stands out clearly it is that the electors of this country are not going to have freedom of choice at the next General Election if the present Government can prevent it.  Before you hope to get freedom of decision as between Ireland and England, at least let us have freedom of decision for the electorate of this State in their own internal affairs.  I have one last and brief word to say.  President de Valera, in an interview with the <i>Sunday Chronicle</i> last Sunday, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The fact is, there can be no good relations between the two countries until the Treaty goes nor real peace in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>His challenge to the people is that there will be no peace in this country while the Treaty lasts.  I want to say this, that if the Treaty which we stood for in 1921, 1923 and since, and which I believe the vast majority of the people of Ireland are standing for since, was worth in its beginning all the sacrifices it cost to bring it about and to maintain it, it is trebly worth it now as a result of the expansion of freedom we have secured through it.</P>
