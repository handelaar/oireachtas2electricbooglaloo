      <P>The first business on the Order Paper is the Report of the Special Committee appointed to consider and report on the Rules of Court.  The House will notice that these rules deal with three separate departments, namely, the High Court and Supreme Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court.  The first motion in reference to the report is that standing in the name of Senator Brown.  I would suggest that the wording of that motion be slightly altered, and that instead of the word &ldquo;adopted,&rdquo; the word &ldquo;received&rdquo; be inserted, because I do not want to prejudice the position of any Senator who wishes to move an amendment.  Therefore, I think it wiser to put it in that form.</P>

      <P>I adopt the suggestion which you have made, sir, and I therefore move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Report of the Special Committee appointed to consider and report on the Rules of Court, in so far as it relates to the Rules of the High Court and Supreme Court, be received and that the rules as presented be approved.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing only with the Rules of the Supreme Court and the High Court in this particular resolution.  The rules which have been made by the Minister for the Supreme Court and the High Court are entirely satisfactory, with one small exception, which is really necessary because of the altered form of the originating instrument. Formerly everything in the High Court was commenced by a writ of summons, or by an originating summons, and under the rules which come to us for our approval the form of these originating instruments has been <Col N="1030" /> slightly altered.  The rules, as made by the Minister, practically adopt the entire old and well-tried procedure, and only in one small instance, where they make an improvement, have they been altered.  The only alteration is in the service of the summons out of the jurisdiction.  Under the old Judicature Rules you could not do that in the case of a tort committed in the jurisdiction, and the person who committed the tort living outside.  This rule gives an opportunity of serving the summons outside the jurisdiction in cases like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. COSTELLO</NameTxt>
      <P>I move as an amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before the word &ldquo;received&rdquo; the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; and to add at the end of the motion the words, &ldquo;with the exception of Order 29, Rules 2, 3, and 5.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to express my disapproval of the rules in regard to the Supreme Court and High Court because I am not satisfied that the status given to Irish is in accordance with our rights under Article 4 of the Constitution My contention is that this Order seeks to limit our rights and, even in that limited condition, it appears to rest on the hypothetical basis of having the Gaeltacht determined at some time or other by the Oireachtas.  That may, or may never, happen and that, I think, is very unsatisfactory.  I cannot understand why the rules made for the District Court and Circuit Court should not also apply to the High Court and Supreme Court.  I consider that they are very satisfactory.  In the District Court, either the national language or the English language may be used in proceedings.  In the Circuit Court, proceedings in all criminal cases and in all civil actions shall be carried on in the national language of Saorstát Eireann or in the English language, and either language can be used at any stage of the proceedings.  If the restriction sought to be put on Irish in these rules is due, as I suspect, to the very limited knowledge possessed by judges and officials of the national language it could be met in two ways.  The Order <Col N="1031" /> could be deleted altogether and we could then fall back upon Article 4 of the Constitution, or similar rules to those for the District and Circuit Courts could be inserted and a time limit given for the carrying out of the full programme.</P>

      <P>We have no Standing Orders regulating the procedure as to moving amendments in a matter like this, but I think we had better follow the practice in Committee on Bills and allow amendments to be moved without being seconded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that when we were dealing with these rules in Committee this matter escaped my notice and it was only afterwards that my attention was drawn to it.  I feel that the rules as they stand inflict, to a certain extent, some sort of inferiority on the national language of the country.  The Gaeltacht has not, so far, been defined, nor, I understand, can it be defined until the Gaeltacht Commission has issued its report.  Under these circumstances, I think that these rules might well be withheld until such time as that Commission has reported.  We would then know what the Gaeltacht is, what its requirements will be, and see whether these rules conflict with the rights of Irish under the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, there would be no difficulty in the case of the Gaeltacht, for any person instituting proceedings to serve the initial summons in the language of the people of the district who are being compelled to appear before the court, for the consideration of claims.  These rules make provision that in the Gaeltacht the originating summons apparently will be in English, which is an alternative language in the country and which, presumably, will not be the language of the people in that district.  For that reason, the rules certainly tend to convey that the court considers that the proper language of the district is the English language.  I think that particular suggestion underlying the rules, as far as my reading of it goes, tends to place the Irish language in a position of inferiority not dreamt of in the Constitution, because <Col N="1032" /> it is the language of the country under the Constitution.  Would it not be very easy after the Gaeltacht is defined, that every summons issuing in the first instance in that district should be issued in Irish, that it should be translated by the official interpreter, that an originating summons be in Irish, and that where translations are not made by the plaintiff the translation should be made in the Central Office and served on people who do not understand Irish?  These, I imagine, would be very few in the Gaeltacht.  For these reasons, I beg to second Senator Mrs. Costello's amendment that these rules be not accepted at the moment.  There is no immediate necessity for them. The Gaeltacht has not been defined and I take it that before we meet again the Rule-making Authority will have had time to consider the matter from a broader aspect and, viewing it in that way, they will have come to a conclusion such as is suggested by Senator Mrs. Costello and such as I would like to give my support to, that is to say, that in the Gaeltacht the Irish language should be the language used in an originating summons and that where translation is required, the translation should be made in the Central Office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to support the amendment.  When reference is made in these rules to the Gaeltacht, it follows that the rules should not be applied until the Gaeltacht is defined and until the Commission appointed for that purpose has concluded its findings. It goes without saying that these rules should only be applied when the Gaeltacht is defined.  When it is defined, certainly if we are to be consistent with our previous actions when similar matters were brought forward in the Seanad under the court system, such as the appointment of Irish-speaking judges and officials in the Gaeltacht&mdash; which action has been given effect to as far as possible since by the Government&mdash;I think it is only reasonable to ask that in the Gaeltacht, where the dominating common language is Irish, precedence should be given to the Irish language in the case of all court forms issued in that district.  They should certainly be issued in Irish, and the <Col N="1033" /> wording of the rules should be altered so that that can be done and that the document may be accompanied by a translation.  All objections would be overcome if we followed the practice that is followed in the case of the official record of our proceedings.  We find that most of these records are both in English and Irish.  They are bound to be by the Articles of the Constitution. I venture to say that very few Senators ever cast their eyes over the Irish portions, and if they did, they would not know what they meant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not blame them for that.  Some people are not of a linguistic turn and they may not, even after years of arduous study, be able to acquire a fluent or even a nodding acquaintance with the language, whereas others with a linguistic faculty may acquire the language much more easily. The Government in all other matters has given due weight to the meaning and the spirit of the clause in the Constitution that refers to our language. Here in a matter that affects the dispensation of justice and may affect human life&mdash;human life may be in the hazard&mdash;the very people who are so concerned in these grave issues of justice, are to be sent a notice to comply with certain procedure and forms in a language that they will not understand. There is only a casual reference to the fact that such notice may be accompanied by a translation.  Unless we are to be retrogressive, we are bound to conform these rules to the actions and the procedure we have already adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Exception is taken in particular to Rules 2 and 3 of Order 29. Rule 2 reads: &ldquo;All summonses and notices to be served personally in the Gaeltacht, if in the English language may be accompanied by a translation thereof in Irish, and if not so accompanied shall be translated into Irish by one of the interpreters attached to the Central Office, and the parties serving such summons or notice shall be bound to serve the Irish version along with the English original of the document <Col N="1034" /> in question.&rdquo;  The idea underlying that rule is that in the Gaeltacht or Irish-speaking portion of the country people brought to law should be summoned in the language which they habitually use and understand.  On the other hand, there is in the rules recognition of the fact that a plaintiff, either in the Gaeltacht itself or outside it, may have no knowledge of Irish, and that his solicitor may have no knowledge of Irish.  To deal with that situation the rule provides that if the plaintiff himself does not voluntarily provide an Irish version, either by way of original or as a translation, for service in the Gaeltacht, then in the interests of a prospective Irish-speaking defendant the document must be translated. There is no option about that. The document must be translated in the Central Office so as to ensure that the defendant will at least have a document in the language which he habitually uses.  There does not seem to me to be anything unfair about that rule.  The rule does not seem to contain any implication of hostility, contempt or indifference to the national language.  I ask Senators, as I asked Deputies in the Dáil, to remember that these rules are not brought forward by way of propaganda, whether linguistic or political.  They simply purport to be a code of rules for the administrative convenience of litigants, their professional representatives and the judges of the courts. They are based on an appreciation of the position as it now is, as we know it to be, and I put it to Senators that when you are considering the position with regard to the use of language in the administration of justice, you have got to take as practically a fundamental factor in your survey the practising and trained lawyer.  There is not anything to be gained by ignoring the fact that whereas every practising lawyer in this State to-day knows and can understand English, I doubt if there is one who knows and uses the Irish language, and knows that only.  Therein lies the explanation of such difference as there is between Rule 2, which deals with the Gealtacht, and Rule 3, which deals with the entire Saorstát&mdash;Gaeltacht and Galltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> Passing to Rule 3, which deals with the whole Saorstát&mdash;that is not the Gaeltacht alone as in Rule 2, but the Galltacht and all the rest of the area of the jurisdiction of the State&mdash;the underlying idea of that is precisely the same as the idea underlying Rule 2. It is recognised that a defendant may have no knowledge of Irish whatsoever, but if the plaintiff chooses to initiate his proceedings in Irish he must not be prevented from doing so.  In the interests of a prospective defendant he may provide an English translation, and if he does not provide an English translation of his initiating document in Irish, then the translation must be done in the Central Office. Now it may be contended, and in fact has been contended, that Rule 3, in dealing with the whole Saorstát is not the precise opposite of Rule 2, which deals with the Gaeltacht only.  I will be told that Rule 3 should be limited to the area of the State outside the Gaeltacht, which would mean that if a document were served in Irish in the Gaeltacht no English translation would be necessary.  There is substantial realism, if I may say so, underlying the distinction.  The Committee which drafted these rules in the first instance, and I, who have adopted them, recognise that English is, in fact, widely known and generally spoken in the country, and that even in the Gaeltacht there will be found people who know no Irish whatsoever, whereas it is difficult to imagine a person outside the Gaeltacht and in the Galltacht who knows no English.</P>
    <P>The point is that no practising lawyer, as I have said, in the whole Saorstát is in this position, that he knows Irish perfectly and knows practically no English at all.  No matter how much we may pretend to be independent of trained lawyers, the fact is that when we have the misfortune to indulge in litigation we are dependent on them, and these rules are based and have had to be based on a recognition of the position with regard to language as it affects the practising lawyer, on whom we depend when we enter into litigation.  We have not ignored the fact that in the Gaeltacht itself, quite <Col N="1036" /> within the Gaeltacht itself, very many solicitors have been practising for a lifetime without any knowledge of Irish.  It will be apparent, therefore, that it is simply illusory to pretend that you can carry on all your law work, even within the Gaeltacht, in Irish.  That position may come.  If it does come, there will be a case for the alteration of the rules, but I am defending these rules on the position as we know it to be, not on the position that Senator Mrs. Costello, Senator Bennett, Senator Kenny, or myself, might wish it to be.  On that realistic basis, and on an appreciation of the position with regard to the language that now exists, I stand over Order 29 and Rules 2 and 3, in particular, of Order 29.  I am not satisfied that there rests in either or both of these orders anything that would justify the rejection of these rules by the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot appreciate the Minister's point of view or agree with the angle at which he looks at this whole question.  Rule 2 reads that &ldquo;All summonses and notices to be served personally in the Gaeltacht, if in the English language, may be accompanied by a translation thereof in Irish.&rdquo;  In view of the fact that Irish in the dominating language in the Gaeltacht, should it not also be made a dominating factor, and would it not be fair and reasonable for us to make that rule read somewhat like this: &ldquo;All summonses and notices to be served personally in the Gaeltacht, if in the Gaelic language, may be accompanied by a translation thereof in English.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the present wording of the rule is better from the Senator's point of view than what he is now suggesting, because the present wording takes the document in the English language as rather an exception. &ldquo;All summonses and notices to be served personally in the Gaeltacht, if in the English language&rdquo;&mdash;the words, &ldquo;if in the English language&rdquo; seem to me to contain the implication that the normal there would be that they would be in the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  We want the originating summonses in these <Col N="1037" /> documents to be served in the Gaeltacht in Irish, and let whatever qualifying clauses are necessary be introduced thereafter for the benefit of those in the Gaeltacht such as those solicitors who have been practising absolutely without their clients knowing what they are talking about.  If they want translations, by all means let them have them, but the people primarily concerned on whom the summonses are served, and who are purely Irish speakers&mdash;and 97 per cent. of the Gaeltacht&mdash;are surely entitled to get their summonses in the language they understand.  They are the first consideration. If solicitors for their own convenience want summonses interpreted they have the means at their disposal for getting them translated.  I want the Minister to lay it down that summonses in the Gaeltacht, when defined, should be served in the Gaelic language and translations supplied to those who require them.  In the Galltacht a similar rule could apply, and those who want translations into Irish can have them.  The principle should be that the dominating language in any area should be the controlling factor in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Earl of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice the Minister dealt fully with Rules 2 and 3, but he said nothing about Rule 5&mdash;that the expression Gaeltacht shall mean the geographical area comprising such districts of the Saorstát as shall be from time to time declared by the Oireachtas. Well, supposing this &ldquo;time to time&rdquo; never comes to pass, Rules 2 and 3 will not operate at all.  I do not understand why the Minister did not say something about Rule 5, for it seems to the plain man unless the Oireachtas acts, Rules 2 and 3 will be nugatory for all time.</P>

      <P>Then my contention falls to the ground.  If they do that for nothing at all it is very kind of them.  I might mention that there are people in important places who go to the High Court, and who have come from the other side of the water, and as for understanding Irish you might as well ask them to understand Chinese, and that is at the bottom of the whole thing&mdash;that these summonses, or whatever they are, in Irish must be translated, and as I understand, free of charge.</P>

      <P>I do not see how we could adopt the suggestion of Senator Kenny without doing violence to Article 4 of the Constitution, which says that the English language shall be equally recognised as the official language.  A summons or a document served under these rules is an official document, and, therefore, under the Constitution the English language being equally recognised with the Irish language as official, we are entitled to have the originating summons, or any other document you wish to serve, in English, and you would be violating the Constitution if you compelled the person in the originating document to have the Irish language only used.</P>

      <P>The Minister has met the case, I think, very fairly, but he went outside the scope of the amendment. We were simply dealing with notices and summonses, but the Minister went on to describe the whole procedure of the courts, including pleadings and all that.  Senator Mrs. Costello merely suggested that the necessity for these rules had not arisen, as <Col N="1040" /> the Gaeltacht had not been defined and that it would be advisable to defer the promulgation of these rules until such time as that definition had been made.  When the actual area has been defined we will know the position better, and can say as to whether or not the rules as framed meet the case.</P>

      <P>This amendment is to delete that portion of the rules which prescribes the present robes and wigs of the Judges of the High Court and the Supreme Court.  I move this, not because I desire to see the judges sitting in their courts in ordinary costume, but because I believe that the Government have in their possession very much finer designs than any that has come down to us.  I am sorry that the Government have not found some means of making these designs known to this House, because the House has to vote on the subject.  They might have been laid on the Table of the House.  You are asked to vote in favour of designs without knowing what the alternative to these designs is.  The only guidance that this House might perhaps possess is that new designs have been adopted for the District Court, and photographs of these designs have appeared in the papers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite accurate.  We had better be accurate about this.  That has to be done by Rules of Court and I notice that the District Court Rules omit any reference to it.  They cannot adopt any costume they like, but only in accordance with the Rules of Court.  They have not framed any Rules of Court for such a purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamYeats" hpid="Dr. YEATS Dr. YEATS">
      <NameTxt>Dr. YEATS</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not adopted any costumes, but we have seen the costumes that have been reproduced. They are certainly very dignified and very simple.  They are, I think, more dignified and more simple than any costumes worn in any magistrates' courts in these islands.  The robes were designed by a celebrated Irish artist, Sir Charles Shannon, and the cap was designed at the Dun Emer Works, and admirably designed.  However, in the circumstances I cannot ask you to vote in favour of other designs, because I cannot put the designs before you.  But I suggest if you reject the present robes and wigs, the Government will have to lay before you new designs by somebody, and then we will know whether or not we will have a <Col N="1041" /> better type.  When you think over the present costume, that great grey wig and that gown, if you try to see it without historical associations, is it not something incredibly fantastic? Is it not something essentially preposterous?  Of course, I admit that historical associations and tradition can endear anything; I will admit that the judge's wig is endeared to me by historic associations and tradition.  Historical traditions have endeared the small foot of the Chinese woman, have endeared the nose-ring.  I admit that I find it very difficult to realise how preposterous the judge's wig is.  I am in the position of some man in China who finds it impossible to realise the preposterousness of the small foot, but it is so.  Historical associations are great things.  I do not think we should lightly put them aside, even when we endear something which is, in itself, without dignity or honour.  Historical associations give honour and they give dignity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But this country has passed through one of those crises which all countries have made the occasion of a new act of energy for the creation of tradition. No country that I know, after a revolution such as we have gone through, has been content to take without examination the traditions of the past, and I cannot imagine any place where innovation is more necessary than in the outward image of the law.  One of the greatest arguments with which we have been familiar for generations in favour of the self-government of this country, was that the law as practised here was regarded by great numbers of people as something inherently alien.  We all want the people to realise that the law is now their own creation, their own instrument, and any external change which marks that fact will in some degree&mdash;I will not say in a great degree&mdash;help the people to understand that the judges are their own judges and not judges imposed upon them from without.  I speak especially of the judges.  I think the case of the barristers is somewhat different. They are not paid out of public money. They are a free corporation.  I should be prepared to leave the barristers to time and to public opinion.  But the <Col N="1042" /> Government cannot put aside responsibility for the judges, because the judges are paid with Government money, and&mdash;always provided, remember, that they possess better designs, designs inherently of greater dignity and of greater nobility than those in present use&mdash;I can see every reason for the adoption of these designs, and I can see no sufficient case against the adoption.  The designs for the Supreme Court and for the High Court which the Government possess are, in my belief, designs of great dignity, great beauty and simplicity.  They would do honour to any country, and in adopting them this country would do as well as the Vatican did when it permitted Michael Angelo to set aside one does not know what historical traditions, and to design the costumes of the Papal Guards.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I shall not be able to deal with this matter with the same scholarship and in the same eloquent language as that used by Senator Yeats, but as a plain man, I should like to make certain observations upon this proposal.  I think we should be very cautious, and should have very good reasons before we break with tradition.</P>

      <P>Yes, English tradition.  I am not ashamed to say English tradition.  It is the tradition which the people have grown accustomed to.  I notice that we naturally gravitate towards tradition.  Let us look at all the observances and all the procedure of the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  Except with the occasional appearance of the Irish language on special occasions and in official records, I venture to say our procedure is being moulded, not unnaturally, but perhaps unconsciously, on the traditions of the British Parliament.  That has been our spontaneous line of development, and I think we have been doing very well, and we may claim that a good deal of the dignity of our proceedings and the efficiency of our work is due to it.  If our tradition and our nature were different, why have they not manifested themselves, and why has not the change which <Col N="1043" /> marks revolution been marked also in the form of our procedure?  In the same way, in the more prosaic matters of finance and administration we are following British administration as the line of spontaneous and natural development. I do not see why we should do violence to tradition in respect to the costume of our judges. The Senator referred to the present head-dress of our judges as preposterous, but I can conceive great practical value in that head-dress.  I was looking up literary references as to what I believe is the proposed new head-dress known as the biretta.  I have not much knowledge of the biretta, but I find a reference to it in the Athenæum in these words: &ldquo;a person described as with a black shock of hair emerging or appearing under his red biretta.&rdquo;  I can conceive nothing more inartistic than that, because hair may not be always black, it may be sometimes grey or brown, it may be long or short, or a person may have no hair. Moreover, we may now have ladies joining the legal profession.  I see nothing in the ordinary course of development to prevent ladies rising to seats upon the Bench.  Ladies have a great variety of head-dress which would also contrast in a very incongruous manner with such a close-fitting ornament as the biretta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wig has the virtue of uniformity and covers up all these imperfections of the flesh and gives very dignified results.  You get uniformity.  That is for what it is worth.  When we go further into the matter I confess I was interested in the quarter from which this proposal came.  My memory at once went back to a recent speech delivered by Senator Yeats in this House on the subject of the Lane pictures, when he used these words: &ldquo;You will forgive me if I forget that I am occasionally a politician and remember that I am always a man of letters, and speak less diplomatically and with less respect for institutions and great names than is, perhaps, usual in public life.&rdquo; Following up that trend of thought I remember certain verses of the Senator's in which his words seem to me <Col N="1044" /> rather inconsistent with the remarks that I have just quoted.  He writes:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All things can tempt me from this craft of verse;</P>
    <P>One time it was a woman's face, or worse&mdash;</P>
    <P>The seeming needs of my fool-driven land.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I admit that I never want to tax anybody with inconsistency, especially a politician, because if we remain consistent politicians we lose all power of reasoning and would pronounce ourselves impervious to argument&mdash;a position which none of us want.  When we look into this I think we have a responsibility in the matter. This thing cannot be determined, I feel, by the mere wish of a small group of individuals.</P>
      <P>We must either try to satisfy ourselves as to what the wishes of the people are, or, if we are unable, we must examine the more narrow wishes of the profession affected.  If you cannot satisfy yourself on that, what have you to expect?  I refuse to believe that the people are interested one way or another.  I do not believe we have in any way a mandate to make a violent change from tradition in this respect. There has been no demand as far as one knows in the Press, through associations or through local bodies that are very vocal when they feel strongly on a matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not seen these designs.  I understand they are designed by an Irish artist.  He was an artist and he left Ireland for his own good.  He left Ireland because it did not afford the same economic and professional opportunities as other more wealthy countries. He has returned to us in this matter.  I do not wish to quarrel with him on that account.  If we are satisfied that there is no popular demand for this change, what do we find among the profession itself?  I understand the overwhelming majority do not want a change, and I think that should weigh with us very heavily.  I think <Col N="1045" /> you have no right here, for reasons of national sentiment or whatever you like to call it, to over-ride the wishes of the profession in this matter without getting a definite mandate from the people.  That being so, I claim that, in the meantime, custom and tradition, which are most valuable assets, especially when they seem to be of a natural growth amongst us, should be preserved.  There is nothing more reactionary than change for change's sake, especially when the change is not asked for, and the actual proposal is not artistic.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration.  In its origin the costume of the Bar and the Bench bore a close relation to the dress of the clerics.  Those two professions have been gradually widening down the ages; we, too, feel that there should be a marked division even among the outward forms of the Church and the Judiciary.  I am assuming&mdash;I may be wrong.  If I am told I am wrong I shall not pursue the argument any further, but I am told&mdash; that the new head-dress is to be the biretta.  That will bring close together the outward association between the Church and the Judiciary which had been widening steadily down the ages.  We find full justification in verses written by the Senator himself:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;How but in custom and in ceremony</P>
    <P>Are innocence and beauty born?</P>
    <P>Ceremony's a name for the rich horn</P>
    <P>And Custom for the spreading laurel tree.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If I understand that rightly, the rich horn is that of plenty which we all desire, and the laurel tree is that of fame to which we aspire.</P>

      <P>In spite of Senator Sir John Keane's protest against these proposed rules, the subject is not trivial.  It is not one of those things which matter very little one way or another.  The important things in the country are often the little things, like the flag, for instance, which are of the utmost importance&mdash;more important than words can express, because they are the spiritual and symbolic things. The costume of our lawgivers is one of those little important, significant things.  It is important to us because <Col N="1046" /> by it we are to judge whether the old régime of law, which meant misery and oppression to this country for many centuries, is at an end or is not at an end.  We want to see a change of heart accompanied by a change of costume. Who can tell the thousands of our fellow-countrymen who faced the wig and gown before being condemned to death, transportation, or penal servitude, for political offences in the old evil days? One would expect from a learned and great profession, to say the least of it, a little good taste in this matter and not a wish to perpetuate the association of the wig and gown, inevitable in the Irish mind, with injustice and place-hunting.  The ingratiating barrister, the transporting judge &mdash;all were clothed in this ridiculous remnant of the 18th century.  Senator Sir John Keane says the alternative is a biretta.  There is no such thing.  I have seen the drawing.  The cap at present might be called a biretta if it were flattened out, starched and stiffened. It is a flat velvet cap which, without disguising a judge lends to him dignity and a little amount of beauty, things hitherto not associated in this country with the law.  We are told to respect custom.  But is custom to date only from the advent of the English into this country?  There were customs and traditions in this country which preceded English law by about a thousand years.  There were both humanity and equity.  The Brehon Laws were more humane than the English laws and more equitable and humane than the Roman.  In the treatment of prisoners they were equal to the most modern form of treatment as seen in Italy. There was no such thing as capital punishment under the Brehon Laws. They exceeded Italian laws in their commonsense.  They made a malefactor work to compensate those who suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our tradition and custom should not be dated by the 18th century wig.  A little knowledge shows that, with the advent of the 18th century wig and gown, coercion and reaction came.  It made every barrister become <i>persona grata</i> with the people in power.  That was quickly reflected through the country.  We knew what the wig and <Col N="1047" /> gown stood for.  Here we have a chance of using Irish material, using Irish designs, and embodying our lawgivers and barristers in something comely and, at any rate, something national.  I do not wish to attribute motives to those who refuse to adopt this new costume, but I must make a statement about a certain mentality that is very rife in Dublin at present. I was accused by an eminent lawyer of wishing to raise trouble because I lamented that at the forthcoming international horse-jumping competition at the Horse Show the National Flag, not that it is artistic, would not be seen.  He said: &ldquo;Are you trying to raise trouble?  You might prevent people coming from Belfast.&rdquo;  Are we, alone among the European nations, to deny our nationality and become nonentities in order to take the chance of a few people coming down from that suburb of Glasgow, Belfast, to the Horse Show?</P>

      <P>There is the mentality of Upper Tooting, which may be called a dangerous mentality.  And it is to get rid of that that I am making this protest.  We have a chance of making the judges look as if the law were native law. The present law is really an adaptation of the very inhuman Roman law.  It became far more inhuman when it got into England.  It was only at the end of the 18th century that the English took their children out of the mines where they were slaving, working up to their waists in water.  We must let our tradition have an outward show. Here is a chance of making it incumbent on judges to use Irish poplin. There is a great house for Irish poplin in Dublin, Atkinson's.  It struggled on during the latter decades when people did not wear poplin.  The poplin waistcoat is now gone, but let us bring in the poplin robe.  In spite of the suggestion that a biretta is a clerical thing I want to disabuse the mind of the House.  I have seen the excellent designs.  The one for the Supreme Court consists of a black velvet cap.  When on it gives the appearance of Cardinal Wolsey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we realise that the so-called <Col N="1048" /> conservatism of the barristers is associated with a little die-hard group it will be very useful if we extract that last fang through legislation.  There are certain <i>points d'appui</i> where die-hards are burrowed.  These are all key positions even though they seem small. The flag is one, and this costume of the law is another.  Though it may have come on quite innocently it comes out of that subconscious and dangerous attitude to the spirit of this country and we must squash it.  We have been tolerant long enough, and we have a good opportunity now to see who is with us.  We can dispense with the Upper Tooting and Belfast mind.  We did our best for Belfast.  We should allow the law to appear in Irish garb made of Irish material with the assurance of added dignity.  It will not be a fictitious dignity from the remnant of a forgotten and very frowsy century.</P>

      <P>The effect of Senator Yeats's amendment would be to do away with Rules 2 and 3 of Order 30. The Senator began his speech by stating that he could not explain the design of the new costumes before the House, but the two Senators who followed, kindly did so.  Senator Sir John Keane said that he believed that the new head-dress of the judges was a sort of biretta.  Senator Gogarty went one better and said that it looked like a velvet cap.  People who are not die-hards know exactly what our judges wear.  The material of the new robe is to be of black Irish poplin.  Senator Yeats's amendment would do away with Rules 2 and 3, and as a result the judges should wear a black robe of Irish poplin.  Senator Yeats talked about historical associations, about honour and about dignity. He also talked about the small foot of the Chinese woman.  I know something about that, as a nephew of mine who is a naval officer spent two years in that country.  He told me that the small Chinese foot was invented by the mandarins, who did not wish their ladies to leave the precincts of their houses.  These ladies were kept in these houses in many cases against their will. That is the explanation of the small foot of the Chinese woman, so that I do not think it is a very happy historical association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> Senator Gogarty said that a change of heart should be followed by a change of costume.  I cannot follow that.  I do not see how a person could change his heart by putting on a poplin robe or any other robe.  All those who follow the profession of the law respect the judges, as they gain their positions by hard work, integrity and honour.  Those who dwell in the British Isles in these civilised days and who did not live when the Brehons ruled have, by long custom, respected the judges with their wigs on their heads. A wig is a most becoming costume for the head, especially for a bald head. If a man has an intelligent and a fairly good-looking face, as can be seen in many pictures, the wig makes him appear a very good-looking man.  All artists admit that.  It is a becoming and a dignified headgear.  This is not a question of policy.  Surely those who follow the law might be allowed to wear on their heads the dress they like. Imagine being tried by a judge with a black velvet cap.  I should at once associate myself, if I was on trial, with a criminal in the dock who was going to get the longest possible sentence. The feelings and the emotions of a judge who is wearing a wig are not disclosed.  I think the first time that an innocent person appeared before a judge wearing a black cap he would say to himself, &ldquo;This is the end of me.  I may as well say my prayers at once.&rdquo;  I shall certainly vote against Senator Yeats's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to give my support to the amendment that has been proposed.  This is a matter that has a distinct national bearing.  So far as the kernel of the present discussion is concerned, all that we, as a nation and as a people, require to be assured us is the absolute dispensation of justice.  It does not really matter whether the judge wears a wig or a gown, or a dressing gown; that does not in any way assure the person brought before the court.  It is not a question of being influenced by apparel.  The principal matter involved is that justice will be dispensed fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to correct a possible impression made by the remarks of Senator the Earl of Mayo in regard to the small foot of the Chinese woman.  In <Col N="1050" /> China that is a characteristic of the nobility; a small foot is a symbol of nobility amongst Chinese women just the same as a long finger-nail on the left hand is a symbol of nobility on the part of a Chinese man.  I have seen a Chinaman's finger-nails so long as to take the form of a corkscrew.  How they preserve their nails in that fashion I do not know.  I have seen a Chinese mandarin with finger-nails three and four inches in length.  They are very particular about preserving that very unsightly mark of their nobility.  The whole thing simply means that the Chinese woman with the small foot is differentiated from and segregated from the labouring classes.  Similarly with the mandarin whose finger-nails are allowed to grow.  It goes without saying that the woman with the clubbed foot and the man who has devoted the whole of his life to preserving his finger-nails cannot have done much labouring work.</P>
    <P>To go back to the Brehon laws, the principles embodied in them are incorporated in the judicial systems of every civilised country.  Any particular style of apparel designed at that time and in keeping with the dignity of the law and its administration should be good enough for us to-day.  Changes have taken place in the interval through the alteration of the laws under an alien system.  These changes were forced upon us and the costumes were adapted accordingly.  I do not think any Irishman will stand up here to-day, consistently with his professions as an Irishman, and cast any reflection or ridicule on the costume that dignified the judges under the Brehon laws.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats is no doubt artistic in temperament.  We heard him making the statement that the costumes now suggested and the head-gear now suggested are essentially an improvement from an artistic point of view upon our present style of dress.  There is nothing contended otherwise.  We are here to try to get away from all that the wig and gown, in relation to the dispensation of law in this country, are associated with.  We are here to make a break-away, as it were.  We are entitled to do that by the freedom which we have won.  We are here to remedy <Col N="1051" /> what we considered wrong in the past and to do away with every symbol that would bring things of the past fresh to our memories.  That is one of the objects of the amendment we are discussing.</P>
    <P>Law is one thing; the administration of the law is another thing.  We have never found fault with the laws of this country; if we have it was only in a relative sense.  We have had very good reason to find fault with the administration of the laws.  Even very good laws could be administered harshly amongst the people.  There are many bitter memories and reminiscences, and I think it will have a very good effect on the nation as a whole, and particularly on people who seek justice in our courts, if we do what we can to obliterate them.  In my opinion it will have a very good effect if people when they enter our courts are not met with the old trappings that they are so familiar with and which in their minds are not associated with the dispensation of justice but with the dispensation of laws sometimes misinterpreted and strained against them.  When they enter these courts, as perforce they must, let it be in a different atmosphere, and that altered atmosphere will give them an assurance that the law will be dispensed in a way different from the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very strongly opposed to this amendment by Senator Yeats, for what are largely prosaic reasons.  The Rule-making Committee who framed this rule consisted very largely of members of the Bench. Every member of the Bench&mdash;every member of the High Court and Supreme Court Bench&mdash;was a member of that Committee, and by an overwhelming majority of the judges of the two courts they framed this rule concerning the costume described in the rule.  I am very strongly of opinion that where the great majority of the judges themselves have recommended this rule their decision ought not to be interfered with.  They are the people who ought to have the decision as to how they are to be dressed.  After all they are the people who have to work in <Col N="1052" /> these places, and surely they are the people whose opinion on a matter like this ought to be given due weight.</P>
      <P>There is another reason for the wig and gown.  The wig and gown are a sign, a mark, a very peculiar characteristic of our judiciary.  I do not mean exclusively the Free State judiciary, but the judiciary in every country whose judicial system is founded on the English system.  Our judges, unlike the judges in France and Germany and every Continental country I know of, are not officials. The judges in France and Germany are, and always have been, officials and have risen to the Bench as officials. Our judges never cease to be members of the Bar, and the wig and gown are a valuable mark of that characteristic of our Bench.  They are still members of the Bar.  Even when they reach the Bench they recognise that, and I myself would be very sorry if this mark of the intimate connection between the Bench and Bar of this country were to disappear.</P>
      <P>Senator Gogarty has told you that the wig and gown in this country were associated with the oppression and the maladministration of the law in this country when we were not governing ourselves.  They have another association than that.  The wig and gown were the costume that was worn by O'Connell and Curran and by members of my profession who, in every generation, have stood up to defend personal liberty and liberty of speech in this country.</P>

      <P>I have not very much to add to the discussion that has taken place.  Rule 30 as it stands is a rule that was submitted to me by the majority of the Rule-making Committee&mdash;a very substantial majority, as Senator Brown has said.  I did not see any sufficient reason to join issue with the Committee with regard to that rule. One felt here, in listening to the discussion, the truth of the tag, <i>de gustibus non est disputandum.</i>  I think Senator Yeats with his high aesthetics, and Senator Keane with his crusted Toryism, and all the other contributions, have left us much where we were.  You come back to the root fact that the men <Col N="1053" /> who have got to wear these costumes, the men who have got to practice daily in these courts&mdash;and I would put it as high as 95 per cent. of the legal profession, even of the barristers themselves &mdash;object to a change.  The motto of the King's Inns <i>nollumus mutari</i>, seems to have prevailed in the matter, and neither I nor any member of the Government has a sufficiently strong feeling in this point to induce us to run counter to the wishes of the judges whom we ourselves have appointed, and 95 per cent of the practising barristers.  As far as I am concerned, that is my position with regard to Rule 30.  If there is to be a change, if a strong volume of opinion grows at the Bar in favour of an alteration in the costume, that would create a different situation.  If judges who desire a change in the costume come along the costume then can be easily changed. But to set out in matters of this kind that judges or barristers are to conform to a costume which they do not wish and to deprive them of a costume which they apparently do wish to retain, is something that the Government was not prepared to enter on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That position may be criticised.  On the other hand, I suggest that it will be very widely understood and appreciated. There is really no question of national sentiment, as I see it, involved. There is certainly no question of principle involved.  It is advisable that judges administering the law daily in the courts should have calm and easy minds, and if they feel they would not have calm and easy minds, in a costume other than that which they at present wear, well we must only accept it like that.  The one definite view I have about the matter is that some form of costume is eminently desirable.  The judge administering in mufti is an anomaly I do not like to contemplate. This is perhaps one of the last countries that could afford to dispense with ceremonial in the matter of the administration of its law.  In the matter of the administration of the law I think it right and proper that there should be ceremonial, and that there should be a costume.  That being so, the only question was whether there should be a change.  We need not go into the <Col N="1054" /> alternatives.  The alternatives are wide. It is true, I understand, that certain designs were put forward in a tentative way.  I have not seen these designs. The first question was: &ldquo;Was there to be a departure from the wig and gown as heretofore worn?&rdquo;  The Rule-making Committee, by an overwhelming majority, expressed their reluctance to any such departure.  The Government accept that.  I accept it.  I did not attempt to interfere with Rule 30 in any way.  If the Seanad wishes it can, of course, do that, but the Dáil has not done it.  If you consider that there is a principle at stake which warrants your imposing on the judges of your High Court and Supreme Court a form of costume which they did not desire&mdash;if you consider that there is a principle at stake which demands that you should deprive them of the costume which they apparently desire to maintain, then this rule must be rejected.  I do not recommend its rejection.  On the contrary, I submit this rule to you with the others as rules that have come along to me from the Committee and which I do not see sufficient reason to alter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been very much interested in the various rules that are put before us, and it occurred to me that the matter of the evolution of the judge's costume was properly intended to affect the public rather than that it should coincide with the æsthetic desire of the judges.  That is really the point of view that I and others would take.  If really the costume of the judge is designed not so much to impress himself but to impress the people who attend the court, then it is not, to my mind, the opinion of the judges themselves we should be considering in this matter of costume but the opinions of the people.  It is not a question of whether the judges like the costume but whether the costume to be worn by the judge is likely to influence the people before whom the judge is acting and administering the law, and whether the design of dress will influence the people in their respect for the law or will give any weight to his decision because a certain costume A is better than a certain <Col N="1055" /> costume B.  I do think that the argument could be used that as we in this country are a new country, the people will have sympathy with the design which they know is native to the country; they will have sympathy with a costume designed by an Irishman, the materials thereof being woven in the country, and the whole paraphernalia of the office connected intimately with the people.  Whether that is likely to influence them more than a costume handed down to them as the supreme embodiment of a law which they did not respect is a matter for the consideration of the Seanad.  Is the costume to be worn by the judge, as is suggested here, to embellish his personal appearance, or is it to be worn to give the people for whom the law is administered an impression of respect and, even, of awe?  At any rate, I think the costume ought to be one which would influence the minds of the people, rather than conform with the æsthetic wishes of the judge.  For that reason I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>We have had an interesting, amusing, and, very largely, irrelevant discussion.  I will endeavour not to add to the length of the discussion, so far as its irrelevancy is concerned. I think it is unwise and, in fact, a great mistake, if it be finally decided that the wig and gown should be retained, to suggest that in doing so you are suggesting to the people, or that there is any kind of support here for suggesting to them, that the laws administered are not the laws which the Oireachtas makes and are not Irish laws.  I think that is a dangerous argument and I am sorry it should have been used.  As to myself, I am not one of those who admire the wig and gown.  They never appealed to me. I think that some of Senator Yeats's arguments are good, but I do not view the matter from the standpoint as to whether I like the wig and gown, or any other proposal, but from this standpoint, namely: we have here proposed Rules of Court as made by the responsible Committee; they have the sanction of the Government, and they have to be approved by both Houses. Is this the kind of matter in which the <Col N="1056" /> Seanad should interfere?  I do not think so.  My view is that, having been sanctioned by the Committee and having the support of the Government, this matter is not one of personal choice. If I believed, with some Senators, that this is a matter of importance, I should agree to take it on the lines of Senator Yeats, but I feel that it is not a matter in which we should interfere, and, for that reason, I shall not support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Douglas that this is not a question in which the House can usefully interfere, at all events, at present. What governs my opinion is the view taken by the gentlemen who preside over the courts, and by those who plead in the courts, and if I find the great majority of them, as I do, approving of the existing costume, it is quite sufficient reason for me for supporting them in their opinion.  The question has been raised that any change in the dress of our judges and barristers would be an interference with a very ancient tradition.  That argument has no weight with me.  I do not suppose that the dress of our judges and lawyers could chronologically go back very far.  It seems to me that the wigs worn in our courts are, more or less, of the type of the Williamite wig.  If that kind of wig offends anybody it may be suggested that they might wear Jacobite wigs, which might, perhaps, be higher in front and longer in the tail.  That is the amount of importance which I attach to the historic argument. I would like to see our judges differently attired, and our officials differently uniformed from those across the water; not that any change in dress is going to make any difference to our opinions or our natures, but it seems to me that it may be an illustration of the fact that we have, to a certain extent, come into our own at last.  It may be that an artistic arrangement could be made of the dress of an Irish Brehon.  I have seen gentlemen in such dress and they certainly were picturesque, but I do not know if that costume would suit draughty courts.  The question, to my mind, is really not a serious issue in contradistinction <Col N="1057" /> to the fact that ninety-five per cent., as the Minister for Justice reminded us, of the gentlemen administering the law are desirous of retaining their present costume.  That costume can always be changed.</P>
      <P>There is no section of the community which is more closely in touch with the public opinion of the country&mdash;they perambulate round the country and they know the opinions and views of the people&mdash;than members of the legal profession.  If the country desires to see its lawyers and judges habited differently, then these lawyers and judges would be the first to know it and they would be the first to move in the matter.  At the present moment I think our laws are administered fairly and equitably by judges, habited as they are, and at the same time we have these judges and lawyers administering the laws we make ourselves.</P>

      <P>If we assume for a moment that this is a desirable thing, that it is possible to put the judges into costumes that are appropriate to the country, do you think that a very old man, grown old in the use of quite a different costume, would ever accept the change?  Never.  Impossible. If the change is desirable&mdash; there is no way out of it&mdash;the change would have to be imposed on the judges.  If I were an old judge, who wore a wig and gown all my life, I should hate to change it.  I should be <Col N="1058" /> furious if any man proposed it, although it might be most desirable to make a change.  It is not an unimportant thing we are discussing.  If we were discussing here to-day whether the Supreme Court should meet in a very imposing building, or in a building which seemed to be unworthy of the nation, we would not think it unimportant to debate the question.  I suggest to you that the question of the costume in which the judge gives his decision is of greater importance than the building in which he gives it.  Are we to allow very old men, for whom we have the greatest respect, to settle the tradition of this country for centuries, because it will be for centuries if now at a time of revolution when we have a chance, we do not create a tradition.  Now is our opportunity.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Sir John Keane for his appropriate and friendly quotations from myself.  I would like to say that when I talked of this &ldquo;fool-driven land&rdquo;&mdash;a good many years ago now&mdash; I meant that it was fool-driven in certain matters&mdash;poetry and the theatre&mdash; matters in which I felt I had a greater right to an opinion than I have in politics.  Senator Sir John Keane described how a certain judge's cap&mdash;a biretta he called it&mdash;looked very inappropriate, if worn by a red-haired or a brown-haired man.  I would suggest to him that when you see red or brown hair coming from under a grey wig it looks still more inappropriate.</P>

      <P>The Minister has suggested, as a matter of convenience, in view of what has transpired with regard to the Circuit Court Rules, that the District Court Rules be taken up now.  I do not object to that if I have any sort of assurance that the debate on them is not likely to be protracted. If it is, I would rather adhere to the Order Paper, because I have a statement to make which I regard with considerable importance with respect to the position the House is in as to these Circuit Court Rules.  I do not want to make that statement in a perfunctory way, because I will be compelled to deal with the matter at some length. The matter is a very important one to me as affecting the position of this House in reference to these Circuit Court Rules.  If Senators think that the District Court Rules are not likely to lead to a protracted discussion, we should convenience the Minister and dispose of them now.  I can make no promise, of course, with regard to that. Perhaps it is only fair that I should say that the Committee, so far as they had time or opportunity, which was of <Col N="1060" /> the briefest kind, to consider these District Court Rules, were of opinion that, on the whole, they were excellently drafted, and that, with the exception of the rules to which they take exception, they were unobjectionable, and were admirably adapted to all the purposes for which they were intended. That being the opinion of the Committee, I think it is only fair that I should state it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to go very briefly through the rules to which the Committee objected, and to state very shortly the reasons for their objection. The first of the District Court Rules objected to was Rule 20.  It is objected to more or less because it was not quite understood.  The rule must be taken in connection with Rule 77.  Each of these rules prescribes certain fees which are payable for the service of a document in connection with this court. Rule 20 apparently is limited to service by a summons-server appointed under these rules.  Rule 77 states that the fee payable &ldquo;to any summons-server in respect of the service of any document in connection with civil proceedings in the District Court shall be 1/6.&rdquo; Now, the fees prescribed by Rule 20 for the summons-server, who is to serve a summons which apparently is a document and may be connected with civil proceedings, vary according to the distance that he has to go.  He gets 1/6 if the distance does not exceed two miles, 2/- for a distance under three <Col N="1061" /> miles, and so on up to 5s. which he gets if the distance exceeds five miles.  What struck the Committee was the variance between the amount payable for the service of these documents.  I thought, perhaps, Rule 20 only applied to the service by the summons-server of a summons in a criminal matter, but apparently that is not so, because if you look at Rule 14: &ldquo;In cases of offences prosecuted by the Gárda Síochána or by a Minister or by any Department of State or by the Attorney-General of Saorstát Eireann, the summons shall be served by a member of the Gárda Síochána or other person authorised by statute, but in all other cases it shall be served by an appropriate summons-server save when the Justice issuing same shall otherwise so direct.&rdquo;  What the Committee felt was that there was an apparent inconsistency between the scale of service, and they would very much like to have that explained.  I do not know whether it would be better to take these rules separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to take them separately.  I might mention, as Chairman of this Committee, that the contrast between Rule 20 and Rule 77 that troubled us so much was this: that while service for every document under Rule 77 is to be paid for at a uniform fee of 1/6, there is a graduated scale under Rule 20 which runs from 1/6 to 5/-.  I find it impossible to understand that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>If Rule 77 had read as follows it would have been quite easy to understand it:&mdash;&ldquo;Any summons-server in respect of the service of any document other than a summons.&rdquo; That probably was what was intended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Rule 77 prescribes a flat rate of 1/6 as the service fee in the case of civil proceedings.  Under the Petty Sessions Clerks and Fines Act of 1878 a scale of fees was prescribed for summons servers in respect of the service of summonses in the case of summary jurisdiction.  That scale depended, as the scale under Rule 20 does, on the distance travelled by the summons-server.  When the District Court was constituted we found it difficult&mdash;impossible in fact&mdash;to secure people who would serve the summonses of the court.  Accordingly, the former scale of fees for service was substantially increased.  As the costs in summary cases are at the discretion of the justice, it was thought that this scale of fees for service could, with advantage, be continued.  People serving the summonses of the Court have become accustomed to receiving a fee which depends on the distance they have to travel.  It was thought that if the scale was discontinued it might again become difficult to obtain summons servers.  Under Rule 77 a flat rate for service fees was struck because a settled amount for costs, including outlay, is prescribed in respect of civil proceedings, and it was not considered desirable to have the amount of costs varying by reason of the distance which the summons server had to travel in any case.</P>

Nor have we any reason to quarrel with the amount here, save in the light that is thrown upon it by the other rule, Rule 77, because if he can get the summons-server to serve, no matter how far he has got to go, the whole length of a district, if necessary, a civil document for eighteen pence, why is he for a less distance to get half-a-crown or three shillings because the document happens to be a criminal document?</P>

      <P>You have to look at the antecedents of the District Court and to advert to the fact that it had at the beginning the jurisdiction which was only a jurisdiction inherited from the Justices of the Peace in the Petty Sessions Court.  Then under the Courts of Justice Act wider jurisdiction was extended to it in recognition of the fact that the men adjudicating in the District Court were professional men, barristers and solicitors, and not the <Col N="1067" /> honorary magistrates of the past. There was always a difference in the Petty Sessions Court for distance as to the amount paid to the summons-server, and in the County Court there was a fixed scale.  We found it necessary to increase, when the District Court was established, the scale paid for distance to summons-servers.  But it is not proposed, in connection with the jurisdiction that it transferred or shifted from the County Court of the past, to have any departure from the fixed fee of 1/6.  We will have to regard for certain purposes these two jurisdictions as distinct.  For instance, in every court area the justice will administer his summary jurisdiction in every place where he holds a court, but not in every court area will the civil jurisdiction be exercised.  We will have, and we may under the rules, to set aside certain places where the extended jurisdiction transferred from the County Court will be exercised by the justice.</P>

      <P>The next is Rule 24; this deals with the expenses of witnesses: &ldquo;In all cases of summary jurisdiction the justice by whom any order for payment of money, not being in the nature of a penalty for an offence, shall be made, may order the party at whose instance any witness shall have been summoned to pay to such witness such sum, not exceeding one guinea as to such justice shall seem fit, for his expenses or loss of time for each day of attending to give evidence, and in default of payment thereof at such time as such justice shall appoint, he may issue a warrant to levy the amount thereof by distress of the goods of such party.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is quite right that a witness who is summoned to the District Court and loses his day's work or has to go to considerable expense in getting there, should be paid his witness's expense, and that they should be limited in the District Court, which is a small court, to a guinea.  But why it should only apply to cases where there is an order for the payment of money I do not know.  If a case is dismissed why should not the poor witness get his money for expenses just as well as if the case was won?  This can only apply to a small class of cases where the jurisdiction was transferred from the old Justices of the Peace to this court.</P>

Rule 36 applies to criminal cases in which the jurisdiction is conferred upon justices by paragraph (b) of Section 77 of the Courts of Justice Act of 1924.  It is a higher jurisdiction, for more serious crime. &ldquo;The justice, if he be satisfied at any time during the hearing that the evidence establishes a minor offence, fit to be tried summarily, shall say to the accused: &lsquo;Do you object to being tried summarily or do you wish to be tried by a judge and jury?&rsquo;  Upon signifying that he has no objection to being tried summarily the justice may hear and determine the case.&rdquo;  The Committee thought the alternative was not given to him expressly and that it should be given to him in this way: &ldquo;Do you wish to be tried summarily or do you wish to be tried by a judge and jury?&rdquo;  It should be put to him as an alternative in that express way.

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that Rule 93 be not agreed to.  Rule 93 deals with witnesses' expenses.  It gives the justices an unlimited power to grant witnesses' expenses.  In the County Court and the High Court there is a scale of witnesses' expenses for certain classes of witnesses.  The Committee suggest that there ought to be a scale of witnesses' expenses in addition to a scale of costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this the District Justice has power to award witnesses' expenses up to any amount. That is a power no other judge has. The Circuit Judge or the High Court Judge has not got it.  They are limited by a scale according to the man's position in life, his occupation, and so on. There is no reason, that we could see, why that should not apply here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>In the County Court there was a limit of £5.  Only £5 could be allowed to any one witness. I think it was found that £5 was, in fact, utterly inadequate.  Take the case of a witness having to be brought from anywhere in England to give evidence in a case.  It does not cover his expenses, and it was considered it might well be left within the discretion of the justice to fix an amount in respect of the witness.  I simply put it to Senators that the justice can be trusted to fix an amount which is fair and reasonable and which will recoup witnesses for any out-of-pocket expenses they have to incur by having to attend at <Col N="1076" /> court.  It is pointed out that these expenses have been regulated by scale. If it can be shown that the scale was found much too tight a fit and not sufficient, that this is intended to meet the cases of witnesses attending from long distances, and so on, then I think the scale goes, and the case for the discretion of the presiding justice might be considered to be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That is done away with by the Circuit Court Rules. In the High Court the scale provides for a man coming from London or Scotland, and in the District Court the same could be done.  In my knowledge and experience, the most extravagant demands were often put forward for witnesses' expenses.  They practically swamped the whole benefit of the decree, so that I think it is a mistake to give the justices absolutely unlimited discretion.  I cannot see why there should not be a graduated scale as in the High Courts.  It would be a tremendous advantage to a justice to have a scale, because, if extravagant demands were made, he could say: &ldquo;They are outside the scale and I can only award you so much.&rdquo;  It is not a matter of very great importance and, if the Minister wishes, I would not ask the Seanad to press it.  It seems to us that it might possibly lead to grave abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>Rule 151 is the next. This is a rule which applies to the licensing jurisdiction which has been transferred to the District Court.  Rule 149 provides for what is known as an interim transfer enabling a person after the death of somebody who has been the licensed person, to carry on, or in the case where a public-house has been sold and where the conveyance has not been yet executed.  It enables the person who represents the deceased person or the person who has got the right to the conveyance of the public-house to go into the Courts of Justice and get what is called a temporary transfer of the licence without having the necessary documents.  A person dies who has made a will and it takes some time to prove that will.  There may be a dispute over it.  In a case where no will has been made, administration has to be taken out, and in such cases it is important that the business should be carried on, and that the person interested should have some protection from the court to carry it on.  Rule 151 has this, &ldquo;Upon such application being made, a justice in the event of the applicant being unable to produce the original probate, grant of administration, conveyance or transfer, as the case may be, upon which he relies, may grant such application subject to the subsequent production of such probate, grant of administration, conveyance or transfer, as the case may be.&rdquo;  Now, the objection which the Committee saw to that rule was this: it did not prescribe any time limit for the production of the documents.  It would be quite possible if this application for a temporary transfer or a temporary licence was <Col N="1083" /> made in the month of October that the business might be carried on for a full twelve months without the document being produced, and the man carrying it on might not have any real right to do so.  The annual licensing Sessions come on in October, and the temporary transfer that you get under Rule 149 carries you on to the annual licensing Sessions.  It seemed to the Committee to be a wrong and dangerous thing to give this unlimited right to the court to give this temporary licence without the production of this administration of conveyance, or probate, or whatever it was, without some reasonable limit of time within which it should be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the rule, I think, is to meet the case that in many districts the court is only a monthly court.  The justice sits once a month.  The rule was intended to cover the case where although the applicant could not produce his document or title at a particular sitting of the court he might be able to produce it in a few days or weeks.  And on the production of the document to the clerk he could then obtain the written transfer which the justice had made. Otherwise he would have to wait and keep his premises closed for a month until the next sitting of the justice in that particular court.  What the rule enables the justice to do is formally to grant the order in open court and to attach a condition that the probate or other document of title should be produced subsequently.  Now take it the justice is present, and will not be present again for a month.  This rule would enable him to grant the order and attach a condition subsequently, on compliance with which he would receive from the clerk the written transfer which the judge had made in court. I do not think there is the danger which the Senator suggests of a man being enabled to go on for a year or to go very far at all beyond the next court day carrying on a trade or business that he was not legally entitled to carry on.  I think this is simply in recognition of the infrequent sittings in certain areas, and the justice should have power to grant a transfer conditional <Col N="1084" /> on the proof being produced to the clerk that the transfer will be given to him.</P>

      <P>The next rule is Rule <Col N="1085" /> 171.  This is with reference to the power of the justice to state a case. The justice has power to state a case under one of the sections of the Courts of Justice Act.  I think under the Courts of Justice Act his refusal to state a case, if he made an order, would give a right of appeal. Rule 171 is taken verbatim from Section 4 of the Act of 1857, which gives power to justices to state a case, but by the next section, Section 5 of that Act, if a justice refused to state a case there was an appeal to the High Court. I do not see why, if they put in Section 4, they should not have put in Section 5.</P>

It would convey the impression, I think, that they have an absolute discretion as to whether they should grant or refuse a case stated, and that discretion was only limited by the power conferred on the Minister of State.  I think the rules are better without it.  Unless you are advised there is some real object to be gained by keeping it in, I would recommend the House to reject it.</P>

The rule would be all right if the concluding words were omitted.</P>

      <P>It gives the justice power in every case to determine what is a verbal or technical error, and then it goes on to say: &ldquo;every error or mistake which is not calculated to mislead the opposite party shall be deemed to be merely verbal or technical.&rdquo;  Therefore the justice has power to decide that it is not material, although it is proved to be calculated to mislead the opposite party.  We do not think that the District Justice should have any power to amend an error if he were satisfied that it was calculated to mislead the opposite party.</P>

He must have discretion in cases which have a tendency to mislead.  It is laid down broadly that every error or mistake which is not calculated to mislead must be deemed to be verbal or technical.

      <P>The procedure is the same as it was.  A justice, under the rule, is enabled to close his court. Discretion is given.  In fact and in practice, that discretion is only exercised in sexual cases of a revolting nature where it is not considered in the public interest that there should be publicity.  Of course, if there was any tendency to use it otherwise than in eminently proper cases, it would be a case for alteration.  You have either to define strictly the cases in which the court may be closed or leave a general discretion, in full confidence that it will be exercised properly by the justice.</P>

      <P>Then I will not pursue the matter further.  My next point is in regard to Rule 11.  There is a proviso in paragraph (a) by which a Peace Commissioner, in making a remand, shall remand to the next District Court of the court area in which he is then sitting.  Take the case of a man who is remanded, say, the day after the court has sat and there remained a month before the next court.  That means that he would be confined, say, in the county gaol on remand for three or four weeks, and he would have no remedy except to apply to the Supreme Court for bail.  A case lately came to my notice in which a farmer was arrested for abusive language and the most trivial assault.  He was incarcerated in Cork for three weeks, although on trial he was only fined £3, a conviction which was quashed on appeal.</P>

      <P>I must have been misled, and I withdraw the objection. In Rule 15, it is set out that the service of the summons must be at least seven days before the trial.  My first point is that it is not necessary to allow seven days for the service of a summons. Four would be sufficient.  My second point is in connection with the provisions directing that the summons must be served upon the person to whom it is directed or by leaving a copy for him with the husband, wife, child, father, mother, brother, sister or any other relation, not being under 16 <Col N="1091" /> years of age.  Judges have held that the provision, &ldquo;not being under 16 years of age,&rdquo; applies to a man's wife, and unless the summons server sets out that a wife with whom he has served a summons is over 16 years of age, the service may be held to be bad.  There was one case where a judge would not give a decree because the summons server did not set out that the wife was over 16 years of age.</P>

      <P>If that is so, I am wrongly advised.  I beg to withdraw my objection to the rule.  In regard to Rule 182, I have an objection, on a more practical point&mdash;to allowing an hour for an adjournment if the justice does not turn up.  I have heard complaints in more than one case where District Justices are rather inclined&mdash;I am not making general charges at all&mdash; to regard this as an hour of grace. Solicitors have been complaining about this.  In one case I had complaints from solicitors that they were kept hanging about waiting for the District Justice to turn up.  I gave the Minister particulars of that actual case.  The complaints I received, however, were not confined to that one case.  The District Justices in some cases arrive three-quarters of an hour late and after a very short time adjourn the court for <Col N="1094" /> lunch.  The court resumes again at 3 o'clock, and in some cases drags on with the aid of candle light.  I am not putting forward an exaggerated case, because this has actually occurred.  I ask is it necessary to allow an hour as the standing practice for the adjournment. Could not the period be a half-hour? A solicitor who complained to me suggested that a quarter of an hour would be ample time to allow.  I think that an hour is too long.  Solicitors are very busy men and cannot afford to be kept hanging about for an hour waiting for the District Justice.</P>

      <P>I think that Senator Brown has pointed out that the rule is simply inserted to meet the case of a justice who meets with a mishap on his way to the court, and who because of that might be late.  If that occurred and that he did not arrive within an hour, then there is the direction for the clerk to adjourn the court.  The only way that Senators can deal with abuses is to see that they reach the proper quarter when notice will be taken of them.  I think this is a rule that can be justified by the circumstances of the time and the large areas which the District Justices have to cover.</P>

If witnesses were delayed for an hour they might have something to say about it.  I think, however, if the District Justice developed that as a habit he would get a very bad reputation.  I do not think such a thing as that could last very long.  As between an hour and a half-hour, the difference, I think, is not of sufficient importance to ask the Seanad to hold up this rule.</P>

      <P>No, the Minister's point is that a distinction is made between them, that this rule does two things: it gives power to award witnesses' expenses and it gives a second power, namely, to award costs.  The costs are to be in accordance with the scale, and the witnesses' expenses are not.  That was the objection taken to them.  The Minister apparently is under the impression that unless they have the power to award costs given by that rule they have not got it anywhere else, and the curious thing is that all the antecedent rules include the question of costs.</P>

      <P>I have a more far-reaching suggestion to make.  I am advised, whatever the result, to make a last-minute plea to the Seanad as to the resolution passed in regard to these rules.  There is exception taken to eight rules.  To about three of these I think the objection is not very strongly held, and in connection with five or six there is a definite and emphatic objection. I would undertake to adopt the Seanad's point of view and to use such influence as I can muster with the Committee to get them to annul these <Col N="1100" /> rules, and either to leave them out entirely or to bring up other rules based on the views that have been expressed here to-day, but if I can I would be very anxious to secure a general resolution of approval of the rules.  When eminent legal authorities can differ on the point there does seem to be very real doubt as to whether the effect of the elimination or the disapproval of certain rules is not to invalidate the entire set of rules, whether it is not like the Ten Commandments where in offending in one you offend in all.</P>
      <P>The Attorney-General, so far as he has been able to examine the question, is certainly of opinion these rules should be one body of rules, and I approached the Dáil and the Seanad, and I sought by resolution to obtain approval of these rules as a body.  He feels if I fail in respect of certain rules that the rules fall as a whole.  I always contemplated that the rules should be considered in the greatest detail, one by one, but my view of what must happen is that the resolution of approval would have to be rejected for reasons stated, these reasons being based quite definitely on an objection to certain of the rules.  But I thought, and have been advised, that the rules stood or fell as a whole.  Now, if there is even a substantial doubt about that, clearly the result of the deletion to-day of these six or seven rules would be that the District Court would be without rules, perhaps until January or February next.  On the other hand, if the Seanad were willing to pass a general resolution of approval of the rules, I give the most definite and binding promise that I would approach the Committee, adopting fully the Seanad's point of view of these eight rules, and endeavour to secure either their complete annulment or their alteration to meet the opinions that are held here with regard to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how we can possibly pass a resolution approving of these rules as they stand in view of the fact that we have already rejected eight of them.  I am <Col N="1101" /> very anxious to facilitate and to help on the business of the Government in any way I can, but there is a limit, and I would much rather see the country put to the inconvenience&mdash; which is really not very great&mdash;of carrying on for another few months without these rules, than that we should surrender our constitutional rights and privileges in a matter of this kind.  The Circuit Court Rules have to be hung up.  I do not believe that the hanging up of them will cause inconvenience to anybody, and in view of the fact that the District Courts have been going on for two or three years without these rules surely no catastrophe will happen if they have to do so for another few months.  I really cannot accept that proposition. If I entertained any doubt whatever as to the soundness of the ruling I have given on this matter on my responsibility as Chairman&mdash;and when I say this I desire to speak with all respect of the opinion of the Attorney-General, whose opinion I very highly value&mdash;it might be different, but I must say on this particular matter that I feel absolutely free from any doubt.  One's common-sense is the best judge, and it would be a revolting proposition to common-sense to say that in the Circuit Court Rules, which number 500, if one, by a clerical error, by a misprint or by a slip on the part of the draftsman, expressed the contrary to what is intended and we reject it, as we would be bound to do, the whole 499 of these rules go with it.  To my mind the thing is not really capable of being argued.  I think I ought to read the statement made by Sir Lonsdale Webster, K.C.B., who has been Chief Clerk in the House of Commons for a good many years.  The question he was asked was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Whether, in accordance with British practice a motion to approve the Rules of Court, pursuant to Section 101 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, would be open to amendment by way of leaving out a specified Rule or Rules, or whether it would be incumbent on the Seanad to approve such Rules <i>in globo</i>?</P>
      <P>This is his answer:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My answer to Mr. O'Sullivan's <Col N="1102" /> question would be that a motion to approve a set of rules would be open to amendment by way of leaving out a specified rule or rules.  The effect of an amendment or amendments being agreed to would be that the final question would be for approval of the rules, other than those omitted by amendment or amendments.</P>
    <P>I have only seen this for the first time to-day, but that is the course that commended itself to me and that a week ago I advised the Seanad to carry out.  I cannot, therefore, ask the Seanad to pass a resolution approving of a set of rules some eight of which have already been rejected.  If I am right, no harm is done by rejecting these eight rules, because they can avail of the remainder and they can go on with them at once.</P>

      <P>But no motion was made for adjourning the consideration of them, as I understand.  That does not concern us.  I am only pointing out that I do not think we could leave them in that position.  We must either, when these rules are before us, approve of them in whole or in part, or we must adjourn consideration of them.  We cannot break away to-day, not meet again for three months, and say nothing about these Circuit Court Rules.  I intended to deal with that later on.  But what I wanted to explain to the House is the position in which we have been placed with regard to these rules.  The House may recollect that on last Wednesday fortnight I suggested to them that they ought to refer these rules to a small committee for consideration and report. At that time I was under the impression that these rules had been passed, were in form to be presented, and had, in fact, been presented in the proper form to the Seanad.  But the Minister cleared that up later in the day and told us that the Circuit Rules had not yet been ratified, either by the Rule-making Authority or by him, but he told us that they would be ratified and in possession of the Seanad by Friday. Accordingly the Committee was appointed, but these Circuit Rules were not, in fact, ratified until the following Tuesday, and they were not circulated until Tuesday night.  Consequently your Committee were not authorised and had no right to touch them, because they had not been presented to the Seanad until the following Tuesday night.  Your Committee only got them on the Wednesday morning&mdash;a week ago&mdash;and therefore they were left one week to consider 500 rules.  We went through them as well as we could, and we found fault with and disapproved of a substantial number&mdash;I think twenty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> But I want to say that the Committee having broken up on the Friday, I became very anxious, because it occurred to me that these rules, taken as a whole, in so far as they introduced for the first time into the Circuit Court the whole machinery of the High Court, are going to add enormously to the time that these cases would take in the Circuit Courts and to the expense.  I felt so concerned that I tried to get into touch with the Committee to get them to meet again.  That was not possible, but I was able to get into touch with Senator Brown.  After discussion he came to the same conclusion as I had come to, that we ought to ask this House to be very slow, indeed, before it sanctioned this remarkable revolution in County Court practice.</P>
    <P>I thought it only fair then to let the Minister know this, and, on Monday, I wrote telling him that Senator Brown and I had come to the conclusion that we would ask this House not to take these rules up now, but to adjourn the consideration of them&mdash;that is, the consideration of such rules as the Committee had not knocked out&mdash;until after the Recess.  We found that manifestly necessary because we had not really thoroughly examined the rules in Committee.  We could not do so. We had not time to examine these 500 rules.  We got them on Wednesday morning; we had seven days to do the work and we could not do it in the time.  We were not in the position to do so, and we came to the conclusion to recommend the disallowance of about thirty of these rules.  But subsequently, having investigated the whole thing and finding that these rules brought in, for the first time, this strong revolution of applying in the County Court the whole paraphernalia and machinery of the High Courts, we came to the conclusion that we ought to advise this House to adjourn the consideration of them over the Recess. That being so, I found that on the Tuesday the same view was apparently taken by some Deputies in the Dáil, and that, through the leader of the Labour Party, a motion was made to that effect based upon the necessity of giving further time and further consideration <Col N="1105" /> to this very big and sweeping change.  That motion was fully debated, and the Minister, in defence to what was said there&mdash;and I acknowledge his courtesy in this matter&mdash;in deference, also, to a communication, he said, as to the views of certain Senators, withdrew his motion for approval of the Circuit Court Rules, and the Deputy who moved their rejection withdrew his motion, and the matter was left there.  That is to say, neither were the rules approved nor disapproved.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can leave the rules in that position.  I think it is our duty either to approve, or disapprove, or to adjourn and postpone the consideration of these rules.  We cannot approve of them as long as the report of the Committee stands, because we recommend the rejection of a substantial number of them.  But there is this to be said for the suggestion of disapproval of the rules <i>in globo</i> and rejecting them entirely: that an opportunity would then be given to the Rule-making Authority, between this and October, of bringing in a new set of rules in lieu of the rules to which we have already taken objection.  That would be one position. The other position would be to adjourn the consideration of those rules altogether until November.  In my opinion that is the wisest and safest course, and for this obvious reason: If we were to disapprove of the rules <i>in globo</i>, it is quite true it would give an opportunity to the Minister and the Rule-making Authority of framing a new set, if they so thought fit.  But they would be doing that in the dark as to what our objections were, and I do not think it would enable them to get them into shape any quicker.  I may say, for myself, and giving my opinion for what it is worth, I believe that if these rules in their present form, or anything like that, are adopted, that delays and expenses of proceedings in the Circuit Courts will be enormously increased.</P>
    <P>First I will deal with the question of delay.  The whole procedure of the High Court is carried on without hitch or delay, because the judges sit every day, in the same place, and every litigant who wants to make a motion or application is always certain to have a <Col N="1106" /> judge available, except during the long vacation.  But in the Circuit Courts some of the judges have six counties, and if all these applications are to be made, in every case which comes before them&mdash;application for discovery of documents, application for inspection, application for judgment, application for particulars&mdash;exactly on the lines of the High Court, then I assure the Minister he will find that he will have to have a separate judge for each county. It will not be a case of one judge for six counties.</P>
    <P>If these rules are adopted and are to be carried on applicable to their entire jurisdiction, it will be inevitable that the Minister will have to have a judge for each county.  But in addition there are some very grave objections not touched upon by our Committee.  We had not the time to get near them or to get to the root of them.</P>
    <P>At present the crying complaint is that in money demands the defendants invariably appeal, not because they have any case but because they want time.  Under the present practice there are appeals outstanding for hearing more than a year, and all that time the defendant had the benefit of the delay and the creditor is kept out of his money.  Now you are going to increase that if you enable those litigants, in all those cases, to go through the whole machinery and procedure of the High Courts of Justice.  The litigant will be able to keep the plaintiff out of his money for practically an incalculable amount of time.  In addition to that, if this procedure is carried out there will be of necessity, as I have said, not merely the requirement of appointing more judges, but there will be as well the necessity for having some provision made to reduce the number of those appeals.  I do urge upon the Minister and the Rule-making Authority to consider some very drastic proposal which will necessitate the plaintiff, or the defendant, as the case may be, making a substantial lodgment in court as a condition of his liberty to appeal.  I am talking now, of course, of simple contracts, cases for the recovery of debts, the recovery on promissory notes, recovery of shop accounts, and all cases of that kind, and the right of appeal <Col N="1107" /> should be saddled with strict necessity for lodging a substantial amount of the debt as security for the costs of the appeal.</P>
    <P>That is one matter.  The Committee were conscious that if they applied the machinery of the High Courts to all this litigation, they would swamp the court, and they sought to remedy that difficulty by Rule 155&mdash;that rule providing that in any case for a money demand or for damages not exceeding £50 the case should go to trial without pleadings.  Now, that, in my opinion, and my colleague agrees, is wholly illusory. £50 was the old jurisdiction of the County Court, but that was fixed nearly a century ago, and that £50 is certainly not equivalent to a sum of more than £100 to-day.  Yet they propose that in every case over £50 all this machinery of pleadings, affidavits, discovery of documents, motions for inspection, and motions for particulars is to be applicable to a case of a simple contract debt.  What we urge the Ministry and the Rule-making Authority to do is this: If they are going to apply the machinery of the High Court to the County Court at all, let them limit it to cases of contract exceeding £150, with a provision that in any case under it the judge, if satisfied that the importance of it so requires, may take it out of that limitation.  But that the rule should be that every case should be tried without pleadings, the exception being cases which are to be tried with pleadings.  We have the ordinary money debts, promissory notes, shop accounts, and all those things over £50, to which this machinery is to be applied. The old County Court had no pleadings, no motions for discovery, and I never heard anyone complain of their absence.  There are certain things they should have, powers of attachment, garnishee and interpleader powers, but these extra powers of supplying documents and particulars and of making affidavits of one kind or another are only going to heap up enormous costs and will impose on the Circuit Judges a task which they will be unable to discharge as long as they have their present Circuits to look after.  These applications have to be made without delay. They are no good if they are not <Col N="1108" /> made within a few days.  In County Monaghan the judge has four other counties to look after.  Some judges have six counties, some have less, and some have more.  The judge is away from Monaghan for three months. Where is the application to be made?</P>

      <P>My impression is that the application is not made either to the judge or the registrar; it is simply a question of notice from either party.  Rule 168 is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Each party shall, after the pleadings have been closed, and within seven days after receiving from the other party a notice requiring him to do so, deliver a schedule verified by the affidavit of the party specifying the books and documents in his possession or under his control which he intends to use in the action, or which may in any way relate to any matters in question in such action, and those privileged from diclosure under the law of evidence must be set out separately with the grounds of such privilege.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If he does not do it and if the man gets a thing which is defective, what is to happen?  What court is he to go to?  I am talking of the man who is bound to supply.  If he refuses or supplies a defective document what is the remedy and where is he to go for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, again, this motion for particulars. Where are they to be asked for? Is application to be made to the registrar? You will find that all those applications have to be made to the judge.  A motion for judgement has to be made to the judge.  Am I right in saying that this application to inspect documents is to be made to the court? I think I am right in that.  At any rate, it is brimful of applications that can only be made to the court itself.  My point is that you will have your courts <Col N="1109" /> sitting only three times in the year in the case of the Circuit Judges.  If you impose this High Court practice on certain judges, you will ultimately be coerced into having a Circuit Judge for every county in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter.  I am not mentioning this to score a point off the Minister.  Everybody knows quite well that the Minister has his hands chock full and that he cannot always speak with authority on those abstruse and difficult legal points.  I was startled to find that the Minister in defending the application of these principles of High Court practice to the Circuit Court did so on this ground: I will quote his own words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the facts proved before the Circuit Judge, his decision cannot be reversed on appeal, notwithstanding that the Court of Appeal might feel, were they entitled to try the case, that they would differ from his conclusion.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Not at all.  Let me quite definitely state that that quotation is inaccurate.  I did not use these words.  I did not say or wish to convey anything of the kind.  The point I made was this: that the appeal on notes from the Circuit Court is tending to become more and more an appeal on matters of law, and, less and less, an appeal on matters of fact.  I told the Dáil that I had noticed that the High Court Judges were taking the view that as between Witness A, who swore one thing, and Witness B, who swore something quite the contrary, if the Circuit Judge opted to place his credence in Witness A, the High Court Judges <Col N="1110" /> were not inclined to differ with him. They would simply say that the judge in the lower court had the witness before him, heard him, and that they did not propose to interfere.  I said that the tendency would be that appeals would become more and more appeals on questions of law and, less and less appeals on matters of fact, and, therefore, that the Dáil had to remember that they were dealing with a court with a jurisdiction as high as £300, and that that court, for all practical purposes, would be a final court save on matters of law.  I never said that a High Court Judge who felt that if he had tried the case himself he would certainly give one decision, would, despite that, uphold the decision of the lower court.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear that.  I was certain that there was some misunderstanding.  The statement in the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; went much further.  It stated that the Minister said that the judges had ruled, having regard to the terms of the section of the Act, that they were not in a position to reverse the Circuit Judge on questions of fact.  They put that statement into the mouth of the Minister. All I want to say is, if that is the idea any person has, be he judge or anyone else, it is entirely in the teeth of the Courts of Justice Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your statement.  I am referring to what you are reported to have said.  You are reported to have stated that the judges ruled that, by virtue of the wording of Section 61 of the Courts of Justice Act, they were precluded from reversing on questions of fact.  The opposite is the truth in the clearest and most emphatic way.  The section says that the High Court on appeal shall determine questions both of law and fact.  The section giving the right of appeal expressly confers it in respect of law or fact or either.  I have every reason to recollect that, because these words were suggested in Committee, when the Bill was going through this House.  They met <Col N="1111" /> with the full approval of the President and the Attorney-General of the day, and they were afterwards brought in on a Government amendment and inserted here on the Report Stage.  I have, therefore, every reason to remember them, and if there is one thing clear, beyond the possibility of mistake, it is that the judges of the High Court are not only entitled, but are bound in duty to reverse a decision of the Circuit Judge on a question of fact if they think it was wrong.  I do not say anything more about that.  I think that it would be very injurious if any impression to the contrary got abroad, and I was greatly startled by the statement put into the mouth of the Minister on the subject.  He has cleared that up and I am very glad of it.</P>
      <P>That brings us back to the question: What are we to do with these rules now, if anything?  My suggestion to the House would be simply to pass a resolution adjourning further consideration of the rules until we meet again in November, and referring back the report on the rules to the Committee for further consideration and report, because we have not had time to go into them, or to do justice to the terms of reference.  If the Minister thinks it would be any advantage to disapprove of them <i>in globo</i>, he can make his case for them, and I am sure the House will listen to it with all respect.  I do not think that would be the wisest thing now.</P>
