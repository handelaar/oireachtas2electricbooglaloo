      <P>I have to announce that I have received information of the death, on 26th July last, of Mr. Stephen O'Mara, a former member of this House.  His death causes a vacancy which will have to be filled as a casual vacancy, and it is my duty, as Chairman, to fix the date for the election.  The election has to be held not sooner than a fortnight from to-day, but there is a difficulty in connection with that, which I want the House to consider and come to some conclusion upon.  I do not think there is likely to be much business for us between this and Christmas.  So far as I can see, the only matter of urgency to come up to us from the other House will be the Expiring Laws Bill, which will probably be a non-contentious measure.  So far as I can judge, we will not want to sit on more than one day between this and the Christmas Recess.  It has occurred to me that members of the House might, under these circumstances, consider it desirable not to fill this vacancy until we meet in January.  That will be a matter on which I will be entirely guided by the opinion of the House.  The 15th December seems to me the earliest date that we will be required to meet, and if we had nothing to occupy us on that date except the Expiring Laws Bill we might have a very small attendance.  Accordingly, it might be more dignified for us to fix a date for the election subsequent to the Christmas Recess.  Senators can consider the matter, and I will mention it again before the adjournment to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> Before concluding, I should like to welcome back here our colleague, Senator Mrs. Wyse Power.</P>

      <P>I know there is a general feeling in this House against formalities, but, nevertheless, I should like to refer to the death of Senator O'Mara.  The deceased Senator was a comparatively short time a member of this House, but he had a long life of honourable service in the interest of his country.  While I do not like formal resolutions, I think that the occasion should not be allowed to pass without some expression of sympathy with his relatives.  Senator O'Mara was well known all over Ireland.  We saw very little of him here.  God did not spare him to give much service to his country here, but I think that there should be some expression of appreciation of his services by us and some expression of sympathy with his relatives on the occasion of his death.</P>

      <P>I think this is eminently a case in which an expression of the sympathy of the House would be fitting.  Senator O'Mara had a very long public career and he was universally esteemed.  He was a colleague of my own for a number of years, and I always entertained for him the strongest feelings of friendship. If Senator Douglas moves a resolution of sympathy, I should consider it a privilege to second it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think every decent citizen must deplore the circumstances leading up to the introduction of this Bill.  Everybody with any sense of justice or humanity must sympathise with and admire the two brave men who gave up their lives in the discharge of their duties and condemn the barbarous cowardice of the would-be patriots who shot down unarmed men as if they were wild beasts.  I am afraid the incidents of last week are an indication that there are still in this country people who stupidly or foolishly think they are rendering a patriotic service by bringing the law and representatives of the law into contempt.  As a nation I think we are far more successful in the making of laws than in their observance, and this is not confined to any particular section of the community. When we find people in high office mentioning the Constitution and the laws for the express purpose of showing how they can be violated with impunity, when we find acts of that kind applauded by distinguished members of both Houses, by the cream of Dublin commercial and professional life, with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court thrown in, we must not be surprised if less privileged citizens through the country do not hold the law in the veneration and esteem that might otherwise be the case.  The day when a better civic spirit will prevail will come <Col N="1118" /> when those who make the laws show a greater respect for those laws than is now the case.</P>
      <P>The incidents of last week are undoubtedly not only criminal and treasonable but they tend to bring the law into contempt.  Acts of that kind cannot be tolerated in any civilised community, but is there not a danger that the State may bring contempt upon itself by rushing blindly for new weapons at the first note of danger without making any serious attempts to use those weapons which it has been forging and perfecting for the last three years?  One would have thought that the Treasonable Offences Act, 1925, would have given the Government all the powers that were necessary in order to deal with incidents such as those I have referred to.  Certainly the impression given to the Oireachtas was that the object of that Bill was to enable the Government of the day to deal with armed rebellion, seditious conspiracy and all conceivable hostile acts against the State.  It was looked upon as a very drastic measure to place upon the Statute Book, but the Oireachtas in its wisdom passed it to place those powers in the hands of the Government of the day.  Now we find, after a dozen Gárda barracks in the whole of the Free State have been raided, the Government come rushing to the Oireachtas and say: &ldquo;We cannot uphold the safety of the State, we cannot defend you unless you give us new powers.  In other words, you must give us powers to arrest all and sundry in order that among hundreds of prisoners we may bag a few criminals or potential criminals.  We must get power to arrest a whole parish because it is suspected it contains half a dozen conspirators.&rdquo; That is not a particular compliment to the efficiency of our defence forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to judge by what has happened in the past, under similar powers, we must, unfortunately, assume that large numbers of innocent people will be arrested as a result of the passing of the Act, and possibly detained for long periods or only released on condition that they give guarantees as to their future good behaviour, although they had no intention to act otherwise than in a law-abiding way. <Col N="1119" /> To give such guarantees is a tacit admission of guilt or an admission of intending guilt.  That is a deplorable situation to place the average citizen in.  It is like cutting down a whole field of corn in order to weed out a few thistles.  If this Bill passes in its present form it will be in the power of a few obscure blackguards on any occasion, any day of the year, to stampede the Government of the day into creating a state of martial law, because when the emergency powers are put into operation the freedom of the individual citizen and the sanctity of his home are things of the past.  It is merely a case of setting up orderly oppression for irregular or disorderly oppression.  A jumpy atmosphere of this kind is not calculated to create stability or improve our credit at home or abroad.  Action of this kind on the part of the Government is far more calculated to create a feeling of unrest and disquietude than could ever be done by any few obscure conspirators, by acts such as those which unfortunately took place during the past week. It is essential that these powers be used with the greatest possible judgment and discretion.  I do not know if one has any reason to hope that that discretion and judgment will be used if it is entrusted to military officers who can in turn delegate their authority to army sergeants.  I should have thought that at least that power would have been left in the hands of the Gárda and trained detective force, instead of leaving it to military men who cannot have an intimate knowledge of affairs in their district because of the circumstances of their employment, and who were never trained for police action of this kind.</P>
    <P>It is a tremendous proposition to place this as a permanent Act on the Statute Book, leaving it in the power of whatever party or Government may be in office to invoke these tyrannical provisions against their political opponents.  The criminal stupidity of those who gave occasion for this is beyond comprehension.  A general election is looming on the horizon.  It may be ten months or it may be only a month or two away, but one can easily <Col N="1120" /> see what is going to be the fate of the country in that general election because of incidents arising out of this Bill. Quite a number of people, we must assume, will be arrested.  Some undoubtedly will be guilty; they will be conspirators, while others are almost sure to be absolutely innocent of any complicity, but through a mistaken zeal on the part of the authorities they will be interned.  Then we shall have our hunger strikes, protest meetings and demands for the release of the prisoners and so forth, while other people will be making wild threats and you will have a general recrudescence of all the features under which the general election of 1923 was fought.  Certainly if I were belonging to the Government in power I would say that no more suitable or favourable circumstances could exist under which to launch a general election, because I would naturally go out as the champion of law and order; I would be able to relegate to the background all those other vital national problems, difficult and complicated, hard to define and equally hard to solve, and go out on the plea of safety first.  He is a very poor aspirant to parliamentary honours who could not make a good stunt on that. There is just the danger that barbarous incidents such as have occurred during the past week may be used and exploited for political purposes, that Parliament and eventually the State may be brought into contempt by refusing to use the tremendous powers or to utilise the forces at the disposal of the Government, but instead come along and create a scare in a political atmosphere and look for powers such as those asked for in this Bill.  None of those things may come to pass. Everything may work out smoothly and the election may be fought sensibly and rationally on economic and social problems, things that affect the management and well-being of the nation.  I ask Senators to watch with the keenest possible interest the developments of the next few months and see if what I have suggested is not likely to come to pass and is not very near the truth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to oppose this Bill.  I have opposed all the <Col N="1121" /> other measures of a similar sort brought before us, but I am not going to oppose this one.  I believe that everybody&mdash;those in this House and people all over the country who have got any responsibility, even those parties who openly declare that they wish the overthrow of the Government, with the exception of one small section &mdash;is bitterly opposed to what has been done within the last week.  I believe they have no connection with it, and that in their hearts they dislike it very much.  Unfortunately they have not come out to say so, but it seems to me that these assassinations that have happened lately prevent anybody giving any sympathy whatever to these matters.  These assassinations have not even the certain amount of moral support that fighting in the early days had.  We have had a long period of peace and had hoped that everything would settle down, and suddenly these things have been sprung on us. I believe, however, that they are not at all as serious as the Government has pretended.  I believe they have their own objects for doing these things.  I believe, though I do not know this, that the party who did this wished it to be more extended and that the orders given were not carried out because their own followers were not prepared to go murdering around the country.  However, these are only suppositions on my part.  I cannot say whether they are true or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, however, it will be necessary to support this measure in order that the Government may have complete power for anything they want in this matter.  Having said so much, I must again repeat that I opposed all the previous measures of this kind that were carried forward by the Government, because I believed they would lead exactly to a state of affairs of this sort and to the certain things that have actually happened.  I said so at the time: that it was a mere chance whether they would go right or not, and apparently it is so.  If you ostracise a great part of one nation, almost one-third, and if you exclude them from office, from the Government and from any public post by which they could earn a living, by oaths and such <Col N="1122" /> like things, you are bound to lead to extremists.  People who would not otherwise be extreme are driven to be extreme, and when that is done, and when the whole country believes it is done, for the purpose of keeping one political party in power, and not really for the defence of the State, then it still more aggravates people and causes them to go into these desperate measures that happened lately.  However, I am not going to say much more about it.  I shall not vote against the Bill, but I can only hope that the Government will use a great deal more discretion in the arrest, detention and treatment of prisoners than they have used on other occasions, when many discreditable things happened.  I dare say they are perfectly aware of all this. Later on I propose to move an amendment to the effect that this Bill, when it becomes an Act, shall only remain in force for one year.  I do not believe in making a measure such as this a permanent one on our Statute Book.  The Government may say in answer to that: &ldquo;Oh, in that case we will have to be coming here every three months to make a statement about it and to ask for permission to continue the measure.&rdquo;  When the British Government passed measures of a similar kind they nearly always did so for some definite time.  If the Government here were in some difficulty, and if the state of affairs existing justified them in asking for powers of this kind, then the Dáil and the Seanad could be brought together at a moment's notice.</P>

It states: &ldquo;It shall be lawful for an Executive Minister to cause the arrest,&rdquo; and so on.  Does that mean that the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he wants can have the various Labour members interned, and that the Minister for Finance can have the critics of national expenditure interned if their criticisms are awkward? It seems to me that some Minister, such as the Minister for Justice, should be made responsible.</P>

      <P>Before we pass from Section 6 I should like to ask the Minister, and the House will probably realise why I do ask the question, whether under sub-section (7) it will be open to either House, by rejecting one or more of the Regulations, to leave the remainder unprejudiced?  A very unpleasant difference of opinion, which is not yet settled, arose on this very question in connection with the Courts of Justice Bill and the Rules of Procedure.  I want to know if the Ministers are advised that under Section 6, sub-section (7), as it stands, the rejection of one or more regulations by either House will not invalidate the remaining regulations?</P>

      <P>I should have thought so only that a practically similar section was inserted in this House in the Courts of Justice Act, after it had been drafted and prepared <Col N="1125" /> by the Attorney-General of the day with the assistance of Senator Brown, for the express purpose of accomplishing the object you mention, but unfortunately when we came to apply it we were told that the advisers of the Government had changed their views in the matter, and that if the Seanad rejected any one of the Rules the whole body of the Rules went.  I want an assurance that the Government understand and are advised that under this sub-section (7) as it stands now it is clear that the rejection of one regulation will not invalidate the others.  I think myself it is absolutely clear, but I thought the same about the Courts of Justice Act and was mistaken.</P>

      <P>I second.  I appeal to the House to support this amendment. I hope the fact that the Dáil or this House may meet again will not cause Senators to turn down such a vitally important amendment as this. The provisions of the Bill are such as no democratic modern assembly would like to see a permanent fixture on the Statute Book.  It gives powers which are subversive of every idea of individual liberty in every democratic country, such as only one could expect to find on the statute books of Italy or Russia, and such as should not be placed permanently on our Statute Book.  Some Senators may smile, on the <Col N="1126" /> assumption that the Party now in power will always be their friends, but the wheel of political events has a funny way of turning round, and what is your funeral to-day may be somebody else's to-morrow.  Apart from that altogether, I think that anybody who professes the faintest idea of democracy would not willingly agree to have this a permanency.  I earnestly hope that the Seanad will give the amendment serious consideration and have it inserted in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined, while having a certain amount of sympathy with the view of Senator Colonel Moore, to look at his amendment from a totally different point of view.  Under the proposed conditions, in three days it will be possible, if the Houses are willing, to pass this Bill, but there has to be a period of a few days for calling the Houses together, and then three further days will be required, or about six days altogether.  I do not think the Government have stated that they are now necessarily about to make a proclamation. I have not heard whether they are going to do it or not.  I, for one, rather hope that, on investigation, they may find that it is not absolutely necessary to do it at the present time. They have stated that they want the power, by proclamation, to be able to intern men on suspicion at short notice. Senator O'Farrell states that some other Party might be in power that might use this.  Supposing that his Party were in power, supposing that they wished to intern capitalists, and supposing both Houses were willing, they could bring in this Bill, and that could be done in three days.  The insertion of an amendment for its expiration in one year need not stop them doing it.  My point is that if we are going to agree at all under any circumstances to internment it is better to let the Government do it immediately when they need it, provided that the Houses can stop it, and provided that the Houses have to meet.  It seems to me that the most valuable safeguard the Government have put into this measure is that the proclamation itself must call both Houses to meet, and I think that we ought not to ignore that <Col N="1127" /> That being so, frankly I would prefer to allow it to take place, provided that the Houses are called within five days, than to say: &ldquo;You must have your meeting and have all this discussion five days before you can actually intern.&rdquo; If we are going to agree in any circumstances to any internment, as I take it we are reluctantly going to do, I would prefer that it would be done in this way rather than by having to come for a Bill.</P>

      <P>I thought that it would not be necessary to intervene at all in this debate, and my intervention now will be very short.  The Bill has been received in a spirit that, I think, was admirable, and Senator O'Farrell's opening words, even when he was objecting to the introduction of a measure of this sort at all, were, for the greater part, in a spirit that could not have been better.  His expression of sympathy with the men who had lost their lives and his protest against the brutality&mdash;I think he said&mdash;or the stupidity of those who thought that this type of attack would help a certain political movement to success were also in a very proper spirit.  But I do not think that the House should leave without entering its protest against one aspect of the matter that Senator O'Farrell introduced towards the end of his speech.  It might go out, if left unnoticed, that nobody had taken cognisance of this complex that the Senator has with regard to the general election.  There seems to be a sort of insinuation&mdash;I do not say that he at all went the length of suggesting <Col N="1128" /> it, but it might be interpreted in that way&mdash;that this incident, with the loss of the lives of two people, had been staged in order that a particular Party might go to the country in a strong position.</P>

      <P>I say that it was not suggested, but that it might be interpreted in that way.  But I do say that the Senator has, at any rate, left it open to the interpretation that we were seizing hold of a deplorable incident of this sort in order to bring in a measure which was unnecessary in the circumstances, simply in order to avail ourselves of better political ammunition in the future.  I want to protest against that.  I doubt if the Senator really meant it, and I would point out, in answer to it, that for a Party going forward later in the year, having as its main plank the security of life and the preservation of law and order, to a certain extent this Bill is a small condemnation of such an attitude, because if law and order had been absolutely and completely established there would be no necessity for this. President Cosgrave stated in the Dáil that he would much prefer, when going before the electors, to have a state of things in the country in consequence of which a measure of this sort was not required, but that he was prepared to go forward, even with his record to a certain extent blotted by the necessity for this measure, rather than to have it left to the few blackguards, to whom Senator O'Farrell has referred, to bring about such an emergency as they brought about last Sunday night.  That is the amount of intervention that I wanted to make.</P>

      <P>The only other matter upon the agenda is with reference to our next meeting.  It has transpired that if a proclamation of emergency is made both Houses will automatically have to meet within five days.  Of course, I cannot predict that that will happen, but the Seanad will understand that although we now adjourn to a particular date it is quite possible that I shall have to convene a meeting specially in the interval.  If that is necessary of course I will give the fullest notice possible.  I might also say that I think, by a slip, I stated that the election to fill the vacancy in the Seanad could not take place before a week from to-day.  It cannot take place before a fortnight, which is the period allowed for Senators to send in their nominations.</P>

      <P>The nominations <Col N="1130" /> are within a week, but I am talking of the election.  I have to fix a date for the holding of the election not less than one fortnight ahead, but I can fix it for any date subsequent to that.  I think I have to fix it for a specified date.  While the responsibility for fixing that date is thrown upon me, I am anxious to consult the convenience of the House, but I do think that in view of the somewhat abnormal conditions under which we may be meeting within the next fortnight, we would have a calmer and a better atmosphere after the Christmas Recess and that it would be better for me to fix the date for the holding of the election on the last Wednesday in January.  If there is no objection I shall do so.  Any Senator who wishes to nominate a candidate will find the forms in the office, and I invite close attention to the matters that are required to be filled up, more particularly, what is very often forgotten, that there is a minimum age for a candidate but no maximum age.  I, therefore, fix Wednesday, January 26th, as the date for the holding of the election.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.55 p.m.</P>
