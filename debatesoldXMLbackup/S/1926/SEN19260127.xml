      <P>I have to inform the House that I have received a communication from Senator the Earl of Dunraven in which he states that, inasmuch as his medical advisers have told him that he must inevitably spend his winters for the future abroad, he finds it necessary that he should resign his seat as a member of this House.  Under our Standing Orders an interval of at least one fortnight has to elapse before a Senator is elected to fill his place.  I propose, therefore, that the election should be held on this day fortnight.  I find that there will be no reason, having regard to the state of business, for convening the Seanad next week, and consequently if we dispose of the business on the Order Paper to-day Senators will not be required to attend until this day fortnight. On that day we will hold the election for the casual vacancy.  I would remind Senators that, under our Standing Orders, any nomination of a candidate has to be handed in before the expiration of one week from this date, that is to say, before Wednesday next. Any Senator who wishes to nominate a candidate will kindly do so not later than next Wednesday&mdash;that is to say, this day week.  Nomination papers, and all the other particulars necessary as to the filling up of the papers, can be obtained from the Clerk.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Order entitled the Public Bodies Order, 1925, which was laid on the Table of this House on the 7th day of January, 1926, shall be and is hereby annulled.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Statutory Order which, unless <Col N="291" /> annulled within 21 days after it has been laid on the Table of the House, comes into operation, and this is the only method that one has of calling the attention of the House to the contents of the Order should one wish to do so.  This is an Order of great importance in that it covers practically the whole ground of our work of local administration.  It covers the procedure for road work, the method of raising rates, and all that is connected therewith in full detail.  It only touches slightly on the work of county boards of health and public assistance, they having been already dealt with in a previous Order to which I have already called the attention of the House.  As the House knows, the tendency of modern legislation is to give very wide powers to Ministers to proceed under Orders.  The Statute only lays down certain general lines for guidance, but all the details, many of them of extreme importance, affecting the whole of the work, are dealt with by Orders.  In giving such wide powers, the House only reserves to itself, in most cases, the right to criticise, and that is what I am asking the House to do now.  I would first of all call the attention of the House to Article 3 of this Order, which reads: &ldquo;The Minister may from time to time assent to any departure from the rules and regulations contained in this Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I read that Article, it means that the Minister may change the Order in any manner that he sees fit.  If that is so, it is very little use making these statutory Orders and laying them on the Table of the House or of taking power to annul them should we see fit to do so.  Yet, after a certain period has elapsed, the Minister has power to upset, and to depart from, the rules and regulations contained in the Order.  That would appear to hand over the whole manner of changing these Orders to the power of the Executive, and to take the power away from the Oireachtas.  I should even go so far as to suggest that nothing of the kind can be done, and that to do so would be <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
    <P>I now pass to the Order itself.  I do <Col N="292" /> not know if Senators have got copies of it in their hands.  The Order is one of very considerable length and contains a large number of forms.  I will not attempt to deal with more than the salient points in it.  I first ask the House to examine the new form on which rates are to be demanded.  I do not know if the House is quite aware of the procedure, but at a certain season of the year, when the rate books are being prepared, a lot of extra work is thrown on to the local authority and it is necessary to engage a large number of temporary clerks to do this work.  My information is that under this new form of demand note four times as much work will be involved in the future as has been necessary in the past.  Each separate rating has its own demand note.  The amount demanded has to be split up under five heads, namely, roads, county services, health district charges, poor relief, and separate charges. It is split up, too, in reference to the demand on land and the demand on other hereditaments.  To take a case of which I have personal knowledge I have myself received something in the region of 150 demand notes.  The valuation in the case of one of them is as low as 3/-.  If the rate there was 10/- in the £, the amount to be demanded would be 1/6, and that 1/6 has to be separated under the five headings I mentioned in proportion to (1) expenditure on roads, (2) county services, (3) health district charges, (4) poor relief, and (5) separate charges, involving perhaps calculations of fractions of 7-32nds or 12-32nds or whatever the fraction might be.  That has got to be done, if the law is carried out, by the temporary clerks engaged for the purpose, some of whom may not be very dexterous at figures.  I submit that in many cases it would either be beyond their powers altogether or would occupy an inordinate amount of time.  I believe the reply to this is that it is portion of this work as prescribed by law.  It is also suggested. I believe, that I was responsible for the amendment that led to this, but I have been looking up the official debates and I cannot see that I am, but if I am responsible then I <Col N="293" /> think it is a case in which I should be adjudged for certification.</P>
    <P>What I had in mind in proposing my amendment was that every demand note should show, as is done in the case of the City of London, the total amount demanded for main services&mdash;roads, lighting, cleaning, education, etc.  That would mean one calculation for every demand note, and I wanted to have that printed on the back of the demand note.  On the face of the demand note no such particulars are given, nor are they necessary, but even if one is responsible for what has turned out to be an act of lunacy, why drag in all these other charges as well?  If all these particulars are to be given it will, as I have said before, involve four times as much work in the preparation of demand notes in the future as was the case in the past.</P>
    <P>I now pass to another very important matter, that is, the method of accounting for the roads.  I am glad to see that the Government have recognised that there is something to be gained by an attempt at a disintegration of the cost of the roads, and the apportionment of the cost to individual roads.  That is implicit in the Order. When you come to examine the technique proposed the conclusion is irresistible that the method proposed to be employed will not serve the purpose of costings or of control.  It will be necessary, if the county surveyor or the local authority is to use an account that will be of the least value for the purposes of control of individual works, that a completely separate set of accounts to this prescribed in this Order be adopted&mdash;that is, of course, to what is the practice at present. The official forms are really of no practical assistance to the county surveyors.  Any up-to-date surveyor has his own forms, which he prepares in his own office and adapts to his own purposes.  One had hoped that these new forms would have been drawn up on the plan of the unofficial forms now in use and which would have been of real service to the county surveyor in his work of control.</P>
    <P>If we come to examine these forms we find that an attempt is made to apportion to each road the cost of the material used upon that road.  I would <Col N="294" /> like to show how that is done.  There is an account called the materials account, in which the expenses connected with the proportion of the materials is charged.  That account will be allowed to run up for periods of anything up to six months.  The county council may shorten that period, but one knows that in these matters the council has really no say and that the authority rests entirely with the officials themselves. Now that account is charged on the expenditure for a period of say half a year for every road in the county. Then at the close of the half year or other period the secretary to the county council is provided with information as to the materials used upon those various roads and the cost is apportioned on a flat rate or an average rate over the various roads in the county. That is to say, this sum charged against a road is not really what the actual cost of the prepared materials for that road is, but the average cost of the materials for all the roads.  You find something like this: The material account shows a charge against it of something like £10,000 and the county surveyor provides certain information of material gone here, there and everywhere. Dividing the amount of material into the cost to be apportioned you get the sum which enables you to close the account and to find the individual amounts to be transferred to the accounts of the different roads.</P>
    <P>Any accountant would certainly agree that this is not the true cost and is not the cost of the expenditure upon that road, but is simply the average cost of expenditure upon all the roads. That system does not lend itself to the purposes of control.  The county surveyor wants to control his own operations by some organisation within his service.  If you take the case of an individual quarry gang, an accountant can keep an account of that quarry as the county surveyor works it, and he can have returns of its output prepared periodically either weekly, fortnightly or monthly, and so he is able to calculate the output of the quarry and to calculate what it costs in the year to work and see how it compares with the case of other quarries or previous work of that character.  None of those elementary straightforward well-known <Col N="295" /> costing methods is possible under this accounting.  These accounts will serve certain purposes; certain forms will be filled up; they can always be made to balance, sums can be apportioned, there is no check whether they are put into the right or the wrong place; they will be apportioned and will appear arithmetically correct, but they will not be a true cost and will not be of any use for the purposes of control.  Therefore I say that these forms, especially forms for the roads, are of the nature of so many of those Government forms, mere elaborations and computations serving no real living purpose.</P>
    <P>Moreover, in the case of county surveyors, the road-accounting authority is divided.  Now it is absolutely essential if these road accounts are to be of any value, that the bulk of these accounts should be entirely under the control of the county surveyor.  He must have an accountant ready, upon whom he can call at any moment, and who must be an officer in his own department. As the Order prescribes, most of these accounts are kept in the county secretary's office, and the county surveyor has only control by courtesy, and not by right, and has not that immediate personal control over the official keeping the account which he should have, and which efficiency in administration requires that he should have. For these reasons I ask the House to take a serious view of this new Order, and to say that it serves no useful purpose, and to annul it, and to let the old Public Bodies Order remain in operation. But I do not wish to leave the matter without putting some constructive suggestion forward to the Minister as to how the whole matter should be treated.  Everyone knows that in any new requirements of this kind you cannot go off in a hurry&mdash;it is perfectly impossible&mdash;as the Minister is trying to do, to get a number of officials, however competent in an office up in Dublin, to devise new forms of accounts, and to expect them to be of any service until they are tried out.</P>
    <P>I may mention, incidentally, that it is rather strange that it was not until these account forms were got out that the officials, as a whole, were consulted. <Col N="296" /> No doubt individual officers were consulted here and there, but it was only after the forms were out that the views of the county surveyors as a body were sought.  The only way to deal with this matter, in my judgment, is to take one county, and say to that county, &ldquo;You are to be made the subject of careful, detailed and detached experiment; we will cut you off from all those other counties.&rdquo;  Burn the whole of the Public Bodies Orders for the time being, so far as that county is concerned; put in one commercial accountant to collaborate with the secretary, the county surveyor, and one official of the Local Government Department, and see whether they will not be able to build up some system of accountancy, paying no attention to what has gone before, but establishing those methods of accounting and of control with fewer forms.  The fewer books used the better they will have done their work.  Try that for two or three years.  Let that county be used as a trial centre.  At the end of two or three years, if you cut yourselves away from the traditions, prejudices and complications of these Orders, built up elaborately for generations, and show that you have arrived at a practical system, providing a ground within that system that can be made the subject of a new Order, then I submit that that is the only way that real reform of administration can be arrived at and recommended and carried out.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the motion.  I am not very intimately acquainted with the particulars of these forms, but I sympathise very strongly with Senator Sir John Keane in his protest against giving Ministers power to do whatever they like and to put forward orders and statements and to withdraw them just as they please.  The Minister has enormous power given him in this case, and why he should have power to withdraw what is laid before the Seanad or the Dáil just at his own sweet will I cannot understand.  The Seanad or the Dáil in these circumstances might as well not exist at all, and it is mere waste of time passing orders and making arrangements that certain documents should lie on the <Col N="297" /> Table of the House if such changes are allowed to be made in them.  Senators may read them, but they cannot always watch and detect whatever changes are made in them which may make them wholly useless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I understand the case, the new Public Bodies Order seems to me to be an attempt to satisfy the public, who, after all, are the most important body, as to how the various moneys they have contributed to pay for the upkeep of their counties are spent.  Senator Sir John Keane has given a very bewildering picture of the tremendous amount of work to be put upon a body of clerks under the new Order.  He himself, as far as I remember, has always been for the simplification of accounts, so that the man in the street could understand them.  But I really feel that this new Order will make the allocation of the funds of the county more easily understood by the men who contribute those funds, and that they will be able to put their fingers on the weak spots in the administration of their counties.  And if such an end were to be secured by a little extra trouble and by the employment of a few extra clerks in the work, that extra trouble would not be very great and the extra expense would be more than counterbalanced by the information to the community which this new Order would give.  The Seanad in its wisdom thought it was well that roads should be put into accounts in a definite manner and should be taken note of, and that is going to be done. Senator Sir John Keane's supposition case of a 3/- rate divided into the seven-thirty seconds or seven twenty-sevenths is not such a difficult matter.  These divisions will be treated as a penny without going into vulgar or decimal fractions, as the case may be.  I think that the trouble of dealing with such a state of affairs as he anticipates will not arise under the Public Bodies Order.  For that reason I welcome from my point of view the coming of the Public Bodies Order, because it will give the community an opportunity of knowing how their money is being spent, and I welcome the order as outlined here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> After all, what is Senator Sir John Keane's constructive suggestion: that one county should be picked out and cut off, so to speak, from the rest of the country and ear-marked for a specific treatment.  How would other counties derive any specific information from such an experiment?  These counties would be carried on as heretofore, and no knowledge is to be given to them of the way their money is to be spent or of the various heads under which their money is being spent.  If Senator Sir John Keane's resolution is to be adopted by us then the whole machinery of the law is to be set aside, and I do not think we could do that. We have to stand by the Orders we have got.  We have to have specific information and expert information, something making for efficiency in administration and for the people's good. I certainly cannot support a motion which proposes that this Public Bodies Order should be set on one side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot pretend any deep knowledge or any technical knowledge of this question, but in this matter of statistics generally I have some experience.  I think the great tendency on the part of Governments, a tendency from which our own Government is not free, is to call for statistics to a greater extent than is perhaps desirable.  Statistics are going to cost something, to increase public expenditure, in printing them and circulating whatever the result of them may be.  I think new statistics should never be called for unless there is a clearly demonstrable advantage to be gained from any particular set of statistics.  My own experience leads me to believe that the Government do not give due consideration to this and that great masses of statistics are asked for which have no practical use and simply cost a good deal of money. As regards the suggestion which has been made by the mover, it seems to me a practical one, because I do think that statistics are much more likely to be credible and reliable and very much more valuable if they are followed up by a consultation with the people concerned. I think the suggestion that an experiment might be tried in one <Col N="299" /> county is a very practical one, and it is well worth consideration.</P>

      <P>I do not know how that stands.  You may be quite right.  Perhaps the Minister would take a half an hour now, and would come back to us when he has considered this point.  It would, of course, be extremely awkward, if the result of adjourning the matter, since we were not to meet for another fortnight, was that the allotted period had expired by then.  It might be a serious question of law whether it was kept alive by this motion.  I am afraid it is possible that it could be held that it does not, and that the annulment would not take place within the allotted time.</P>

      <P>With the leave of the Seanad I would like before the next business is entered upon to place on record the sense of deep obligation to one of its members under which the Government rests for an action of great generosity and public spirit. Senator Sir John Griffith, who, as the Seanad is aware, has devoted several years to the preparation and completion of a scheme for hydro-electric development on the River Liffey, has intimated his desire to present to the Government as custodians for the State all the plans, drawings, calculations and other material comprised in his scheme.  He wishes that all the details of a project to which such labour has been devoted should be preserved and be placed at the disposal of whatever body is hereafter responsible for development on the Liffey, should such a development, as is very probable, be necessary in the future.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has already conveyed to Senator Sir John Griffith the Government's grateful acceptance of his magnificent offer, but I thought it only fitting that as head of the Government I should take this opportunity of publicly assuring the Senator, in the House of which he is so valued a member, that his signal public spirit will always be appreciated and remembered by the people of the country.</P>

      <P>Unless this matter has been settled I would like to say a word not particularly in reference to this election, but generally in reference to all elections.  It will be very convenient for members of the Seanad, if some day on which the Seanad meets intervened between the date on which the date of the election is fixed and the date on which the election is held, in order that Senators may have an opportunity of consulting as to the line of action they should take.  If there is no meeting intervening, Senators will not have an opportunity of coming to an understanding on the matter.  I am not referring to this particular case, but as a general rule I think Senators should have an opportunity of consulting before a vacancy is filled.</P>

      <P>I moved amendment 1 that the word &ldquo;construed&rdquo; be substituted for &ldquo;constructed.&rdquo;  I also raised the question that some of the clauses were involved.  In one case the Bill was limited to vessels carrying 25 tons, and in another portion it mentioned &ldquo;any vessel.&rdquo;  I then mentioned that a vessel carrying 15 or 20 tons would do as great an amount of injury as a vessel carrying over 25 tons.  We have also other objections to the Bill.  We think it would be much better if it were mandatory on the local authorities to take action.  In some cases it mentions the Harbour Board, and in others the local or sanitary authority, and if it would be possible to introduce a section to make it mandatory on local authorities, and to make a harbour board where one was established the authority that should take action.  It also seems rather objectionable that the harbour authorities have to make representation to the Minister, who may appoint some person to interfere <Col N="303" /> where the law is broken.  It seems to me that that would involve a good deal of delay, and if power were given to the harbour or local authority to take action itself it would be better. A vessel that had done a lot of damage might possibly be out of the port before the Minister had sent a representative to inspect it.</P>

      <P>The point on which the debate was adjourned the last day was in reference to the difficulty raised in regard to an amendment to Section 2.  Senator Jackson then said that section 2 read at present &ldquo;twenty-five tons of oil at one time,&rdquo; and that in other sections it read &ldquo;any vessel.&rdquo;  He suggested that that portion in reference to the twenty-five tons of oil should be deleted.  It was in reference to that suggestion that the Minister said he would like to look more fully into the Bill.  Perhaps if the Senator would let the Fourth Stage remain over it would be the best thing to do.  At the time the Minister thanked Senator Jackson for drawing his attention to these two matters.

I tried to get a copy of the <Col N="304" /> Order here, and was told I would have to go to the Library.  I went down to the Library, and the gentleman who gave me a copy of the Order wanted me to sign a paper.  I did not want the Order to take it away, and if Senator Sir John Keane's oration had been a little longer I would have arrived back in time to answer him.  I suggest that for the future it would be a good thing when important motions of this sort come before the Seanad that a copy of the Order should be in the House.  This was a very important matter, so important that the debate had to be postponed. I hope that you will see, sir, that there is a copy of the Order in the Seanad on the next occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COUNIHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in the opinion of the Seanad the time has now arrived to settle finally the question of the responsibility for payment of compensation for Irish live stock slaughtered by order of the British Ministry for Agriculture on the occasion of the foot and mouth disease outbreaks at what are known as foreign wharfs or landing places in Great Britain, and further, that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture be requested to take steps to ensure the immediate settlement of the claims of Free State citizens whose stock was slaughtered owing to this cause in the outbreak of 1923.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> The question of payment of compensation to owners of Irish live stock that was slaughtered in Great Britain concerns a very large number of the people of this country.  At present Irish cattle or any cattle landing in British ports may, by order of the British Minister of Agriculture, be destroyed owing to fear of the spread of foot and mouth disease, and although the cattle are free from disease, no compensation is given. Under the Importation Order made by the British Government in 1920, the British Minister of Agriculture may do that at any time.  No compensation can be secured by the owners of the cattle.  Senators will realise why people who are engaged in the live stock export trade wish to have this menace removed and of being placed in a secure position.</P>
    <P>To a large extent this Order has contributed to the falling off of exports of live stock from Ireland during the past twelve months.  The export of cattle was affected because of fear on the part of the owners that the stock would be held up at any particular time, then slaughtered, and no compensation paid. We have suggested that this Order should be removed on terms that would be fair and equitable to the parties concerned.  We have suggested that the Irish Government should be responsible for Irish live stock landed in Great Britain until they were passed as sound after ten hours' detention, and that the British Government should then pay if the stock was detained at the port for any other reason. The question must be settled if the cattle trade is to prosper.  The exporters of Irish live stock require all the facilities that it is possible to give them to carry on their trade.</P>
    <P>We have been told that this Order was made by the British Government, and that the Irish Government cannot interfere.  I do not agree with that. It is true that we send possibly 97 per cent. of our live cattle to England, but it is also true that 97 per cent. of our imports are from England.  That position could be made the basis of a good bargain.  I am not advocating any reprisals against England.  I want to encourage and foster trade with England in every possible way because it is to <Col N="306" /> our advantage to do so.  At the same time I cannot believe that if our Minister for Agriculture, in conjunction with the Minister of Agriculture for Northern Ireland, met the British Minister of Agriculture, who, fortunately, is another Irishman, and discussed the matter, with the goodwill that exists between the three Governments at the present time, and the expressed desire to help and assist one another, I cannot see why they should not be able to come to an understanding.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion deals with the outbreak of 1923.  In that year a number of Irish exporters sent cattle to Great Britain.  The animals were perfectly sound and healthy and were passed as such after the ten hours detention.  An outbreak of disease was reported in the vicinity of the port. The cattle were put into quarantine and left there for some time.  Although there was no suspicion of any disease, the British Minister of Agriculture ordered that the cattle should be slaughtered.  The animals were slaughtered, but the owners have never got one farthing compensation.  I think it is a discreditable and a monstrous proceeding, that owners whose stock was destroyed for the public good should not receive compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephOConnor" hpid="Mr. JOSEPH O'CONNOR Mr. JOSEPH O'CONNOR">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOSEPH O'CONNOR</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the motion I may state that I am practically the oldest authority on foot and mouth disease in Ireland.  I remember the first outbreak that occurred about 55 years ago.  Animals suffering from the disease at that time, when there were no restrictions, were allowed to recover.  I never saw a fatal case.  The cattle, after getting sick, suffered for a time, but after that they got well.  The peculiar thing is, that what they lost in condition during the disease they made up subsequently. We had another outbreak 34 years ago, but the restrictions then were not so stringent as they were after the outbreak of 1912.  We also had an outbreak in 1911 at Ballysax, near the Curragh.  My reason in mentioning that is that I desire to blame the British Government for their negligence in allowing the disease to come into the country.  A family that lived <Col N="307" /> near the Curragh&mdash;most respectable people&mdash;had a contract with the officers' mess, and got the offal.  In that was packing and litter that came from France, where the disease was widespread.</P>
      <P>To my mind the origin of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease was as I have said.  What I want to convey is that the British Government was responsible for allowing this foot and mouth disease to come into Ireland. It came in in the way I have stated, through foreign packing material such as straw.  We in this country were accused by the British of having the disease in the country and not reporting it.  At one time there was a very widespread belief to that effect, and the Minister for Lands and Agriculture is well aware of that, and at one time he had to make a public statement that there was no such disease in Ireland. Cattle dealers in this country, over and over again in the time of the British Government, and even since, have made representations suggesting the prohibition of the importation of foreign packing material from countries where this disease is known to be in existence.  At one time, when that representation was made to a late Minister of Agriculture in England, the cattle dealers were told that it would be a serious thing to interfere with the importation of wines from France.  I might tell the Minister, and we in the Seanad know it, that the importation of wines was a very small matter in comparison with the protection of the cattle industry, and most of them considered it was a very silly case to put up when they were attempting to fix the responsibility for foot and mouth disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, coming to the question of the slaughter of these cattle, I honestly contend in fairness to the cattle trade that there was a very great amount of panicky legislation and administration adopted in order to cope with the outbreak. It was only within the last week that Mr. Hill, a gentleman connected with the Board of Agriculture in England, stated publicly his belief <Col N="308" /> that these outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in England originated in France, and were brought over here through material used in packing goods that were imported into England. That really is the only correct explanation as to the origin of the outbreak. For the last fifty-five years the most scientific people in the veterinary line have been trying to discover the origin of this germ, and how it is introduced. But it is one of those things that has baffled the experts up to the present, and it is greatly to be regretted that as yet no preventative has been discovered. We consider it a great injustice that cattle should be slaughtered because of this disease, and no compensation given to the owner.  This is done for the benefit of the general public, and it appears unfair and unjust that the owner of the cattle should suffer, as many of them have suffered already in this way.  It is not what we would expect from the Minister for Lands and Agriculture here.  We are as anxious as anybody could be to preserve the good name of our cattle, and we resent the imputation that we are not in favour of keeping out the disease, and that we do not appreciate the importance of having a clean bill of health.</P>
    <P>We know that at present we have to depend on England and Scotland for the sale of our cattle.  We, therefore, want to have our cattle in the best possible condition.  I respectfully ask the Minister for Lands and Agriculture to see that no such gap as exists at present should remain open between the time the cattle leave Ireland (when the Irish Government is responsible for them) and the time they arrive in England or Scotland.  We think that in the interval after the cattle leave Ireland, and until the detention period is over, compensation should be allowed to the owner in case of the slaughter of the cattle.  It has always been held as a fair and equitable principle that anything done for the benefit of the public should be paid for out of the public purse.  It seems to me rather a pity that in an industry like that of the Irish cattle industry, which amounts to many millions, that this small matter of £5,000 or £10,000 should stand in the <Col N="309" /> way of justice being done to people who have suffered through having their cattle slaughtered while the cattle are in the detention lairages.  These people were simply caught in a trap.  We say that the cattle trade of Ireland requires a certain chain of safety from Ireland to any part of England or Scotland. And we say that they should be protected either at this side or at the other side, and we say that they should not be slaughtered unless the owner gets compensation.</P>
    <P>I understand that a good number of these cattle come from Derry or from the port of Belfast, and some of them belong to people in the Northern area. That suggests that when the matter is one for the three Governments that it should be more sympathetically treated. We do not want to put down the liability to the British Government.  We have sufficient faith in our own country to ask that the Government here would come to the rescue of those men and restore to them the heavy sums which they have lost owing to the slaughter of their cattle.  There is no doubt that something ought to be done for these people.  That would give a great deal of security to the people engaged in the trade, and it would encourage them to launch out into bigger business.  I do not want to throw bouquets at the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, but I do say that he has been identified with one of the best Acts that was ever passed for this country, that is, the Live Stock Breeding Act, a measure that will increase the value of the Irish cattle trade by more than five millions annually in a few years time.</P>
    <P>We are very glad indeed to have Mr. Hogan at the head of this important Department of the Government, and for that reason we say it is all the more a matter for shame that because of a small sum of £5,000 or £10,000 that an injury should be done to some of our people.  I do not expect that the forensic ability of the Minister will seek to convince us that this is not a liability that the Government should in the first instance shoulder.  I therefore respectfully urge on the Minister to use his influence to have this question brought to a satisfactory conclusion and to satisfy the people who are <Col N="310" /> dependent on the cattle trade that they will not risk being ruined through having their cattle slaughtered.  Such an act would inspire the people in the trade to go about their business with less misgiving and with greater heart. I want the Government to close up this gap, and I respectfully ask the Seanad to pass this resolution.</P>

      <P>I must say that until I saw this motion under Senator Counihan's name on the Order Paper I did not know anything whatever about the facts.  It seems to me, however, that two things are established, and that there is more in this than meets the eye.  In the first place, we have it that people who have had their cattle slaughtered at British ports have not received compensation.  Now, is there any reason why people who have suffered this loss should not receive exactly the same compensation as has been given to hundreds and thousands of people who have their cattle slaughtered by the order of the Minister of Agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who do not look with favour on the British Minister of Agriculture contend that some people have got more than the value of the animals that have been slaughtered.  That being so, I would like if those who lost their cattle got compensation.  If that is established it is also clear that the owners of cattle are not in a position to extract full compensation from the recalcitrant British Minister of Agriculture. The Irish Government should in the first place make themselves responsible for this.  The individual should not be allowed to suffer, and the Saorstát Government should make themselves responsible for the admitted loss.  Surely the Government here would be able to extract this from the British Government.  It is like the double income tax.  On this point I would say that we should insist on having some clearing house to adjust the difficulties that may arise from time to time between the two countries. Questions of this kind must frequently arise between the two countries as there would be cases of money due from one Government to the other.  It would be easy for the Saorstát Government <Col N="311" /> in a well-established case of this sort to get the money back.  I think it is only right and fair that the Government should see that individuals who are suffering should be compensated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. GOGARTY Dr. GOGARTY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion.  The difficulty in this case seems to be on which Government to fix the blame.  This is an example of what arose in 1923.  Most people do not require any more experience of public life to know that if you have two Governments to deal with, then they have two methods of escaping between them, each blames the other, and the man who suffers loss is left to an <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal.  That is what will happen here.  Now the sum is not very large&mdash;five or six thousand pounds, but its importance lies in the fact that it may extend under future conditions.  At present the trap is still open.  What I mean is that any small cattle dealer sending his cattle forward not for immediate slaughter comes within the risk of this foot-and-mouth disease breaking out, and a panic may arise at any moment in any areas in England or Scotland, and the cattle sent over to be finished will be slaughtered. As these cattle are sent more or less at owners' risk there will be no compensation.  These people suffer a great injustice.  In the case of large companies no great hardship obtains because they are able to take precautions against this matter.  But what is the position of the cattle owner sending over his beast?  No insurance company will insure for more than 60 per cent. of the value of the beast, and they charge 3/6 a head, and in addition the value of the beast is at their own discretion.  Now that 3/6 is a charge against enterprise and against the small cattle traders in this country, but the compensation given does not cover the full value of the beast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not cover the value of the beast within forty per cent. and this trap is still open.  Anyone may land a beast and at the very moment it may seem good to the Minister for Agriculture to bring down the guillotine with something of the panic of 1923, when it was suggested that we were the originators of the foot-and-mouth disease.  The <Col N="312" /> importance of this cannot be exaggerated. It touches the whole root of our cattle trade, particularly when there is an idea that foot and mouth disease is prevalent at these ports.  It means in the long run that the Irish Government will have to act as sponsors for the cattle between leaving the Irish ports and getting over the ten hours' or whatever limit of time there will be for the quarantine.  The position at present is one where the Government will abandon the responsibility and the man will be left without any compensation.</P>

      <P>I think that any fair minded man will say that any shipper of cattle who suffers loss by having his cattle slaughtered deserves compensation and the question is who should compensate him.  The cattle came from this country having a clean bill of health.  They were held up in a port against the will of the sender for a certain time, at any rate long enough for the foot and mouth disease to occur, and all the cattle were slaughtered.  Fortunately that happens to be a matter in which both north and south are concerned.  We have not heard the Minister's statement, and I have no doubt that our anxiety will be relieved in a few minutes, when the Minister for Agriculture will tell us whether it is a subject which he discussed with the Northern Minister for Agriculture.  It is quite clear that both north and south have suffered in the same way.  Whether any action has been taken by the Minister for Agriculture or not I do not know, but clearly it is a case in which north and south can make common cause.  I presume the Northern Government would have to pay for the damage as well as we should.  It was ordered by the British Minister of Agriculture and he is liable for compensation to the owners.</P>

      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is a very important one and I desire to support it.  It seems to me that the point is this, that on a certain occasion a certain number of cattle from the North of Ireland were held up during ten hours, and during that ten hours, there occurring an outbreak of foot-and-mouth <Col N="313" /> disease, they were promptly slaughtered.  I can understand that, because the cattle could not be moved, but it is hard lines on the people who sent the cattle and they ought to be compensated. When you have to deal with three Government Departments and, perhaps, an extra one thrown in, the arrangement of a small matter&mdash;it is a small matter now when we talk in millions&mdash;of five or six thousand pounds is difficult.  As Senator O'Connor says we have now got an Irishman as the British Minister of Agriculture, and I believe he will do his best with regard to paying some of this.  I do not know that he will pay it all.  I also hear that two departments on the other side are involved in this matter.  I may as well tell the Seanad that I shall take it on myself to see Colonel Guinness and ask him what he is going to do, and in the event of not getting a satisfactory answer I shall put a question down in the House of Lords.</P>

      <P>We should all welcome a statement from the Minister on the subject.  I do not think there is any doubt whatsoever as to the opinion of the Senators on the resolution of Senator Counihan, and when we think that a sum of £4,000,000 is being paid by the British Government to the British agriculturists whose cattle had been slaughtered it seems an extraordinary thing that our Irish exporters whose cattle were slaughtered in British ports for the good of British agriculturists should be left to get their money from nobody.  I do not know whether the Irish Government should pay it or not.  In justice to our own subjects I think it is up to them to pay it if they cannot get the British Government to do it.  Certainly they should make every effort to get the British Government to pay everything that in a court of equity would seem to be a case against them. I have no doubt our Minister has done his best.  As he is here we would be all pleased if he would tell us all about the matter.  To the ordinary citizen it seems a hard case indeed, and with Senator Lord Mayo we do not like to hear that the British Ministry have not met us in the matter in a fair open way.</P>

      <P>Firstly it is necessary to give a short history of the case.  Under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, all cattle slaughtered in Ireland by order of the Department of Agriculture were paid for by the State.  That was also the position in England until 1923.  Under the Importation of Animals Act, 1922&mdash; the Act took effect as from 1923&mdash;the British modified that position so far as cattle slaughtered in England were concerned.  They had admitted liability for cattle slaughtered in England no matter where they came from except cattle slaughtered at the landing stations which are a kind of quarantine, and the normal time for cattle to remain there is ten hours.  That is the regulation, but the time may be extended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>By the British Minstry. This regulation is made in England, and the Act allows great extension That is rather an important point.  The position, therefore, at the moment in view of the two Acts, the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, and the Importation of Animals Act, 1922, is that all cattle slaughtered in Ireland by order of the Department of Agriculture on account of foot-and-mouth disease are paid for by Irish taxation through the Irish Department. All cattle slaughtered in England, no matter where they come from, on account of foot-and-mouth disease, are paid for by England with one exception&mdash;that is, where cattle are slaughtered at the landing-places.  The landing-place is a quarantine station, and under the regulations the maximum time is ten hours for the cattle to remain there.  The point is, who is to pay for any cattle slaughtered within the ten hours.  In theory, the British must assume that cattle slaughtered in what is supposed to be a quarantine station, contracted the disease somewhere else.  That is the theory, but everyone, including the English Minister, knows that cattle contracted the foot-and-mouth disease in England as a result of certain mistakes which I do not want to go into, but which were <Col N="315" /> admitted by the Inquiry set up to go into the question.  In any event, they refused to pay.  Their attitude is: &ldquo;No reasons are necessary.  We have passed an Act of Parliament setting up this quarantine station, and cannot accept liability for animals slaughtered there.  It is not our business.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Our position is equally simple.  It is our business to pay for cattle slaughtered in Ireland.  We have no other liability.  We make those payments, but will not pay for cattle slaughtered in England.</P>

      <P>Any cattle slaughtered in England, whether imported or not.  It is not like the income tax question, where everyone is agreed that the methods are unsatisfactory. It is not a simple question of that sort.  There is a big question of principle, a question which if wrongly handled would land the Irish taxpayer not into an expenditure of £5,000, or £6,000, but by the setting-up of a bad precedent, into an expenditure in the future of £500,000 or £600,000. We are asked to admit liability for cattle slaughtered in England.  I was asked what was the maximum time for which cattle should be kept at a landing-place. I said ten hours.  That is the regulation.  The Act empowers regulations to be made by which that can be extended for a much longer time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is only the first step.  When cattle land in England they are detained for a certain time in a landing-place on a quarantine station.  The next step is that they are slaughtered or taken to a market and disposed of there, but either before or after they go to the market they must be detained by the purchaser or the original importer in a farm for six days.  That period could also be extended.  You have, therefore, various stages.  First, the animal lands, and spends a certain time fixed by regulation in a quarantine. Then it must spend a certain definite time in a definite place.  That is really no hardship, because it can go to the market, be disposed of there, and then be taken to the purchaser.  It can <Col N="316" /> also be brought to the farm before the market, kept there for six days, and then bought by anyone who can keep it on his farm for four or five days. It is no hardship.  There are two stages&mdash;one, the detention of ten hours, and then the detention of six days.  Both of these periods can be extended, and other stages can be added.</P>

      <P>We have been in touch with the Northern Government on this matter since the thing happened in the year 1923.  They see eye to eye with us in our attitude on this matter.  We put the proposition to the British Government that they should pay.  They refused.  We put it to them again very strongly and they refused.  As I say, they explained their refusal probably on the ground that this is a quarantine station.  Whatever mistakes there may be, we cannot admit liability for what happens in a quarantine station, because the whole thing would fall to the ground if the quarantine station was not water-tight.  As I say, we put up the proposition to them and they refused. We went further, although I was rather against going further, and I know that there was a considerable searching of hearts in the North about going further.  We did go further, and we put up the proposition that if we could prove that in fact the infection did not take place in Ireland, would they pay, and they refused.  I do not know whether I was sorry or glad that they refused, because again that principle might be extended very far.  Anyway, we are in the unfortunate position at the moment that we pay, and the farmer is in the fortunate position that we pay for all cattle slaughtered in Ireland by our order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> The British pay for cattle slaughtered whether Irish, Canadian or any other class except cattle slaughtered in the quarantine station.  Now, we must be extremely careful not to do anything by Governmental action which would establish a precedent for the British Government to suggest, and perhaps to legislate to make a suggestion good, that we should carry this a step further and pay for all cattle not only slaughtered in the quarantine station but slaughtered during the ten days' detention I have mentioned, or slaughtered during any other stage.  If anyone will consider this they will see that there are numerous possibilities in it capable of all sorts of permutations and of combinations.  We might very easily get on to the question where the British would say that they would not pay for Irish cattle that had been imported within a week, a fortnight, or a month.  They might say that they would not pay for Irish cattle except on certain definite conditions.</P>
    <P>Our attitude to the British is that they have got to pay for all cattle slaughtered on the other side, and we have carried that point except so far as the quarantine station is concerned. We do not want to do anything which would create a precedent, especially for the sake of the very small sum of money, comparatively speaking, that is involved.  It was pointed out here by some Senators that the sum involved was extremely small.  It was pointed out in the same connection that in this dilemma where you have three Governments sparring over a question like this the unfortunate individual is going to suffer.  But I ask is there not a fourth party, and I am surprised that no one has thought about mentioning it.  What about the cattle traders themselves?  I understood Senator Counihan to say that the loss of this small sum of money was responsible, to some extent at any rate, for the decrease in the exports of cattle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. COUNIHAN Mr. COUNIHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COUNIHAN</NameTxt>

      <P>That as a result of this uncertainty exporters were unwilling to consign cattle across to the same extent as heretofore, and that this particular uncertainty had something to do and had some connection with, the decrease in the export of Irish cattle this year.  The suggestion has no contact at all with the realities of the situation. Foot-and-mouth disease has been in England since 1923.  It has probably been more severe since 1923 than during any other period in which an outbreak occurred.  Anyone who knows the conditions under which cattle are quarantined on the other side knows well that it is only a fifty-to-one chance that what occurred in connection with these Fleetwood cattle could occur again.  The results of the inquiry that was held into it were rather startling from the point of view of administration by the British Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is perfectly certain that a sum of £5,000 would cover the risks under this for an average period of 20 years.  The disease breaks out in England on an average, say, once every eight or nine years.  This last outbreak has been the most severe that has occurred in England in our memory; it has been going on now for four years.  The sum involved here is roughly £4,000.  That would be the amount of compensation. Half the cattle were owned by individuals residing in the North, and half by individuals residing in the South. The North are about equally interested with us.  The cattle traders themselves admit that a sum of £4,000 or £5,000 would cover the loss.  I imagine if a sum of £10,000 were put up, that it would make the position absolutely safe for ever afterwards.  That is what the risk comes to.  I am not suggesting the insurance of cattle for a moment.  In good times the insurance is not worth the money.  The expenses are too many and the premiums are too high.  What I do suggest is that the cattle trade should organise and <Col N="320" /> put up a sum of £5,000.  That would cover them for the next twenty years and would enable them to meet the liabilities of these unfortunate individuals who have suffered.  We must look at the question not only from the point of view of these individuals, but from the point of view of the cattle trade.  I have the greatest sympathy with these individuals, some of them small men in the trade who have lost 40 or 50 cattle each.  They are broken, and from that point of view the position could not be more serious.  But looking at it from the point of view of the trade as a whole, I ask myself is it a case in which the Government should establish this percedent?  The Northern Government are quite clear that it is not, and I am equally clear that it is not.</P>
    <P>As I say I have the greatest sympathy with the unfortunate men who have lost.  We all profess the greatest sympathy with them and a tremendous interest in the cattle industry.  The one thing we will not do is a little amount of organisation that would be necessary for the cattle trade to put up £5,000 or £7,000 as a lump sum to provide against risks of this kind.  The compound interest on that sum of money would secure the trade during <i>secula seculorum</i> against a risk of this kind.  Rather than do that the cattle trade have come to me with the suggestion that we should pay, and that we should bring in a Bill levying a certain amount on the live stock that leave Ireland.  That would get us out of a temporary difficulty, but I am perfectly satisfied that if we were to establish such a precedent it would get us into a very permanent difficulty.</P>

      <P>There is just one little point that I would like to have cleared up.  The Minister spoke of ten hours and he afterwards spoke of a number of days.  I understood that some of these cattle were delayed for nine or ten hours and some for a still longer period through no fault of theirs, and it was during this second period, I understand, that the cattle were slaughtered.</P>

I am not prepared to say that the period for 1923 might not be twelve or twenty-four hours.  They have power to extend under the Act of 1923, but the period at the present time is ten hours.</P>

      <P>I do not know that the Minister is quite certain about the period, and of course neither am I.  My information was that they were kept longer than the period they should have been detained whether that period of quarantine was nine or ten hours. But it was after that period that they were slaughtered in the quarantine station, and that makes the difficulty. I do not see myself how it is worked out, but I think that it ought to be explained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened as carefully as I could to the debates and I have tried to understand what the case is.  There are two cases, as I understand, made: one is that in the first part of the resolution, which applies, I take it, to the future, when the Minister says that a sum of £10,000 or something of that kind, if raised by the cattle trade and invested with interest would more than meet the claims that would be likely to be made against them in the next twenty years.  That is a question between the Minister and the cattle trade.  I do not know why we should interfere, but that does not dispose of the case of the men whose cattle were lost in 1923.  The Minister admits that some of these men were broken&mdash;I use his own words&mdash;by not being paid for their cattle.  I think that is a point that appeals to everybody in the Seanad.  It does seem to be a very hard case if these men are to be let down between the two Governments. I do not know whether I understood the Minister to mean that if the Irish Government themselves took the matter in hand and decided that these men should be paid, that that would be establishing such a precedent that we would have great losses piled up against Ireland in the future.  If this could be dealt with as an <i>ex gratia</i> grant and these men cleared of their loss, and leave the future to be dealt with by the trade themselves, I think the whole of this <Col N="322" /> House at any rate would agree.  The Minister ought to ask for a grant for those men who lost their cattle on account of the action taken by the British Government on the occasion complained of.  If this is only a question of four or five thousand pounds I do not think it is worth raising an international question upon the subject.  I would be inclined to think our Ministry would be taking only a just and right action if they dealt with this matter themselves in the manner I suggest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNEDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words upon this matter.  This is a case where cattle were held up in England in the lairs.  As far as I can understand, since 1911 and 1912, there has been no case of foot-and-mouth disease in Ireland.  There had been reports of foot-and-mouth disease from different parts of Ireland for two or three years, but when the European war started foot-and-mouth disease ceased until 1923, but even then I am quite confident there was no case of foot-and-mouth disease in Ireland at all.  Now, the cases of slaughter mentioned here occurred in the English lairs, and as we are aware there had been foot-and-mouth disease in different parts of England&mdash;one day in one part of the country, and another day fifty miles away.  I think it is very unfair that those men who sent over their cattle to England should be kept out of their money now for nearly <Col N="323" /> three years.  Whatever regulations may be made in the future, these men should be paid for their losses.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture should bring about some consultation between himself and the Minister for Northern Ireland and the British Minister in order to have these cases settled.  It is too long to keep these people out of their money.  It was the first case of the kind for ten years.  Irish cattle had not been held to be suffering from foot-and-mouth disease for ten years previously, and it is my contention that these cattle contracted that disease in the English lairs, and if that is so ought not England to be responsible? I say the responsibility rests with them.  They were very glad to get our cattle during the war.  Now I dare say some of them prefer the Canadian cattle.  I say now, looking at the matter not from the narrow point of view, our Minister for Agriculture should, together with the Minister for Agriculture in Northern Ireland, and in conjunction with the British Minister for.  Agriculture, try to secure a settlement for those men irrespective of what may be done in the future.  I am quite sure the Minister for Agriculture will do his best to see that these men are paid.  I say it is time to settle this matter, and I am sure the House will be unanimous in passing this resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with one point raised by the Minister in his objection to this motion.  All the material points that have been put by Senator Counihan have been admitted. It is admitted that a number of these poor people suffered from the action of the British Ministry in slaughtering their cattle in 1923.  But the point of objection put by the Minister is that if they admitted liability for the slaughter of cattle within the ten hours detention it is possible that the British Government might extend that period to ten days or to ten months, and that, as a matter of fact, they might extend it to the slaughter of any Irish cattle in districts where the disease has broken out.  I think there is not very much foundation for that fear on the <Col N="324" /> part of the Minister.  The British Ministry of Agriculture are sensible people. They are anxious to facilitate the trade in Irish cattle, so that there will be cheap food for the people of England. And I think he may put out of his head any possibility of their extending the period for slaughter without compensation if he joins with the Minister for Northern Ireland in paying this very small sum to the poor people affected. I put it in that way.  I do not think that this will create any precedent, and especially as it is so long now since the loss of these cattle occurred.</P>

I meant merely to influence the Minister in dealing with this situation. If the Minister for Agriculture, in conjunction with the Minister for Northern Ireland, would open negotiations with the British Minister for Agriculture on the lines I suggest, I think a satisfactory arrangement would be arrived at. A lot of stress has been laid by every speaker upon the few thousand pounds lost by the traders whose cattle were slaughtered in 1923.  The trade, as a whole, are more concerned with the future than with the bagatelle of four or five thousand pounds.  I said, although the Minister does not seem to agree with me, that this matter has prevented speculating by exporters.  It is the fear of being held up at the ports that is operating and no hope of merely getting compensation as the matter stands at present.</P>

After all, one result desired is that the question should be settled so that the cattle trade should know where the responsibility rests.  And if this debate has done nothing else it has satisfied me that the <Col N="325" /> Minister is quite convinced the responsibility rests with the cattle trade, and if any legislation is brought in to fix the responsibility, I am satisfied myself on which side I shall be found.  We all agree that the time has arrived to decide who is responsible for this payment. I do think the Seanad should not declare by an off-hand vote who is responsible.</P>

The fact is that the British Act regulates the period of the quarantine.  I thought I made it plain that we were in consulation with the Northern Government about this matter.  We discussed it at great length in all its bearings.  We put up the same joint proposition to the British and they turned it down.  We put it up the second time and they turned it down.  The British Government will not pay.  Senator Kennedy suggested that they ought to pay and that they were very glad to get our cattle during the war, but that is all beside the point.

      <P>That is beside the point too.  They have given us their reasons.  The suggestion now is that we should pay, and we are told that this is only a small thing.  But I do say&mdash;and in this I am expressing the considered view of the Northern Government and most of the Northern farmers as well, and our attitude is identical with theirs&mdash;that we do not think we should establish such an undesirable precedent.  In view of the smallness of the amount, it is essential that the trade should do something for itself.  I have no sympathy with the proposition that we should pay now, thereby establishing a precedent, and that the cattle trade should itself take the liability in the future.  Of course the cattle trade will be cheerful because the chances are twenty to one that the liability will be nothing.  We all hope nothing is going to happen next year or for four or five years.  If I am right at all that it is a dangerous precedent, then certainly you will agree that my attitude could be no other than that we will not take on this liability or any future liability.  I would not have attempted to discuss the matter with the cattle trade on these lines.  My view is that we would be establishing a wrong precedent.  It is the view of the Northern Government.  We have discussed this time and again.  We discussed it the last time they were down. They have not changed their minds in any way.  It is a matter for the Seanad, if you consider it is not a dangerous precedent.</P>

      <P>It cannot pass a Money Resolution, but it can suggest that a certain course be adopted by the Government.  Perhaps the Minister would clear up the matter a little further. He has spoken of the danger of a precedent, but he has not developed that, probably for very good reasons. I do not want to force him to develop it, but, at the same time, in view of the pretty general opinion that the Seanad seemed to have, in favour of the spirit <Col N="327" /> of the motion, it occurs to me that it might be desirable to have a little more light thrown on it and on what the dangerous precedent would be.  I think I myself see it.  If it were once established that compensation was to be paid by the Free State for all animals imported from Ireland and slaughtered in England, that these animals were found to be unquestionably suffering from disease, and that the disease was brought by them amongst English cattle, I can very well see the British Government saying: &ldquo;They brought the disease into our country; you must compensate our cattle owners for the losses they have suffered.&rdquo;  That is one of the dangers that I see might be opened if a precedent of the kind were established, and, therefore, the Seanad should consider this carefully and perhaps say whether it would not be better to confine this resolution to a recommendation that the losses incurred in 1923 by the owners should be made good by an <i>ex gratia</i> payment without saying now that there should be a final arrangement governing these cases in the future, which would be a very different and a very serious matter.</P>

I think the general feeling of the House is that these losses should be met by some grant or other.  Would it not be possible for the Minister to permit a little Vote to go through, say, of five or six thousand pounds, on the very definite understanding that it is not to be regarded as a precedent for the Dáil or the Seanad?

      <P>I suggest that the resolution be amended in the last four lines by inserting the words after the reference to an immediate settlement, &ldquo;by an <i>ex gratia</i> payment.&rdquo; Senator Counihan, who is simply acting as a mouthpiece for the members of his own trade, stated that he is more or less in their hands, and he would not like to take the responsibility of whittling down this motion without getting an opportunity of consulting them.  I think that the trade would probably wish to have something rather than nothing, and he might get something if he fell in with my suggestion.</P>

      <P>The amount of money involved for the Free State is about £2,500 according to the Minister.  The advice he has given is worth more than the amount of money involved, that the cattle traders should organise their business.  One would imagine from reading the papers that the Irish Cattle Traders' Association is a great body, but they come here to ask this House to support them in going over on their knees with the beggarly claim to the British Government for £2,500. They could raise this money, as Senator Mrs. Wyse Power said, by having a flag day in the Dublin markets.  The money could be very easily raised and the cattle traders would be well advised to take the advice of the Minister and organise a Protection or Defence Fund to assist any members who may meet with misfortunes seeing that the turnover of the trade runs into millions per annum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That it is expedient that a Tribunal be established for inquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance, that is to say, the retail prices (and wholesale prices if necessary) of articles of general consumption and practical methods of effecting reductions therein, with special regard to the difference between the prices received by producers or importers and the prices paid by consumers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This resolution is identical with one <Col N="330" /> that was passed in the other House. It is moved by me at the request of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I confess that I move it with a certain amount of diffidence, because I am not a great enthusiast for the appointment of commissions.  It was only when I read the Minister's own speech when moving it in the Dáil that I came to the conclusion that, at any rate, I could approve of the resolution as much as he did in his original speech.  I am inclined to think that there has been so much talk about prices, some of it justified and a great deal of it misleading and unjustifiable, that in the main it would be a good thing to have a Commission which will sit in public and hear evidence and get out a certain number of facts with regard to the price of commodities here.  The resolution provides that the Commission is to make practical suggestions for the reduction of prices.  Now, I have no objection in asking them to do so, but I do not wish to be taken as one of those who really believe that the Commission can effectually reduce prices.</P>
    <P>At the same time, in view of the promise of the Government, and in view of the fact that in the main I believe it will be a good thing to have the matter brought into public&mdash;that there should be a place where various charges could be made and answered as distinct from various paragraphs in the Press and hints in various speeches or notes in party propaganda&mdash;I think we will be wise in concurring with the Dáil in passing this resolution.  The position is this.  The resolution does not appoint a tribunal, but it gives power to the Minister to appoint one. That is, if both Houses pass a resolution in this or in similar terms, the Minister has then power to appoint a tribunal and set out its terms of reference generally within the terms of the resolution itself.  Personally, on the whole, I am inclined to agree, particularly when the Chairman is an able, experienced man, that it is better to give pretty wide powers in the terms of reference rather than to try in the actual order made by the Minister, to define too definitely the lines on which the Commission should work.  I do not think I need say anything more except <Col N="331" /> to say this, as an instance of what is in my mind.  I do believe it will do good in other instances.  There was evidence that the loaf in London, which is decidedly cheaper than the loaf in Dublin, is not the same loaf.  We can discover whether it is not, or whether there is an explanation of that, and then whether it is desirable, contrariwise, that we should have a somewhat reduced loaf.  I give this illustration of a matter that the Tribunal might be instrumental in setting right.</P>

      <P>As President of the Federation of Irish Industries a good many cases have come under my notice in which tariffs have been blamed for higher prices.  In many of the cases there was no increase whatever since the imposition of tariffs. The wholesale prices remain the same. There is very great need that profiteering on the part of retailers should be checked in some way, and I cannot see a better way than by an inquiry. Wholesale prices can be easily ascertained, and we know what the legitimate profit of the retailer should be, and what it was before tariffs were imposed.</P>

      <P>I hope that the Commission will consider evidence from all possible quarters and see where the blame lies.  I suggest that the Government itself is by no means free from blame in this matter.  The statistical tax of 6d. or whatever it is which has to be paid on parcels, certainly has had the effect of narrowing the purchasing market for the consumer.  It was easy from advertisements to buy goods in any market without restriction, and before this tax there was a wider market and much keener competition than there is at present.  That is a point I hope will not be overlooked.  Profiteering must be considered, and although the margin may be high between the wholesaler and the retailer <Col N="332" /> the enormous overhead charges thrown on the retailer by heavy burdens, such as rates, and the amounts which have to be paid to the sheltered trades in this country, must be considered.  Although the margin may appear high the charges that are thrown on the distributors, owing to rates and the monopoly of the sheltered trades is a very heavy item.</P>

      <P>I support the motion, but I think it should go a little further and consider the question of labour costs.  It is not enough to go into the retail and wholesale prices. The question is why is an article produced in this country more expensive than the same article produced in England, Scotland or Northern Ireland? Senator Douglas referred to the price of the loaf.  Bakers in Dublin get 94/- a week while those in London get 60/-. In Dublin a baker produces thirteen sacks of flour as against 22 in London. Why is that?  Why is it necessary for the Dublin baker to get more than the London baker?  In addition, wages and conditions are different in Dublin and London.  In Dublin the man who cleans the oven and carries out the bread gets 94/-, while in London the man who does that is regarded as unskilled and gets 35/- a week.  As a result the cost of living here is considerably higher than in London, and that is due to excessive labour charges.  In the district that I come from, close to the border of Northern Ireland, it is all Belfast bread that is sold there.  In Monaghan, Cavan and Louth at least half the bread sold is Belfast bread.  The Belfast baker works for 72/- a week and produces bread from 22 sacks of flour. If the Dublin baker was working under the same conditions the bread that goes to the counties I have mentioned would be produced and distributed from Dublin.  Bakers here would be employed supplying Monaghan, Cavan and Louth, and they would be paying taxes that would go to the Saorstát instead of to the Northern Government. These things have a considerable effect on the cost of living, and I suggest that the words &ldquo;the labour costs of producing such articles&rdquo; should be added to the resolution or included in the terms of reference.</P>

      <P>I raise no objection to the form of the motion or to any other motion, but I do protest against the form in which it is worded.  Why begin at the bottom?  If you are going to have a true and comprehensive Commission to inquire into all these things, with the possibility of it being of some use eventually, begin with the land.  I do not care whether it is beef, butter or beer.  Let us start with the land, which is the source of all production. If you want to find out if the retailer's price is an extravagant one or if there is profiteering you can only do so by tracing articles from their source and taking into account the cost of production to the farmer and what he gets when he sells to the wholesaler.  You have also to consider the various channels the produce goes through before the wholesaler buys it and sells it to the retailer.  You have to take into consideration all the overhead charges and the leakages that occur in the retailer's hands such as selling in small quantities.  Strictly speaking, if goods are not well handled there can be as much leakage in the sale of a stone as in the sale of a ton of stuff.  I say you can only ascertain whether retail prices are true or false by starting at the source of production, going down to the wholesaler and the retailer and discovering the process of distribution. To launch an inquiry into retail or wholesale prices is, in my opinion, starting at the wrong end.</P>

      <P>I think on a motion like this the Seanad need not go into details.  Details will have to be considered later.  If one side of a case is to be put up it is only fair that the opposite side should also be put up.  I <Col N="334" /> had the misfortune to be a member of the Prices Commission that was set up by the Government a few years ago. The members of the Commission spent a considerable amount of time dealing with the question that this motion now proposes to deal with.  The Prices Commission lacked the power that this motion proposes to give, to demand the production of evidence and documents. The Prices Commission failed because there was not the necessary legal authority to demand the production of documents.  One trade came before the Prices Commission and submitted an imaginary statement of accounts.  The Commission could not get very far with that.  I welcome any tribunal that is set up to deal fairly between all concerned, the producer, the wholesaler, the retailer and the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must refer to some remarks made by Senator O'Rourke regarding the bakery trade.  On a motion like this I would not dream of introducing a matter which would be an attack on an employer who did not pay decent wages. I do not think it would be fair to do so.  Senator O'Rourke takes advantage of the motion in order to make statements about a matter of which he knows very little.  He made a comparison of the prices of bread and wages in London and Dublin.  There is a statement on record in the Department of Industry and Commerce that was made during the sitting of the Prices Commission by the leading baker in this country.  There is no question about who the leading baker in this country is.  I put a question to him about the difference in prices and he stated that if bakers in Dublin worked for nothing at all they could not sell the loaf in Dublin as cheaply as it is sold in London.  That is on record, and there is no use in a Senator making a statement without knowing all the circumstances. Before I asked that question I knew what the answer would be. The principal baker in this country admitted that if the bakers in Dublin worked for nothing the loaf could not be produced as cheaply as it is in London. I think Senator O'Rourke should investigate the conditions of employment before making allegations against any particular trade.  If the motion is <Col N="335" /> passed, I hope that the work of the Commission will meet with more success than the Commission on Prices.</P>

      <P>That is the reason I asked what was the particular importance of the word &ldquo;Tribunal.&rdquo; The word Tribunal is of great importance, as it covers all the points you require. Apparently use is being made of an Imperial Act of 1921 by which a tribunal for purposes of this kind can be set up.  It is expressly provided in the legislation that such a tribunal shall have all the powers of a High Court as regards enforcing attendance of witnesses, examination of witnesses, and compelling production of documents. That is the purpose and object of the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that.  Everyone knows that the Prices Commission of 1922 turned out a fiasco, and I think that was one reason why it did.  Personally I have not very much hope of anything material emerging from this Commission, unless, to the extent, that it may proceed on the lines of the Food Council in London, and through publicity indicate what retail prices are and should be. The Food Council in England has done remarkably good work in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Farren has pointed out, reference has been made to matters that could be more properly dealt with before the Commission.  Some people are inclined to make wild statements that the cost of articles to the consumer here is due to the high wages.  The question of bad management and bad business methods and the over supply of retailers in proportion to the number of consumers has to be considered. Some time ago the railway managers appeared before the Railway Wages Board looking for a reduction in wages which would come to about a quarter <Col N="336" /> of a million yearly.  One of the arguments made use of was that if that relief was granted by the railway employees it would mean inevitably a fall in the cost of living, because of the reduced charges.  The demand was refused, but the Railway Tribunal just a year ago enforced a reduction in railway rates and fares which to one company meant a loss of £500,000.  They gave a half a million to the retail people who were using the railways, and everyone is aware the cost of living is as high to-day as ever it was.</P>
    <P>It does not affect the cost of living to the extent of a farthing.  The resolution refers to articles of general consumption. I presume that includes the question of stout and beer, because I think it is an article of fairly general consumption, and there is a demand for an inquiry into it.  I am afraid, however, that the Government are gradually falling into the hands of retailers and wholesalers very largely. In addition to being bankrupt politically, the Government Party are bankrupt financially.  The result is, the Government candidates of the future for some time will be people who can pay their own expenses, such as publicans, cattle-dealers, doctors, and people of that kind, and one wonders to what extent Government policy is to be compromised. We had on Monday night the bewildering spectacle of the Minister for Justice, the modern Father Mathew, appealing for votes for one of the disciples of Bacchus.  I would like to ask the Minister if he has tried to exclude the prices of beer and milk from this agreement.  We know that the publican has been selected as a candidate in the forthcoming election by the Government because he can pay his election expenses.  I hope such things will not influence the policy of the Government in matters of this kind, and that we are going to select representatives of various interests, and not give predominance in the tribunal to the retailer or wholesaler.  We should also give the fullest powers to this Commission to enable it to do its work properly.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference are drafted in such a way that they do in my opinion include labour costs.  Anything that bears on prices falls under consideration.  I think obviously labour costs would come in, not merely labour costs but the proportion which labour costs have assisted in adding to the price of any commodity here.  That, I think, is what Senator Farren was driving at.  The matter of the compulsory powers I explained in the Dáil, but it seems to have fallen on deaf ears so far as being brought outside the Dáil to the general public.  I do not expect Senators to read the Dáil reports.  They are too voluminous; but I expect newspapers to report accurately what is said in the Dáil.  It was amazing to me, after I quoted from a document, that one newspaper said editorially that it was left very vague whether compulsory powers were given or not, and another paper had a headline &ldquo;Compulsory Powers at Last.&rdquo;  We were left then between the two.  If there are any doubts I should like to remove them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This resolution is a condition precedent to the setting up of a tribunal; the resolution having been passed by both Houses, a tribunal may be appointed. Certain Acts shall apply, and it is our intention that the Evidence Act of 1921 shall apply.  Powers will be given to the Commission.  Reference has been made to a chairman.  It is quite obvious that in the Commission founded on an Act of this type the chairman must be expert in the matter of evidence.  It is my view that the chairman must have legal experience, must be able to interpret this Act and to hear evidence.  I do not want to damp any enthusiasm there is with regard to this tribunal or to throw cold water on it, but it is my belief that the result of it will be not so much suggestions as to how prices may be reduced as a definite clarifying of the public mind with regard to high prices in the country which may easily turn out to be the over-plus of the retailers, the very bad distributive system in the country, and not so much that any one individual or set of individuals have proved to be profiteers.  Nevertheless <Col N="338" /> it is better that the tribunal should get these facts laid clearly before the public and if it were only for that purpose I urge that the resolution should be passed.  There is a further hope that the tribunal may be able to make suggestions to bring down prices.  It is a further hope that the mere publicity may, in itself, effect a reduction in prices.</P>

    <P>The motion on which I am speaking is one connected with the harbours of Ireland.  I do not know whether the Seanad have carefully read it.  I shall take for granted that the members of the Seanad have read the proposal for establishing this tribunal.  Might I say I think it is a great pity that under our Standing Orders a Minister cannot bring a matter of this sort before the House by himself.  In the last two cases Senator Douglas and myself took on ourselves duties which would be better performed by the Minister, who could explain in the first case the motion to the Seanad.  At present the Standing Orders of the House prevent that being done.  Therefore, a Senator has to take up the matter and speak on it secondhand.  I should like to have it on record, if at all possible, that it should be seriously considered whether some arrangement could be made whereby the Minister could take up those matters in the Seanad.  In this case, after going carefully into it, I endorse the motion that a tribunal should be established to inquire into the conditions of the statutory harbours in the Free State.  You know very well that there are great differences between these harbours, and we know that some of them in the country are extremely hard up.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to think that in view of their condition and their usefulness compared with the amount of money it is possible for them to get, that a great deal of public good will be done.  Then there are others such as the Port and Docks Board in Dublin, where a huge board, representing various interests, manages the affairs of the port.  Connected with the Chamber of Commerce, I had a great deal to do with the evidence given before a Committee of the House of Lords long ago, when the present Port and Docks Board was established. At the time we thought it was the right way of doing it.  A long time <Col N="340" /> has elapsed since then, and I think a good many are very doubtful whether the solution arrived at was the best. Any of us can see that a huge body of people representing different interests might not be the best way of managing the Port of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I read Deputy Hewat's remarks in the Dáil.  His great fear seemed to be that such an inquiry as this would interfere with the credit of the Port and Docks Board in issuing their bonds and raising capital where they needed it.  In business we all know that the Port and Docks Board bonds are sound and good things to invest in.  The management of the port in that way is looked on as perfectly sound, and I cannot see how any inquiry of this sort is going to interfere with the money that is going to be made in the port of Dublin.  We might see some methods of administration that might be improved, and we might see that public facilities which might go towards the good of the State, might be introduced. The criticisms of the proposed tribunal in the Dáil really were not of any weight.  More or less the gentlemen who spoke approved of it, but the most they could say of it was that they did not think it was needed.  I think most of us who live in Ireland think it is needed.  It really is only part of the great inquiry which must eventually take place as to the methods of transport in the Irish Free State.  It is no good trying to put up a tribunal at present to inquire into the whole of the transport problem in the Irish Free State.  There are far too many compartments that have to be inquired into.  We know the railway problem is under very fierce criticism and is being gradually watched and looked into and lessons are being learned.  The same applies to the rates.  Now we come on to the harbours.  No tribunal could at the present deal with the transport problem in Ireland till they had a report on the harbours, and the first thing they would have to do is to appoint a committee to deal with those harbours. I think the Government are right in trying to have this tribunal put into being and to come to a decision as to what is the state of the harbours, inasmuch as the tribunal then will have <Col N="341" /> sound evidence to go on as far as the harbours are concerned.  The question of the personnel of the tribunal is, of course, extremely important, and I have no doubt whatever that the Government will try to get perfectly impartial, prudent, intelligent individuals to sit on that tribunal, whose verdict, when they give it, and their recommendations when they make them, will be available to those who come after them. I do not think there is anything more I can say on the general subject.  If any member of the Seanad cares to ask any questions, the Minister is here and can answer them.</P>

On reading the terms of the resolution, and on reading the speech of the Minister in the Dáil, I was gratified and relieved to see that it is not proposed to consider the question of laying out money on new harbours or competitive ports in other parts of the country that might enter into competition with the existing harbours.  I am sure the various harbour boards throughout Ireland will welcome the suggestion that the tribunal should have compulsory powers to call for books and also to compel witnesses to give their evidence and to give the fullest details with regard to the working of the respective ports in the country. As far as Cork Harbour is concerned, the Board were quite prepared to do so.  When this matter was first mooted in the Dáil the Chairman of the Cork Harbour Board made a public announcement to that effect, that is to say, that the Board would be glad to welcome the official auditors who would come down to examine the books, and to see to the work of the Harbour Commissioners in the past.  We in the South of Ireland did not wait for a suggestion of this kind in order to arrive at what we recognise to be the <Col N="342" /> wonderful potentiality with regard to the great port in the South of Ireland. Soon after the Free State came into existence we invited over to Ireland the harbour master or, rather, the chief engineer of one of the most important ports in the United States of America &mdash;a port that has only come into existence in comparatively recent years&mdash; the Port of Seattle.  This evening we listened here to a case put forward from the cattle trade, and the amount of money that the Government were asked to pay in that case was little more than the expenses we incurred in bringing over that expert to the Cork Harbour.</P>
      <P>That expert inquired into all the details with regard to the possibilities of Cork Harbour.  We have all these suggestions in book form, which no doubt, the Minister has seen, and has at his disposal.  That is very valuable, because we believe that any tribunal that is set up and goes into the details of the different boards mentioned in this resolution will find that the harbour in the South of Ireland, Cork Harbour, will bear favourable comparison with any other harbour board in Ireland or, for that matter, with any harbour board in the world.  It is placed on record in the printed statements of the British Admiralty what they think of that port.  The suggestion, which at this late hour I need not elaborate, as many of the Senators are anxious to get away, is that at a comparatively small cost as compared with the enormous advantage to be gained, a pier be made at right angles to the foreshore at Cobh, where the largest liners could come in, and cargoes and transport sheds could be erected. Though the channel is deep enough at the present moment, with comparatively little expense the two channels at the entrance to the harbour could be deepened six to eight feet more, and this would enable the greatest liner now afloat to come into the harbour. I strongly support the resolution, and I hope that in anything that may result from it Cork will be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>I have nothing to say except to ask one question which I have no doubt Senator Jameson will <Col N="343" /> be able to answer.  I notice that some ports are omitted from this schedule, for instance Bantry and Berehaven, and also Lough Swilly in the North. Perhaps there may be a good reason for omitting them, but I rather wonder why they have been omitted or if he can explain if there is any reason why they should not be included?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution is deliberately worded so as to refer to this schedule of harbour undertakings referred to in the motion.  Now the schedule included what is known as statutory harbours and undertakings in the Saorstát, and it was in order to make that clear that I made a statement in the Dáil into which I fear Senator Haughton may have read too much.  I said that at the moment I was proposing to set up a tribunal for inquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance, that is to say the present position of the several ports and harbours in the Saorstát, those which were maintained as statutory harbour undertakings.  I do not want the Senator to believe that I have precluded myself from granting money, aiding in the development of any harbours other than those while this inquiry is going on.  I do not wish that Senators whose constituencies include these harbours should, on the strength of this, drop around to my office, hat in hand, looking for money, perhaps. There is no intention to have any particular harbours inquired into at present, but there may be a reason for it afterwards.  I think the best method of procedure is to get these statutory harbours inquired into first, as the information in regard to them is easily procured.  We can get the Acts governing them and the methods of administration. We can get details as to their financial position and revenue, the dues which they are able to charge and which they are, in fact, charging. There may be a case afterwards for putting these and some other harbours to a particular use; if there is a case made for any harbours not under statutory control it can be made.  The <Col N="344" /> resolution is definitely intended to be confined to statutory harbours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That might vary in different cases.  You have certain harbours constructed under the Sea Fisheries Act.  Some of these are handed over to the county councils.  I cannot tell off-hand what is the position with regard to any particular harbour in the country, but I can quite accurately say that the harbours which the Senator has referred to are not statutory harbours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. WYSE POWER</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that applies to Dun Laoghaire; it is not included in the schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another difficulty with regard to Dun Laoghaire. Dun Laoghaire and Dunmore are harbours that used to be known as Crown harbours, and are now known as State harbours.  We have not included these, although to a certain extent they may come within the same definition I have given, for this reason, that they are not to any great extent trading harbours, and we have had no complaint or agitation from the agricultural or trading interest with regard to them. As a matter of fact, Dun Laoghaire harbour was examined into last year under that particular Bill called the State Harbours Bill, which was introduced and passed through the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  Objections were made to certain details, and the position with regard to its management was gone into.  As these details are still fresh I did not think it fit to include these harbours in the schedule.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanePower" hpid="Mrs. WYSE POWER Mrs. WYSE POWER">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. WYSE POWER</NameTxt>
      <P>Could not Dun Laoghaire and Dunmore harbours be put in with Dublin Port&mdash;that is what I am interested in?  Under this <Col N="345" /> tribunal it could be brought under the Dublin Port like the Skerries and Balbriggan harbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a difficulty I had not adverted to.  It is possible that there might be a recommendation from this inquiry that certain harbours might be brought under one authority.  Some people think that the harbours should be controlled by one central authority.  Senator Mrs. Wyse Power has raised the difficulty that there was not a recommendation that, say, the Dublin Port and Docks should include the Dun Laoghaire and Dunmore Harbours.  I think it could be done.  The tribunal could be given whatever information is in the possession of the Commissioners of Public Works with regard to the Dun Laoghaire harbour and then there could be a recommendation passed on whatever evidence they were able to get.  Senator Mrs. Wyse Power is right to this extent, that if the chairman of the tribunal liked to interpret the terms of reference strictly he might rule out the recommendation that the Dun Laoghaire <Col N="346" /> and Dunmore ports might be included in it.</P>

      <P>The Greater Dublin Commission has got conflicting evidence as to why Dun Laoghaire harbour should be included in the Dublin Port and Harbours Bill.  It seems to open up a very big question, and that is the reason why I raised it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to seem to be offering suggestions to the chairman of the tribunal as to how he might enlarge the terms of reference laid down, but I think the point raised by Senator Mrs. Wyse Power might be dealt with apropos of Dublin, and could not be dealt with apropos of Dun Laoghaire; but I think we could, if necessary, make reference to the tribunal.</P>
