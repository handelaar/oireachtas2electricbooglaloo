      <P>I have to inform the Seanad that on the recommendation of the Minister for Finance and myself the President has appointed Mr. Coffey as Assistant Clerk of the Seanad.  Senators may recollect that when the Seanad was first constituted we limited the appointment of Clerk and Assistant Clerk in the first instance to one year, and in this particular case Mr. Coffey has been appointed for a year.</P>

      <P>With regard to the motions standing in the names of Senators Toal, O'Farrell and Sir John Keane, I would like, if possible, that we could amalgamate them, so that one motion only would be before the Seanad, and if it meets with the views of Senator Toal I would suggest that <Col N="587" /> a motion of this sort might consolidate the whole and raise a net issue for the Seanad to discuss.  I suggest a motion in these words would meet the case:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in the opinion of the Seanad the upkeep and maintenance of the main roads and trunk roads of Saorstát Eireann should be made a national charge and that for this purpose an equitable system of road motor vehicle taxation should be established based on the usage by such vehicles of the public roads and having due regard to the damage caused thereto by vehicles of exceptional weight and capacity.</P>
      <P>In other words, I have incorporated Senator Toal's motion and the amendment that stands in the name of Senator Sir John Keane and Senator O'Farrell, and if there is no objection on the part of these Senators I think we might take it as one consolidated motion.</P>

      <P>I have not any objection, because my only desire was to raise the question generally.  I should like to widen it really &mdash; that is, to leave it open so as to cover the whole subject.  However, these motions are only intended in a general manner and I am quite satisfied that the Government would have to consider a lot of details before they could carry out any practical policy in this matter of road maintenance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion as it now stands.  In speaking on this matter I do not want to indulge in rhetoric.  I would ask the Seanad to cast its mind back for a few moments to the genesis of road taxation in the Free State.  The Local Government Act of 1898, if you will remember, changed in almost every instance the liability for road maintenance.  Part of what was called the county cess was, up to that time, borne by the landlord. Therefore the landlord had a very large interest in the economical management of the roads and in the economical <Col N="588" /> management of all kinds of affairs.  The passing of the Act of 1898 introduced a new principle altogether into road maintenance.  What was called the Agricultural Grant was devised. The Agricultural Grant, I might point out, was based on what was called a standard year, the standard year being the previous year to 1898&mdash; that is, the year 1897.  The Agricultural Grant was based on half the amount of what was called the county cess for the year ending the 30th June, 1897.  We in Ireland at that time thought that if it were proper that we should be given the management of our own affairs we should be also given the responsibility for the upkeep of the roads, but you must remember that it also swept away very largely the responsibility that the owners of property in the country had for the payment of any county cess at all.</P>
      <P>The Earl of Mayo, when he took a flight to Moscow, where he saw Socialism preached and Communism worshipped as a god, must have felt that these were happy times, when all the road charges and so forth, were borne, not any more by property and monied people, the people of the land, but by the small newly-created proprietors of that country.  The character of the roads has completely changed since that period.  At that date a county cess, as far as my memory takes me back, would have been about 10d. in the £, perhaps less, half being borne by the owner and half by the tenant. In my own county at present the road charge amounts to very nearly 4/- in the £.  Roads must be maintained.  Sir John Keane made a very able statement on the genesis of the whole motor traffic and the need for the upkeep of the roads, with all of which I agree, but I think, while agreeing that the roads require this amount of attention, care and expenditure, it is the duty of statesmen to arrive at the very best method of upkeep by the people who really use the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you travel along the roads you meet motor after motor, in most instances only carrying middlemen, hurrying to display their wares in various parts of the country, or country shopkeepers carrying their wares to <Col N="589" /> little towns, using the roads of the country.  I say they have been, and should be maintained, but I think the people who use those roads largely should be, in some way, made bear the charge.  I think the time has passed when farmers who really bear the brunt of this taxation should be asked to bear it any longer.  Equity requires that they should be relieved, to some extent, of the enormous burden of road maintenance.  Their condition, at the moment, is not good.  Their ability to pay is, on every side, admitted to be practically gone, and the danger is that, if the change suggested by this resolution is not adopted by the Government, roads must go out of repair and will no longer be available. Senator O'Farrell's resolution as to motor-lorries and the taxation of them is very good and goes a long way, but I should like that we should go a little further.  I should like that, if those charges are to be made, we should have some security that they would be paid for the relief of the roads, and at the moment we have not that security. The motor taxes are paid to the Road Fund and they distribute them as they think wise.  It may be the best method, but I think the amount paid for the wear and tear of the roads should be transferred to the authority whose roads are being used in this way.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  Various people are now using the roads with all sorts of motor vehicles; you have people with very little stake as regards property, having motor cars which may be good, bad, or indifferent.  Some of them are going through the country at rates dangerous to themselves and to the community.  As far as I know there is no compelling of these people to take out insurances for third party risks. Lots of these men, as everyone of us know, are men of straw.  If they, in their wild careering, injure pedestrians there is no redress.  I would ask those responsible to see that provision should be made whereby people could be insured against things of that kind recurring. I have nothing more, to say on this as it is urgently necessary in the interests of equity and efficiency. This resolution should be adopted and the roads should henceforth be a national charge.  It is just as equitable <Col N="590" /> that the roads should be a national charge as the Civic Guard is.  The roads are a national concern and, for that reason, I hope the Seanad will pass this resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem is a very large one.  We will see that if we look at some figures.  In England there are four and a half miles of roads per thousand of the population.  In Northern Ireland there are ten miles, and in the Free State 14½ miles per thousand of the population.  In the Free State we have something like 30,000 miles of road.  Four thousand of these are really main or trunk roads.  There are, approximately, 22,000 miles of other roads.  I think Senator Sir John Keane was wise &mdash; and I hope that Senator Bennett accepts that view &mdash; in confining this motion to the main roads of the country.  Otherwise I think the problem cannot be satisfactorily dealt with.</P>

      <P>As the motion stands it includes main roads and trunk roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Government can only hope at present to deal with main trunk roads.  I support Senator Sir John Keane's motion, but the form in which it is worded does not quite elaborate what was contained in his very instructive speech of yesterday. When the Local Government Department comes to deal with this question I hope the suggestion contained in that speech will be carefully examined. No effective attempt can be made to put the roads into the condition they should be in, unless they are largely reconstructed. The Senator's suggestion to capitalise motor taxation, or to earmark taxation derived from motor cars, is the only adequate way to deal with the problem.  I think some of the points raised by Senator Bennett are germane to the question.  A motor car that is recklessly driven does an unnecessary amount of damage to the roads, and for that purpose it is wise to consider the possibility of compulsory insurance.  I would go a little further and, in dealing with insurance, whether compulsory or voluntary, would make it a condition in every policy that at least £5 or £10, in the <Col N="591" /> case of an accident to a motor car, should be paid by the driver.  If there was a fine of £10 I think drivers would be more careful.  In supporting the motion I may say that we have had a profitable discussion and I hope that the Local Government Department will take what has been said into consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that the mover of the original amendment accepted my amendment, I have only to generally support the resolution as it now stands.  I find that those who support it have disagreed very much with one another in their method of doing so.  While seconding the amendment of Senator Sir John Keane, Senator Gogarty disagreed with everything he said.  He advocated a sort of outlawry on the highways and even in the streets.  He objected to the police control of traffic, which, in my opinion, is one of the most useful functions that the police perform in our cities.  He would have all control removed and have a regular system of freelance driving of motor cars.  I notice that Senator Gogarty also pronounced a sort of panegyric on the railways.  He described them as a dying industry. While, of course, the Senator belongs to a profession that regards death on the part of others with a great amount of philosophy, it is true, also, that doctors have often despaired of the lives of people who afterwards survived to attend some of the doctors' funerals. It may turn out that way in respect to the latest medical prophecy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all agree that the cost of road maintenance is mounting up at an alarming rate, whilst the roads, notwithstanding what may be said to the contrary, are in many districts deteriorating at a rapid rate.  At the present rate they will in a comparatively short space of time, with the growing motor traffic, become quite impassable unless drastic steps are taken.  That is the cause of the outcry against the ever-increasing rates and of the demand to make the Government responsible for the cost of construction and maintenance. Before deciding finally who shall bear the responsibility for construction and maintenance of the public roads, <Col N="592" /> it is desirable, in my opinion, that we should consider the question of regulating the use of the highways in the future.  We should know clearly where we are going before we embark on huge national expenditure on road construction and maintenance, involving a national burden.  In doing this we cannot afford to ignore some of the causes which have brought about the present state of affairs.  The introduction of mechanically propelled road vehicles immediately created a new situation.  They travel at a rapid rate. They create conditions of danger where previously there was safety, and dangerous turns and sharp corners assume new perils.  In the interests both of safety and comfort a new system of road surfacing was necessary, and a more expensive method of road maintenance.</P>
    <P>The problem, however, of the light passenger car was not insoluble.  The real problem was caused by the introduction of heavy motor lorries and passenger omnibuses with a carrying capacity ranging from 5 to 12 or 15 tons.  This inevitably meant that the old system of road was quite incapable of bearing that kind of traffic.  It has been stated by previous speakers that the present tendency is to divert all sorts of traffic, goods, passenger and live stock, from the railways to the roads.  This tendency is considerably encouraged by the fact that the community places at the disposal of these private speculators a ready-made permanent way, at the rate of about £30 per annum, without any additional cost for maintenance, as far as the permanent way is concerned; without any effective regulation regarding speed limit; without any regulation governing the safe and clean transit of goods, passengers and live stock; with no restrictions as to the roads covered, as to the fares charged, or whether they are compelled to give a certain minimum service to the public, if it does not suit them to do so.  This in effect means that the new form of transport is being heavily subsidised at the expense of the community.  Subsidies to railways and such forms of transport have always been stubbornly refused on the grounds that they are private <Col N="593" /> enterprise and should be self-supporting. Yet, we are to heavily subsidise what claims to be a rival form of transport, and we do not even go through the formula of demanding that this new transport shall conform to the minimum requirements of the people who provide that subsidy.</P>
    <P>Senator Toal says that if the railways are to continue there must be strict State supervision over all rates and fares charged.  As far as the Free State railways are concerned, last year the Railway Tribunal imposed reductions in rates and fares amounting to £500,000, and within the year the cost of living had not come down one penny. That £500,000 has gone into the pocket of middle-men.  The new form of transport which we are heavily subsidising is left without any form of control. An eminent expert has estimated that the damage done to the average road by a heavy motor lorry is at the rate of 3d. per ton mile.  I do not know that that is a fair estimate, but one knows, at all events, that one does not go far on a road for 3d.  If that is correct, in the case of a lorry that has a carrying weight of 10 tons the damage done to each mile of road every time that lorry goes out amounts to 2s. 6d. per mile. If that additional charge of 2s. 6d., which is a legitimate charge that the owner of the lorry would have to pay, were imposed or added to the charge already imposed, the cheapness of the new form of transport would not seem quite so apparent as it seems to certain people under present conditions.  It may be the policy to subsidise these people at the expense of the community, but if we are to subsidise them at least it is only elementary justice that the people from whom they have taken traffic at the present time should be exempted from paying those as subsidies. It is unfair that you should compel them to pay towards a subsidy to their rivals.  That is the crowning absurdity and the crowning injustice of the present position.</P>
    <P>A return given in the Dáil recently showed that a sum of £131,000 was paid in 1925 in rates by the Great Southern Railways Company.  A very large portion of that went towards road maintenance. The Great Northern Railway <Col N="594" /> pays over £163,000 per annum in rates and they are paying this large sum apparently in order that their competitors may all the more easily try to steal away from them the traffic which these railways have developed over a long period of years.  It will be noted that these vehicles run almost invariably parallel to the railways in order to grab up the traffic passing that way, and it is the exception to find them opening up areas in regions that have not been covered already by railways.  It is this form of transport that the ordinary citizen is asked to contribute towards by way of increased subsidy.  I do not think it matters very much what form that contribution takes.  What is the use of saying you are relieving the farmer of the cost of the maintenance of the roads by taking it off the rates and putting it on in taxation?  The great majority of the people do not own motors and the majority will not own motors in the future.  Many of them have to travel to and fro to fair and market and to church without a vehicle of any sort along roads that have become unsafe, unpleasant and generally hideous because of the motor traffic.  Is it likely that they are going to agree voluntarily to this additional taxation in one form or another in order that the traffic may pass from the roads maintained by the railway companies to the roads maintained at considerable expense by the people themselves?</P>
    <P>It may, perhaps, be pointed out that these alleged low charges have brought about no reduction in the cost of living, and that is the real test.  The cost of living is as high now as it was a year ago, or two years ago, since this motor traffic developed in an intensive way. One thing this traffic has done has been to take a lamentable toll of human life, and it will continue to do that as long as the laxity of the present regulations is permitted.  Many drivers of passenger 'buses are what Senator Gogarty would admire &mdash; highway outlaws &mdash; and they seem to have absolutely no regard for traffic regulations.  There is at present, I believe, a nominal speed limit of 12 miles for heavy 'buses, but once they get outside a town they travel up to 30 miles per hour.  I had an instance of this reckless driving mentioned to me <Col N="595" /> lately by a friend of mine who was formerly a motor driver in the Army. He was travelling on a motor bus going to Kildare one Sunday, and he said that the driver was in such a condition of intoxication that this friend of mine felt it incumbent upon him to take the wheel.  The man was in such a condition that he did not resist; evidently he had sense enough to feel that he was incapable of driving himself.</P>
    <P>At present there is no regulation by which the fitness of people to drive can be tested.  A railway engine driver has to serve a long apprenticeship, and he is subjected to severe medical and eyesight tests.  He has also to submit to a whole series of Board of Trade regulations in the interests of public safety before he is allowed to drive.  Yet, it is suggested that the inadequate restrictions that are at present in existence in regard to motor traffic should be swept away not withstanding that we are asked to subsidise this traffic to a very large extent.  If we are going to have this class of traffic with roads fit to bear it, surely it is not unjust that these people should be asked to pay a fair quota towards the provision of these roads.  The fairest and the most sensible way is to proceed on the old system, that is to make each person pay for the road in proportion to the use he makes of it, and to the damage he does to it.  The petrol or fuel tax may effect this to a certain extent but consideration will have to be given to the question of vehicles of exceptional weight which, no matter what the tax may be, will do much more damage, if they are not prohibited until such time as we have roads fit to bear them.</P>
    <P>We are often told that this is a poor country and that we cannot afford the advantages, both economic and social, that are enjoyed by the people in more favoured lands.  If that is true it is questionable whether we can afford the luxury of two or three different forms of transport and indulge in a form of cut-throat competition for a volume of traffic which has proven inadequate to make one system pay for itself.  I do not want to put back the hands of the clock or to retard progress of any kind. Progress will come no matter what the position may be, in its ordinary course, <Col N="596" /> but I do suggest that in order that this progress may be of a really progressive nature, instead of the reverse, there must be some central co-ordinating authority that will tend to make these services work in co-operation and tend to help each other rather than to work towards each other's elimination.</P>
    <P>When the Ministers and Secretaries Bill was going through, I ventured to move an amendment providing for the setting up of a Ministry of Transport which would control and co-ordinate the various forms of transport by road, water and in the air, and that, in addition, would have control of the postal and telegraph services.  Amongst the opponents of the amendment was one railway general manager, who turned pale at the very mention of State interference of any kind.  Subsequent developments may have altered his views, judging by the speeches of railway chairmen at recent meetings of railway shareholders, in which they asked for State protection.  If that Ministry were set up, we could in time dispense with the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs.  I do not suggest that we should get rid of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, because he might be a very excellent Minister for Transport. By co-ordinating the control of the various forms of transport and making the lorries feed the railways, it would be possible to effect economies and we could utilise this form of transport in those big regions which are at present not well served by rail and which now will never be served by rail because of the new orientation of traffic.  In addition, we could work the Posts and Telegraphs in co-ordination with the railways, because, after all, the postal service is essentially a transport service.  The railway stations in sparsely populated parts of the country could also be utilised as postal stations, and you could in that way solve the problem of an eight-hour day where the work is spread over ten hours. If that were the case, well, then, the argument would be, give the man some other work, and what better work could be given them than work of a postal kind, which is transport in the real sense?  In that way you would get efficiency and economy at the same <Col N="597" /> time.  I raise these questions because they are all inevitably bound up with the question of the upkeep and the construction of the roads, and this question has now reached a crisis which has got to be faced quickly and definitely, unless we are to have a collapse of the present road system altogether. We should decide, before we embark on largely increased expenditure in order to get those great, broad, strong roads, and in order to facilitate the people, what exactly they are to be used for.</P>
    <P>The suggested new form of taxes in connection with motors has not been given favourable consideration by the Government.  It is difficult to understand why a fuel tax is so persistently resisted.  We could, by the establishment of a central authority with full power to control traffic, develop an efficient traffic which would not be open to any form of objection.  Motors have excellent work to do.  They could open up the districts which serve the railways by taking the produce from those districts to the railways and in turn return bringing commodities from the railways back to the people in remote districts.  The Earl of Mayo painted a very proper picture of the service of the motor lorry going round to the farmers' houses, taking the produce from the farmers, and bringing it to the doors of the consumers, and taking back to the farmers from the towns goods and commodities and manures and all such things as they require in the pursuit of their business; but that is not what happens at all. The whole fault of the motor service system is, that the motor comes along and competes for the carriage of commodities, with the railways, over the very routes served by the railways themselves.  They take the traffic which was formerly carried by the railways, and in that competition with the railways they receive a subsidy from the ratepayers.  The consumers have been referred to by Senator Sir John Keane as if they were a water-tight section of the community, but it seems to be forgotten that thousands of workers and their families, connected with railway transport, consume a certain amount of commodities and, therefore, <Col N="598" /> are of some consideration to the shopkeepers. It is not my place to say anything about the morality of trying to secure, by a form of subsidy, the downfall of an existing industry, in which millions of money is sunk, and which gives employment to thousands of people, in order to develop a new form of transport, the benefits of which to the community are rather problematical. We have not decided on any form of transport.  The Government have not faced the issue, and, until they do so, we cannot decide in an intelligent and definite way the question of the proper maintenance of the highways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the motion now before the House but, before doing so, I would like to be satisfied as to where the cost of the upkeep of the 8,000 miles of main and trunk roads is to come from.  I would like to ask Senator Sir John Keane whether he has made up his mind as to where this cost is to come from, because, if the proportion of the cost that is at present borne by the ratepayers of the county is to be taken from them, and put upon the shoulders of the general taxpayers of the country, I am against it, and for this reason: the deterioration of the roads, to my mind, has been brought about by the failure of the County Councils, during the past ten years, to make adequate provision for the upkeep of the roads.</P>
      <P>Every member of this House is aware that in the carrying out of any business if you compare the pre-war figure with the figures to-day in very few instances is there less than a hundred per cent. of increase.</P>
      <P>I think there is no county council in the Saorstát to-day which is not paying a higher rate than a hundred per cent. over pre-war.  But when you come to the amount of money allocated for the roads you find that only in six counties of the Saorstát, during the year ending the 31st of the present month, was the rate of expenditure up to or above 100 per cent. over the 1914 figures.  I think realising that fact, people in this assembly must come to the conclusion that there has been a good deal of exaggeration about the enormous cost of the road upkeep at the present moment.</P>

    <P>There has been a lot of exaggeration, <Col N="599" /> also, about the subsidy for motors and motor lorries.  It is made to appear as if the people using the roads &mdash; that is, the motor people &mdash; were doing nothing to provide for the wear and tear caused by their use of the roads, but I would like, in considering a question like this, always to get down to hard facts and to know exactly where we stand.  I would like to point out, at the present time, that the motor people in this country are paying almost half a million a year in motor taxation.  That half a million goes for the improvement of the main and trunk roads of the country.  The total amount provided last year for roads in the Saorstát by the ratepayers to the various county councils and to the public bodies amounted to £1,400,000.  The amount subscribed in motor taxation came to very close on £500,000.  The Exchequer benefited also to the extent of £250,000 in the import duty on motor cars.  There has been a good deal of talk about subsidies, but I would like to inform this assembly that the general Treasury of the State has not so far subscribed anything towards the upkeep of the roads. Any money allocated to the county councils through the road fund came from motor taxation, and to some very small extent from the sixpenny rate in the special Act passed a few years ago which provides for the repair of broken bridges.</P>
    <P>In spite of all that has been said here to the contrary, I hold that these lorries and motors would not be so very largely used if there were not farmers in the country to burn the coal or use up the other stuffs the lorries carry.  I consider that the ratepayers have a lot to gain from a good lorry service, and I also hold that it is rather the duty of the road authorities of the State to build up the roads to meet the traffic rather than try and cut down the progressive tendency of modern traffic to suit the deteriorated, antiquated sort of roads we have in this State.  I would like also to mention the fact that last year the Roads Advisory Committee had occasion to look for some information as to the mileage of the main trunk roads, and to inquire to what <Col N="600" /> extent these had ever been steam-rolled. It might surprise some people to learn that, twelve months ago, out of the 4,500 miles of the most important roads, very little over 2,000 miles were steam-rolled; in other words, there were still 1,800 miles of the main trunk roads on which a steam-roller never had worked.  That fact should be taken into account when there is talk about roads being destroyed by heavy lorries.  Anyone who knows anything about roads knows roads that have never been steam-rolled are not fit to be called roads at all.  It might surprise people if they had the experience I have had with some of the trunk roads.  If you went to cut these roads there is not two inches of material in them.  After that depth you get down to clay, and yet these are called main trunk roads. There is hardly any highway in this country fit to be called a road.  To some extent the roads have been built up in recent years out of motorists' money. I am quite in agreement with the proposal that motor and lorry owners should be made to pay for the damage done.  I quite agree with Senator O'Farrell and others who say that they should be made to pay, and I am willing to believe that they are quite ready to pay, but I do not want people to say that they are doing nothing and that they are subsidised.</P>
    <P>The average rate spent on the roads last year was 2/5.  I have made a simple calculation.  The man with a Ford motor car pays a tax of £18.  He is paying a taxation for roads equivalent to what a farmer with a £144 valuation pays.  Up to a couple of years ago, instead of £18 he was paying £23.  I consider that the man who is paying £18 and doing but a little amount of damage is paying his way.  I very much doubt that he is doing any harm to the community.  I quite agree with Senator O'Farrell and others that when it comes to heavy traffic there ought to be a limit.  There is already in existence an order limiting the weight of lorries to nine tons.  Some people talking about lorries will tell you about some of them carrying 15 and 20 tons.  I do not believe there is a lorry in the State able to carry that, or even that the roads are fit to carry nine tons. <Col N="601" /> People will tell you that they drove behind lorries carrying 14 or 15 tons, and that these lorries travelled at 20 or 25 miles an hour.  Now a person that drove a lorry over 12 miles an hour was breaking the law, and the person who travelled behind it at 25 miles an hour was also breaking the law.  This is a case of men who see the mote in other men's eyes and cannot see the beam in their own.  If they are going to criticise others, they should keep within the law themselves.  I believe that the railways were never an economic proposition in Ireland.  When the railways came into existence we had a fairly intensively cultivated country, and the population was three or four times what it is to-day.  When the railways were built the roads were allowed to go into disrepair.  After sixty or eighty years we find that the population is halved and we find that agriculture is down to about one quarter of what it was then.  As long as I can remember, railways have been crying out about bad times and their inability to pay a dividend.  I am not one who hopes to see the railways broken up.  But, at the same time, if the railways do not justify their existence to the community, I do not believe that the community or the State, after eighty years' experience of them and finding that they did very little to build up population or industry, will be likely to be hoodwinked and induced to put too many restrictions or to put impossible restrictions in front of the development of lorry traffic.</P>
    <P>I believe that that reasonable development would be along the lines of &ldquo;laden weight,&rdquo; which should be strictly enforced.  I just made a mistake a little while ago.  I said that nine tons was the limit to the weight of lorries.  That is not so.  The limit is twelve tons for lorries at present using the roads, and the order limiting it to nine tons applies only to the import of new lorries.  No new lorries now coming in capable of bearing more than a weight of nine tons will be allowed travel over the roads.  This Seanad should hesitate before coming to a decision on this matter until they are perfectly clear as to whether the cost <Col N="602" /> of this nationalisation of roads is to come from the ordinary taxpayer or from the ratepayer.  The ordinary taxpayer in this country is in a far worse position than the farmer or ratepayer. Not alone does he pay rates but almost every bit of food he puts into his mouth is taxed.  The sort of clothes that the working man of this country is in a position to buy, the boots that he is able to purchase, are taxed.  The furniture that he uses, if he is in a condition to buy furniture, is taxed.  I do not think, bad and all as the position of the farmer may be, that he is in as bad a position as the unfortunate working man, who, even if he gets the unemployment benefit, has often to spend a considerable portion of it in taxation.</P>
    <P>I believe that a certain proportion of the cost of making those trunk roads should be borne by the ratepayer in all the counties of the Saorstát.  I do not see why they should be absolutely relieved of the cost or perhaps 50 per cent. of the total outlay on roads. There are no figures available to show exactly what was the amount spent on those 8,000 miles of road.  Those 8,000 miles of road are the most important in the country; they embrace in fact every road leading from any town or village containing 500 inhabitants. The remainder of the 46,000 miles of road in the State are only laneways and bye-ways.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that these 8,000 miles would represent anything up to 50 per cent. of the total expenditure on the roads of the State.  For that reason it is a very important decision to come to.  To shift that burthen from the shoulders of the ratepayers and put it on the shoulders of the taxpayers would be a very important decision.  I do not see why the couple of hundred thousand people in Dublin who have neither motor cars, bicycles or anything else should be expected to shoulder the cost of the maintenance of those roads. I do not see why the agricultural workers of the country should be asked to shoulder that burthen of making good roads for people who have motor cars.  For that reason, if Senator Sir John Keane makes it clear that he intends in his resolution that the money that is to be spent upon the <Col N="603" /> roads is to come from the ratepayers and the property-owners in the country and every road-user and motorist wherever he may be, in the town or country, I will have much pleasure in supporting the motion.</P>

      <P>I should like to speak a few words on this combined motion which you read out &mdash; a combination of Senator Toal's motion and Senator Sir John Keane's motion. Senator Bennett has done me the honour of mentioning my name.  Before I say anything with regard to what he said about me I want to start with this question which I put yesterday: &ldquo;If the State pays for the upkeep of the main trunk roads the money can only be found by increasing taxation, and who is going to pay that increased taxation?&rdquo; Every sort of idea, dodge and plan has been put forward by the different speakers, but none of them has faced the main question: Where is the money to come from?  Not one of them.  Is it to come out of the ratepayers' pockets?  Is it to come out of the general taxation of the country? Is it to come out of the motorists' pockets?  No Senator who has spoken has dealt with that.  Senator Bennett alluded to the Act that was passed, I think, in 1898.  He said that the owners of the land ought to be very pleased because they were relieved of this burthen of county cess.  Personally, at present, that does not interest me in the least.  Because I have sold out my land, and I am not at all affected in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say one word about Senator O'Farrell's suggestion.  His main complaint is as to the taxation of the heavy lorries.  That in itself is very good. But how are you going to carry it out? Senator Duffy has said: &ldquo;I am in favour of the taxation of heavy lorries.&rdquo;  But now those heavy lorries are for the benefit of the public.  What will the public do without heavy lorries? It is all very well saying that they do not benefit the public.  How is the farmer going to get coal and other things?  At present the lorries bring the farmers these goods.  That is quite right.  Let me just say a word about this complaint as to heavy lorries.  The <Col N="604" /> truth of the matter is this: the heavy lorry goes down the road and makes a pot-hole, small or big.  That pot-hole is filled with water.  Then the motor car comes along and sucks the water out of that hole and enlarges the hole. Then you have the recurrent damage going on on the road week after week and month after month and you cannot catch up with it.</P>
    <P>I will now go back to the question of payment and I ask myself again: &ldquo;Who is going to pay?&rdquo; If the State is going to pay for the maintenance of these roads then we will have to be further taxed.  Are we satisfied to be further taxed?  Is the ratepayer going to pay?  Yesterday I said that the farmer complained that the rates are too high already.  He has to pay heavy rates and in addition he says he is taxed for every little bit of food that he eats.  However, I would point out that we have got a free breakfast table. That is one thing, and our tea in this country is cheaper than at the other side.  I hope Senator Duffy will remember that.  Coming back now to this joint resolution, I have to say that I do not agree with it at all, because I have come to the conclusion that Senator Duffy came to when he said: &ldquo;I want to know if these roads are going to be nationalised what it is going to cost,&rdquo; and to that I say &ldquo;amen.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'HANLON Mr. O'HANLON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw attention to the statement made by Senator Duffy in which he specifically lays it down that the cost of maintenance should be borne on the rates. In his statement or comment he made a certain analysis.  I would advise him that he applies it to himself.  One question which I would like Senator Duffy to tackle is this &mdash; does he stand for the maintenance of the system of upkeep of the roads by direct labour, which is 50 per cent. more costly than by the old contract system in vogue before the introduction of the direct labour system? If he would deliver us a little homily on that and show us that he himself had investigated the problem we would be happy to know the results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to say that the maintenance of the national highways should be borne out of the rates. Senator O'Farrell said he could not <Col N="605" /> differentiate between the maintenance of the roads out of the rates and out of State funds.  Surely it is apparent that State funds are secured from the general taxpayer and that the main portion of the rates is borne by the farmer.  The farmer should be mainly responsible, through the rates, for the upkeep of the national highways.  Do the farmers require the maintenance of those highways, consisting of four thousand miles, at their present high standard? The Minister for Local Government, last July, in giving the outline of a scheme which he hoped to put into operation, said that the cost of maintenance of these roads at their present standard even would be £120 per mile. Do the farmers require the roads to be maintained at this high standard and cost?  If they do not, who requires them?  Senator O'Farrell and Senator O'Duffy laid it down as an axiom that the main cost of the maintenance of the roads should be borne by those who make most use of them and who do the most damage to the national highways. Those are maintained at a high standard at present.  If the Senators accept it as a principle that the cost should be borne by the users and if the farmers do not use them and do not require the high standard at which they are maintained, is it fair that the farmers should be saddled with the maintenance of those highways?</P>

      <P>If they own motors they pay for a portion of the maintenance.  If it is laid down as a hypothesis that a portion should be paid by the farmers, so equally should it be laid down by the farmers that a portion of the cost should be paid also out of State funds secured from the general taxpayer.  There is room for self-analysis in such matters.  I think if Senator O'Farrell studies his hypothesis, he will be satisfied that his motion cannot stand criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kenny yesterday evening said that this matter had already received the attention of the Government and referred to the findings of the Roads Advisory Committee.  I suppose he referred to it with a pardonable feeling <Col N="606" /> of self-gratification.  I read the findings of the Committee and what struck me about those findings was their glaring inconsistency. In the introductory observation of this Committee they lay down as axiomatic that the Committee had in view the guiding principle that the taxes on the roads should as far as possible be proportionate to the amount of damage done to the roads.  Later on in this report they point out that most of the evidence confirmed them in the opinion that the main users of the roads should contribute the main portion of their upkeep.  Later on they convinced themselves again that the principle they accepted at first was the right one.  Then in their findings they point out that the only equitable system is a tax on petrol and not on horse-power. Then we have a proposal to divide the tax over horse-power and petrol.  If they came to a definite decision and finally decided that the only equitable system of motor taxation was through a tax on petrol it would enable them then to hit at heavy lorries.  It is a most peculiar thing that no attempt was made to put the creation of their own reasoning into operation.  They decided that the system they would recommend would be a tax partly on horse-power and partly on petrol.  We can appreciate difficulties such as the slight difficulty with regard to reciprocity and with regard to motor licences, etc.  After that they laid down as one of the main reasons why they did not put a tax on petrol was that they feared it would press too heavily on the owners of heavy lorries.  I hope the Minister for Local Government will not act on that report.</P>
    <P>Sir John Keane's motion asks, not for the development of the roads.  He has regard to national economies.  What he asks for is that the roads be not allowed to deteriorate.  If we agree to certain standards of road-making it is necessary that we should keep our roads up to the standard.  All the energies of the State should be devoted towards their maintenance.  I take it due regard should be had to that.  Recently I made a trip to a little place outside Dublin.  Last year the road to it was excellent.  This year I found it cut to pieces.  There was a sand-pit on <Col N="607" /> the road.  I found that lorries had been carrying sand from it.  I found the number of lorries and reckoned that the total value of the sand carted would not nearly meet the amount of damage done to the roads.  Those lorries operating in the areas, possibly daily, would do damage to the extent of £20,000.  A leading county surveyor said that the minimum taxation on lorries, having regard to the amount of damage they do, would be up to £400 a year.  It is very well to say that we must not stop the hands of the clock of progress.  Neither should we move the hands of the clock too fast.  If we do we are likely to have bad time-keeping. If the whole question of transport is to be tackled I hope it will not be the subject of piecemeal legislation but be the object of a complete survey of the whole transport service.  In that way we may get that co-ordination that Senator O'Farrell hopes for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as a member of the Road Board.  The Senator who spoke last took the members of the Road Board to task for inconsistency in their report.  I desire to explain one or two points that seem inconsistent to him.  The preamble laid it down that those who caused destruction to the roads should be made pay in proportion. I hold that view still, but, in some cases, if we were to do that you might not have cars on the road at all. The cost would be so great in proportion to the destruction caused that it would be uneconomic for these people to go on the roads and trade their wares at current prices.  When we adopted and recommended a dual system of licence on petrol, side by side, we were brought to the conclusion that it would be the best alternative to a direct petrol tax.  If you are going to impose a direct petrol tax you are up against the difficulty of getting a definition sufficiently clear for Customs and Excise purposes to enable you to enforce the tax.  The Customs and Excise <Col N="608" /> people are not chemists, and the ordinary officer wants, by some simple test, to know whether the article is dutiable or subject to tax.  You must have a clear and specific definition for him to work on.  The English authorities found that was impossible, but we have given a definition with the aid of the State chemist which would be a workable one.  That is the reason we have proposed a petrol tax at all. The only condition that the State chemist and the Customs and Excise authorities laid down in the imposition of a petrol tax was there were to be no such things as exemptions or rebates. If there were exemptions on petrol used for other than motoring purposes, in trade or in dye works, that would give rise to such complications that the whole thing would be unworkable, and the expenses attached would more than outweigh the revenue brought in.</P>
      <P>Following out the principle we enunciated we thought the imposition of a licence duty concurrent with the imposition of a moderate petrol tax, would best attain the object we had in view.  If you put the full petrol tax on, you at once focus the attention of chemists and engineers to devise means whereby the tax could be evaded and then you would not get your revenue. Engineers will devise an engine which will run possibly on high-grade kerosene and will not be subject to the tax. The chemist will devise a blend of aviation spirit with a couple of gallons of high-grade petrol so that there will be only one gallon subject to the petrol tax.</P>

      <P>It speaks for itself, but it is liable to misinterpretation, seemingly, and that is what I am trying to explain.  I am speaking now, not in my own justification, but in justification of my colleagues whose names are attached to the report.  This is a clear indictment of the intelligence of these men, and an indictment against the assiduity and efforts they brought to bear on the problem.  The inference is that they did not go deeply enough into the matter, and in that way did not perform their duty.  There must be something underlying that.  One Senator has said that the whole tax should be put on petrol.  If so it would mean 9d. or 10d. per gallon and you would not derive much revenue from it, as the tax would be evaded.  We thought a duty of fourpence on petrol would not induce evasion and would not be a hardship to users other than the motor user&mdash;the industrial and domestic user.  We thought such a tax would be sure to bring in revenue and would not make it worth any man's while to go in for evading it.  He would get better results from the true petrol than from a bad blend.  We are striking at the heavy lorry.  If the heavy lorry man carries 9, 10 or 12 tons, he will possibly get 5 miles out of one gallon of oil.  The man with the high-power touring car will get 30 miles to the gallon. The lorry doing fifty miles a day for 6 days of the week would do 15,000 miles in a working year.  If you make the calculation you will see how we are striking at the man with the heavy lorry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that document we are following out the principle I have stated as far as we can practically follow it, without putting a man off the road.  He has gone to considerable expense in buying his lorry and he should not be put off the road without giving him time to adjust his position to suit the new conditions. If you take these calculations you will find how well balanced are the recommendations in the columns of that report.  As to the question of whether a man should be put off the road or not I think there should be a time limit.  We were met with two propositions in considering the report. <Col N="610" /> We had an already existing industry. It has served its purpose and it will serve many useful purposes in the future.  Many people have their money invested in the railways, and as a result of the condition of the railways these people are now suffering.  I know widows and others who have investments in railway stock and some of them are now on the dole.  The more we move in the direction of devising ways to build up better roads for this motor traffic, the more we undermine our railways, and it will take a very considerable expense to build up the roadways commensurate or proportionate to the increasing traffic.  Eventually we will have to decide whether you are to have highways for lorries of ten or twelve tons.  No expense that this country in its present financial position could stand will be equal to maintaining roads for that class of traffic.  You cannot possibly do it. What is the alternative?  I should say it is the recommendation of the Advisory Committee, in order to give us breathing time to bring our roads up to the required condition according to our financial resources.  In the course of years possibly we will have roads such as they have in England.</P>
    <P>We are at present faced with the position that we are trying to maintain the surface and reconstruct and build our roads at the same time.  We have not enough money to do it.  It is a matter that will take years and years. I suggest that in the case of these lorries of nine or ten tons a time-limit ought to be fixed, and that after that date no lorry laden with more than seven, eight or nine tons should be allowed to use the roads.  That would give the proprietors of such lorries time to accommodate themselves to the new conditions.  At the worst all they would have to do would be to provide two lorries to do the work of the one heavy lorry which they are using at present.  It will also have the result of sending back a large volume of this trade to the railways.  If lorries laden over a certain weight are prevented from using the roadways the traffic which they carry will naturally go back to the railways, to the iron road, and that is the only road that can ever <Col N="611" /> stand the traffic that is doing such an immense damage to our roads at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this matter is of such great importance that the time of the Seanad is well spent in discussing it and considering the whole question regarding the maintenance and care of our roadways.  I read the report of the Committee that considered this question and I was favourably impressed with the report and the recommendations submitted by the Committee. I do not think that in discussing this matter due consideration has been given to the recommendations contained in the Committee's report.  It appears to me that the maintenance of the trunk roads and the main roads should be a national charge.  I hope my saying so will not have a serious effect on Senator the Earl of Mayo, because yesterday when he was discussing Senator Toal's motion, he seemed to see red and his visions carried him as far as Moscow.  It does not appear to me to be of such tremendous importance, that it should throw Senator the Earl of Mayo into such a dreadful state to remove the care of the main or trunk roads out of the hands of the local authorities into those of a national authority. That is simply what the proposition is.  They were already under the control of the local authorities for the simple reason that private enterprise would not have anything to do with them as there was nothing to be made out of the upkeep of the roads. It is not a matter of such tremendous importance&mdash;taking them out of the control of the local authorities to put them into the hands of the national authorities&mdash;that Senator the Earl of Mayo should see so much red.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A statement has been made to-day by Senator Duffy who, I think, is in a position to offer a fair opinion on this question of road work.  I think he is to be congratulated on the manner in which he made the statement, which is quite distinct and should be of interest to everybody.  He told us that the amount of revenue for the current year that will be got from the taxation of motor cars will be £450,000 or, approximately, half a million.  If that is so I am greatly surprised that somebody <Col N="612" /> with financial experience could not see a way out of the question of the cost of the upkeep of the main roads.  In my opinion, if this half a million of money were capitalised the amount that would be available would be about ten million.  If that ten million of money were spent on the main roads of the country, to put them into decent repair, the cost of maintenance afterwards would not be so very heavy.  The income from this taxation afterwards would go to pay off any loan raised for the purpose of putting the main roads into a good condition.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy has told us, as a practical man who has worked on them, that the roads of this country were never in a satisfactory state, and that what is required is to put them in a satisfactory state, and that after they are put in a satisfactory state the cost of the maintenance of these roads will not be heavy.  Senator O'Hanlon is to be congratulated on his maiden speech &mdash;I mean on the manner in which he delivered his maiden speech.  From my point of view he is not to be congratulated on some of the things he said. Senator O'Hanlon and I are very old friends, but I must criticise all the same some of the remarks he made on this particular question.  He blurted out the point of view of the farmers straight off; he was hardly a second on his feet when he tried to draw a contrast between the system of direct labour employed on the roads, and the system of employing the farmers on the upkeep of the roads.  He told us, in the usual farmer's style, without giving any authority for the statement, that the difference between the upkeep of the road by direct labour and the upkeep of the road by the farmers was 50 per cent. in favour of the farmers. He gave no authority for that statement. I know very little about road-making, but I certainly know sufficient to be able to say that that is not correct. If you ask the most competent county surveyors in this country as to which is the most costly system of maintaining the thoroughfares of the country, they will tell you without hesitation that a system of direct labour, under proper supervision, is the <Col N="613" /> cheapest and the most efficient way of maintaining the main roads.</P>

      <P>It does not make much difference.  Any roads maintained by direct labour under proper supervision can be done cheaper than by employing men who are not road-makers at all.  I travelled through a good portion of the country, and I often observed that, in the slack period, farmers who have charge of the roads in their district would come along, and throw a few stones upon the road, and then they call that road-making.  Senator Duffy, who is a practical road-maker, told us that there are about 2,000 miles of main roads in Ireland that never were steam-rolled, but were in charge possibly of the road-makers Senator O'Hanlon spoke of, who do their work by throwing a few shovels of stones upon the road, and thought themselves <i>ipso facto</i> road-makers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the recommendations of the Committee that sat and examined so many witnesses on this matter, I think their recommendations have not received due consideration.  Senator Kenny made a statement that one of their recommendations was a tax on fuel, and he stated that he thought the tax of 4d. per gallon should be put on petrol.  From his figures I roughly made a calculation, and from it it would appear to me that if that principle were applied to those heavy motor lorries, considering the amount of mileage they covered in a year, in addition to the tax paid on horse power of these motors, there would be an additional tax of £50 per annum on heavy motor vehicles.  £50 in addition to the taxed horse power of these motors would be, I think, reasonable taxation for any of these people to have to pay.  I think due consideration ought to be given to the Committee's recommendations, and that this whole question should be very carefully considered. The Minister has been present in this House for the last two days listening to the whole discussion of this particular question, and I certainly trust that before it comes to a <Col N="614" /> close we shall hear a statement from him on the whole question as to the intention of his Department towards this matter.</P>

      <P>There is one point that does not seem to me to have any particular emphasis given to it and that, I think, deserves to be emphasised.  We have heard the historic controversy as between contract labour and direct labour.  I recollect another controversy that was started by the gallant county of Tipperary when it actually introduced what was then the novel system of steam-rolling. I recollect the apprehensions of the other counties with regard to that matter. Why, they said, you have got to borrow the money for the purchase of the steam-roller, and you have got to pay it back in instalments, and all that will add to the amount of the rates, and the last condition of the ratepayers will be worse then that it was before. But soon they learned from Tipperary's experience that by paying off by annual instalments the cost of the steam-roller they reduced the actual rates that the ratepayers had to pay in the end.  They found that by the use of the steamroller they were able to reconstruct roads that lasted for a period of five or six years&mdash;I forget which.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another controversy has arisen now: how are you going to maintain the roads with the present kind of heavy lorry traffic?  It is all very well to say the Government will give a loan for reconstruction, but to put the roads in a fit state to carry the heavy motor traffic would be beyond the possibilities of a county's finances.  There is no use looking back to the time when each barony paid for its own roads, and those baronies that had the fewer roads to keep were the baronies to live in because the rates there were light.  We had the county roads, which were partially paid by the whole county.  It is only tinkering with the subject to talk about repairing or maintaining a road which has not been steam-rolled and so on and is suddenly submitted to heavy motor lorry traffic.  I do not understand why the Government should not take their courage in both hands and go in for a <Col N="615" /> national loan to put the highways of the country in a condition such as you find them in other civilised countries. We think it is necessary for the advancement of the country to provide electrification under the scheme such as the Shannon scheme.  Is not transport as important as power?  Electrical power is very useful.  Industries will be started because you can have cheap power but how are you to have increased tourist traffic or how are you to carry on the transport of the country with roads such as we have heard of to-day? I suppose about one-third of them have never been steam-rolled at all.  What sort of a state will they be in after a few months of heavy lorry motor traffic?  They would simply be disembowelled.  It is obvious that we are putting no practical proposal before the Government at all, and that is why I suggest to the Government that they should take their courage in both hands and reconstruct in a proper manner the roads of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary for me to say anything.  One Senator has answered another in the debate. Senator Duffy in particular has practically voiced everything I had to say. I think we owe a debt of gratitude to Senator Sir John Keane for introducing this matter.  He has dealt with the question in a practical and helpful way and in a manner which is quite unusual, as a rule, in criticising the Government at present.  If we had, generally, criticism of that kind I think we would get along very much better. This question of road policy is a very difficult one.  Senator Kenny, who is a member of the Roads Advisory Committee, seems to be a little bit hurt that we have not already put into effect the recommendations of that Committee. I should say that probably the main reason why the recommendations of the Committee have not been given effect is because this is not really a local government so much as a financial problem.  If the State was in a sound financial condition I think the policy advised by the Roads Advisory <Col N="616" /> Committee, and recommended in substance by me to the Minister for Finance and to the Executive Council, would probably be in operation, but as is the case with most problems in other countries in Europe as well as in Ireland, finance is the difficulty.  This is a big and difficult problem.  We have something like 46,000 miles of roads, and not 30,000 as has been stated&mdash; 8,000 miles of main roads and the remainder by-roads or farm roads.  That works out roughly at the rate of 14½ miles of road to every 1,000 people in the Saorstát.  In England you have only 4½ miles to 1,000 of the population, and it is a much simpler problem for them to deal with the roads.  In 1914 the cost out of the Roads Fund for the maintenance of roads was £15 per mile. That amount was able to give the country very satisfactory roads for the kind of traffic they had to bear at that time, and if our traffic had not increased in the meantime we could get along very well with the same maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, as Senator O'Hanlon remarked, merely tarring the roads would cost £120 per mile.  Tarring a road would put it in shape for ordinary motor traffic, and even for lorries, but tarring is not sufficient for heavy lorries. It would cost a great deal more to build modern roads.  It is obvious that we are not in a position to take on anything like 46,000 miles of roads and build them up to a condition suitable for modern transport.  That is the difficulty.  As regards the ratepayers having a burden put upon them, we all realise that the rates are rather high and that they amount to a crushing burden on a great many people, but the amount that the farmers are called upon to pay in rates for roads is not by any means excessive.  The increase in rates for roads since 1914 is only 98 per cent.  The main item of cost in road upkeep is labour, and labour on roads since 1914 has gone up 146 per cent., so that as regards the amount of value, the ratepayer is relatively paying less for roads than he was in 1914.  With reference to some remarks by Senator O'Farrell, I might say that some of the railways are paying much less in rates for the upkeep of <Col N="617" /> roads than in 1914.  They are only paying 86 per cent.  At the same time, wages and salaries for railway workers have increased considerably, being in 1925 nearly three times the amount in 1913, so that the railways have nothing to shout about in this matter.</P>
    <P>Motor transport is paying its way to a large extent, and it is only because the duty on motor cars has gone up by leaps and bounds that we have roads able to stand up to modern traffic.  At present the yield is over £500,000 a year, and in 1914 it was scarcely £25,000, so that lorries are not being subsidised by the public in competition with the railways.  If there is any inequality in the present system of taxation it is rather between lorries and motor cars than between motor and railway transport, or any other system.  The heavy lorry is not paying a tax in proportion to the damage it does. We have recommended the Minister for Finance to increase the duty on heavy lorries.  I might add that does not necessarily mean we are going to increase the amount in the Road Fund to any considerable extent.  One hundred per cent. increase in the tax on lorries, assuming we do not drive the lorries off the roads, would only increase the Road Fund by over £100,000. That would not go far.  I am not an expert at finance, but I have considerable sympathy with the idea of capitalising the Road Fund.  I understand, however that in circles where they are in a position to give expert opinion on financial matters they do not look with favour on that idea.</P>
    <P>The result is where are we going to find the funds for the maintenance of the roads if we do not ask the ratepayer to bear his share?  The Road Fund account cannot be capitalised.  The Minister for Finance is not in a position to provide any more money.  We are all crying out against taxation as well as against rates.  Where is the money to come from?  That is the dilemma we are in all the time.  In the circumstances all we can do is to carry on as best we can with the funds at our disposal.  We have reduced the maximum laden weight of lorries from twelve tons to nine tons.  That is as <Col N="618" /> regards the lorries now coming in.  We could not interfere with the lorries now on the roads.  Neither could we interfere with the lorries in use in the city, because the roads in the city are strong enough to maintain that weight of traffic.  There has been a complaint about the excessive speed of motor lorries. Motor lorries are restricted to a speed of twelve miles an hour.  We have called the attention of the Minister for Justice to the fact that attempts have been made to break those regulations and several prosecutions have taken place.</P>
    <P>The law is there and it is for the public to see that the law is carried into effect.  It is not necessary for me to deal with the question of putting a tax on motor spirits.  We, as a matter of fact, recommended the Minister for Finance to do that.  But when that system of taxation was in operation before, the large demands for rebates made it administratively very difficult and as a result it had to be dropped. We anticipated that under the present Boundary the opportunities for smuggling would be so great that it would be almost impossible to put this tax into operation.  That is the main objection to the petrol tax.  We are not at all asleep with regard to this matter of the roads and road maintenance. We are doing everything in our power to develop them.  Every year there is a certain amount devoted to reconstruction and maintenance.  Though at present we may be hastening slowly we are doing as well as we can in the financial circumstances of the present time.  We are always anxious to get any help whether in the way of criticism or otherwise from Senators or Deputies.  I think this proposal for the nationalisation of the main roads should be very closely considered before you give your consent to it.  If you merely go in for the nationalisation of trunk roads you are faced with the difficulty that the material provided by us out of the National Fund for trunk roads would have an awkward way of disappearing off the trunk roads and getting on to the bye-roads. At present if the trunk roads became a national charge we would find it more costly to maintain them than to the ordinary <Col N="619" /> man in the street would appear proper.  Then if we maintain all the roads in the country the cost will go up very considerably in the central department. It would mean increasing the staff of the Department of Local Government or whatever department takes over the work.  A new staff would be required for this work.  With the present demands for a reduction we could not do that.  I have been reading criticism of roads in France and in other countries that have a national system of road maintenance, and judging by that criticism they are not a bit better off.</P>
    <P>In the Local Government Bill I did go a fair distance in the policy of road nationalisation.  Heretofore it was left to every county to make its own main road declaration.  As the result of that, in fourteen counties you had a state of things that no main road declarations were made, and you had no main roads. Now it is left to the Minister for Local Government to say what roads should be main roads.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Then, as I have already pointed out, the tendency at the present time is for the expense of road upkeep and road improvement and road reconstruction to be met out of the Road Fund&mdash;I might say out of road taxation.  The burden on the ratepayers is becoming increasingly lighter.  The ratepayer is paying a good deal less to-day than he was in 1923, even if we did not take into account the fact that the Agricultural Grant has doubled in the meantime. I do not think that there is any case at the moment for road nationalisation.</P>

      <P>Either from a commercial standpoint or from the point of view of the revenue of the Minister for Finance, I think there is no argument needed, and I think it would be very desirable that an expression of opinion should go from this Assembly as to the taxation of this article.  As a source of revenue to the Minister it is rapidly drying up.  There is no money coming to the Exchequer from it, while on the contrary it is one of the most prolific sources of employment in the country at the present time.  In 1909, when the duty on whiskey was 11/- per gallon, the whole production of whiskey in Ireland was 4,000,000 gallons.  In 1918, when the duty was raised to 30/- per gallon, it was down to two-and-a-half million gallons.  In 1925, when the duty was 72/6 per gallon, it was down to one-and-a-half millions.  For 1925-6 it is estimated at below a million gallons. Can the Minister for Finance give us any reason for retaining such a crushing impost upon Irish industries?  The average man would come to the conclusion that it is the policy of the Executive Council to bring about a complete annihilation of this industry.  Take the city of Dublin&mdash;in 1924 and 1925 two establishments carrying over a million pounds worth of capital were paying over £3,500 a week in wages.  These two establishments are now closed down.  There is not the sound of a hammer or any other work there.  And if this crushing impost is maintained there is not the slightest hope or possibility of these two establishments ever again opening their doors.  Take that heavy wage bill of an average of £3,500 a week, and remember that those men to-day are unemployed.  These men <Col N="621" /> and their families are not in a very hopeful or healthy condition.  Moreover, that does not represent the true economic effect by any means.  Because you have got to pay more than £1,500 a week in unemployment benefits through the medium of the dole.  Adding these two together you will see that this is a loss of five thousand a week to the city of Dublin.  Nothing more depressing than the position of the owners of these establishments could be pictured at the moment.  If those two establishments close down they are carrying about a million pounds worth of capital.  In the present condition of stagnation prevailing, and gauging the matter through the fluctuations on the Stock Exchange, the capital of these people has decreased by about 65 per cent. and there is not the slightest hope that these people will get a dividend of one shilling now or in the future.  I think there should be some consideration for the proprietors and those whose capital is all going and whose families are practically reduced to starvation. I think the few facts I have stated and the few figures I have given speak for themselves.</P>

Secondly, it will assist the farmers in getting a market for wheat, barley, oats and rye.  The price will be better.  The third and the most important reason is that there are several thousand people out of employment in those various distilleries.  Employment at the present is bad in the country.

      <P>When the sentiment of the House is so strongly in favour <Col N="622" /> of those motions in their different forms one wonders what can be in the minds of the Government.  You might understand that there was some strange puritanical strain coming across them late in life and that they wanted to abolish whiskey drinking, but then you are confronted by the fact that they are allowing diluted Scotch whiskey to come into the market, and so they are increasing the production and sale of that whiskey.  The population of a little island in the Hebrides fell from 16,000 to 6,000 in the last twelve years. That island has five distilleries which pay the British revenue five millions a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax on whiskey was inherited, amongst many other taxes, from the British.  When Lloyd George was floundering about looking for money he put 72/6 a gallon on whiskey.  That was accepted by the Free State apparently without question, but not without regret by us that they did not dissipate their inheritance.  It seems to me an apparently indefensible position to maintain this tax on whiskey unless they intend to abolish the industry in this country.  It is a pity that it was not protected in the same way as the Minister for Agriculture is protecting eggs, which were lower a year or two ago than Chinese eggs and now are the most sought for on the market.  Irish whiskey is failing because it is not protected.  Dunville's bilge-water in Belfast destroyed the name of whiskey coming from Ireland. There is a lot of sentimental nonsense and pious platitudes talked about our desire for union with the North, and about our gratitude towards the North. We owe them nothing because we have given them an excuse to camouflage their trade rivalry with England under the pretence of loyalty.  The North is England's second best customer. Patent-still whiskey destroyed the name of pot-still whiskey.  There is not a single pot-still whiskey coming from Scotland; all of it is consumed by blenders and the whiskies that come in are only half as strong as they should be.  In other words, we are paying full price for a half bottle of spirits.  Our industries are crushed by taxes inherited from Britain.  The only thing <Col N="623" /> that makes me wonder is that the thing is so obvious, and unless you get one of those right-about-faces from the Government I cannot understand the position.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of times my efforts at statesmanship were foiled by my being told that I was anticipated by a year or two.  When I had a brilliant notion and brought it before the Government's notice, I was told they had thought of it at least two years ago. The thing is obvious unless we are on a crusade to dry up, not our own country, because the amount of whiskey consumed in Ireland would not keep the distilleries going, but the world. It seems that we are ignorant of the fact that the thirst of the world is a fixed thing and is simply like an appetite.  It may sway from place to place, but it does not alter.  Certainly the Free State is crushing its own industry with a sort of <i>hari-kari</i> of 72/6 in the gallon.  That will not make the remainder of humanity dry.  The dreadful result of trying to make people dry in America can be seen.  It is eating into their countenances and certainly their style.  For those reasons, because barley is more native to Ireland than beet and because whiskey can keep a great deal of people in employment at a fine weekly wage and does not require bolstering up, the thing is so obvious that I should like to know who is mad, the Government or ourselves?</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words on behalf of the Government. They do not deserve the strictures passed upon them by any of the previous speakers, particularly Senator Fanning, who seems to think they are out to abolish the liquor traffic.  I think the most eloquent testimony they can give to refute that was that in the recent County Dublin election they selected a publican.  Not only that, they put on his platform and made speak on his behalf the head of the temperance party in Ireland, the Minister for Justice.  I do not think they could give a more touching exhibition of their desire to help that traffic than their action in that case. <Col N="624" /> They selected a strong candidate and, as a result, he gave a good run for his money to the Labour candidate.  In view of that, I do not think it can be laid at their door that they have any desire to hamper that industry.  Senator Gogarty must make up his mind that they are not as hostile as he thinks.  If the general election were here to-morrow you would find the great proportion of the Government candidates to be candidates interested in the liquor trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNEDY</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald has given details of the duty charged on spirits.  I would like to compare the duty charged pre-war and at present on beer.  The duty on beer in November, 1914, was 7/9 per standard barrel. In that month it was increased to 23/- per standard barrel.  In April, 1916, the duty was increased from 23/- to 24/-; on April 23rd, 1918, it was increased from 24/- to 50/-; on April 1st, 1919, the duty was again raised to 70/-; on April 20th, 1920, the duty was raised to 100/- per standard barrel.  Is there any sense or reason in keeping on a duty like that now?  Three years ago the British Chancellor of the Exchequer saw his way to reduce the tax by £1 4s. per standard barrel.  The duty on beer in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is now £1 4s. a barrel less than it is in the Free State.  Is there any justification for keeping on what I consider to be the present monstrous tax of 100/- per barrel on beer?  I was speaking to a director of a brewery in Dublin recently and he told me that if the duty was not reduced very considerably in the coming Budget his firm would have to close down.  He also told me that that would mean the dismissal of 300 hands.  These 300 men might be turned out on the streets of Dublin to join the present army of unemployed. They would not get employment in any of the other breweries as their services would not be required.  I am glad to say that we have one great brewery in Dublin that employs a very large number of men and pays good wages, but it could not employ the men thrown out of work.  If the Government does not see its way to reduce the duty considerably, on both beer and spirits, it will <Col N="625" /> crush out a number of distilleries and breweries in the Free State.</P>
      <P>As to the question of barley, the crop last year, owing to the fine weather that prevailed, was the best that the farmers had for many years.  The people thought they would get a good price for their barley but in some places they only got 15/- and in other places 17/6 a barrel.  Two of the distilleries did not distil any last year. There was no sale for a good deal of the barley beyond what was sold as seed.  The by-products of brewing, the grains, were very largely availed of for the feeding of cattle.  Grains went all over Ireland formerly.  It was customary to see from 50 to 100 cars waiting outside the breweries to take the grains away.  There is not one-tenth of the brewing and distilling in Ireland now that there was ten years ago.</P>
