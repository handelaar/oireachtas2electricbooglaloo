      <P>I want to remind the House that in regard to the Rules of Court we appointed a committee at our last meeting to look into the rules and report their opinion upon them.  The committee has met and has practically finished its work, and we hope the report will be in the hands of Senators by Monday next.  I also wish to mention that I was asked my views as to the meaning of the section in the Courts of Justice Act which deals with the question of the approval or disapproval of these rules.  It was suggested at the time, I think by the Minister for Justice, that these rules, having regard to the provision of the statute, would have to be approved or rejected <i>in globo.</i>  I stated, at the time, that I myself did not take that view, in answer to a question by a Senator. I said that I would look into the matter.  I have carefully considered the matter since then and I am satisfied that that is not a true construction of the Act.  I am quite satisfied that it is within the power of either House to disapprove of any one of these rules, whether they approve of the remainder or not.  Otherwise, there would be an extraordinary position.  The Rules for the Circuit Court, for example, number 483.  If that view is right, and if for any reason this House, or the Dáil, rejected, or felt that they should reject, any one of these rules, they would have to reject the remaining 482.  That cannot be the true construction of the section, and I am satisfied that the true construction is that the House has power to approve or disapprove of all, or any, and the report of the committee will be based on that assumption.  I also wish to mention that the House is not bound by the report of the committee, and any Senator <Col N="950" /> who thinks that there is any objection to any of the rules will be at liberty to call attention to it when we meet to-morrow week, and move its rejection. I am not inviting them to do it, but I am letting them know that they are not necessarily bound to adopt the report of the committee.</P>

      <P>Senators will see on the Order Paper a series of amendments to this Bill tabled in the name of Senator Sir John Keane, but at the time he sent these amendments he also sent, by the same post, a number of other amendments.  The set of amendments on the Order Paper was delivered yesterday morning, but the remainder, for some reason or other, was not delivered until late in the evening. Consequently, they do not appear on the Order Paper, but the Clerk has printed them all on a separate sheet, and it will be better for Senators, when dealing with the amendments, to take them from that sheet.</P>

      <P>I desire to give notice that I shall raise, on the motion for the adjournment, the question of the delay in the delivery of letters.  I am not referring to this specific case, as there are other cases which I should like to mention.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION I.</P>
      <P>(1)  As soon as conveniently may be after the passing of this Act the Minister for Finance shall establish a Commission (in this Act referred to as &ldquo;the Commission&rdquo;) which shall be styled &ldquo;the Tariff Commission&rdquo; and shall consist of three members of whom one, who shall be chairman, shall be nominated by the Minister for Finance, one shall be nominated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and one shall be nominated by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Nominations of members of the Tariff Commission shall be made from time to time as occasion requires, <Col N="951" /> and every member shall, unless he previously dies or resigns, retain his membership for two years from the date of his nomination, but shall be eligible for renomination.</P>
    <P>The following amendments stood in the name of Sir John Keane:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Section 1, sub-section (1).  To delete all after the word &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; in line 19 down to the end of the sub-section.</P>
    <P>2.  Section 1, sub-section (1).  To insert after the sub-section a new sub-section (2) as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Commission shall consist of three members, who shall be nominated by the Executive Council, of which not more than one may be a civil servant.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take both of these amendments together, and my object in moving them is to give the Tariff Commission something wider than a mere departmental basis.  My view is that this matter is one of extreme gravity.  The recommendations of the Commission may have very far-reaching consequences, so that the tribunal should be something much bigger and more representative than consisting merely of nominees of various Departments. My object is to secure that the big aspect of the question shall be considered and that the Commission shall be appointed, not merely as a sort of compromise between various departmental points of view, but on the grounds of big national policy.  In my opinion, the appointment should be made by the Executive Council and not merely on the nomination of individual Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one very strong argument against the proposal, and that is found in the rather peculiar feature of our Constitution, which provides that we are to have certain Ministers who are not members of the Executive Council.  The Minister for Agriculture is one of those who are not members of the Executive Council, and it was felt that in the setting up of this tribunal he ought to be specifically consulted and have a specific voice.  In <Col N="952" /> the past we have had, in spite of the provisions of the Constitution, in preparing budgets and in deciding tariff proposals, actually in practice to treat the Minister for Agriculture as if he were a member of the Executive Council and bring him into consultation. We did that because we all belong to one political party, but if we did not all belong to one political party, it might have been difficult to bring in a Minister who was not a member of the Executive Council, who did not share their responsibilities, and who was not obliged to stand or fall with them.  In certain circumstances, if the Commission were appointed by the Executive Council, it might happen that the views of the Minister for Agriculture would not have the weight we think that they ought to have.  It is for that reason that it was decided that the committee should be constituted as suggested in the Bill.  As a matter of fact, all tariff proposals in the past have been examined by a committee consisting of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Agriculture, and the Minister for Finance. I would suggest that that is really the most satisfactory way to deal with the question in all the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 1, sub-section (1).  &ldquo;To insert after the sub-section a new sub-section (2) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Commission shall consist of three members, of which not more than one may be a civil servant.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard this as a very important amendment, raising the whole question of the personnel of the Commission. This matter was referred to and debated at length in the other House.  I consider that a commission wholly composed of civil servants, as the Government has announced, is not a satisfactory one.  I ask the House to take the view that civil servants are not by nature constituted and trained to deal with the intricate and involved questions of tariffs, to sift and examine evidence that will be advanced by the various parties seeking tariffs, or to give an opinion as to the consequences and of the invisible items&mdash;and the invisible items are the difficult ones&mdash;involved in any such recommendation. If only one civil servant was chosen I would not object, but I am of the opinion that some person with a legal training, a retired judge or barrister, who is accustomed to evidence and pleading, should be appointed.  I suggest that it might be possible to have an accountant of some eminence on it. I do not wish to see business specially represented, even though such a representative is not actually concerned with the application.  I do not wish to see people actually engaged in business, <Col N="954" /> trade or commerce on the Commission. I should like to see someone on it with a judicial training, but I strongly object, and I hope the House will endorse my view, to having the Commission wholly composed of civil servants.  Naturally, having regard to their close and intimate relations with the Government, civil servants cannot be immune from the policy of the Government. That is out of the question. It is expecting too much to think that they could take an absolutely detached view from that held by the Government. I hope the House will take that view, and make it impossible for the Government to carry out its present expressed intention, of having the Commission composed entirely of civil servants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a great deal of weight in the views that have been expressed by Senator Sir John Keane.  I do not know if the Government has made a decision on this issue or not, but I would suggest that it is one that might be very usefully considered.  Taking them all round, civil servants are people who discharge their duties in a most conscientious manner, but I am not at all certain that they are the people best qualified to advise us on the protection of industries.  I would like to see something on the basis of the American Tariff Commission formed which makes certain recommendations to Congress, and which may or may not be carried into effect.  If you are to have civil servants only to advise the country on such very important and intricate proposals you will lack in authority.  I think you will find the authority very much enhanced, so far as the Commission is concerned, if you take in some outsiders who would be well-known business men, well-known agriculturists, or well-known <Col N="955" /> lawyers.  The Commission should be composed of those who could not be held to have any axe to grind.  It is difficult to find people without an axe to grind, but I think we could find them in this country.  There are persons whose names occur to me who would be capable of giving disinterested advice.  I hope the Government has not made up its mind to confine the Commission to civil servants, estimable as civil servants are.  In view of the importance of the matter and of the weight which its recommendations should carry in the country, I think it would be better that the Commission should be more widely representative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HAUGHTON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to be done by the Executive Council.  I think the work of the Commission would be done much more expeditiously by confining it to representatives of the Department of Finance, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture.  I know some industries in the South of Ireland that need to be expeditiously handled, or otherwise the industries concerned will be transferred across the Channel.  On the other hand, there are other manufacturers in this country who do not want at any cost a tariff placed on their manufactures which are largely those of an export character, and I believe the Commission, as proposed, will be much better able to handle questions than others brought in from outside.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister to answer a question which is a matter of doubt generally? Is not this Bill intended as a temporary measure not to last beyond two years?

      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know what the views of the Government are.  The actual subject of the amendment is not in the Bill, and the proposal of Senator Sir John Keane is merely based on a casual remark which was made by the Minister in the Dáil.  There is a great deal to be said on both sides.  Civil servants are not usually put on to commissions of this kind.  They are appointed as secretaries, but not as members of a commission. I realise that for a commission of this kind, which is to be available for all time, it would be important for the Government to get members who would attend regularly.  Sometimes it is difficult to get members to attend a commission.  Possibly the Government has something of that kind in their heads when the Minister suggests that civil servants only are to serve on the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Bill was before the Dáil I stated that the present intention of the Government was to appoint three civil servants.  I also said that we did not bind ourselves to appointing three civil servants.  Our object is to get the best possible body to do the work, and because we wish to do that, I resist Senator Sir John Keane's amendment.  I prefer that we should not be tied as to personnel, but should be free to get the best personnel available. We have found it difficult to get suitable people outside for various commissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, there were advisory committees mentioned in the Seanad a week or two ago, and in filling up these bodies we experienced great difficulty. It would still be more difficult to get outsiders in the Tariff Commission because there are a great number of people interested and prejudiced one way or the other.  We do not want anyone in the nature of a partisan.  If we had anyone of that nature grave doubts would be expressed even on matters of fact.  The Committee will <Col N="957" /> not only be asked to deal with matters of fact as set out in the Schedule, but with certain aspects of policy.  Even on matters of fact the findings of the Commission would be regarded with suspicion if people, interested one way or the other, were appointed on it.  That restricts outsiders who would be available otherwise.</P>
    <P>A merchant dealing with goods manufactured in Great Britain might be impartial and a good man, but his work would be attacked and criticised, and people would say that he had an interest in preventing protection.  On the other hand, anyone interested in manufacture might be an impartial man, but his membership would give rise to suspicion and would be questioned. A person like a retired judge might not be willing to give the time necessary, because this will need a great deal of time and will last over a considerable period.  The desire of the Government is the same.  Members should act on the Commission for a considerable time so that we will not have chopping and changing, and evidence looked at from one point of view to-day and another to-morrow.  We want a body which will treat a variety of applications on a uniform basis, and from the same point of view.  Certain people who would be desirable in themselves, who are impartial and independent and who might be looked upon by the public as impartial and independent, might not be willing to give the time.  Although there are citizens willing to give public service, yet cases have frequently arisen when it is found difficult to get suitable people to undertake arduous service such as this would be.</P>
    <P>We believe we can get very good civil servants for the work, men who are of an independent turn of mind, who would be impartial, who are not interested, and who can be said not to be interested.  There are always two points of view about the relationship of civil servants to the Government.  Some people accuse us of being merely the mouthpieces of the civil servants.  On the other hand, some people say they are entirely subservient and have no independence at all.  I do not agree with either point of view, and I believe <Col N="958" /> we can get a body of civil servants who can deal impartially with the matter. On the other hand, if some person were highly recommended to us who was not a civil servant, we are not committed to three civil servants and we should consider the name of such a person most carefully, being quite willing to appoint him if we found somebody willing and in every way suitable.  I think it is better to leave the matter open.  The intention of the Government arises from the circumstances I stated.  There would be practical difficulties in choosing the personnel if an amendment were passed saying there should be only one civil servant.  As I have already pointed out, the constitutional position creates difficulties. There are people who are not members of the Executive Council, and you cannot always rely on having the give and take you might have between members of the Executive Council.  I might very strongly desire to have as a civil servant, somebody on whom I rely very greatly.  On the other hand, the Minister for Agriculture might have someone in his Department whom he regarded as the ideal person to see that the agricultural point of view is kept in mind, and if only one civil servant was appointed, difficulties might arise. As we are not both members of the Executive Council it might be difficult to reach accommodation.  If we were both members we could leave it to the majority of the council to decide.  That is a minor difficulty but a practical one involved in the course suggested by Senator Sir John Keane.</P>
    <P>In reply to what Senator Sir Nugent Everard said, this is not a temporary measure, but if it had not been urged on us that there were certain obligations that must and ought to be considered and, if necessary, dealt with within a reasonable period, we probably would not have introduced this Bill at the present stage.  If it had not been put to us very strongly that there were industries which would disappear if nothing were done, until after the General Election, and that at any rate their cases should be considered, we should not have introduced this Bill, but would have let the whole matter stand.  It is out of my explanation <Col N="959" /> of that side of the case that members' misapprehensions, with regard to the temporary nature of the proposal, arose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'HANLON Mr. O'HANLON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement rather inclines me to the belief that he has a leaning towards the appointment of civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'HANLON Mr. O'HANLON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>His remarks in regard to prejudices might, in a way, be construed to apply to civil servants as well as to those outside the ranks of the Civil Service.  Senator Sir John Keane rightly remarked that civil servants, who are daily in touch with the Government Party, must be subject to the infiltration of ideas, tendencies and leanings of the Governmental Party, and being human, they must undoubtedly be influenced by that infiltration.  As regards the question of getting men outside the ranks of the Civil Service to give time and attention to the matters which come before the Commission, it should be noted that those representatives who serve on the various Commissions at present are unpaid, and civil servants who take up this work will be paid.  If persons outside the ranks of the Civil Service were appointed to the Tariff Commission and were paid, undoubtedly, men could be got to act on the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be civil servants then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'HANLON Mr. O'HANLON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>If men outside the ranks of the Civil Service were appointed, and were paid they would undoubtedly act.  Take, for instance, the Railway Tribunal.  The members of that body are not civil servants, but they are paid.  They do their work, and there are no complaints about it. The very same thing could apply in the case of the Tariff Commission and outsiders should not be excluded on the ground of the difficulty of getting proper men.  It should not be necessary to confine the Commission to civil servants. The Minister has shown a very definite tendency in that respect and I do not see why we should be reduced <Col N="960" /> to such a state of bureaucracy where civil servants would determine the policy of the State.  Their duty should be confined to carrying on administration. I strongly support Senator Sir John Keane's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Seanad will not pass this amendment.  If the Seanad were prepared to press for the appointment of a paid independent Commission, or even of a paid independent chairman, I would be prepared to support it, but no amendment of that kind has come forward, and I take it, at present, at any rate, the Government are not prepared themselves to undertake the necessary expenditure.  It seems to me that what is required is the maximum of independence for the Commission.  It does not follow that because a trader or manufacturer or a man having business interests in England is appointed, he would act other than scrupulously and impartially, but it seems to me certain if he does act that his motives will be impugned and that he will find it impossible to remain on the Commission, not because he is doing anything wrong, but because those associated with him in business are being charged with influencing him wrongly.  That is almost inevitable, and for that reason, unless you are prepared to get persons who will be paid and independent and who will be for all practical purposes civil servants, I would frankly say that a Commission of civil servants should be appointed rather than that the Dáil and Seanad should press the Government to look for and get other persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Theoretically, it would be a very good thing to get a competent accountant, as mentioned by Senator Sir John Keane, but practically, unless you are prepared to pay that competent accountant something like he is earning at the present moment&mdash;and that is a very large sum, as I happen to know, more, perhaps, than the House would be prepared to sanction&mdash;then you have to take an accountant from a firm, which, if it is not actually doing the business, is, potentially, at any rate, liable to undertake accountancy business for a class of manufacturer or trader who will be affected by tariffs. Then it will promptly be suggested <Col N="961" /> that these accountants are acting in the interests of certain clients of theirs, or of certain prospective clients.  I do not want for a moment to suggest that I believe in the truth of such an allegation. What I do suggest is that the appointment of such persons would lead to a weakening of the position of the Commission from this kind of suggestion, not that I think it would affect the findings, but it would affect the Commission, and that, I believe, would be most unfortunate.  For that reason, I believe that until it is at work for some time and until public opinion is prepared to pay an independent person, as in the United States, such person to act as chairman&mdash;to act, practically, as the Tariff Commission&mdash; I believe civil servants would be the best for the purpose, taking the matter as a whole.  I am certainly against this amendment, because I would prefer to see a majority of civil servants dealing with a matter of this kind.</P>

      <P>Senator Douglas has said that he doubts if the Government is in a position to appoint men or to pay them, but he has evidently overlooked the provisions of Section 8, which provides that the expenses of the Commission, including the remuneration of members, shall be paid by the Government.

      <P>I frankly admit that I am very much disappointed that this debate does not mark the reality and magnitude of this issue.  Here we have been discussing the very important matter of the composition of the Tariff Commission, and it has now come down to a question of compromise and expense. Nobody is more anxious than I am for economy, but we have to look at the unseen.  It is the unseen that governs all tariff questions and that dominates the issue.  Take, for example, if a tariff of a shilling is imposed on a pair of boots.  I do not know how many pairs of boots are worn annually in Ireland, but to put a shilling on each pair of boots worn by the population means a tax of 3,000,000 shillings annually.  Enormous issues are involved, and I am disappointed that this discussion should be brought down to some small question of compromise and of the inability to pay or to get people to serve on the Commission.  My point is that the magnitude of these tariff issues are being overlooked at present.</P>

      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;modification&rdquo; in line 33, to insert the word &ldquo;abolition.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that this amendment will be quite so simple.  The object of it is to ensure that an applicant may demand the abolition of a duty.  The Minister again may say that he is advised that &ldquo;modification&rdquo; involves, or may be held to involve, &ldquo;abolition.&rdquo; If he does I should answer that he might do away with all doubts by the insertion of the word &ldquo;abolition.&rdquo;  I gather from the Minister's gesture that he does not, and so I will proceed to argue the case.  The difficulty in this whole matter all along, and the objection that some of us take to the way in which this whole tariff question is being handled, is the absence of any declaration of policy.  At the outset, the Government was undoubtedly seeking a policy or it would not have appointed a Commission to inquire.  That Commission did not deal with the broad principle, but with specific cases with a view to advising the Government on policy.  No policy has emerged and no policy is yet feasible.  If any policy was possible and the Government wanted to put it up, a proviso in the Preamble would be required&mdash;&ldquo;Whereas it is desirable to rescue or to protect industries from extinction without undue cost to the consumer.&rdquo; That would, no doubt, be open to criticism, <Col N="964" /> but it would at least show what was in mind.  Or I might suggest a Preamble&mdash;&ldquo;Whereas in view of the approaching General Election it is desirable to have power to use tariffs as required, a Commission is hereby set up.&rdquo;  That is only expressing in a way a view of policy, not what I say is the policy that the Government has in view.</P>
    <P>But we do not like the way in which this exceedingly important matter is allowed to drift on without any declaration of policy.  A fundamental question of policy is involved and we want the Government to declare themselves on this point.  Is it open to those who are suffering from the duties to come in and say: &ldquo;We want these duties removed&rdquo;?  The Government might say: &ldquo;No, we cannot allow that, because we are under a quasi-contractual obligation, and people have sunk capital and undertaken commitments.&rdquo; But suppose it can be shown that these commitments are of a comparatively small kind and can easily be liquidated, still the door is shut absolutely to any abolition of duties, however ineffective, unsuitable and costly they may have been found to be in practice.  One thing will occur to us all, I think, the case of bottles.  I would like the Government to deal with that and to say what they claim to have done for the bottle industry by the tariff.  They have increased the price of bottles by, I believe, 25 per cent.  They have fostered the home manufacture of a bottle which is so bad in quality that I believe it will not be used where imported bottles can be obtained, although the imported bottles are dearer.  Further, I understand that in addition to the duty they have come to the assistance of the bottle industry under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.</P>
    <P>That is an example, I submit, of the totally mistaken application of this fostering power, and the sooner it is abolished the better.  The effect of the abolition would be to revise and stimulate our export bottling trade, because it is obvious that we are not exporting bottles now.  The bottle, I am informed, that the exporters use must be of a kind and quality that must be imported, although it is 25 per cent <Col N="965" /> dearer.  As time goes on the trade interests involved will feel the pressure of those duties more and more.  Is it reasonable then to say, as implied in the Bill, that in the interests of the consumer, of the majority, and I put it even on as low a ground as in the interests of electioneering tactics, that a large majority of consumers should have not the power to come along and ask that certain duties should be revised or, if necessary, abolished?</P>
    <P>The effect of this debate, I hope, will be to get from the Government some declaration of policy with regard to the tariff question.  The Bill at present has for its object the setting up of a body to investigate and make a report. Having got a report, what is the Government going to do with it?  If we are to judge from the experience of other countries, it is almost impossible to keep any of those tariff questions out of politics.  They have got into politics on every occasion that they have turned up.  The big financial interests dominate politics in tariff matters. I am not going to pursue that further, but you cannot shut your eyes to the fact that the powerful financial interests dominate in these matters.  We would like to know what is the Government's policy on this tariff question generally?  It should have been announced long before these duties were introduced at all, and should not be still as an entirely undecided matter.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Senator that we should ask the Government, at this moment, for a declaration of policy on such a difficult question as to whether we ought to have free trade or protection. I do not suppose that the Government has made up its mind on the question as, I am perfectly certain, the country has not.  If I may say so, I think the Government is pursuing the wise and obviously natural course, of waiting until the country makes up its mind as to what it really wants to do.  But, having said so much, I think, Senator Sir John Keane's amendment is a good one, and I am going to vote for it if it goes to a division, and for this simple reason: It does not tie the hands of the Minister or compel him to do anything <Col N="966" /> he does not want to do, but it gives the Minister additional scope in the exercise of his administrative capacity.  If he chooses to abolish a duty he can refer the abolition of that duty to the Tariff Commission, and he can have their advice.  He is not bound to do so; it is perfectly permissive.</P>

      <P>I should, also, like to support the amendment.  I do so, because we all know there may be danger, not an immediate danger, but a danger in the course of time, of one specific manufacturer predominating through creating a trust in a particular interest in the country or in a particular trade.  There may be a number of smaller people engaged in the trade who feel that the tariffs are aiding that particular man in the furtherance of his designs to the injury of the community. A combination of these people might be got together to apply for the abolition of a duty which is so offensive to them.  As things stand, I can visualise a number of men not wanting to appeal collectively for modification, but whom the larger question of total abolition might bring together, and, I think, in that way, we might have an effective safeguard or medium of opening up a question which might be against the interests of the community as a whole.  From that point of view, I think the amendment should be supported.</P>

      <P>If this amendment is in order, surely sub-section (1) of Section 2 would have to be altered.  The sub-section to admit such application reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever an application is made to the Minister for Finance by any persons substantially representative of the persons engaged or proposing to engage in the production in Saorstát Eireann of goods of any particular class or description.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is not likely that people who are engaged at present or people who are proposing to engage in such industries would apply for the abolition of any privileges those particular industries might have.  I presume that abolition in the ordinary sense would mean depriving an industry of any tariff it has already.</P>

      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he should accept this amendment because it gives him additional powers.  It is quite conceivable that a duty that is put on in favour of some particular trade may in the end do harm, and surely one of the best ways of bringing that to the mind of the Minister is to have it referred to this Commission?  It would be impossible, as the section now stands, to have the question of the abolition of the duty which is on any imported goods at present, and which may be doing harm, sent to the Commission. I suggest to the Minister that he ought to consider this amendment and accept it on these grounds.  It does not bind him in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>The feverish anxiety of Senator Sir John Keane, lest by any chance industries might be established, is a very interesting study in psychology.  The Minister, in dealing with his Finance Bill last year, said that the duties which he was then imposing were experimental, and that it would be only fair to those who relied on these duties and who invested their money in industries that they should get a fair and exhaustive trial. I think the Minister mentioned a period of something in the neighbourhood of ten years as the period of trial for the experiment.  If this word &ldquo;abolition&rdquo; is put into the section it will be a pointer to the Commission, and a menace to those who have invested or who have an intention of investing <Col N="968" /> their money in this country on the faith of those duties being given a fair trial.  Any man who has any regard for his capital will take very good care that he will not invest it in these industries if the word &ldquo;abolition&rdquo; is put in.  We got a dissertation on the price and quality of the bottles produced here.  I know a gentleman, the representative of a cross-Channel bottle firm, and he tells me his firm has been hard hit and he has been hard hit because his firm, with a capital of over one million pounds, cannot compete with the bottles made here in Ireland. I will give Senator Sir John Keane full particulars with regard to this.  I do not like to mention names in a public debate of this sort.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Bennett about the danger of trusts, I think the Senator need not worry his mind in the matter of the possible harm that trusts may do to industries in Ireland.  Even if there were trusts springing up in due course, it seems to be only the natural modern development such as has taken place in England and America.  It is a natural development that those who have vast accumulations of capital should come together to preserve their interests.  I believe there is a trust in the glass trade in England.  This is what we are competing with, and lest we are to have any chance of competing with it, the word &ldquo;abolition&rdquo; is to be introduced into this section.  After all, I have myself seen in this country, and in parts of England, including London, the old Irish glass, the Waterford glass, offered for sale at very fancy prices.  Is it outside the bounds of possibility that the skill of our craftsmen may be revived, at a relatively small cost, and that such an industry may be introduced into this country again? Senator Sir John Keane seems to be terribly afraid it will.</P>

      <P>The anxiety of those who are anxious for an extension of tariffs to see that no case can possibly be made for the abolition of any tariff presents us also with an interesting study in psychology.  Is it to be argued that if there is a tariff in respect of a certain commodity, and if <Col N="969" /> those engaged in the production of that commodity combine to form a trust and to fleece the public, and if they do all these things that a trust sometimes does, that there should not be anybody allowed to make a case for abolition before the Commission?

      <P>I speak on this amendment from an entirely opposite side to that of Senator Sir John Keane. I am certainly a protectionist and yet I see the justice of this amendment. It seems to me that there can be no reason why arguments should not be heard on both sides, and if any tariff was found out to be bad that certain people should not be in a position to come forward and point out to the Commission that that tariff was bad.  A person may fail in showing that these tariffs are wrong, but I hold <Col N="970" /> that it is quite proper that the other side should be heard on each occasion. People who object to a tariff on the ground that it is bad for the public should be given an opportunity to come up and try to prove it.  I really fail to understand why both sides should not be heard on this matter and why the word &ldquo;abolition&rdquo; should not be put in as well as &ldquo;modification.&rdquo;  Of course you can modify a thing down to infinity.  You can bring a tax down almost to a point that is practically infinitesimal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will consider whether he can accept the principle at any rate of the amendment. I know there is some difficulty in putting in the word exactly where it is proposed by Senator Sir John Keane.  It seems to me that it is not quite the same class of person who ought to be given power&mdash;it is not quite the same class of person who would apply to the Minister and for whom it is desirable the Minister would have power to put the question before this Commission.  I think it would be better if the Seanad would agree to the principle to insert another sub-section which would provide that where the Minister was satisfied that there were substantial interests in the country who were affected by the tariff, that they should be heard against a tariff.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of some such provision being put in, but I do recognise that when you put on a tariff you cannot hastily take it off without a certain amount of breach of faith, and without doing a considerable amount of damage. It is because of that fact that some of us are anxious that there should be very great care taken before tariffs are imposed.  It is one of the difficulties that one cannot immediately undo tariffs that have been put into operation.  It would be a mistake, though he may not exercise it immediately, and I do not think he can exercise it immediately, for the Minister not to take to himself powers to put a proposal of that kind before the members of the Tariff Commission if he thought fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer the amendment <Col N="971" /> proposed by Senator Sir John Keane to the suggestion made by Senator Douglas.  I think Senator Keane's amendment is logical.  I have no real objection to it.  When the Bill was originally drafted the word &ldquo;revocation&rdquo; was in.  It read &ldquo;for the imposition, modification, revocation or renewal.&rdquo;  The reason why the word &ldquo;revocation&rdquo; was taken out was that it was feared it would be looked upon, as Senator Dowdall has said, as a pointer, that it would cause alarm and a certain amount of uneasiness amongst manufacturers and people engaging in the industries already protected.  It was thought, moreover, as Senator Moore has said, that the word &ldquo;modification&rdquo; could be used to get practically the same sort of inquiry as &ldquo;abolition&rdquo; or &ldquo;revocation.&rdquo;  If it were proposed to modify the tax to a very small tax, then it would be practically equivalent to abolition.</P>
      <P>While what Senator Keane has proposed would do very little harm&mdash;I have no very great feeling about it, although I did strike an equivalent word out of the Bill when it came to me in draft&mdash;if it were to be suggested that persons other than those engaged in the industry could cause an inquiry to be made, the results would be extremely serious, and in such circumstances, I believe, it would not be desirable. I know that at present, simply because our tariffs are experimental, we are not getting the full value out of them.  People are afraid to invest money; they are afraid that in a year or two those particular tariffs will be abolished just after they have installed necessary plant, and that they will sustain a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely desirable where a tariff is imposed that it should be given a very considerable period of trial.  I have mentioned in the Dáil a period of from seven to ten years.  Since we placed a tariff on goods two or three new factories have been erected.  In the case of other factories extensions have been made, new machinery has been installed.  The erection of further new factories is in contemplation. Within the last month I have heard of one or two proposed new factories. <Col N="972" /> If an inquiry was instituted before the Tariff Commission for the abolition of a duty the result would be rather serious.  For example, there would be no further investments; no further extensions would take place while that inquiry was pending, and unless the report of the Committee were of an extremely definite character, no developments in the way of starting or extending industries would take place afterwards.  We would be then in the position of having a tariff and not getting the effect of the tariff.</P>
    <P>When four or five years have elapsed this Bill can be amended.  It is comparatively easy to introduce and get passed through the Oireachtas a Bill of one or two clauses embodying necessary amendments.  I believe that is the better way.  If we now provide means whereby people other than those engaged in industries can have inquiries instituted before the Tariff Commission, I believe we will hold up development and this thing will drag along for many more years without enabling the people in the country to come to any definite conclusions on the subject of the imposition of tariffs.</P>
    <P>I would not object to the proposal put forward by Senator Sir John Keane, because it is clearly understood that there is no intention of touching existing duties, and it is clearly understood that proposals for modification, renewal or abolition must come from those engaged in the industries.  No harm can be done by this proposal, but I think it could have unfortunate results if it went any further.  When these tariffs have been in operation for four or five years more, when the results are clearly understood, when the people who invested money have established themselves so that it is not merely a case of having actually expended money and having no return, then further legislation, if such is necessary, could be enacted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  To insert after the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" />&ldquo;(2)  Every applicant for the imposition of a duty or the increase of an existing duty must show</P>
    <P>(a) that the industry is of substantial importance;</P>
    <P>(b) that the industry has suffered from exceptional competition resulting in serious unemployment;</P>
    <P>(c) that there has been unfair competition owing to currency depreciation or inferior labour condition in competing countries;</P>
    <P>(d) that the granting of the application in whole or in part would not be injurious to other Irish industries using the same product.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is an attempt to obtain from the Government a declaration of policy, and, if it is passed, to ensure a certain policy.  There is nothing more perplexing than the broad principles of this fiscal question.  Those of us who are free traders make no apology whatever for being free traders.  We dislike tampering with this fiscal question.  We desire to keep up with the times, however, and if we are to embark on this very tortuous and very unsatisfactory path, we say that tariffs should be confined to existing industries that are prejudiced owing to abnormal conditions.  We say that tariffs should not be used to stimulate industries that are inefficient and dying; they should not be used to start new industries in uncongenial and unsuitable surroundings, the argument being that if conditions were suitable industries would be already started; at any rate, a large number of industries would be already started.</P>
    <P>We might make certain exceptions in the case of heavy industries in connection with which large amounts of capital are required.  Of course many big industries have small beginnings. Let us take as an example the ready-made clothing industry.  We strongly object to the imposition of duty on an industry of that kind, which requires no very great technical skill and requires a comparatively small amount of capital.  What real justification there ever was for a duty on an industry of that kind, I cannot say.  Under natural conditions it had been flourishing <Col N="974" /> here.  Now the Government consider it wise that it should be fostered, of course at the expense of the consumer. The Minister is, no doubt, aware that one of the effects of the duty on ready-made clothing is to encourage people with comparatively small means to get together a few pounds to enable them to take a holiday on the other side of the Channel, where clothing is very much cheaper, and where they frequently are able to buy clothes and even pay the duty for a total cost that compares favourably with our prices here.  That is a well-known fact, and no amount of restrictions will do away with a certain amount of it.  I just give that as an illustration.  One might go on for hours illustrating the slippery path of all the evasions, all the psychology and all the subtlety that will enter into this, once you embark on this protectionist doctrine.  In implementing that admission the free trader will say the only possible justification for protection is the case of industries being hit by abnormal conditions.  This amendment claims to affect industries of substantial importance, industries that have suffered from exceptional competition, resulting in serious unemployment, or industries that have had to meet unfair competition owing to currency depreciation or inferior labour conditions in competing countries, and where the granting of the application in whole or in part would not be injurious to other Irish industries using the same product.  Currency depreciation enables a country whose currency has been depreciated to take advantage of low wages, where the workers are working under worse condition than in countries which have stable currencies.  But even there the free trader will not admit or even go so far as to say that there is a case at all by which the protectionist has anything to fear on the grounds of currency depreciation, or inferior labour conditions in competing countries.  I hope that the Government will accept this point of view, that the industries comprised in this amendment are the industries only worth taking trouble about, and that before the Commission starts to report on the schedule it <Col N="975" /> should be satisfied that the conditions laid down in the amendment are fulfilled and that no application should be made until the Commission is satisfied that these conditions have been fulfilled.</P>

      <P>I oppose this amendment.  I take the first point in it, which is that the industry must be one of substantial importance.  Within my own recollection a firm called Dunlops attempted to start a tyre manufacturing works here.  If they went before this Tariff Commission it would not have been deemed of substantial importance.  I do not know exactly what the capital of Dunlops is at the moment, but we all know that it is many millions at least.  Had they required a little encouragement here at the inception of their undertaking they would not have got it had such an amendment as this been in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I said nothing of the kind, although Dunlops have gone into other countries and employed labour in these protected countries. They make their tyres there and employ labour in these countries and not in England, We all know what happened to Dunlops' shares after the war. If Senator Sir John Keane does not know, at least they know well in Belfast. Another industry of which I know something that was not encouraged here was the margarine industry. Taking what was the late United Kingdom, margarine was first made in Ireland.  It is now made very largely in England, and the capital involved in the industry runs into something over £50,000,000.  If Senator Sir John Keane's amendment were adopted, that is another industry that would not have been deemed worthy of protection.  Lately we have all heard a lot of artificial silk.  That is a very important industry in Australia.  In connection with that industry I have here a cutting from an Australian paper.  Mr. Watt, in the House of <Col N="976" /> Representatives in Melbourne, introduced a motion imposing a tariff on artificial silk of 20 per cent., an intermediate tariff of another 20 per cent. and a general tariff of 25 per cent. as compared with the previous duties of 10, 12½ and 20 per cent.  I cannot understand Senator Sir John Keane's mentality.  I do not think he recognises it himself, but it seems to be that before any industry of importance could be established it must be of importance <i>ab initio</i> to fulfil his conditions.  In that case it is less likely to want protection. Of course, he does say that to establish any industry you must make it safe from unfair competition or from depreciated currencies and inferior labour conditions.  To-day, for the first time, I have heard him voice that particular view.</P>
      <P>Let me call the attention of the House to some of the onerous conditions which Irish industrial enterprises have to bear up against.  Money is spent very largely on our rather expensive, but I think fairly efficient, Department of Agriculture.  A great number of experts and necessarily highly-paid officials go about the country instructing our farmers.  Specially selected cattle are purchased by the Department and made available for our farmers to enable them to improve their breeding stocks.  Besides that, there is the sugar beet industry which is subsidised by the Government.  Most of the money which goes in this way is an indirect subsidy to agriculture and must of necessity, in part at all events, be drawn from the industrial sections of the country.  Are the industrialists of the country to suffer all these handicaps without any consideration for themselves when they are in difficulties?  As Senator Sir John Keane must know, they are in difficulties at present owing to existing world conditions.  The cost of living here, whatever be the cause, is ten points higher than in England, and that apparently must not be taken into consideration at all by the Commission when they come to consider the lists of cases which may be given consideration by them.  I ask the House not to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I cannot quite understand Senator Dowdall's objection to the first clause of this amendment that &ldquo;the industry is of substantial importance.&rdquo;  The Senator has quoted several industries, amongst them margarine, that now are very great. Surely he does not mean that he wants the Government to take up now the manufacture of margarine and to put a duty on it against imported margarine, thereby to establish a margarine industry here at the expense of the rest of the community.</P>

My reasons in arguing against the amendment are perfectly plain: that if an industry is not of substantial importance, or, to quote the amendment again, if it is not potentially of substantial importance and at the moment is not of substantial importance or likely to become so in the future, that then it would be ruled out by this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am trying to get at what Senator Dowdall really means. When we were discussing the Finance Bill last week I drew attention to articles which I argued should not be protected.  One was the twopenny-half-penny business of cider and perry and the other oatmeal.  I do not think there is anyone in the State who believes that any great improvement is going to follow protection in the case of these articles.  I ask Senators to look at the labour and the cost that will be involved in collecting the proposed duty on oatmeal and of watching the quantities of cider that come into the country. I think Senator Dowdall himself will agree that if an industry does not promise to be of potential importance in the future that it ought not to be considered.  I am afraid that we are going to enter into very bad business indeed if we protect every little industry that seems to someone or other to need protection, and if we are going to employ all our Customs officials in seeing that such an industry is protected. I ask Senator Dowdall to remember that we are not discussing this matter purely from the point of view of free trade or protection.  What most of us are aiming at is to point out the difficulties that are in the way and to <Col N="978" /> try and get the best we can out of this Bill.  I cannot see what objection there can be to the suggestion that the Minister should be satisfied that an industry will, eventually, be of substantial importance to the country before he would recommend to the Commission that it be given protection.  I hold that if we put a provision in the Bill to that effect &mdash;that the Minister must be satisfied&mdash; that the Commission will be saved from a good deal of criticism in the case of small industries looking for protection. Even if these small industries were given protection it would be of no use to them.  Before the Minister would recommend any application for protection to the Commission he should, I think, be satisfied that the industry concerned was going to be of substantial importance to the country, and that it was calculated to give employment. As regards unfair competition, the same thing occurs again, depreciation of currency and wages in foreign countries.  These are points undoubtedly which the Minister himself will have to consider before he takes the matter to the Commission.  Every applicant for the imposition of a duty must, I take it, show his case to the Minister.  These are the only points the Minister will have to consider.  Probably the Minister's answer will be &ldquo;I will have to consider these things,&rdquo; but I cannot see what injury it is to the Bill to have it put in that he must consider them.</P>

      <P>The House must not <Col N="979" /> forget that the one clause in the Treaty that was fought for tooth and nail and conceded with the greatest reluctance was this clause enabling us to protect our industries.  We know that the four conditions mentioned by Senator Sir John Keane are a contradiction of protection. We know that in this country there are no industries of substantial importance that do not represent England's thirst and hunger.  I am not keen in seeing this an industrial country, and I think the national character of the Irish people would prevent any slave-working conditions here.  I think that even &ldquo;potential importance&rdquo; will not take the sting out of these four conditions Senator Sir John Keane wishes to impose.  Nitrate from the air can be made when the current from the Shannon scheme is developed.  The Government have not announced their intentions or policy with regard to protection, and I think they should be given a vote of thanks for that, considering that the text of what they have announced has made such a difficulty and been such a cause of confusion. If the bottleworks at Ringsend had been allowed to fall through, then the Government would have got whipped with scorpions.  These bottles made at Ringsend might not be admirable, and perhaps, as Senator Sir John Keane said, they might not be sold for Waterford glass.  I think the first duty of a Government to its nation is to see that the people have employment, even if it means putting a 50 or 100 per cent. duty on imported articles.  The bottle-making industry in this country was about to fail owing to competition, but it was saved by the clause we had to fight for tooth and nail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jameson said that the cost of collection might stultify the import taxes that would be imposed.  That is a thing England has been living on.  It does not matter if you collect cockles, the money paid to the officers who take the tariff, who collect the taxes at the different ports, is part of the existence of the national life.  England's nationals in India, and up to a few years ago in this country, need not have returned any revenue.  They were making their livelihood and keeping their families in other parts of the world; <Col N="980" /> in other words, they were living on the revenue they collected, and whether anything came to the Exchequer or not did not matter because they were prosperous. That keeps a country's flag flying whether it be Imperial or otherwise. I want to draw attention to the argument that if a tax does not return revenue it is futile.  That is not so. It provides employment and it preserves the culture of any nation that tries to establish itself at the expense of another nation.  If these clauses were to be taken one by one, and Senator Sir John Keane has made no provision that they should not be taken holus bolus, they are merely formulæ for the contradiction of free trade. Apart from that they are impracticable. Anyone who ever considered taxes had to consider whether industries were developed, preserved or abolished or suffering from exceptional competition, or unfair competition with other countries. The new menace we have had after the war is the internationalisation of trusts.  The big trusts that used to be national, American, British or German, are now becoming international, to overstep the rate of exchange and benefit by the cheap currency, and get cheap labour in countries where there is a base coinage.  That will be the cause of the next war.  We need not bring that state of affairs into this country, nor need we consider the competition of black and yellow labour, even though the tin and copper of England has to be mined by Chinese.  Dunlop tyres are made by darkies in Calcutta and Japan.  As a matter of fact, we lost that industry here as a penalty for the highly-developed æstheticism of Dublin, which objected to the smell when it was proposed to start the industry in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianORourke" hpid="Mr. O'ROURKE Mr. O'ROURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'ROURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reply to some remarks made by Senator Jameson to-day, and which he made also in connection with the Finance Bill, about oatmeal.  Milling was one of our most important industries forty years ago, and we used to supply the Irish and English market.  That industry has been going down, and probably would have disappeared were it not for the tariff.  I am satisfied, as a result of the tariff on oatmeal, that <Col N="981" /> mills that had been working half-time last year are working full time to-day.  When the new crop comes in there will be dozens of mills working that had not been working for the last ten years, and that is a result of the tariff.  That means increased employment and, a more important result, providing a good market for the farmer.  I am surprised to see a representative of the farming industry crying out against the tariff, considering the result of the imposition on imported oatmeal, and that farmers will be getting 2/- or 3/- a barrel more for their oats.  Millers are now asking farmers when their oats will be ready.  Last year the farmer could not sell his oats, and numbers of farmers came to me with oats which I could not buy, and it was the same with others.  That will not be so this year.  In fact, there will not be enough of oats grown to meet the milling requirements.  There is a huge trust in Canada and the United States who land oatmeal in Dublin at £14 per ton, when they were getting £18 for it in New York.  If we sent oatmeal to those countries we would have to pay a duty of 1d. a lb., but we, in our kindness of heart, and owing to our free trade principles, were taking oatmeal from the trusts in America.  I have known Irish farmers to sell their oats and then buy American oatmeal.  It is time to stop that and to give employment by providing a good market for the farmer and, at the same time, giving the consumer the same value at the same price.  The price of Irish oatmeal will not be dearer.  It is not dearer now than it was six months ago. The tariff on oatmeal means that as much employment will be given in our mills as has been given in the brewing and the distilling trades.</P>

      <P>Free trade or protection has been regarded as a most profitable subject for debating societies, and apparently on every amendment we are going to discuss principles.  I am opposed to the amendment, not for the reasons that have been urged against it, but because it is contrary to the spirit of the Bill.  According to the amendment the Minister must satisfy himself before he refers an application to the Commission that it is included in the schedule, on which, under the Bill, he has to ask expert opinion.  In other words, the Minister has practically to inquire first into an application and, having made up his mind, then refer it to the Commission.  I suggest that that is absurd.  If the Bill is to be useful I do not think we could agree to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Douglas has summed the matter up. Senator Sir John Keane's amendment proposes practically, that if we think an industry is guilty we give it no trial, but if we think it is innocent, we might give it a trial.  The Bill directs that certain matters set out at considerable length in the schedule should be reported upon by the Commission. Senator Sir John Keane says that if the Commission is not satisfied it shall make no inquiries.  He proposes that the Commission shall be satisfied about certain things without inquiry, shall be satisfied &ldquo;that the industry if of substantial importance,&rdquo; and various other things.  Without an inquiry it cannot be satisfied.  I think this is a proposal that should not be accepted by the Seanad.  It would also nullify the whole principle of the Bill and would make it inoperative if we were to insist that each one of the four conditions set out in the amendment should be complied with.  Before any inquiry shall be made, for instance, every applicant must show (a) that the industry is of substantial importance; (b) that the industry has suffered from exceptional competition resulting in serious unemployment.  If the unemployment was only coming on, and if the industry was carrying on at a <Col N="983" /> loss, no inquiry could take place.  If there was unfair competition, inferior conditions of labour, and dumping, no inquiry could take place.  I think the amendment would be unworkable if passed and would make the Bill entirely inoperative.  If we are to work the Bill I think we could not do so with this amendment included in it. I think Senators discussed Sir John Keane's amendment as if the four provisos were alternative.  They are not.  They must be added together. As to (a) that the industry is of substantial importance, it might be an industry of very great promise.  I think that an industry of great promise but which is not yet &ldquo;of substantial importance&rdquo; is the very industry that should get protection.  An industry that has been of importance but which has fallen away is perhaps much more doubtful.</P>

      <P>Senator Jameson asked a question that should be answered as it is the foundation of all this discussion.  He asked &ldquo;How was it possible for prices to be kept at the <Col N="984" /> same level under protection?&rdquo;  That is easily answered.  The price of an article very often depends on the quantity produced. If an English cotton or woollen mill can supply an article at the same price as an Irish mill, and if they supply half the Irish market, then the Irish mill, in competing, will have heavier overhead charges than it would have if it supplied the whole country. The Irish mill, by losing half the trade, would be obliged to raise the price in order to meet the overhead charges.  I think that is a clear answer to Senator Jameson.  I have supported Senator Sir John Keane's other amendments, but as an independent Senator I must now vote against him.</P>

      <Col N="985" /> Like the man who said that he was not a bigoted teetotaller, I am prepared to admit that I am not a bigoted free trader.  I make that admission in the hope that my amendment will not be attacked with the same venom with which some of Senator Sir John Keane's amendments have been attacked.  I should also admit that I am not a bigoted protectionist.  I support the Bill because I think it is eminently necessary that every question should be examined on its own merits.  There is no question that one of the great drawbacks to protection which have been experienced in many places, notably in America, and largely in Germany, has been that the people in the protected countries have been called on to pay a price for the protected article which is greatly in excess of the cost of production.  That is done with the object of enabling them to dump the goods on another country at a price which is less than the cost of production.  There are numerous instances of that, and I think we had, in a small way, in this country, an instance given on the last day on which this Bill was discussed, namely, the position in regard to Ford cars.  I hope I am not treading on the corns of any Cork Senators.  I do not mean that these cars get any direct tariffs, but they get indirect advantages.  We were informed that the Ford car is sold in Great Britain and Northern Ireland at £20 less than it is sold here.  I want to prevent anything of that sort occurring in connection with this Bill.  I think it would be highly unjust that a tariff should be put on an article manufactured here, and that under cover of the tariff the price should be entirely in excess of the article when sold in England or elsewhere.  That is a matter which requires to be guarded against in protective legislation.</P>

It is quite probable that the Commission will never report in favour of the establishment of tariffs, because it will deal with the various aspects of the applications and will leave it to be deduced whether a tariff should be put on or not.

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move (8):&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section. After Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;No practising barrister or solicitor shall be eligible to appear before the Commission on behalf of a person making or opposing an application under Section 2 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to give all parties engaged in these negotiations who come before the Commission equal opportunity.  The amendment is actuated by the experience of many countries.  We know the influence of big trusts and powerful interests, in spite of the phrase &ldquo;One man one vote&rdquo; and all the rest of it. How it is done I do not profess to know, but that is the fact.  Here is an illustration of how you can see big money working.  A powerful interest can go to the very best counsel, and it is absurd to say that even the most distinguished civil servants are not affected by the forensic skill of Senator Brown or other distinguished counsel. Otherwise why do such distinguished counsel earn such large fees? They earn it before the judges.  I do not suppose that this Commission would be more impervious to arguments than a distinguished judge. What will happen if you do not safeguard this is, that you will get those big interests able to pay big fees to brief an expensive and fashionable counsel, and other interests who are less united, such as agriculture, will only be able to pay a very second-rate counsel.  There are plenty of precedents in this.  I do not know whether it was a ruling made by the Commission itself or whether it was under the enabling Act, that no counsel could appear before the Coal Commission. In that case the employers put up their case and the trade unions put up theirs.</P>

      <P>I suggest that is why it did not take very long.  It had to report within a certain time, and if it had an array of counsel it <Col N="989" /> would still be going on.  At any rate I think you get much more fairness, and you bring the small and the rich man nearer together.  It is possible that a small man will be affected and will be incapable of meeting all the arguments put up by a fashionable counsel.</P>

      <P>This is an extraordinary attitude on the part of Senator Sir John Keane, who, the other day, contradicted me for suggesting that influence is necessary for corruption. I bore that, as I thought it came from a change of heart.  I was not going to suggest then that a doctor should raise twenty years' purchase of the dispensary to do a little canvassing.  When Senator Sir John Keane took up the cudgels, naturally I laid down the wand.  Now he suggests that there should be no free trade in barristry here and that anyone should not employ counsel.  It really means depriving the struggling industries of representation. When barristers are unduly suspected by people like Senator Sir John Keane, I suspect that there is more than meets the eye in the amendment, and for that reason I will not vote for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of this amendment.  I have had often the experience of being opposed to leading counsel because employers were always able to brief counsel to state their case. Trade unions had to state their own case.  Senator Sir John Keane said something about big fees, and said he could not understand it.  It is easy to understand it.  These people have a really good trade union.  They fix their own rate of wages which other employees cannot do, and more power to them.  That is the explanation of the big fees.  The principle in this amendment is good.  If a case has to be stated on behalf of the industry, the people engaged in that industry are the people to state a case for and against it.  The briefing of an eminent barrister is not going to help the case.  I do not believe that a civil servant would be influenced or overawed by the presence of a counsel, from my experience of the stating of a case with regard to business.  On many occasions I have been opposed on the employers' side by leading counsel, and I go so far as to say that no matter <Col N="990" /> how clever barristers may be they do not understand the case with regard to industrial matters.  The case for and against tariffs can be stated by every employer.  They understand the case as a whole.  They are not talking to influence the jury.  They are stating the facts of the case which can be understood by everyone, and for that reason I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane's plea on behalf of the abolition of counsel in such an inquiry reminds me of the fable of the wolf and the lamb.  It is to be assumed that weak or struggling industries will apply for protection.  We are told, they, having endless funds, can employ the best counsel and make their case against the poor importer.  We all know what the importer's interest is in this country. It is the most powerful interest that exists, and to say they will be afraid that the huge funds, at the disposal of these struggling industries, will prevent them from making their case before the Commission is rather absurd, or, in other words, that this weak lamb is fouling the water of the wolf upstream.</P>

      <P>Are the Commissioners to have other powers to make regulations with regard to the method of hearing a case?  If so, this is a matter that it would be better to have dealt with by them.  Now, I do not think it is desirable to have arrays of barristers on each side.  I do not agree that the Bill is in favour of any particular section either for or against.  I think it is drastic to put into an Act a specific provision that there is to be no barrister or solicitor, because you employ accountants.  When you want an inquiry it is better to put the question to the man concerned.  I think if the Commission had power to make regulations it would be much the better way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Commission has power to make regulations. It is because it has that power and because the amendment would fetter the discretion of the Commission that I oppose it.  I have had a talk with one or two persons who are, at any rate, possible members of the Commission, and the probability is that <Col N="991" /> the Commission will make regulations restricting the appearance and employment of counsel in applications coming before them, but to say that in no instance should counsel appear upon an application, or to oppose an application, is going a little bit too far.  While not having counsel appearing for them an association representing a particular industry making an application might have a whole-time secretary who would have the whole case thoroughly made up.  He would be really taking the place of a barrister, and it might be only fair that those opposing that application should be able to employ counsel to represent their case.  That may occur.  As Senator Douglas mentioned, they might not employ a barrister or solicitor, but an accountant. I think, in any case, the advantages that can be got by moneyed people would not in any way be lessened by his amendment.  The side that has money can always employ experts and it will perhaps get even non-legal experts as legal experts, because the proceedings before the Commission will be for the purpose of eliciting facts.  Legal arguments or legal knowledge will not come into it a great deal.  I think nothing will be gained either for the rich applicant or the poor applicant by adopting the amendment.  On the other hand, sometimes in certain situations some difficulty might be created for the Commission.  The Commission will have power to make regulations, and I think it should be allowed to make regulations, and to amend them, if experience shows that they require amendment.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;In the case of witnesses the only expenses payable shall be the expenses of witnesses appearing on <Col N="992" /> behalf of persons opposing any application.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is put forward in view of the experience of the enormous advantages that accrue to those interestel by the imposition of a tariff.  It is only right that such parties should pay the expenses.  The putting forward of such applications should not be encouraged and this is a form of discouragement. The plaintiff should be compelled to pay the costs of all his witnesses, and where it is felt that a defence is necessary the expenses of the witnesses examined in opposing the application should be paid.  I should like an explanatory statement from the Minister with regard to the expenses of witnesses or the various parties appearing before the Commission.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As some Senator may be making a point in regard to the absurdity of this amendment, I may say that a similar <Col N="993" /> amendment has already been inserted in the British Safeguarding of Industries Act.  I have not got the exact words, but it is in operation.  It is a definite heading of which Committees under the Board of Trade have to take cognisance.  In any case that is my information.  It is the only justification for protection, and it should certainly be embodied and set out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It would certainly lead to some overlapping or duplication, because already the attention of the Commission is directed to the cost, efficiency, conditions of labour and rates of wages in the industry in respect of which the application is made as compared with such cost, efficiency, conditions and rates in other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I had regard to that, but that is very general.  This term, &ldquo;currency depreciation,&rdquo; does not arise at all.  It specifically arises under the Safeguarding of Industries Act in England, and I think it is an important factor.  If the Minister puts in these words somewhere I shall be satisfied.  I should much prefer to have them inserted in the schedule, even if it is a case of overlapping.  It is no real harm, although it may be untidy, to make a schedule as wide as possible.</P>

I do not know if the Senator appreciates the fact that we have 50,000 people unemployed and that 20,000 to 30,000 people leave the country every year for America.  This is, I think, the richest and most fertile country in Europe. Our people are not lacking in intelligence, and simply because there are no <Col N="997" /> facilities and avenues of employment for them they have to leave the country.  I do not hear any complaints from the countries to which they go that they are so ineffective or so useless that they cannot make a living in these countries, and I know from experience&mdash;I was in Lancashire for a great many years&mdash;that many of the most expert textile operators are Irish, and in Glasgow and on the Clyde in engineering.  This is fantastic opposition by people who are opposed to the establishment of industries in this country, even though it may necessarily mean that for some time the cost of living will be raised to some extent, and I throw back the taunt of fanaticism in their faces.  I am in favour of the establishment of industries in this country at some cost, even though the cost be considerable.  I oppose the introduction of this Preamble as a pointer to limit the discretion of the Commissioners with regard to the cost of living.  I object to any restriction, even in a Preamble.  I know that it is not statutorily binding, but I object to its being put in to attempt to bind the Commissioners as to what they should do.</P>

      <P>I am not at all sure that Senators who believe that this Bill is specially in the direction of protection are justified in their belief.  I would not call it a step in the direction of protection, but I certainly would call it a very useful and very important step to enable the country to make up its mind as to whether it is to have protection or free trade. I think that the Bill is an admirable one, that its purpose is admirable, and that the Government deserves to be congratulated on bringing it in.  But I do not go so far as to agree that this Bill of necessity means a policy of protection. What I think it will do will be to induce people to begin to think about it, to think out for themselves whether they want a free trade policy or a protection policy.  The country has not made up its mind on this question.  The country has not had time to think about it.  It has been too busy on other things.  But it may be, and I hope it will be, that this measure will help to make the country consider the question, <Col N="998" /> and it may be that it will result in the establishment of a free trade party and a protectionist party.  I am not at all certain that it would not be for the public advantage if it did, because it might be that if we could get divided on any present-day or future question, and if we could disagree as vehemently upon that question as we have on other questions, ancient or recent, it would have a most excellent effect in wiping out many of our existing divisions.  If we could manage to divide the country between two policies like that I think it would be to the public advantage.</P>
      <P>I am cordially in favour of this measure.  I do not think there is any necessity to amend the Preamble; I do not suppose it would have any effect. The Commission unquestionably will consider the relative importance of industries in this country and the condition under which each can be started. Personally I have not made up my mind yet whether this country would be better industrialised or as an agricultural country.  It is very hard to make up one's mind on a question of this sort.  It may be it would be better for this country to be industrialised or partially industrialised.  There will be a great opportunity for promoting industrialism in this country when the Shannon scheme is completed.  Then, when we have power, it may be that by the manipulation of tariffs we may induce foreign manufacturers to settle here and to promote industries in this country.  That, to my mind, would be all to the good.  I have not yet decided whether, broadly, protection or free trade is the better for the majority of the people.  That is what we have to make up our minds about, and that is, after all, the only thing that matters. If we make up our minds that the wellbeing of the majority will be promoted by protection then we should be protectionists. If we think the advantage of the majority is going to be promoted by free trade, then the majority will be free traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, if you are a producer it may be, but it does not necessarily follow, that you will be a protectionist. If you are a consumer it is more than likely you would not be a protectionist. We have to consider the balance of <Col N="999" /> advantage and whether it would be for the good of the country or not to adopt a system of protection or to continue a modified condition of free trade. There is no doubt whatever that there are certain industries in this country that could be protected, and protected with advantage.  I do not name them now.  I do not want to pre-judge the case, but I am satisfied that there are some industries that can be protected with some advantage to the community. On the other hand, whether the advantage would be counterbalanced by other disadvantages is a matter that we cannot make up our minds on just yet. I think that the step the Government have taken, in appointing a Commission to go into this matter dispassionately and intelligently, is a very admirable step indeed in the general interests of the country.</P>

      <P>I feel I have to object to this amendment.  I think it is another attempt to put free trade shackles upon this Bill.  The Government has designed the Bill to bring about ideal industrial conditions in this country which to my mind are&mdash;everybody at work.  We hear a lot of talk about the cost of tariffs to the export trade, but in countries with a bigger export trade than ours there are no such objections taken.  For instance, Australia's trade is large, but Australia has five times the number of tariffs that we have, yet she exports to England so successfully that she is able to compete with our farmers and to oust them out of the markets.</P>

      <P>I do not think the proposed amendment is necessary, and I am sorry to say I disagree with Senator Sir John Keane on some very vital points.  We start from a different basis.  My basis is that next to the maintenance of order the employment of the people is the first duty of the Government.  Senator Sir John Keane no doubt thinks that the cost of living is more important and probably he starts from that basis.  But I do not see much use in having the cost of living cheap if you have not got the money to buy the necessaries of life.  If <Col N="1000" /> you cannot get employment in your own country you have to go elsewhere. I am certainly supported by one who was considered to be a great authority in this country on national economics&mdash; that is Arthur Griffith.  I will read one sentence which I hope will disabuse the minds of those who think that he was not in favour of protection &mdash;though that statement was made by one of our Ministers only a few days ago.  The following is a sentence from <i>Sinn Fein</i> written by Arthur Griffith:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The reason our citizens are unemployed is because we are debarred from fostering our suppressed industries by the only policy that has ever proved effectual&mdash;the adoption of protective tariffs.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose Senator Sir John Keane's amendment because I believe not only would his Preamble not improve the Bill but it would be innocuous.  It would give indications which I certainly could not support. We desire to develop and foster industries, but to say that we only want to foster them without prejudice to our export trade may be, in certain circumstances, going too far.  If we develop the leather-tanning industry, dealing, say, with sole leather, we probably would have a disappearance of our exports of hides, but because we were likely to have our export trade in hides prejudiced we would not refuse to have a tanning industry.  So the proposed Preamble, as it stands, goes too far.  Then, again, while we do not want any increase in the cost of living, it may be that the best policy would be to have, for a time, a substantial increase to the consumer. That took place in the case of cigarettes. When our own financial system was established we took over the existing British tariffs.  By taking them over we got a very substantial measure of protection in regard to cigarettes, and there was a substantial increase at once in the price of cigarettes.  The result of that substantial increase was that new factories were set up here, and now the great majority of brands of cigarettes are just as cheap as in outside countries and as if there had been no tariff. <Col N="1001" /> Now consider if, instead of having a substantial increase, there had been a slight increase, the position would be that no factories would be set up.  The population would bear the small increase and continue bearing it.</P>
      <P>The Preamble sets out principles to which I could not subscribe without a great deal more of elaboration than would be possible to-day or even after several days.  It sets out principles which we could not assent to and which I think the Seanad should not assent to.  There is no need for any Preamble. The object of the Bill appears quite clearly.  It is to ascertain facts. It is to have the facts set out clearly so that the decision of policy may be taken by the Executive Council and on their recommendation or advice by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The decision of policy!  What policy?  That is the whole point.  There is only one other remark I want to make now, in reply to Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde.  He says this is a good Bill because it will enable the country to make up its mind.  I want to say that I cannot put any such interpretation on the Bill at all.  If it was the case that the issue was still open and that the whole of this protectionist manæuvring for the last three or four years had that object, I would agree with him.  He says it is to put the whole country into the possession of the facts.  Of course, the whole thing is prejudiced by the existing duties.  The Minister says that he will use this Commission to impose other duties as soon as he gets the report, before the country has an opportunity of saying aye or nay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Seanad has a certain amount of sympathy with those who have had some hard work in connection with this matter. It is not entirely our own fault that this hard work has been imposed upon us.  I do not wish to stress any personal note, but the Seanad will remember that on a former occasion in the case of the Land Bill I was regarded as rather an obstructionist. But if Senators will refresh their memories and study some of the repercussions that followed from that Bill they will admit that I was justified in taking up the line I did.  And in years to come I venture to say they will appreciate, as they do not now, the supreme importance of this move I am taking before this Bill passes.  It may be said that this policy is practically decided already.  It is rather like closing the door after the animal has escaped, but there is a fair range of commodities that are still free, and it is yet time to prevent their inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the very best it is only taking money out of one pocket and putting it into the other, and that is the net effect of this tariff business.  But the principle of that involves &ldquo;out of which pocket into which pocket&rdquo;? And it involves the fundamentally unsound effects on our national character. First of all it brings what is a very important question right down to the arena of essentially practical politics. Numbers of interests, instead of accepting the natural laws, are inclined to get loopholes.  That is a poison in our national life which is vicious and thoroughly bad.  It is bad for the mentality and it is also bad for the energy and the more virile qualities.  If people believe that by pulling strings they will get these tariffs, then in this Bill you are going to do something which will enfeeble the economic stamina. As far as I can see, you have only to extend this doctrine of small self-contained nationality far enough and you will have the Gaeltacht in the West wishing to cut away and saying that they shall be a nation to themselves. You get the thing reduced to a perfect <Col N="1003" /> absurdity.  I contend that Ireland is too small, far too small an area to be a self-contained economic unit.  You may say that free trade is an impracticable ideal.  But this ideal of little self-contained protective groups is equally impracticable and suicidal.  Where is it going to end?  Senator Sir Nugent Everard quoted the words of that illustrious Irishman, Arthur Griffith. But I should far prefer in this matter of economics to take my stand on the subject from a different angle and to take it out of the hurly-burly of party polities.  Can anybody contend that at the time that Arthur Griffith stated his policy that it was a dispassionate view of economic policy, or that it was ever examined on its merits?  But this policy of protection was examined on its merits by experts, and they condemned it, root and branch.  Yet their recommendation is thrown overboard, and by a nibbling process we are getting this thing by degrees.  The thing is summed up in certain verses that I am going to read.  These verses throw a lurid light on what is going on behind the scenes and what the thing means in practical politics.  In free trade we know where we are.  We know the natural courses that are operating. We have none of this wire-pulling. We say, let the weakest go to the wall; and the wall is a very good place for them to go to.  We should not assist people by Acts of Parliament in this matter.  Let them stand on their own legs, and if they cannot, let them fall. These lines that I am going to quote have reference to the performance of Mr. Baldwin before the election.  They run in this way:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I'm a plain and simple countryman.</P>
    <P>This tariff bothers me.</P>
    <P>I cannot make my meaning clear for other folks to see.</P>
    <P>For instance, when a heckler asks&mdash; and asking seems to scoff&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Why put a tax on apples and from cider take it off?&rsquo;</P>
    <P>I'm blessed if I can answer, when I'm out of Worcestershire,</P>
    <P>Where people grow the apples and so want them to be dear.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" />&ldquo;My Bewdley tariff works all right in Bewdley; but we find</P>
    <P>That every other county seems to need a different kind.</P>
    <P>Dundonians want free honey, with a tax on marmalades;</P>
    <P>Brum would prohibit foreign guns, and Sheffield razor blades.</P>
    <P>The politicians prime me; but their primings disagree.</P>
    <P>On one side there is Derby, and the other Amery.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that has a homely application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was introduced into the Dáil I said I would support it, and that, in fact, it would make for good things for the country. In saying that I was largely influenced in my decision by what the Minister, on the occasion of its introduction, stated. He told us many other things.  He told us a White Paper containing the evidence will be issued.  I am sure that will be very valuable to students of this question, and I think it will tend to create students on the tariff question as a whole.  Countries have prospered under free trade.  I think there can be no doubt that Ireland did not prosper under free trade.  Free trade was imposed on this country, and during that period of free trade Ireland certainly retrograded, and now that we have power to make tariffs it is our bounden duty to consider the question in its broadest aspects and to consider what tariffs we shall indulge in and what tariffs we shall reject.</P>
      <P>I think the direction to the Commission in the Schedule certainly contains most of the things which an open-minded man would desire to know, as regards the imposition of any tariffs. I sincerely hope that the Minister will insist upon getting thorough answers to every one of the nine questions in the Schedule.  Question 6 sets out the effect which the granting in whole or in part of the concessions asked for in the application would be likely to have on the public revenues of Saorstát Eireann.  That, to my mind, is useful. Question 5 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect which the granting in whole or in part of the concessions asked for in the application would <Col N="1005" /> be likely to have on consumers of the goods produced by the industry in respect of which the application is made and on the cost of living.</P>
    <P>If that is particularly considered, I do not think there is much danger of any unwholesome tariff being imposed. There are demands for tariffs in the country which should not be allowed. In connection with applications for tariffs, all bases of calculation should be considered by the Tariff Commission or by the Minister.  I have in mind an industry where the present costings of the finished article are 110 per cent. over the pre-war costings, and where the consumers, who are 70 to 75 per cent. of the Free State, will be largely people whose finished product is only 40 to 50 per cent. over pre-war prices. I consider the imposition of a tariff in connection with this industry, without first considering closely the implications concerning those people whose finished product is only 40 to 50 per cent. over pre-war, would be unjust and undesirable.  I fear that these people whose finished product is only 40 to 50 per cent. more than pre-war will not be organised to prepare for a tariff.</P>
    <P>It is essential that every one of these questions set out in the Schedule should be carefully studied.  I feel sure that the Minister will not let any tariff be entertained which is unjust.  I am quite sure the Minister for Finance is in earnest in this matter.  In the tariffs that he has already imposed he has probably done right.  I would be in favour of the imposition of a certain incubus on people, even though it increases the cost of living, if it is essential that a particular industry should be developed.  I believe eventually such cost of living will not react injuriously on the community.  Where any commodity is largely consumed by people in the Saorstát, where the cost of that commodity ranges from 30 to 50 per cent over pre-war, and where the cost of the commodity desiring to be protected brings the figure to 110 per cent., I contend that all these facts should be carefully considered.  If it is considered desirable that a tariff should not be imposed, then I, for one, would be quite satisfied.  I welcome this Bill.  I say it <Col N="1006" /> is a distinct advance in the right direction. In my opinion it is up to the Government to consider from every aspect the question of the imposition of tariffs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'CONNOR Mr. O'CONNOR">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNOR</NameTxt>
      <P>My views on this matter will probably be considered very homely and very Irish in their origin and in their expression.  I am giving my personal views in connection with the Irish cattle trade and with the farming industry generally.  In my native country down around Roscrea, there were, in my own memory, six mills, regular hives of industry.  Now I am sorry to say that they have all closed down with one exception.  That one mill is being kept alive by the monks of Mount St. Joseph's.  The reason that they have been successful in keeping it going is because of free labour.  By keeping this mill going the monks have been of great benefit to the district.</P>
      <P>In my early days there were six mills working in that area, and farmers had bran and pollard at nominal rates. Pollard was considered particularly useful and was one of the principal foods connected with the pig industry; it was also used for stall-feeding.  Then the first opposition came from foreign flour. American flour mills, owing to their adoption of the roller system, completely knocked out our mills, with the result that Irish mills dwindled down until they were unable to support themselves. The few mills we have remaining in Ireland are being kept alive by reason of the millers charging for their by-products far above their value. Foreign flour is being largely imported. I consider it regrettable that flour should be imported and that our own mills should remain closed.  If our mills were working plenty of employment could be given.  As it is, money is being taken out of the country and that means a great loss to the community generally.  It would be much better if there were a tariff on imported flour; flour should not be allowed in free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conclusion I have come to, as a result of my experience in the country, is that there should be a tax on all manufactured articles imported.  I would allow no manufactured article <Col N="1007" /> in free.  In that way we would promote industries in our own country. Such a proposition may have a very wide effect.  People may be jealous. There are some who consider that the cost of living should be reduced, that the poor man's dinner at the moment is costing a lot more than it should cost. All that is so much nonsense.  It would be much better for the man to have 6d. in his pocket to buy a loaf than to have the loaf at 4d. when the man would have no money to buy it.  If there was more protection more industries would be set going and more employment would result.</P>
    <P>As Senator Bennett pointed out, this country should be given an opportunity to stand on its own legs.  I well remember the statement that Ireland suffered more from the free trade policy that England applied to this country than any other country in the world.  At that time England was a manufacturing country and it suited her to get all the opposition possible.  Industries were only in their infancy at the time.  Countries such as Canada, America, Australia, New Zealand, India and South Africa were customers of England. England then became wholly a manufacturing country, and while they had the custom they did not fear.  Ireland was solely an agricultural country, and what was life to one country was death to the other.  Ireland's industry was killed by the free trade policy which England imposed here.  Since then the other countries I have mentioned have become great manufacturing countries. They are now independent of England.</P>
    <P>I spent a while in England last year, and the people there complain that they are badly hit owing to foreign competition.  Nations that were once customers of theirs are now producers and are under-selling them.  If you visit country towns in the Saorstát to-day you will see American hay forks, rakes, and other types of implements, and in all these matters our industries are being under-sold.  For the reasons I have given I am an out and out protectionist as regards manufactured articles. That is the conclusion I have come to, and it would take a great <Col N="1008" /> many speeches to change my mind on that.  With regard to wheat, I would allow it in free, because our country is not able to compete with other countries which are favoured with more sunshine and in which wheat of a better quality can be grown than here. Wheat-growing in this country, as experience shows, has not been a success. The wheat we produce here is not able to compete with the foreign wheat.  As regards the meat industry, in which I am interested, Senators may have seen from the newspapers that a cargo of 172,000 carcases of frozen mutton and lamb arrived here in one consignment some time ago.  I ask what advantage was the importation of that amount of frozen mutton and lamb to Ireland? In my opinion it simply made the country poorer than what it was.  It means, too, that this country is deprived of the hides and the fat of the cattle killed in foreign countries and imported here. For all these reasons I am a protectionist. In my native place it is pitiful to see the number of mills that are now idle.  Seventy or eighty years ago they were hives of industry, but now they are derelict, and there is no chance of reviving the industries carried on in them.  They are now simply land-marks of what were once prosperous industries. We hear a lot of talk about the increase in the cost of living that would take place if we were to afford protection to our industries.  I do not think that would occur, but I believe the contrary would be the case.  I would be in favour of protection here for the purpose of giving our country a chance of competing with the manufactures of other countries.  For that reason I would be in favour of putting a tax on all manufactured articles coming into the country.  I congratulate the Government on the attempt that it has made to deal with this matter.  Now that we have the blessings of a native Government we ought, I think, to avail of the opportunity to get the intelligent opinion of the people of the country on this question.  I think, too, that the Government would be well advised to have due regard to the opinions of the people engaged in industry in this country.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the motion standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad regrets the refusal by the British Government to give effect by legislation to the codicil of Sir Hugh Lane of the 3rd February, 1915, which was invalid by reason of being unwitnessed, and in view of the finding of the Committee appointed by the British Government on July 9th, 1924, that Sir Hugh Lane, when he signed this <Col N="1010" /> codicil, believed that he was making a legal disposition of the pictures therein mentioned to the City of Dublin, the Seanad is of opinion that the British Government should be urged to provide by some form of legislation for the permanent return of these pictures to Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My reason for bringing this matter before the Seanad at this particular time is this: About two years ago a Committee was appointed by the British Government to advise them as to the destination of what are known as the Lane pictures.  That Committee reported some considerable time ago, but its report was not published until about a fortnight ago.  Last week, in answer to a question in the House of Commons, the British Government stated its intention of carrying out the recommendation of that Committee, of refusing to legislate for the purpose of making valid the invalid codicil in Sir Hugh Lane's will.  The matter of these pictures is of such importance to this country, and the feeling in this country on the subject of their destination is so strong, that I felt it was right that the matter should be brought before this House and that Senators should have an opportunity of expressing their opinions on it and of urging the Government to take any steps in their power for the purpose of trying to alter the determination of the British Government on the subject.  The facts in connection with the bequest of these pictures to the Corporation of Dublin are within the recollection of us all. Long prior to the year 1915, Sir Hugh Lane had formed the intention of giving this noble collection of modern French pictures to the City of Dublin. The difficulty was a gallery for them. The Municipal Gallery in Harcourt Street, in this city, was wholly unsuitable for their reception.  They had, in fact, been there for some little time, but being in an old house, in an old street in this old city, they were not safe from fire, and very naturally Sir Hugh Lane, when he made up his mind to give these pictures to the city, made it a condition of his gift that the Corporation should erect a proper gallery within a certain time.</P>
    <P>Now the Corporation agreed to <Col N="1011" /> erect that gallery, but we all remember the unfortunate discussion which took place as to its site.  That discussion became so acrimonious and prolonged that ultimately Sir Hugh Lane removed the pictures from this country and gave them on loan to the National Gallery in London.  There again a difficulty occurred as to their exhibition, and, undoubtedly, early in the year 1915, Sir Hugh Lane had no definite intention as to the ultimate destination of these pictures.  But probably if things had gone on in the ordinary way, he would have given them to London or to Dublin, according to the treatment which one or other of these cities gave them in the way of providing a gallery.  One thing is quite clear, that in the year 1915 he was starting on a visit to America and was conscious of the risks of the voyage, and with a strange prevision of his fate he executed a codicil to his will by which he bequeathed these modern French pictures&mdash;thirty-nine of them&mdash;to trustees for the City of Dublin on condition that the Corporation provided a suitable gallery for their reception within five years after his death.  We all know that on his journey back he was lost on the &ldquo;Lusitania.&rdquo;  The codicil was found in his office of the National Gallery, just beside us here in Dublin.  It was found in a desk in a sealed envelope directed to his sister, who was his executrix. When it was opened it was found that it was unwitnessed, and that it was, therefore, invalid.  After his death the question arose as to whether his last wishes as to the destination of these pictures should be carried out.</P>
    <P>Now the codicil was unwitnessed, and it was practically a war will.  If he had, instead of going to America with the dangers of the voyage, gone out to France, executed the will and died, the unwitnessed will would be perfectly valid.  The question almost immediately after his death as to whether this codicil of his should be given effect to by legislation was raised, and there was quite an animated correspondence in the English Press, in the &ldquo;Times,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Observer.&rdquo;  There was in <Col N="1012" /> 1916 a petition by the Corporation of the City of Dublin, as the trustees of the National Gallery, asking that the pictures should be returned to Dublin. In 1918 there was a mass meeting held in the Mansion House of Dublin, one of the most representative meetings ever held in this city, at which resolutions were passed in favour of the return to Dublin of these pictures. Then came the troubled times, but even in the troubled times representations were made by the Provisional Government through General Collins to the British Government, and these representations were most favourably received by the British Government. On the 9th May, 1923, this House unanimously passed a resolution asking the Government to press on the British Government the return to Dublin of the pictures in the unwitnessed codicil to the will.  A similar resolution was passed unanimously by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Therefore we have from 1916, practically from the death of Sir Hugh Lane, a continuous and public claim by this country for the return of these pictures.  That is of very great importance when we come to consider one of the reasons given for the conclusion arrived at by the Committee which was appointed to advise the British Government. So much had this question become a national one that in the year 1924 a Committee of three was appointed by the then Labour Government to report on the matter of the pictures, and two quite definite questions were left to that Committee. First, whether Sir Hugh Lane, when he signed the codicil on the 3rd February, 1915, thought he was making a legal disposition, that is, thought it would be effective in law; and, secondly, whether it was proper that in view of the international character of the matter of these pictures, the legal difficulty in the codicil should be remedied by legislation. The first of these questions was a question of fact, and that question the Committee has answered in the affirmative, that is, they have come to the conclusion, and so reported, that Sir Hugh Lane when he executed this unwitnessed codicil thought he was making a legal disposition.  Having <Col N="1013" /> myself seen all the evidence on that question of fact, I hold they could come to no other conclusion.  The answer to the second question is not only most unsatisfactory, but is based on considerations which were absolutely irrelevant to the question which was referred to them.</P>
    <P>In answer to this second question the Committee recommend that the legal defect in the codicil should not be remedied by legislation, and for this conclusion they give three reasons.  The first is they state that they are advised that the validation by Act of Parliament of Sir Hugh Lane's imperfect codicil would constitute a legal precedent of the first importance, and that recourse to such a step would be justified only on the grounds of general public interest.  Now, with great respect, in giving that as a reason the Committee obviously mistook both the terms and the nature of the question that was put to them.  They were told that this was an international question, and it was, therefore, a question of general public interest, and they were asked, this being an international question, and a question of general public interest, to order a precedent to be made.  Their answer is: &ldquo;You could only make a legal precedent on the grounds of general public interest.&rdquo;  That is the false assumption which underlies this report.  The question has been dealt with by this Committee as if it were a question between two galleries, whereas it was a question between two nations.  They were told it was a question between two nations and their answer to the Government which appointed them was, it is not.</P>
    <P>The second reason given by the Committee for recommending no legislation was that it would be a breach of faith as regards the donor of the gallery for modern continental pictures which was opened a week or two ago at Millbank. That would only be a valid reason if the donor of this gallery was induced to build it on the assurance that the Lane pictures would be housed there. Now it is inconceivable on the facts that any undertaking of that kind or assurance could have been given.  As I pointed out, from the date of Sir Hugh Lane's death there was this continuous and public claim by this country for <Col N="1014" /> these pictures, of which the donor of that gallery must be perfectly well aware.  It was followed in 1924, by the appointment by the British Government of this Committee, which could not have been appointed if any such assurance had been given.  The third and last reason of the Committee is perhaps the most difficult of all their reasons to understand.  They found as a fact that when Sir Hugh Lane signed this codicil he intended and believed, in the event of his death before his return to this country, that the pictures would come to Dublin, yet they give us a reason for recommending that his last wishes should not be given effect to, that to do so would be contrary to the spirit and purport of his wishes as expressed during the last two years of his life.  Now it is very difficult indeed to understand or to deal with reasons of this kind.  They were not asked to consider what Sir Hugh Lane's wishes as expressed during the last two years of his life were.  They were asked, what were his wishes as expressed in the codicil, and did he believe that if he died before his return to this country they would be given legal effect to.</P>
    <P>Sir Hugh Lane, as a matter of fact, gave different expressions as to his wishes during the last two years of his life.  It depended very much on the treatment that he thought his pictures were going to get if they went to London or to Dublin.  He had no settled intentions at the time, but when he came to start on his last journey there was no doubt.  Therefore, in giving this as the reason for the recommendation they made to the Government that no legislation should be adopted for the purpose of validating the codicil, they had no ground to go on.  They departed, as they did in answer to the second question, from the reference under which they sat.  I have gone fully into these matters for the purpose of showing that our national claim for the pictures has not only not been answered but has not really been duly considered. It has been turned down by a nation which is rich in examples of modern art of this kind, whereas our examples of that art are the few pictures in the small collection in Harcourt Street.  It has been suggested that our moral claim for the pictures would be met if some <Col N="1015" /> of them were lent to us from time to time.  That is no satisfaction of our claim.  If our moral claim is satisfied it will be for us to lend the pictures, and there would be nothing to prevent that being done, and there would be everything in favour of it if the pictures were ours by right and made so by legislation.  I have no doubt that this country would see that England got its share of the pictures on loan from time to time.</P>
    <P>The terms of the resolution which I am proposing are on the Order Paper. They express regret at the refusal of the British Government to give effect by legislation to the unwitnessed codicil of Sir Hugh Lane, and they ask our Government to urge on the British Government to provide, by some form of legislation, for the permanent return of the pictures to Dublin.  No form of legislation is suggested by the resolution. They have declined to pass legislation which will validate the codicil. There are many other forms of legislation by which it can be done.  There is a Bill, which was recently introduced by Lord Carson into the House of Lords and which provides that the pictures shall be transferred by the trustees of the National Gallery to this country. There are many ways of carrying out by legislation what is desired by this country, and what we believe is due to this country.  It can be easily done, and, having regard to the fair play and generosity which the British Government have extended to us since we have been established as a State of our own,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And the Government that backed it.  Apparently they came to the conclusion that Sir Hugh Lane desired that the pictures were to be kept here.  At a moment in a man's life, when he feels that he ought to be most in earnest, when he makes his will and goes on a journey which he knows will be beset with difficulties, he explicitly implies what he feels.  At that particular moment, Sir Hugh Lane, going on what proved to be a dangerous enterprise, then and there explicitly conveyed to those who were to follow him that his desire was that the pictures should be given to his own country, Ireland.  His decision, as Senator Brown has pointed out, was respected by the Committee who were asked to make such a finding.  They said: &ldquo;Yes; it was his intention that Ireland should get the pictures, but no legislation should be introduced to give effect to his wishes.&rdquo;  What do you call that?  I, a plain man, call it dishonesty. I feel that there is no man in this country of ours, under similar conditions, even though we are a poor country, who would grab the treasures which England already liberally possesses.  If Ireland under similar conditions possessed them, she would not attempt to grab and keep things which in her heart she knew were not hers, and which a Committee set up by an Irish Government found that the donor of these pictures did not mean to be hers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is gross dishonesty, and I am to be forgiven if I do not use the moderate language which Senator Brown so effectively used.  There is a time when we cannot restrain our words, and I feel that there is a time when to mince one's words would be dishonest.  We are told about the generosity of England. Here is a concrete example of her honesty.  Here is a great instance <Col N="1017" /> of her desire to spread the light in various countries, but when it is a question of spreading artistic light in Ireland, she says, &ldquo;No artistic light for Ireland.&rdquo;  That is the policy; that is the creed.  Is it any wonder that some of us for many years have not believed in the honesty of England in spreading the light?  If we did not believe it, perhaps we are beginning to believe it now.  A concrete instance, such as this, brings it home to plain men that there is no honesty there.  I would ask the Government to press the resolution, so moderately conveyed by Senator Brown, and I believe that it will not be unsuccessful if our Government presses it to the bitter end.</P>

      <P>It will be within the memory of Senators that some two years ago both this House and the Dáil passed resolutions urging the British Government to give effect to the unwitnessed codicil of Sir Hugh Lane's will.  Lord Glenavy gave his very emphatic opinion at the time that it was impossible to doubt that Sir Hugh Lane did intend that codicil as his last will and testament.  The only satisfactory thing in the report issued some two weeks ago by the British Government is that it also decides that Sir Hugh Lane did intend that codicil for his last will and testament.  Senator Brown and others have analysed and exposed the excuses made by the Commission and accepted by the British Government for not giving effect to that decision.  In this country we have to decide upon a course of action, and it is largely with that object that I speak.  It has been a long dispute; some of us have given much time and thought to it; my closest friend, Lady Gregory, has given the best of her thought and much of her time to it for the last ten years.  The property involved, though great in monetary value, is more than property, for it means the possession of the implements of national culture.  You will forgive me if I forget that I am occasionally a politician, and remember that I am always a man of letters and speak less diplomatically and with less respect for institutions and great names than is, perhaps, usual in public life.  In our endeavour to have our case laid <Col N="1018" /> before the British public once more, to have the fallacies of this report exposed, we are faced with an unexpected difficulty.  Three weeks ago, while the report was still unissued, when the British Government had announced no decision, when the whole matter was <i>sub-judice</i> between the nations, the King opened the new wing of the Tate Gallery, that is to say, the building which, it is claimed, was built to contain these pictures by Sir Joseph Duveen, and of which they are the principal ornament.  As he made his speech, or as he passed through the gallery to deliver it, his eyes must constantly have looked upon the words, &ldquo;Lane Bequest.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the policy of most of us in this country, seeing that very lately we preferred a king to a president and that we fought a civil war that we might be governed by a king rather than a president, to remain upon the friendliest terms with the King of England, who is also the King of Ireland. We have been told, I do not know whether truthfully or not, that the King is personally friendly to us, that a certain speech which influenced our affairs for good was made on his own initiative.  Statements of that kind are frequently untrue; they are put out for policy, but, whether true or not, we have no desire to disturb the impression that they have left.  Our relations with Ulster make this more essential.  But it would be impossible to preserve this attitude towards Royalty if certain obvious conditions are ignored.  When the King was urged to perform an action which seriously compromised the claim made by this nation, when he was urged to intervene in this international dispute, was it pointed out to him that he should be advised, not by his English Ministers alone, but also by the Governor-General, or otherwise by his Irish Ministers?  We have no means of questioning Ministers in this House, and I would be glad, therefore, if someone in the Dáil would ask President Cosgrave if his Government was consulted before the King recently opened the new modern gallery in London.  Important as our claim for the Lane pictures is, this question seems to me to raise an <Col N="1019" /> issue of far greater importance, one vitally affecting the constitutional position not only of this country but of every Dominion.  I can imagine the British Government replying in the evasive spirit of its Commission that as our claim was moral and not legal the King was not bound to take cognizance of it, but in disputes between nations&mdash; and the British Government itself has, within its terms of reference to the Commission, called this dispute international&mdash;it is not legal but moral and material issues that cause trouble.  A day may come when the action of the King may prejudice some claim involving the most fundamental rights. I see by the daily papers that Canada and the Irish Free State are to seek at the next Imperial Conference for some clarification or modification of the relations between the Crown and the Dominions.  I think that this recent experience of ours shows that one or the other is necessary.</P>
    <P>When I addressed this House some two years ago on this question I believed that our case was almost won, and from that day to about three weeks before the issue of the report we had continual assurances that it had been practically decided in our favour.  The persons who gave us these assurances seemed to be in a position to know. I am certain of their sincerity.  If you ask me about the sincerity of those from whom they derived their information, I can merely say that I am without conviction, one way or the other. What happened at the last moment is unknown to me.  I am sure of one thing; it was not any particular force or authority in the report of the Commission that made the change.  Senator Brown has dealt effectively with the two or three reasons which they give for retaining in London property which they admit that Sir Hugh Lane intended for Dublin, and believe that he had legally bequeathed to Dublin.  Of these arguments, that which seems to have weighed most with English public opinion, and probably with the Commission, is the statement put forward by the Tate Gallery and accepted by the Commission, that Sir Joseph Duveen received a promise on June 9th, <Col N="1020" /> 1916, that if he were to build a new wing to the Tate Gallery Sir Hugh Lane's pictures should be deposited there.  I hold letters in my hand which will prove conclusively that no such promise was ever given.  Those letters were not laid before the Commission, because it never passed through the minds of the three witnesses, Lady Gregory, Mrs. Shine and myself, that the Commission would go outside its reference, nor did it occur to the Commissioners to question us upon this point.  They had been appointed to find out whether Sir Hugh Lane intended the codicil to be a legal document, and whether, if so, considering the international issue involved, it should be given effect to.  It never occurred to us that they would repudiate their reference, and declare that there was no international issue involved, and then go into a mass of detail which seemed excluded by that reference.  Before repudiating their reference they should have referred the matter back to the English Government for a new reference, and have informed us of their action.  If such a promise had been given, it would have carried no weight, for it would have been given by one party in the dispute without the knowledge of the other, but it was not given, as I shall now show.</P>
    <P>Sir Hugh Lane was drowned in the &ldquo;Lusitania&rdquo; on May 7th, 1915, and at the end of that month Lady Gregory laid the codicil before the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the English National Gallery, which had the custody of the pictures.  I have here a letter written by her on June 6th of that year to a great New York connoisseur and collector:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I went to see (taking a copy of the codicil) Lord Curzon, the most active of the London National Gallery trustees, and one who appreciates most the French pictures.  He would, of course, like to keep them but said he thought Hugh's wishes, so clearly expressed, ought to be respected, and he would say that when the time comes to the other trustees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On June 1st, 1915, that is to say, three or four days before the date of the letter I have just quoted, Lady <Col N="1021" /> Gregory received the following letter from Lord Curzon:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I mentioned to-day to the National Gallery Board the subject which you had been good enough to bring before me the evening before ....I think the right thing would be for the executors to address them formally through solicitors, and lay the whole case before them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On September 15th Lord Curzon wrote as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It seems to be a matter in which the executors will have to formally approach the Board, who will, no doubt, consult their solicitors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A year later I was in London and heard privately that the National Gallery intended to have a gallery built for modern French pictures, and to put the Lane collection into it.  I told Lady Gregory of this, and she wrote to Lord Curzon, who answered as follows on October 10th, 1916:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The matter is not in my hands nor at this moment even in the hands of the Board.  They are waiting to be advised by their legal advisers, and in the interim it would not be right for any individual trustee to intervene.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yet our opponents allege, and the Commission accepts their allegation, that an individual trustee did intervene. Here are the words of the report:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Not only has the London Gallery the legal possession of the pictures but, on the assurance that such a gift would be in perpetuity, it has secured the gift of a gallery in which the pictures are to be housed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An editorial in the Burlington Magazine for 1924 gives the precise date and circumstance of the alleged promise:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On June 9th, 1916, Sir Joseph Duveen, being on the point of returning to America, saw Lord D'Abernon about the project.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It then goes on to say that Lord D'Abernon thereupon promised the pictures if Sir Joseph Duveen built the gallery.</P>
    <P>I have read you the assurances of the Chairman of the Board, Lord <Col N="1022" /> Curzon, stating that the matter was undecided, assurances repeated several times for more than a year, the last and most specific, that in which he states that no individual governor had the right to intervene, being written some months after the date of the alleged promise.  Relying upon those repeated assurances we had summoned no meetings, organised neither petitions nor protest, and we were right.  It was entirely impossible that a man of Lord Curzon's position and training would have deliberately deceived us.  Unless minutes of the National Gallery recording that promise were laid before the Commission, I have a right to affirm that such a promise was never given. Sir Joseph Duveen or Mr. McCall imagined the whole thing, or Lord D'Abernon made some vague statement which was misinterpreted.  The matter is very serious, a very large amount of property is involved, property which may already be worth some £200,000 and which will certainly rise in value from year to year.  I, therefore, ask the Irish Government to press upon the British Government the production of the minutes of the Board of Governors of the National Gallery of London for the period during which the promise is stated to have been made.  If no such minute can be discovered then the Commission has been grossly misled; if it is discovered, we have.</P>
    <P>I was going to deal with the other indefinite argument, that if Sir Hugh Lane had lived he would have changed his mind.  He was the most generous of men.  A famous artist said of him that he had raised the profession of a picture dealer into the magnificence of the Medici.  Had he lived I have no doubt he would have given great endowments right and left to Dublin, to London, and to that great gallery in South Africa that was partly his foundation. But when he was going on that last voyage he knew he had only one collection of pictures to bequeath.  He preferred to bequeath them, where the rest of his bequests had gone, to the gallery which will always bear his name, where everything had been chosen by himself, and where they were not to be lost among the growing richness of the great London gallery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> There is that other argument&mdash;I am not competent to deal with it&mdash;that there is no precedent for altering a will.  While we do not press that point I have heard great lawyers differ on it.  The other day the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; newspaper&mdash;and I should like to thank the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; newspaper for the great vigour with which it is pressing this question&mdash;gave a very remarkable precedent.  In the midst of the Great War, by Act of Parliament, the will of Cecil Rhodes was modified. In that case there was no question of the letter of the will or of his intentions. He had left a large bequest to enable German students to attend certain English universities.  They abrogated that request not merely for the time of the war but for ever.  That is precisely one of those actions which all nations do in time of war and are ashamed of afterwards.  Yet it seems to me if we had claimed that we would not make an excessive claim.  It seems to me what they did by Act of Parliament to modify the will of Cecil Rhodes under the influence of national hatred they might well be asked to do&mdash;to modify the will of Sir Hugh Lane under the influence of national honour.  Now what are we to do?  No compromise.  We ask and we must continue to ask our right&mdash;to hold 39 pictures, and for ever.  Let the Dublin Commissioners build that long-promised gallery.  We have already, in Harcourt Street, great treasures that will make it one of the richest galleries in the world.  Let them build that gallery and let them see there is ample space for those 39 pictures.  Let them write the names of the pictures on the wall, in spaces reserved for them, and let the codicil be displayed in some conspicuous place and watch the public opinion of these countries.  I do not believe that the public opinion of these countries will permit the London Gallery to retain pictures which it was not the intention of the donor to leave to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not favour demand for favours in these times when it is so difficult to get our rights.  It is always difficult to ask for favours, but <Col N="1024" /> in these times when it is the custom of the friends of our neighbours both on this side of the water and the other to publish so much propaganda with regard to the extremely moral character of their minds, and the very high ideas which they possess in these matters, I, with some hesitation and with a great deal of doubt, ask that this moral right should be taken advantage of and claimed.  The Committee admitted, and it has been already stated that the codicil showed, it to be the desire of Sir Hugh Lane to hand over the pictures to Dublin, but they tried to get out of it by saying &ldquo;Oh, his desire to hand them over to Dublin was only a second preference.  His real preference was to find a house to store the pictures.&rdquo; They insinuated that as he was a man of great vanity he desired honour and a great house in London, and that it was only a second kind of arrangement when he sent them over to Dublin. I had the honour of Sir Hugh Lane's acquaintance when he first came to Dublin.  Everyone recognises, as I do, that he was a man of the highest honour.  He was much above the ordinary folk of any country in his moral views and his honesty as regards pictures and otherwise.  He bought those pictures because he loved them.  He gave them to Dublin ungrudgingly without any thought of glory because he wished to do honour to them.  That was the only reason he had in mind, as far as I can find out.  He was annoyed when opposition arose, when people here said it was a pity a big palace should be built in Ireland at a time when the people were living in hovels.  That, of course, was an appeal which many honest and honourable men were touched by very much.  Annoyed by this opposition for the moment, he made his will handing them over to Britain.  I think he did so purely perhaps on account of a little pique, but I do not think that was a matter which entered much into his character.  He did it really as a sort of an inducement to the Irish people so that when they saw those pictures moving away they would become more reasonable and grant his wishes.  I have no real doubt in my mind that the desire of his heart was to have those pictures in Dublin. <Col N="1025" /> He was an Irishman and came over to to live in Dublin when, from the material point of view, he had much more advantage in living in some other great capital, in London or elsewhere. He established here a gallery in Harcourt Street, of which he became director, and he gave to that gallery a great number of pictures.  He was appointed director of the National Gallery, and, I think, taking all those things, one with another, it seems to me that his wish was that his name should be continued in Dublin and that Dublin should profit by all that he has done.  I think also that the Committee is somewhat hypocritical in the reasons they have given.</P>
      <P>Now, what they say is that a will should not be altered.  There may be some truth in that when it is the will of one individual towards another. That individual would have certain rights, and it might be a hardship to take them from him, but we will suppose that that individual, having received that donation, says to himself: &ldquo;No doubt, I have a legal right, but I have also to consider the moral right.&rdquo; If he were an honourable man, an exceedingly honourable man, he would say: &ldquo;Well, I have received this, but I hand it back to the person who has a moral right to it.&rdquo;  Is there anybody in the world who would say that that man had not a right to do so or that he should be debarred from handing back the donation made to him?  I think everybody would say that he had not only a right to hand it back but that it would be an extremely honourable thing to do.  In this case it is not a donation to an individual.  It is a donation to the English nation that is pleaded.  Has that English nation, which exists and has life, not the same right as that individual to say: &ldquo;This donation is made to me, but I do not consider that I have a moral right to it, and I will hand it back&rdquo;?  This Commission is trying to say that the English nation could not do what the individual can do, that they would not be entitled to say, &ldquo;We will hand that back to the person for whom it was meant.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that this is rather a test case.  I never had so much belief <Col N="1026" /> in national honour as some people here have, but now we have an example by which this matter can be tested and put to the proof.  Is the British nation going to act as an honourable man would have acted in similar circumstances or is it not?  We have made every appeal we could make and we can go no further.  I entirely approve of the suggestion of the Senator who said that the Gallery should be built, that the places for these pictures should be written over one by one&mdash;thirty-nine empty spaces&mdash;with the names of the pictures, and a tablet that would be somewhat of a disgrace to the nation and a public and everlasting record. So far the disgrace rests only on the Committee, so far as I know.  The British nation has taken no steps and may yet redeem its honour.  I hope and trust it will do so.</P>

I do not believe that in asking that these pictures be restored to Dublin we are asking for any favour.  We are asking for what is clearly and simply a right.  We have had many dealings with British Ministers, and since the setting up of the Free State the experience of us all has been that we have been met fairly on everything that has been under discussion, that there has been no attempt to treat us meanly or shabbily or to do anything other than full justice.  I do think myself that the question of the Lane pictures has not been dealt with by the British Government, so far at <Col N="1027" /> any rate, in the way in which other problems have been dealt with by them.  I think that is a pity from every point of view.

      <P>I shall be very brief in dealing with this matter, but I do speak with a certain amount of justification.  About a month ago I had occasion to go to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and I gave particulars of a letter handed in here to the Post Office in time for the English mail.  It did not cross by the English mail although handed in here at 6 o'clock.  It bore the Dublin post-mark at 10 p.m.  The Minister investigated the matter in the Sorting Office and stated that he hoped it would not occur again. This morning three letters, containing amendments, which were posted in England on Monday, and which would have crossed on Monday night's boat, were delivered, one at 10 o'clock in the morning, and two others, which should <Col N="1028" /> cross by the same boat, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  These two occurrences, coming close together, do suggest that there is a certain looseness in the administration of the Post Office.  I am not satisfied on this occasion merely with making an individual complaint to the Department, and I wish to raise the matter here because I think a certain amount of publicity will serve a useful purpose.</P>

      <P>I should make it plain that the staff of this House is in no way responsible for this.  I have a letter from the Superintendent of the messengers' staff in which he tells me that it is a very common experience that letters for Ministers, Senators and Deputies arriving by the morning mail are not delivered, either in Leinster House or in the Government offices, until 3.30 in the afternoon.  He says that that is what happened in regard to two out of the three letters to which Senator Sir John Keane referred. Therefore let us be quite sure&mdash;the Senator himself has not suggested it&mdash; that we do not blame our own staff.</P>

      <P>It is a general complaint throughout the country.</P>
