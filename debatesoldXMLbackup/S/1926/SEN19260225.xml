      <P>I desire to move an amendment to this section.  When this Bill was introduced in the Dáil it was <Col N="459" /> thought by town commissioners in country districts that it would be of great benefit to them, but on examination of Section 14 it was found that it was only applicable to the County Borough of Dublin or to such urban county districts as may by resolution passed, have adopted it.  I have been asked by numbers of different town commissioners to move an amendment to make the Bill applicable to towns with over 1,000 population.  But I find now that there is a Money Resolution tacked on to the end of the Bill which, I believe, takes away from this House the power of amending it.</P>

      <P>We were told that there were ample powers to be found in the Towns Improvement Act of 1854, but I think that is going rather far back, and I think it would be of great benefit if we had an amendment such as I propose.  The Minister seemed to think that the object was entirely to prevent competition in trade.  I do not think so.  One of the principal reasons why we desire the extension of this Bill is to prevent certain persons coming in with stands and lorries and creating dirt in the streets and causing a nuisance.  In some of these towns the market day is Saturday, and the result of the street traders is that the streets are left in a filthy condition on Sunday.  There are certain towns in the country that have a certain amount <Col N="460" /> of civic pride and like to see their streets clean, particularly on Sundays. There are also some towns in the West where the streets are very narrow.  In Tuam, in Roscommon, and in Castlebar there are streets in which two cars could not pass, even without having any stands or carts in the way, and I think it would be of great benefit if the town commissioners in these towns were able to say whether such stands as those erected by street traders would be permitted in very narrow streets.</P>

      <P>That would not meet your purpose, for there are towns governed by local authorities that are not commissioners.  If you put it this way: &ldquo;towns under the control of a local authority,&rdquo; I think that would cover the case, unless you like to put in a definition and set out a limit of population so as to avoid a place that might be described as a town but would be too small for your purpose.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I will ask the Minister to reconsider the attitude he took up in the other House in regard to this matter.  The Minister referred us to the Act of 1854, but that is going back very far, and he also said we could get civic powers.  Well, Tuam is an instance where they tried some years ago to get civic powers, in fact there was a big lawsuit there, but they failed to get these powers, so that it is not so easy to get civic powers as may be thought.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Kevin O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill as it stands applies primarily to the County <Col N="461" /> Borough of Dublin, and it can be adopted by any urban council.  The purpose of the Senator's amendment is to extend the Bill so that it can be adopted by the town commissioners of any town.  An amendment substantially similar to that moved by the Senator was moved in the Dáil, and, on consideration, rejected. I think the Senator's point about the Money Resolution is that I remarked in the Dáil that the Money Resolution did not cover an extension of the Bill to the case of a town which had town commissioners, or the case of towns other than those controlled by a county borough council or an urban council.  I suggested that possibly if there was a feeling in favour of extension to the borough towns governed by town commsisioners it might be necessary to secure an altered financial message from the Governor-General, and to bring into the Dáil a new Money Resolution.  Apart from that, and simply taking the Senator's amendment on its merits, I objected.  The Bill was introduced not to eliminate street trading but to control and regulate it, and also it was introduced primarily from the traffic angle&mdash;the angle of preventing obstruction.  In the Dáil an attempt was made to give a swing to the Bill in an entirely different direction, and to alter and use it so as to exterminate the street trader.  That is not the purpose of the Bill.  It is not its purpose to lay down what form of competition is or is not legitimate with the traders of a town. It is not the purpose of the Bill to say whether the shop of the future is going to be a stationary shop or a movable shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We simply approach the matter from the point of view of keeping the streets and pathways of the towns and cities reasonably free from obstruction, and not from the point of view of wiping out and eliminating the rather harmless class of people who make their living by traffic in small wares without having attained to the prosperity which would enable them to have premises on which they would pay rates.  The Senator's point about fair-day obstruction is to be treated very carefully, and for the reason that the Bill will not apply at <Col N="462" /> all to that kind of sale and purchase which takes place in any market or fair.  The very idea of a market or fair is that the people will come together to buy and sell.  There is this peculiarity, that the people who are anxious to outlaw the street traders in the country towns on the grounds of obstruction, the cleanness of the streets, and so on, will not enforce the powers they have under the Towns Improvement Act of 1854 to keep the fairs or markets within reasonable limits.  When the Guards make any attempt to prevent a fair straggling down the length of a town there is considerable indignation on the part of the traders whose premises are scattered along the streets of the town.</P>
    <P>Not only will the town commissioners not attempt to keep a fair or market confined to some open space, but they resent strongly any tendency on the part of the police to do that, and yet from the same quarter you are urged to extend to towns governed by town commissioners, or others, so that the street traders may be legislated out of existence.  The street trader may be not merely a very harmless but a useful individual, a man who comes into fairs or markets to sell cattle or pig troughs. He may be to the farmers of the country a very useful person and may enable them to secure goods of that description cheaper than they would get them in the shops; so that it is not entirely a one-sided matter, and the Senator ought not to jump to the conclusion that the street trader is necessarily <i>prima facie</i> a pest to be exterminated by statute.  That certainly is not the outlook which inspired this Bill.  It was simply that street trading, particularly here in the city of Dublin, is rather outstepping the limits, and that powers are needed by the police and local authorities to keep it within reasonable measure and see that it does not develop into abuse and obstruction, and spoil the amenities of the city.  I have not just the same sympathy with the move to extend this Bill wholesale through the country.  Everyone knows it is not the same problem.  You have not got it in the same proportion in the country towns that you have it here in the County Borough of Dublin.  I think <Col N="463" /> we have gone quite far enough in agreeing to allow the state of affairs whereby urban councils may adopt this Bill by resolution.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that town commissioners should have that power is scarcely acceptable.  The Money Resolution, as I say, can confine the matter to the county boroughs and the urban councils, and the long title of the Bill does likewise.  Apart from technical difficulties of that kind, I am not of opinion that any strong case can be made for the inclusion of towns controlled by town commissioners.  Most towns that have not an urban council but have town commissioners are small. There are a few exceptions; Mullingar would be one, and Tuam, which the Senator quoted, would be another.</P>
    <P>The adoption by a town of a system of control by town commissioners, or the retention of that system of control, is largely due to the desire for small rates.  Town commissioners are confined to a rate of 2/-, and the objection very often to applying for urban powers is simply that it is felt it is just as well to have that limit on the rates.  If a real case is made for the extension of this Bill to towns controlled by town commissioners, it is scarcely too much to expect that such towns would apply for and obtain from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health the power to establish an urban council. In towns controlled by town commissioners the only congestion of traffic which could arise would be on the market or fair days, and, as I have said, the powers of the Bill do not extend to fair or markets.  If town commissioners let their fairs straggle through the town for business reasons they cannot complain.  They could prevent that under the Act of 1854.  Even if they had the powers of this Bill they could not prevent a street trader trading wherever the fair or market can be said to exist.</P>
    <P>If the Senator had in mind the idea that if the town commissioners could get this Bill they could keep street traders from selling on the streets on fair or market days, they could not.  There must be the right of <Col N="464" /> free trade wherever the fair or market exists.  If town commissioners have made up their minds that a fair or market is to extend right down the street and run, perhaps, up the side street, then the street trader can go wherever the fair is.  I think the real trouble is that the far-reaching powers which the town commissioners have under the Act of 1854 are scarcely used, and when the Senator says, &ldquo;Do not let us go so far back as the Act of 1854,&rdquo; the Act is current law and can be used by town commissioners if they want to use it.  They do not want to use it.  They consider it good business to have a straggling fair.  If they have a straggling fair, they must put up with the attendant inconveniences, and one of the attendant inconveniences is that the street trader has the fullest liberty to sell wherever the fair goes.</P>

      <P>There is no positive urgency if I could assume that the Seanad would meet next week, but, as, I understand, there is a dearth of business, and the possibility that the Seanad will adjourn over next week, I think it desirable that the Bill should be put through its remaining stages. On Second Reading it was clear that, while a proportion of the Seanad disapproved of the form of the Bill and the method we are adopting to secure a particular end, there was something approaching unanimity with regard to the end itself, and those who dissented from the form were disposed to waive their objection.  The Committee Stage is passed.  No section of the Bill has been challenged.  No amendment has been moved, and in view of that, if the Seanad is not intending to meet next week, I certainly would be glad to get the remaining stages of this Bill taken to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the fact that the Bill has not been challenged to a division and that no amendments have been moved in Committee, are insufficient reasons why we should suspend Standing Orders and pass all stages of the Bill to-day.  There is a disposition to over-ride the Standing Orders.  We are doing that too often. No real grounds have been advanced on this occasion for suspending Standing Orders.  There is no danger, I think, that the proceedings before the Privy Council will come on, and even if they do they will be rendered null and void by the passing of the Bill.  I will vote against suspending the Standing Orders.</P>

      <P>I may say that this Standing Order has received very wide interpretation.  We have been very indulgent in the interpretation given it.  To a large extent I am, perhaps, to blame for that.  This is a very <Col N="466" /> difficult case, but I do not think the Minister has put forward any ground of urgency.  Perhaps he would be satisfied with this assurance: that if between this and Monday next any urgency did arise, I would convene the Seanad for some day next week.  There is no other business to justify my calling Senators together next week, but if there was any real urgency in the interval, I could call the Seanad for next week.  Unless there is some real, positive question of urgency, I think, perhaps, it would be wiser for the Minister not to press it.</P>

      <P>I would have been reluctant to ask the Seanad to depart in any way from the Standing Orders but for the fact that I had heard that there was an intention on the part of the Seanad not to meet next week. That opens up the prospect of this Bill not becoming law for the best part of another fortnight.  There is then the necessary seven days to run as from that and the signing, so that the Bill would not be operative law for three weeks.  I am reluctant to refer here to the proceedings of either House of the British Parliament, but there is a growing disposition in one of those Houses to put down motions dealing with the affairs of this State, either its legislative or administrative affairs, and a motion has been put down for debate and discussion in the House of Lords in connection with this Bill. I think that is a very deplorable state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is as improper as if a motion were put down in this House or in the Dáil to discuss the legislative <Col N="467" /> or administrative affairs of Britain. I should be glad if this Bill were a closed issue so far as they are concerned before any such debate took place on the other side.  I would, if the Seanad are to meet on Tuesday, be prepared to wait until then for the remaining Stages of this Bill, but having regard to what I have heard as to the intention to adjourn over next week, I certainly would feel grateful if the Seanad could see its way to take the remaining stages of this Bill to-day.</P>

      <P>No.  That would mean we would have to suspend the Standing Orders.  I think the very fact mentioned by the Minister is a reason why we should not rush this. The very fact of it would seem to suggest we were nervous or frightened to have this Bill referred to elsewhere.  I think that is a pity and a mistake.  I cannot see what the urgency is. I cannot conscientiously rule that the Bill is an urgent one.  I have heard no grounds to satisfy me.  I thought, perhaps, it might be suggested that there was some danger of this particular case coming on.  That might have been a different consideration, but I understand there is no prospect of that at all.  Cases listed many months before it have not been heard at all.  I do not think the Bill is in the slightest danger owing to that consideration.</P>

      <P>You cannot see your way to say this is an urgent matter. Therefore there is no power, without notice, to suspend the Standing Orders. Personally I think the House should not depart from the reading of the Standing Orders.  There is a feeling amongst the Seanad that the way we have met suddenly, have suspended the Standing Orders, and then passed Bills does not make for the dignity of the Seanad.  I do not think the House can have it both ways.  If we are not willing to meet we must rush through business in the time we do meet.  I think we ought to meet on Tuesday or Wednesday next, even for half an hour. I think we must be prepared to suspend our Standing Orders or be prepared to meet if there is a case put forward even for the sake of one Bill.  The custom of handing in notice when you wish to suspend Standing Orders should be revived.  There are many cases where you will be prepared to vote for the suspension of Standing Orders, but I think notice should be given.</P>

      <P>I think I am largely responsible for any blame that is to be attached owing to a certain laxity shown in the administration of our Standing Orders.  The cases which I have in my mind were cases where Bills came at the close of the session and there was urgency from the point of view of time.  The Government was to blame, because they kept the Bills from us too long, and I think I unduly relaxed the construction of the Standing Orders.  As far as this particular case is concerned, I cannot see my way to say it is urgent.  I am quite willing to convene a sitting for next week for the purpose of disposing of the Report Stage of this Bill and, with reference to that, a Senator can <Col N="469" /> give notice of motion that the Standing Orders be suspended to take the Fifth Stage that day.  Is it the wish of the Seanad that we should meet next week for the purpose of disposing of the remaining stages of the Bill?</P>

      <P>Since the Seanad rose yesterday I have had an opportunity of conferring with the President and he has satisfied me that this amendment of mine would in all likelihood interfere with the due operation of this Bill when it becomes an Act.  I therefore, with the leave of the Seanad, am willing to withdraw my amendment, which reads:</P>
      <P>Section 7, sub-section (3).  To add at the end of the sub-section two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) No person shall be convicted of an offence under sub-section (1) of this section unless and until he <Col N="470" /> has been required in writing by registered post to fill up or otherwise complete a schedule, form or other document according to the instructions contained therein or otherwise communicated to him under this Act and to return or otherwise dispose of such document in accordance with such instructions and has not within the time therein limited complied with such requisition in writing.</P>
    <P>(5)  No person shall be convicted of an offence under sub-section (2) of this section unless and until he has been required in writing by registered post to give or furnish to such officer of statistics the written or verbal information or to answer the question asked of him by such officer and has not within the time limited in such requisition in writing complied with such requisition in writing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President has suggested another amendment in lieu of it which I shall have very great pleasure in moving. My object in the amendment that is on the Order Paper was to protect a person who has been prosecuted because he did not comply either with the requisition in writing which had been sent to him through the post, or answer the question which had been put to him verbally.  So far as the requisition through the post was concerned, the hardship and danger of it to the person who was served with the requisition is this, that under Section 8 of the Bill the mere posting of the letter was conclusive evidence that he got it.  I consider that that was not fair.  It put an end to the case once you proved the posting of the letter.  That, of course, is not fair to the poor man in the country, or even in our towns, where the post occasionally goes wrong, and a letter which has been properly addressed is not delivered.  Accordingly, I tabled the amendment that before a man could be prosecuted or convicted for not answering a requisition sent to him through the post by the officer, the latter should take the precaution of sending him a registered letter which would be an assurance that he had got it, because you have the receipt by himself or someone in his house. <Col N="471" /> That is equally important, and the amendment which the President has given and which I am now proposing deals with that in such a way as to reasonably protect the person.  The amendment is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>To add in line 47, Section 8, after the words &ldquo;served therewith&rdquo; the following words: &ldquo;unless such occupier shall satisfy the court that the document has not been received by him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, the prosecution will have to prove the posting of the letter.  That will only be <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the letter was received by the person to whom it was addressed, and the person to whom it was addressed will have an opportunity of coming up and satisfying the court that he did not get it.  Then it would be for the court to say whether he is telling the truth.</P>

The other side can say, &ldquo;I did not refuse to answer the question,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I gave reasons for not answering the question,&rdquo; or &ldquo;that was not the question he put me.&rdquo; I therefore consider that I am justified, with the leave of the Seanad, in withdrawing my amendment.</P>

      <P>Because the civil bill officer has to enter the service of the civil bill.  I do not see any provision of the sort.</P>
      <P>I do not want to appear unduly pressing on the President in this matter, but it does seem to me that a great deal of injustice may be done under this particular clause.  We all know sometimes how uncertain the post may be owing to various causes.  It is not merely the question of dishonesty, which is very rare&mdash;and it is a tremendous tribute that it occurs so very seldom&mdash;but then you have cases of where it may be delivered to the wrong person, leaving it at the wrong house, or perhaps forgetting to stamp it.  There is a variety of causes which make it very likely that the occupier will never get it.  Then you are placing the Judge in a very big difficulty, because in one case he will have to discredit the occupier or in the other case discredit the statistical officer.  All that trouble will be got over by this other proposal of Senator Brown's which will also cover what I think is the more critical case&mdash; that is, the verbal case.  If the officer swears that he asked a particular question the man on the other side may say that he was never asked that or that that was not the question he was asked at all or that it was some wholly improper question he was asked.  In that case you are placing the Judge in a very difficult position, whereas if you provide that the question should be set out in a registered letter, then you have the man's own receipt for the document and his mouth is closed.  It would add to the expense, of course, but I do not think the expense would be prohibitive because it would only apply in the case of an anticipated prosecution.  The President, I am sure, has considered this thing much more carefully than I have, but I fear cases will arise under this clause that may be very harsh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two forms.  There is the case of the occupier upon whom a document is served, and there is the case of the person to whom a verbal inquiry is put.  In the case of the document, if the person satisfies the Court that he has not received the document a prosecution will not lie.  Let us examine the class of <Col N="474" /> case that is likely to arise.  An officer of statistics requires information.  His main purpose is to get information.  A prosecution is his only security for getting it in the event of some person desiring to withhold it from him, but his main purpose and his whole business is to get the information, and the document is his means of getting it. Suppose a person explains that he has not received it.  The obvious course for the officer of statistics is to leave another document, to hand it to him, in order that he may get the information. Say that an officer required some information verbally.  He is refused it and he serves the person with a summons. It is open to the person then to come along and supply the information in order to avoid the prosecution.  There is nothing simpler.  A prosecution can only lie when such information is being withheld as will make the compilation of statistics impossible.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As nobody is speaking in favour of the amendment, I will take the opportunity of saying a few words against it.  I do not want it to be taken that it is in the nature of a threat, but I must say that if this amendment is passed, it is unlikely that the Census will be taken this year.  It is unlikely that it could be taken if the amendment were passed.  Let us examine the case and see what happens. In the first place, a huge number of requisitions must be sent out.  In many cases in the city alone these documents must be left under the description &ldquo;occupier.&rdquo;  Nobody knows that better than people who live in the city and who have had occasion sometimes either to visit such houses or to canvass for votes in such houses.  If it be held or if it be thought that it is possible to send out in a week registered packets to occupiers in order to get that information, then I think responsibility for getting it will have to fall on somebody other than the present statistician. Those who are acquainted with the Representation of the People Act of 1885 will know that registers of voters were compiled in this city on requisition served on the occupiers, and in the case of a house in which there were flats, that they were left with one person in that building, and that in the majority of cases they were properly filled up and properly returned, and possibly not more than five per cent. of the people lost their votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a given day in April it is proposed to take the Census in Northern Ireland, and it is advisable that the taking of the Census for the whole country should go on on one day.  It is to be hoped that we shall be ready upon an agreed date to get the information. Documents must be left with occupiers in each particular case for a particular day over the whole country, and not confined to the city alone. It is suggested that within a given <Col N="476" /> period, if not returned, the registered packet must go out in order to effect the workability of this particular Bill when it becomes an Act.  I submit, and I think I explained at some length to Senator Brown, that that was impossible. One case remains to be answered. That is as to the verbal requisition.  A person is asked for information and refuses. If the officer for statistics is one who desires to prosecute persons unreasonably, there is the Minister for Industry and Commerce responsible to the Dáil.  He will have to answer any questions that may be put to him in regard to such prosecutions.  At the present moment it is open to the Civic Guards to arrest a man whom they believe is drunk and disorderly; the man may not be drunk and disorderly, but the Guard has absolute power; he could place a Senator under arrest, but it does not happen.  And you might say if we were bringing in a Police Bill for the first time, is not that an extraordinary power to give to a policeman about whom you know little or nothing?</P>
    <P>The extraordinary power given here is to get the statistics you require. There is a very short period of time in which to get the statistics required. There is a certain method provided for getting them by serving a document, and the supposedly aggrieved person is in a position to draw attention to any officer who outsteps his duty.  In the whole range of the civil service, where there are large numbers of people employed by the State, very few cases of indiscipline or of desire to do anything unpleasant when they are seeking information occur.  The real purpose here is to get information and if, in order to get that, a particular officer has to serve 20 or 30 summonses in order to procure what he is sent to get&mdash;if such a thing happens it makes his superior look into the question to see whether or not that is the type of person to get the information. If it was known that an officer had a large number of prosecutions in his area, very likely his superior would suggest the need for trying a change and would see that some person would be sent who might prove better at getting such information.</P>
    <Col N="477" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the specific case against this amendment?  The Census in this case is to be taken about April 8th.  The particular section to which this amendment has reference deals with convictions for failure to supply certain statistics.  Is it seriously suggested that between now and 8th April all cases of people who fail to supply the information can be dealt with <i>seriatim</i>, prosecuted and convicted so as to ensure that the taking of the Census on that date will be in compliance with the law as laid down in the section?  I think it would be quite impossible within the period suggested here, some six weeks.  You first make your application, and having made your application, you satisfy yourself that some person is a delinquent; then an officer of the Statistics Department, having satisfied himself that there are delinquents, prosecutes and gets a conviction.  I think it would be impossible between now and the 8th April to set in order the machinery necessary for such arrangement, and having set the machinery in order, then to perfect the working of the machinery. Therefore, I say that to suggest to the Seanad that this particular amendment, dealing with the Census, will vitiate the taking of the Census is hardly fair, because I submit that the powers in Section 7 cannot be enforced between now and the taking of the Census, and, therefore, to say that they are required for the Census is hardly a reason for the withdrawal of this amendment, which, I consider, is in the interests of the citizens.</P>
      <P>The position will be if the citizen does not get this, in spite of all that is said about the Census, any man having had a letter posted to him can be brought before a court, and evidence of the letter having been posted being given by some officer, he would make him liable to a penalty in a summary court of jurisdiction not exceeding three months' imprisonment.  That is a horrible position, but apart from that horrible position, I do not think that the people of Ireland are so inimical to the taking of a Census, or to any other statistics, that they would be hostile or that they would fail to give the necessary information to enable it to be taken successfully.</P>

There is no fear, to my mind, that the acceptance of this amendment will vitiate the taking of the Census.

      <P>On this question of the Census return a prosecution cannot take place unless failure to supply the information at the moment has been established.  I do not see what powers would help the taking of a Census if people do not wish to render a return; the harm is done by the refusal to render the return.  In the case of wholesale refusal you cannot deal with the Census retrospectively.  It is the essence of a Census that it should be taken simultaneously.  I cannot see how these special and hasty powers of prosecution, to which we object, will in any way help the Government in regard to the collection of the Census.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>In my honest opinion one of the inevitable results of the passing of this amendment would be that anybody having any objection <Col N="479" /> to supply their statistics would wait until they get the registered letter, but that does not mean that before that a person can be prosecuted.  He will have to get the registered letter, and he will put off the supplying of the information until he receives that letter. There are many people who hate the idea of having to supply any form of statistics.  Sometimes these people act on principle and sometimes through laziness, and that type of person, if he thinks he is going to get a registered letter, is going to put the matter off until the last hour and until he gets that letter.  I do not see what all the alarm is about.  What is asked for here is asked for in every up-to-date country in the world, and this information which is asked for in every civilised State seems to have created more alarm than if the Bill was one that threatened the lives and safety of the citizens.  This opposition has come from people who are always crying out that we should be prepared to trust the Government in every respect.  These are the people who say you must trust your Government and their officials or else you cannot get on with Parliamentary institutions. We have been told over and over again that we must trust the Government when we have been speaking about the safety of the citizen. Senators who object and who oppose the withdrawing of this amendment never thought of putting down an amendment themselves.  It was only when Senator Brown agreed to withdraw his amendment that we were told that if it was withdrawn the whole safety of the citizens of the State would be imperilled.  Senator Bennett did not put down an amendment.</P>

When it can be shown that the Bill is not sufficiently watertight in this respect I think it will be time enough to put in these cumbersome safeguards which involve delay and expense and encourage those who have been always disposed for one cause or another to withhold information that is essential in the life of any civilized State.</P>

I think that is a reflection on the people, and I believe that there is a better civic spirit in the country.  It is an assumption that the average citizen will not respond unless under threat of imprisonment.  I say that is an undeserved censure on the people of the country, and that is why I am opposed to it.</P>

I have very much more experience than <Col N="481" /> the Senator in connection with these matters, and I have more knowledge of the people.  I am perfectly satisfied that in a case like this it is a second letter that is looked for.  The Senator comes from a part of the country where there is a second bell rung for devotions or religious duties, and people wait for it.  They will wait for the registered letter in this case.</P>

      <P>I think the Seanad ought to be rather slow and take considerable thought before they vote on what is before the House.  The matter was very carefully gone into by the Select Committee, and undoubtedly we saw the great difficulties there were in dealing with this question of the registered letter.  The President disapproved of it, and so we held it over because we saw it was an amendment which the Select Committee thought they ought not to force in view of the case the President put up against it.  It was held over specially for consultation and the result is the amendment which Senator Brown has agreed with the President gives all reasonable protection to anyone who is rendered liable to prosecution without having a chance of stating his case.  I think in view of what we have heard from the President, and knowing the way the matter has been handled by the Select Committee, and that this amendment represents the considered opinion of those who have been studying it very much, the Seanad should very seriously consider the matter before voting against the case the President has put so strongly. Senator O'Farrell put the matter plainly.  His point is that if we insist on this amendment and leave in the registered letter there will be delays which will make the taking of the Census not easy.  It would be a strong action for the Seanad with that knowledge to vote against the withdrawal of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I was Chairman of the Committee, and I would like to explain <Col N="482" /> the position.  When the amendment was moved in Committee by Senator Brown the Committee felt there was a fair case made for some alteration in the Bill.  The President made a case which convinced every member of the Committee that the way proposed in the amendment would not be the wisest way of doing it.  The President undertook, if possible, to bring forward on the Report Stage an alternative amendment to meet the case.  It was suggested to Senator Brown definitely by me that he should put down his amendment again.  That course has been adopted again and again in this House between the Committee and the Fourth Stages to ensure that the matter would be discussed.</P>

Senator Brown smiles, but he has a facile lawyer's mind, and we have not; we simply try to gather the facts from a short statement read here at a moment's notice.  What we have before us is the amendment on the Order Paper, and that amendment, in spite of talks they had in Committee, was moved by Senator Brown yesterday and seconded by one who may have been a member of the Committee.  The President was in the House yesterday, and he did not produce his alternative amendment. That, to my mind, is the position.

There is a notice on it stating that failure to return the document within a certain date renders the person liable to a fine of forty shillings.  It does not hold it up.  It simply makes it more expensive to get the Census.  It is known that a particular document is not returned, and it is someone's business to see that the information which was not given on the document is given in some other way, and that the person responsible for the omission is prosecuted.

      <P>Under the Bill as originally framed, in the case of a written demand for information, it was provided that once the fact was proved that a prepaid letter addressed to the individual, asking for the information, had been posted, that was sufficient, and the court would have to act and say: &ldquo;This man got that requisition in writing because there is evidence that a stamp was put on it and that it was duly posted.  Under the Act we are bound by that to assume that he got it, whether he did or not.&rdquo;  That did not seem just, particularly in the case of a criminal prosecution.  The Committee, accordingly, seeing the injustice of it, adopted for the purpose of investigation the particular amendment now appearing on the Orders of the Day.  Apparently they were afterwards convinced by the President that that amendment would be unworkable and injurious to the taking of statistics and be very expensive, so they arranged that while it should be put on the Orders of the Day for the purpose of discussion, it should be put there only to see if some compromise could not be arrived at between the Committee and the Government.  As a compromise the Government suggest that in the case of a written demand for information it will be open to the <Col N="485" /> person who is alleged to have failed to answer, to prove that he did not in fact receive the pre-paid letter, and if he proves that to the satisfaction of the magistrate, he is not to be found guilty of the offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Land Bill, 1925. It proposes to amend the Land Act, 1923 in respect of holdings having an actual or potential value as building ground, residential holdings, compounded arrears of rent, and lands held under fee farm grants, leases for lives or years, renewable for ever, or leases for 60 or more years unexpired.</P>
      <P>As regards a holding excluded from the 1923 Act in consequence of being building ground in whole or in part, the Bill gives power to the Land Commission to divide the holding and separate the portion having value as building ground from the remainder of the holding, and to the latter part the provisions of the Land Act, 1923 shall apply.  If at the expiration of five years from the passing of this Act the landlord has not resumed the part of the holding declared to be building ground and utilised the same for building purposes the Land Commission may order that the Land Act of 1923 shall apply to the whole or part of the said lands, but if the landlord satisfies the Land Commission that he intends forthwith to build he may be granted a further period of time to do so.</P>
      <P>The effect of the Bill should be to speed up the erection of buildings where the land is really suitable building ground.  Tenants who hold under lease, except a building lease, are at the expiration of the same to be deemed yearly tenants notwithstanding that the lease may not have been existing prior to 1881.  Residential holdings are brought under the 1923 Act provided the following conditions exist:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) that the rateable value of the land exceeds that of the dwelling house;</P>
      <P>(2) that the tenant's principal or only business is farming;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) that the tenant is in bona fide occupation of the dwelling house and works and uses the land as an <Col N="487" /> ordinary agricultural or pastoral farm.</P>
    <P>Compounded arrears of rent remaining unpaid or any portion thereof may be added to the purchase money of any holding if the Land Commission so direct.  The occupier of land in a non-congested district held under a fee farm grant, lease for years or lives renewable for ever, or lease for 60 or more years, who is in a bona fide occupation and uses and cultivates the land as an ordinary farmer, and where the rent payable is equal to or exceeds a third term judicial rent, may apply to the Land Commission for an order, which they are empowered to make, that the land be vested in them as if it were situate in a congested district under the 1923 Act.  A demand for an amendment of the 1923 Act comes from various quarters.  The tenants and occupiers of land now excluded from its provisions desire to be included.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in a recent speech at Mountrath promised amendment as regards compounded arrears, and the Judicial Commissioner of the Land Commission also expressed the opinion that amendment was desirable in other respects.  I submit that this Bill will form the basis for giving relief to these parties.  I therefore move the Second Reading of the Bill, and I submit it for the favourable consideration of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianORourke" hpid="Mr. O'ROURKE Mr. O'ROURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'ROURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to second the motion for the Second Reading of this Bill.  When the 1923 Land Act was passing through the Seanad, we were under the impression that it would give complete land purchase for all the farmers and that it would serve to complete land purchase.  We now find that there are numbers of farms that do not come under the Act.  That is that these lands do not vest in the Land Commission.  They do not get the benefit of the arrears under the Land Act.  There are two sets of farms of this kind in the county I come from&mdash;land held under fee-farm grants and lands held under lease. Now, as I understand it, the reason these two sets of farms were exempted was because it was considered that the <Col N="488" /> rents were small, only 1/- or 2/- an acre.  Now, as a matter of fact, I know that land in my county held under fee farm grants is as high as 15/- an acre and, in the case of one farm in the neighbourhood where I live, the rent is 16/- an acre.  One hears a great deal about agricultural holdings and the need for tillage.  These men till 80 per cent. of their holdings.  Many of them have not more than 20 acres each.  When they saw this Land Act of 1923 being put through the Oireachtas, they considered that they would come under its operations.  But after a few months they found that this was not so.  Their landlords asked them to pay up.  At that time these men could not conceive that they would be compelled to pay the last penny, when everybody else was getting 5/- in the £, but when they consulted their solicitors they found they had to pay and they paid under protest.  It is very hard that these men are exempted while perhaps the grazier with five or six hundred acres of land gets the benefit of the Act.</P>
      <P>The other set of men exempted consists of those who held land under lease.  I understand it was because lease-holders were considered to be large ranchers that they were exempted from the Act, and it was desired that these ranches would be taken over and distributed.  In the counties of Louth and Monaghan there is a very large proportion of agricultural land held under lease.  These men till their land in the ordinary way, and they have to pay their full rent up to the present day.  They got none of the benefits as the others.  If we are to see fair play between these men and the rest of the tenants we should see that they get the same terms.  These are the great blots in the Land Act of 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be a case put up against this by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, to this effect, that if the leaseholders were brought in, all the grazing lands in the country could be brought in.  I do not think, and I am sure the other members of the Seanad do not think, that these men <Col N="489" /> should be brought in.  It could be confined to farmers of 150 acres.  That would exclude the ranchers from being brought in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I myself confess that I have become somewhat of a philosopher over this question of land purchase, having been almost extinguished by the operation of successive Land Acts.  Still we have to keep the flag flying to the last, and it is somewhat refreshing to find that this is a Bill where the subject matter has some relation to the fact that this is a land measure.  I do not rise to oppose the Bill because probably it will be necessary to have some amendments to the Land Act of 1923, but I do think that these should be considered comprehensively and dealt with by the Government.  On the point of these arrears I should like to ask the Government a question, and that is, when are those to whom the arrears are due likely to get paid?  I do submit that there is a solemn contractual obligation in this matter, and I do say we would be doing an infinity of harm to two parties if the solemnity of their contract is not recognised.  I know there is a popular feeling that only rich men are involved in this transaction.  Surely there must be at least one exception. We had yesterday the case of a working man named Lynham who had acquired the possession of lands as a result of his own labours.  I presume the tenant who held from him did not recognise his status when it became a question of arrears.  And I should be interested to know whether any arrears are due on his land or whether the tenant did recognise the quality of the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there are numbers of people in exceedingly needy circumstances depending on these arrears.  I submit that there is a claim to be recognised in this way in the case of people who have been born to a certain status of life and who now are reduced to living under conditions of the utmost poverty on a small income.  I therefore suggest that the Government should recognise that aspect of the case.  I also admit that the tenants and occupiers of land are suffering acutely at the <Col N="490" /> present time.  I have obligations and embarrassments to certain association, and I say that the members certainly recognise that fact, and I say that perhaps a certain recognition of that practical economic necessity is due from the Government.  That is no excuse for not carrying out the contract between the landlords&mdash;the owners of land&mdash;and the Government under the Act of 1923.  Perhaps the Minister may bear in mind that in this infant State it would be an injury to both parties not to carry out that contract fully.</P>
    <P>George Washington at the time when the &ldquo;greenbacks&rdquo; issued by the Government were coming into the hands of speculators and when pressure was being brought on him to write down drastically the value of these instruments, said: &ldquo;I do not care who owns them, they were issued under the credit of the State, and by that credit we will stand and we will discharge our obligations.&rdquo; There is in that a suggestion to this infant State that ought not to be neglected.  It is a question of policy. It is open to the Minister to give stock to the value of the cash.  The contract is in cash.  The contract should be discharged in cash.  The owners would be quite willing to accept stock which could be cashed at par value.  That can be given by emergency legislation and it should be given forthwith to relieve the acute need that exists, and I know it.</P>
    <P>As to the question as to how that is to be dealt with, if the Government did not see fit to ask the tenants to pay for it it could be met out of the general taxes, but I do submit that the question of the credit of the State is involved. There is a solemn contractual obligation under the Act of 1923 under which the landlords made great sacrifices&mdash;an Act under which they had to submit to the wiping out of all arrears after a certain date and had further to submit to a reduction of 25 per cent. in the arrears.  They contributed their share to the solution of the problem and it is not fair to ask them to contribute any more.  By asking that these arrears be added to the purchase money you are asking them to consent to a further reduction, roughly, 10 per cent. on the <Col N="491" /> amount you agreed to pay.  I know it is an unpopular thing to stand up in an Irish assembly and make any case for landlords.  I make no apology for doing so here.  I think the landlords have done more for this country than they got credit for.  Roughly speaking, since 1880 they have suffered a loss of from 60 to 70 per cent. of their incomes. It is at least fair that they should now get the full value which the Government contracted to give them under the Land Act of 1923.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the Second Reading of this Bill.  From my knowledge of the conditions that exist in the country, I know of no better remedy for the grievances that exist than that suggested in the Bill before us.  For that reason I think it should get a Second Reading.  I do not, for a moment, suggest that the arrangements outlined in the Bill are the best that could be made.  I think some amendment would be necessary to make it more acceptable to all parties.  I feel that the compounded arrears must be dealt with.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the arrangement suggested by Senator Keane being made.  There is no doubt at all that those in possession of fee farm grants are in a particularly unfortunate position.  Some small farmers, forty or fifty years ago, who had a little money, bought their small holdings.  I know that in the counties of Limerick and Tipperary there are many holders of that sort, and in all equity they should get the advantage of the Act of 1923.  This Bill will make for peace and security in the country, and for that reason it should get a Second Reading.  I beg to support it.</P>

      <P>I must say that to a great extent I agreed with Senator Keane in this matter.  It seems always to be concluded that the landlord, the owner of the land, has to suffer in every case.  When you reduce the rents of a certain number of people and there are a few people whose rents have not been reduced, that seems quite sufficient proof that a new Bill should be brought in to reduce the rents, not because it is a just matter, but because the rents of somebody else have been <Col N="492" /> reduced.  I think some consideration should be given to those who have been brought almost to starvation point by these wholesale reductions that have been given in the last 50 years.  Some regard should be had some time for the landlords.  I have not had very much regard for them myself, but there comes a point eventually when one must think of those who suffer.</P>

      <P>I agree that the Land Act needs amendment in some particulars.  Like Senator Sir John Keane, I have also become a philosopher in regard to land purchase.  I realise that it is possibly a recurrent problem and that it is a rather rash statement to say that this, that, or the other is going to be the last Land Act.  I think we found out that long ago.  It needs amendment in a great many clauses that have not been mentioned here.  I will find it necessary to introduce a Land Bill in the Dáil during this session to amend the Act in respect of the section dealing with Land Bank cases.  It has been found that land was purchased at a very excessive price in 1920 and that it would be quite impossible, as was contemplated by the Act of 1923, to resell the land at that price. It will also have to be amended in respect of building ground, I agree.  I agree that the section of the Land Act, 1923, dealing with building ground has caused a lot of hardship.  That is generally agreed, I think now, by the Land Commission and outside by landlords and tenants.  It really does not affect the interests of the landlord.  You have cases where there is a holding of 200 or 300 acres with, say, about two or three acres abutting on a road, which is potential building ground, and for that reason the whole holding is excluded. That is obviously unfair, and it is a legitimate business grievance that has to be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are thinking of introducing a clause in an amending Bill providing that the holding may be sub-divided and that that portion of the holding which is not building ground can be sold to the tenant purchaser.  I think that would probably meet with general consent.  I am not prepared to express any opinion on the particular sub-sections <Col N="493" /> of the clause of Senator Linehan's Bill which deals with building ground. I am merely setting down the general principles we will go on when drafting our amending Bill.  That is all I can say in reference to building ground.  I am not prepared to agree or disagree with the other sub-sections of that section. It is the first section, I think. For instance, sub-section (3) and sub-section (4) raise other questions that have to be examined.  I am not prepared at present to say what my attitude on that is.  All I am prepared to say is that we must introduce a Bill dealing with this question of building ground and that we do admit the principle contained in the first sub-section, namely, that the holding may be sub-divided and that that portion which is not building ground may be sold to the tenant.</P>
    <P>As to other amendments, I am considering an amendment giving certain security to farms which are used for the purpose of breeding high-class animals.  It may be possible to draft a clause which will meet the requirements of that case and at the same time give the Land Commission power which they consider they should have.  In any case that is a point to be considered.  There are other questions of detail which I need not go into now, but they must be dealt with urgently by some amendments under the Land Act.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of residential holdings&mdash;I have already dealt with building grounds&mdash;so far as I am concerned at the moment I do not think we could improve on the system under which we left the question of what is and what is not a residential holding to the Land Judge. Whether it is a residential holding or not depends on a number of questions. It depends on the circumstances under which the holding was let in the first instance.  It depends, also, on the terms of the agreement.  It depends on the circumstances of the person who got the holding and it depends on the user of the holding when he had it, and the ratio between the value of the house and the land.  It depends on 101 other factors, and I suggest that no definition which you could insert in an Act of Parliament could cover all the equities <Col N="494" /> of the case and that any such definition as Senator Linehan suggests would probably exclude some cases and would cause as much hardship from his point of view as is at present the case under the Land Act of 1923.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to agree when you have said all you have to say as regards a residential holding that a holding is not residential whenever the poor law valuation of the house is less than the poor law valuation of the land.  With regard to the fee farm grantees a good case could be made in a specific instance where a fee farm grantee and a long leaseholder should purchase. You can nearly make a case for anything by quoting specific instances in connection with legislation which deals in general terms with land purchase, but such a case will be the exception. My point of view can be expressed simply enough.  There may be good reasons for dealing with fee-farm grantees, but I think land purchase has gone far enough.  I think it should be our aim to limit it.  It should apply to all ordinary agricultural tenancies. We all know that there are demands from all quarters, from fee-farm grantees as well as from the holders of long leases, from owners of plots in the very hearts of the cities, from owners of houses, that something should apply to them, comparable to the particular legislation applying to agricultural tenants.  These demands are coming constantly upon us, but I suggest to anyone who values the security of property that we must set our face against that tendency somewhere. There were very special reasons for the Land Acts which go back a very long time.  There was need for special legislation to deal with the agricultural tenants of the country.  Our land legislation is probably the most drastic of any land legislation in Europe, and, as far as I am concerned, I am not anxious to extend its scope.  I am anxious to administer the Act so far as it applies to the ordinary agricultural tenants, but I am not prepared to hold that certain people who are not agricultural tenants should get the advantages of agricultural tenants within the Land Act of 1881.  We must draw the line somewhere. <Col N="495" /> There is demand from people who own land in the towns and from all sorts and conditions of property owners, that they should become the owners of their holdings.  That is going to hold us up if we accede to it, and it has to be stopped at some stage, and I think the stage to stop it is that which we reach by drawing a line for agricultural tenants, as those whose land comes under the Land Acts passed between the year 1881 and the year 1903.</P>
    <P>The fee-farm grantees have not, from that point of view, such a tremendous grievance.  I do say that a considerable portion of the land of the country acquired for division was held under long leases and in fee-farm.  That is a fact.  There are a great many people colloquially called landlords, who hold their land under fee-farm grants and long leases, and when I say that I am met with the case, &ldquo;we are thinking of the ordinary farmers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is an ordinary farmer?  We cannot deal with persons.  We cannot legislate on a standard as to whether a man has black hair or brown hair.  We must deal with land, not so much as with persons who occupy it, but with regard to their tenure.  With regard to the fee-farm grantees, to meet the plausibe case that they put forward we inserted a clause in the 1923 Act which practically gave them all the rights of tenant purchasers.  We allowed them to go to the Land Commission, and we provided that the Treasury should make an advance to enable them to redeem the rent; that is, where the land, in the opinion of the Land Commission, was good security, money would be advanced, the interest on which would bring in the fair rent having regard to the value of the land.  That means that a high rent paid under the fee-farm grant becomes less, and is reduced on the same principle that the Land Commission applies.  When making advances to new tenant purchasers, they consider whether the value of the land is security for the full redemption money.  If the rent is high it is reduced to what is considered the right annuity for sixty-seven-and-a-half <Col N="496" /> years.  So far as these people are concerned they will own their holdings at the end of the sixty-seven-and-a-half years, and during that period annuities paid by them, if they are in the same position as tenant purchasers, will be on the same basis.  Their rents are reduced if the rents are so high that in the opinion of the Commissioners, the land is not able to bear them. They become absolute owners at the end of the sixty-seven-and-a-half years. So far as these people are concerned, they are in the same position as tenant purchasers.</P>
    <P>But there are numbers of fee-farm grantee holders who held under extremely small rents.  I do not know whether it is seriously suggested that where land is let at 5/- an acre there should be a reduction of 25 per cent.  I think that frequently happens.  Occasionally rents under fee-farm grants are fixed under different circumstances. Sometimes the rents are high and sometimes they are far lower than the judicial rents fixed by the Land Commission.  But there have been leases for 90 years where the rent was fixed at a half-a-crown or five shillings an acre.  Is it seriously suggested that the same principle should apply there as in the case of rents fixed according to the judicial standard on an agricultural holding?  That would be an extraordinary and unjust state of affairs.  But when the rents are high and beyond what the land will carry, the Judicial Commissioners can come in and decide the redemption value of the rent, and meet the equities of the case.  You get a reduction of the amount if the rent is high, and the purchase annuities run on for sixty-seven-and-a-half years.</P>
    <P>That is to meet an exigency in a particular class of case, but there is no agreement from my point of view.  It is well to draw the line somewhere.  I ask people anxious that fee-farm rents should be purchased if they do not think that we must draw the line somewhere, and to consider how far they mean to go and whether we are to adopt the same course in all circumstances. I know the real grievance is this: there is usually a reduction of 25 per cent on the rent until the day <Col N="497" /> of purchase in cases of agricultural holdings.  What the fee-farm grantees are thinking of is, that their rents should be reduced immediately by 25 per cent., regardless of circumstances. I do not say that that is the case that Senator Linehan had in mind, but that was the way it was pressed upon me. They were not satisfied with the provisions of the Act; but they quoted the case of what they called the ordinary farmer of 50 acres.  He has a judicial rent, and he does not get his reduction, and they say that is the grievance, so far as he is concerned, but in the case of a man with land of 5/- per acre on a long lease, is he to get a reduction also?  I put these difficulties to show that I have not made up my mind that we ought to insert a clause for the fee-farm grantees.  I have been thinking over it.  It is always dangerous to say that you may change your mind because it is taken for granted, if you say that, that you will change your mind.  I have considered this matter with an open mind, and I say this here on the merits, and regardless of pressure on one side or the other, that I do not see the other side of the case put up.</P>
    <P>With regard to the compounding of arrears, the Land Act of 1923 provided that not more than three years' arrears all round should be collected. That in effect was practically all that could be dealt with.  I should say that out of the total rental of £1,000,000 there would not be more than £20,000 to be added for another half-year after the three years.  I mean by that that if you said instead of three years, three and a half years, the extra amount yielded by the additional half-year would not be more than £20,000.  We, in fact, provided that the arrears should be dealt with, and we provided that one and a half years of the three years was to be added to the purchase money and two years collected.  That was in 1923.  We are now in 1926. Things were not as prosperous in 1923 as they had been in pre-war days, or as they had been during the war, but we all expected that things would get better.  We certainly did not expect that the depression would continue or that prices would decline as steeply as they did in 1924 and in 1925, and we <Col N="498" /> did not expect a further fall in prices for agricultural produce would occur in 1926.  But these are the facts, and we find ourselves now, notwithstanding that we have a fairly stringent and drastic enforcement of the law which gives the sheriff powers he had not got pre-Treaty, and that he has been exercising ruthlessly, with considerable arrears of land purchase annuities and rather considerable arrears of rates, and there are considerable debts as between private individuals which have been undischarged.</P>
    <P>That is the position, and the prospect is that things will get a little worse before they get better.  In that state of affairs I have come to the conclusion that we cannot collect the one and a half year's arrears outstanding.  We have collected for one half-year; there are one and a half year's arrears outstanding, and we cannot collect the current annuities, the current payments in lieu of rent and current rate and at the same time collect one and a half year's arrears from people who owe in other respects.  That is unfortunately the state of affairs, and it is a precedent I do not like.  I make no secret about it. It is a precedent to be avoided.  We have got into bad habits.  To put it in another way, it is difficult to get away from an example which has always been set to us in that respect.  There has been this wiping out of arrears of rent since 1870.  We are not too anxious to follow that.  For the reasons I have given, we are compelled to come to the conclusion that we have no alternative except to add that one and a half year's arrears to the purchase money, and that is the view of most of the landowners I have discussed the matter with.  Is that going to be a hardship? The really important consideration in the matter is the one I have mentioned, that we are coming again to deal with arrears, by way of making people pay them.</P>
    <P>As to a point mentioned by Senator Sir John Keane, I would like to say that this one and a half year's arrears would be paid within, I should say, less than a year in bonds which stand at 90.  It has not been possible in this country to collect 100 per cent.  Ninety-five per cent. has <Col N="499" /> been more like it.  Landowners would lose on that five per cent., but they would get their money quicker than they otherwise would.  Many landlords with whom I have discussed the matter have admitted it is as broad as it is long.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane stressed the the fact that there are a great many people who are dependent on rents, on their income from lands, and who are by no means well off.  He asked me incidentally if I knew anything of the circumstances of the Lynham case.  I know nothing of the circumstances of that case.  I agree there are large classes of the community who are dependent for their livelihood on the receipts they can get from land, but it should be remembered they are getting their rents, now called payment in lieu of rent, at a time of rather acute depression, reduced, I admit, by 25 per cent., more promptly than they got them for seventy years.  There is not a landowner who has not admitted that.  You occasionally meet a man who complains, but it is always because it is the question of title.  Cases of this sort only represent two per cent. of the total rent.  They are getting their rents with regularity for the first time for seventy years.  That has to be remembered when people stress the conditions under which poor landowners are living at the moment.  Another point on which I want to say a word is that made by Senator Sir John Keane in regard to contractual obligations. The word &ldquo;contract&rdquo; has been used. <Col N="500" /> There is always a contract between the occupier of the land and his superior interest.  There always was that contract. That is the position in every country in the world.</P>
    <P>I have said all I have to say in introducing successive Land Acts.  I hope I made my position clear.  On the other hand, if there is anything in this contract, then it is applied to the land legislation which has been going on since Parliamentary government commenced in every country in Europe.  If there is a contract broken in introducing a new Act dealing with land, then there was a contract broken in 1923, 1903, 1889, 1881, and 1870, and in all the Land Acts behind that time, not only in this country, but in England, Scotland, France and Germany.  You can argue there is a contract.  Undoubtedly there is a contract between the owner of the superior interest and the occupier, and wherever legislation affects that in any way there is a breach of contract.  I protest against the suggestion that Irish land legislation amounts in fact to a breach of contract &mdash;some failure to keep your contract, some interference with the credit of the State which apparently does not apply to the land legislation it has been found necessary to pass in every other country in the world since Parliaments began.</P>
    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.20 until 3 o'clock on Wednesday, 3rd March, 1926.</P>
