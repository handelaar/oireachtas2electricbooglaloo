      <P>I have seen the terms of a resolution that Senator Gogarty wishes to move.  I think it is exactly the sort of resolution that the Standing Orders contemplated I should give permission to move without the necessity of notice being given of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, sir.  I understood that your permission was sufficient without suspending the Standing Orders.  I hope I am not presuming in asking the House to pass this motion, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That this House places on record its grateful appreciation of the recent action of Mr. Cornelius Sullivan of New York in presenting to the National Gallery, in trust for the Nation, six portraits of distinguished Irishmen.</P>
      <P>This is an affair of national importance, because, by bringing together, as it were, into the national family portraits and reminders of its most distinguished members, the nation becomes self-conscious of the nobility inherent in it, and it provides both a monument and an exemplar for others.  Such a collection of its relics and portraits becomes an inspiration to the nation.  We have been accused, as a nation, of ingratitude. This can be explained because in the first instance it was easy for people to conceal a political manoeuvre behind such an accusation, when, for instance, we were accused of not being sufficiently grateful for a Government in the election of which we could have neither hand, act nor part, and in the other instance, our benefactors may have set too high a value on their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But in this case our benefactor, Mr. Sullivan, wished to remain private.  He cabled to the National Gallery and <Col N="82" /> asked them if they required such pictures, and then cabled that he had obtained them, and so presented them to the nation.  I need not remind the House that behind such action as this there lies a great deal of power for the development of our country.  To obtain those pictures in the face of public bidding in New York is no gratuitous manoeuvre.  This country has a most wealthy and almost untouched field of archæological interest.  There is evidence of a civilisation in this country dating back 2,000 years B.C.  There are large gaps here and there in its history which will require money for excavations, large endowments and a Bill to protect the objects when excavated, before this field can be thoroughly explored.  Many American sons of this country have expressed their readiness to help the development of national archæological history.  Mr. Sullivan, by his presentation of the portraits of gifted Irishmen, has brought the Ireland of recent years into the national purview.  It does not require very great imagination to envisage the importance of such American interest in this country, which has been such a foundation of civilisation.  If it does require imagination, the composite character of this House is quite competent to supply it without any more suggestions from me, or any attempt on my part to thank Mr. Sullivan for this gift.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to second this motion.  It stands to reason that any nation would like to have a collection of the pictures of great Irishmen who have done honour to this country either at home or abroad.  I am very glad to know that one who is not a native of this country but who is connected with it by birth has helped us to obtain pictures of this sort.  From an archæological point of view I am, perhaps, more interested in these things than others, because I have been dabbling in them for years, with a certain amount of success.  I know tha wonderful things have been discovered in archæology of late years, tracing back the inhabitants of the various countries of Europe to ages that were never dreamt of.  Here in Ireland the same thing has been done.  The same field has been found and they have gone <Col N="83" /> back at last to the very beginnings of the Irish people, and we find that the beginnings really are, as they often were said to be, in tradition, dating back to Spain.  This, however, is not the time to say very much on this matter, except that we are greatly interested in these matters, as everybody must be, and we are very grateful to anyone who helps us to know ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a good many of these pictures in the painting and they are a great gift to the nation. Mr. Yeats was an artist, who has been dead a few years now, and I do not think he met with a great deal of appreciation in his day, but will in years to come when these portraits are in the National Gallery.  We know that some of these portraits reached a very high state of excellence indeed, as most artistic work.  Mr. Yeats was a little ahead of his time.  He did not paint in that methodical manner that was so much admired years ago; he had far more of that freedom that we get nowadays, more suggestion than actual representation, stroke by stroke of what is in front of the artist.  There are no portraits that I know that bear the test of years as far as one's judgment goes better than the portraits that Mr. Yeats has painted.  His and Mr. Nathaniel Hone's are two names that I think Ireland will be very proud of in years to come.  I am delighted to hear that Mr. Sullivan has given this gift to the nation.  I am sure that every Senator recognises that if we could only get his example copied it would be a great benefit to us all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COUNIHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be irrelevant to make a few remarks with regard to Labour in this country before this Bill passes.  The necessity for this Bill arose through the Labour upheaval in Great Britain, and my idea in rising is to make an appeal to the President, whose sympathy for Labour is recognised by every honest worker in the country, and to Labour representatives, in this House and outside, to see if some means could not be provided whereby strikes could be entirely prevented, at least for a period of years. <Col N="85" /> Now that our political troubles have been got over and peace and security established I hope it is not too much to expect that we might also have industrial peace and security for some time to come.  Strikes have done no good to anybody; Labour itself recognises that, and if the leaders of organised Labour could accomplish the prevention of strikes by the setting up of an arbitration board to which all disputes should be left, they would be conferring a great boon on the workers and would merit the good-will of every honest citizen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only deplore the bad taste of Senator Counihan in striving to arouse an acrimonious or contentious discussion on the last Stage of this Bill.  So far as Labour in Ireland is concerned in connection with this dispute we have no apologies and no regrets, and in similar circumstances would do precisely the same.  Employers who have met us admitted that we could do nothing else, and admitted that they admire men with principles rather than poltroons.  What we have done we would again do in similar circumstances, and the people whose interests Senator Counihan represents should not advise us as to what our attitude should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Farrell, you are always extremely fair and courteous, but I think you have entirely misunderstood the purport and the object of what Senator Counihan said, because, as I understood his remarks, he made no reflections whatever on Labour in this country, in connection with the recent strike or otherwise, and the gist of his remarks, as I followed them, was that he hoped that with the co-operation of Labour some means might be found to prevent strikes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">

      <P>I think that <Col N="86" /> that is so.  Of course it is not easy for the House always to follow what is said, but that is the way I read it.  Senator, I do not think you wanted to pass the slightest reflection at all on the policy of Labour or upon its leaders?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;No reinstatement condition shall attach or be attached to any sum payable by the Minister for Finance under Section 2 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if it is possible to attach a reinstatement condition with regard to these payments, but one <Col N="87" /> would naturally like that if possible the proper proportion of this additional ten per cent. would apply to the reinstatement of destroyed buildings.  Some of the grants have been in excess of £50,000, and addition of ten per cent. will be an appreciable amount, and one would like to see, because of the circumstances under which it is granted, that it would be spent in the country to the extent of restoring such a building.  Here it is deliberately omitted.  There may be some practical difficulty in the way, but I would like to have such a difficulty overcome so that the proportion of the addition might apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Damage to Property Act, 1923, specified various conditions under which reinstatement would be involved.  I would like to emphasise the difference between the Damage to Property Act, 1923, and the International Commission, called by some the Shaw Commission and by others, the Wood-Renton Commission. That Commission dealt with cases all of which occurred pre-Truce.  The Damage to Property Act, 1923, dealt with cases that occurred after the Truce and up to, I think, May 14th, 1923.  In the case of the Damage to Property Act ample provision was made for reinstatement.  There were various forms.  In the case of a very big house, in respect of which there might be a grant of £50,000, it was open to the applicant for compensation to apply for such a sum of money as would enable him to rebuild the premises as they were.  In a case of that sort a certain deduction was usually made by the Judge because of the increased value of the premises after restoration.  That was case No.1.  Case No.2 would be where a person made application for the transfer of the grant to a site in another county, and in that case reinstatement was a condition precedent to receiving any money.  In either of these cases money would only be paid on the receipt of a certificate from the architect.  There was a third case where a person did not desire to rebuild, and in that case he could claim what would be assessed as the market value of the premises.  That bore no <Col N="88" /> relation whatever to the cost of restoration. It has varied in cases from, say, £2,000 in the case of a £10,000 building to probably £4,000 in the case of a £50,000 building.  In that case the sum awarded, being only a proportion&mdash;ten or twenty per cent.&mdash;of the actual value of the property and not the market value, it would not be a very large sum. But the main purposes of reinstatement have been attended to under the Damage to Property Act.  I think that anybody who has any experience of its working will admit that every possible precaution was taken by the Oireachtas to ensure that where considerable sums of money were being paid in compensation to restore buildings a reinstatement condition was the inevitable outcome of the proceedings.</P>
      <P>The difficulty with regard to imposing a condition of reinstatement in a case of this sort resolves itself into this: that in no case that I have heard of has a sum been awarded in excess of the cost of restoration.  In other words, the sufferer in all cases had to supplement by a very considerable sum the amount granted in order to carry out the work.  In that case, of course, it will be seen at once that it would be unreasonable to ask for a still further extension of the terms in order to permit of this grant being paid, and, generally, I should say that the difference between the sums awarded in the case of the Wood-Renton Commission and in the case of the Damage to Property Act would vary from ten per cent. to thirty and forty per cent. in favour of the Wood-Renton Commission.  I think that having in this case taken every reasonable precaution that could be taken to ensure that a reinstatement condition would be attached to every decree for destroyed property, it would scarcely be reasonable now to insert a further reinstatement condition.</P>

      <P>With regard to our future there is now available those Bills that we have dealt with to-day and that are not finished.  In addition, there is the prospect that within some days we will receive from the other House the Shop Hours Bill, the Court Officers Bill and Local Elections Bill.  These will, of course, only be available for Second Reading, and I do not think there would be sufficient business to justify me in convening a meeting of the Seanad for next week. There is an additional reason why, if possible, we should not meet next week. Senator Brown is very anxious to speak <Col N="90" /> upon the Second Reading of the Court Officers Bill, but he will not be here next week and he is very anxious that that Bill should not be taken until the week following.  Possibly that is a Bill upon which the Seanad would be glad to have his views.  My own view is that if we adjourn until the week following we will be very likely to have at least two days' work, and when we do meet I think we should have sufficient business to keep us occupied for two days rather than that we should be called together simply for an hour or two hours.</P>
