      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand some time ago Senator Fitzgerald handed in a motion asking for an inquiry into the affairs of the National Land Bank which he afterwards verbally withdrew. Yesterday I asked the Clerk about the motion, and I wish if possible to have it taken at an early date.  I want the Seanad to meet to-morrow and take that motion.  Certain matters were raised in the other House yesterday. It is not satisfactory that a motion of this kind should be mixed up with other business, and for that reason I ask that the Seanad meet to-morrow to take the motion.</P>

      <P>It will be an advantage that we should meet to-morrow. The Minister for Justice asked that we might dispose of the remaining stages of the Rent Restrictions Bill, and in view of the fact that we are going to have a substantial accumulation of business I think it is wiser to meet to-morrow. In that case the motion to which you refer will appear to-morrow. As to the time, I am entirely in the hands of the House.  It might be an advantage to meet early in the case of country members who want to get home.  If there is no objection we might meet at 11.</P>

    <P>(1)  Every officer and every servant of the amalgamated company who if he had not become such officer or servant would have been entitled to a gratuity under the first paragraph of the Third Schedule to the Principal Act shall, if his services are dispensed with by the amalgamated company within seven years after the passing of the Principal Act and whether before or after the passing of this Act on account of his services having become unnecessary in consequence of changes of administration due directly to the amalgamation and absorption of companies effected by or under the Principal Act and not shown by the amalgamated company to have been caused by decrease of traffic, reduction of renewal or maintenance work, introduction of improved methods of working (other than methods <Col N="327" /> which would not have been feasible for the amalgamating or absorbed company by which the officer or servant was formerly employed), or other economic cause, be entitled to be paid by the amalgamated company a gratuity calculated on the basis of one-sixth of the amount of his annual salary and emoluments for every completed year of his service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. CUMMINS Mr. CUMMINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CUMMINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  To delete in lines 28-29 the words &ldquo;within seven years after the passing of the Principal Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this is to get back to the position which railwaymen were in after the passing of the 1924 Act. There was no limit in that Act to the time within which a railway employee might be dispensed with and still be in a position to claim compensation. That was secured to him by the Act, which we know was practically an agreed measure between the employee and the railway company.  We seek by this Bill to take from the employee rights which he had secured after due deliberation by an Act passed by this House.  I think that is extremely unjust. It is a thing that, as far as we know, is not done in any Parliament in any country where an amalgamation of services has taken place or where there has been reorganisation of an industry.</P>
      <P>We should not set up in this House a standard of that description by which we can filch away to-day what we ratified a few days ago, not for the reason that any change has taken place in the economic condition of the country, but for some reason which seems so far to be only known to the Minister himself. I have watched the Bill in the Lower House, but I can point to nothing that can convince me that this destruction of the workmen's rights was justified. No claim can be made by a servant after 1931.  If his services become redundant, say, within the next four or five years, he has a claim for six and a-half years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult enough for a man to establish a claim at the present moment, or even within the next year, but when it is six or seven years it will be almost <Col N="328" /> impossible for that man to establish a claim, and the anomaly is that he may establish it after six years and eleven months, but by the company holding him one month longer in their service they can dispense with that man.  If he were able to prove it after a lapse of seven years there is no reason why he should not be granted the terms as laid down for him in the Bill last year. Like yesterday's Bill, to some extent, this is one of retrospective legislation, and it is, I think, pitiable, and not to the credit of both Houses, that it is necessary at such an early stage to bring in this.  It is quite possible that the company may balance up its account at the end of four or five years, and say it is cheaper to keep these men, whose services are redundant by reason of amalgamation, walking about the platform with their hands in their pockets for seven years, and get rid of them without any compensation, than to allow them to establish their claim now.  A man may be in a position to establish his claim now, but is not released by the company to do so. He is kept on in their employment because it is cheaper for them.  In the British Act of 1921 this was not done. There was no limit placed to the time at which he could prove redundancy, and claim what he was entitled to claim.  I think the railway companies should be very slow to do that, because I believe in any system of reorganisation they will not pay men to walk about, but the temptation to railway companies is great to do so.  I do not think I have anything further to add.  Apart from the general iniquity and unfairness of the Bill, this is one of the glaring grievances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be able to see his way to accept this amendment.  I fail to see why he should consider it necessary to introduce such an amending Bill at all.  I hardly think it was in the companies' original Bill as handed to him.  It is certainly not in the Act because of anything that has happened in connection with the administration of the Third Schedule, seeing obviously that nobody could come with a claim for compensation seven years after the passing of the Act which was passed <Col N="329" /> two years ago.  There is more in that part of the Third Schedule we are repealing than the mere payment of compensation for redundancy.  Sub-section (3) of the Third Schedule provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No existing officer or servant so transferred shall, without his consent, be by reason of such transfer in any worse position in respect to the conditions of his service as a whole (including tenure of office, remuneration, gratuities, pension, superannuation, sick fund, or any benefits or allowances, whether obtaining legally or by customary practice of the amalgamating or absorbed company) as compared with the conditions of service formerly obtaining with respect to him.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (4) lays down certain conditions.</P>
      <P>It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If any existing officer or servant so transferred is without his consent in any such worse position as aforesaid, by reason of such transfer, and has thereby suffered any loss or injury, he shall be entitled to be paid by the amalgamated companies such lump sum as would reasonably compensate him for such loss or injury.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are repealing in this Bill that sub-section (4), and that means that after five years from now the company who took over a number of officers and servants are at perfect liberty to reduce their salaries and to reduce their status, and in every respect that they may desire, apart from the question of dismissing them, they have the right to reduce and to disimprove the conditions of service, which these men enjoyed under the old Act.  Apart from the question of redundancy, you are taking away all protection in that respect from every railway employee who has been transferred.  As Senator Cummins has pointed out, if it is just and if it is logical to afford protection at all, that protection should not be for a temporary period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You might as well say that seven years after the signing of the Treaty all transferred civil servants should lose the rights which they held and the conditions which they enjoyed prior to the Treaty.  Nobody can suggest here in this House with any sense of reason <Col N="330" /> that five or seven years after 1921 these civil servants should be stripped of all protection.  Yet that is the position in regard to this Bill.  If a man is redundant at any time, the Minister says that redundancy will have shown itself by that time.  It may: it is quite possible that the redundancy will have shown itself within that time.  It is a question of chance, but if it does arise after the seven year period named in the Bill that a man is disimproved in his position or that he becomes redundant, it will be obviously much more difficult to prove it than it would be within seven years.  That is his funeral, but if he can prove his case, where is the logic of depriving him of the right of proving that case and of getting compensation? It is a fact that he may be dismissed after six years and eleven months, or even on the exact completion of the seven years, and he can establish his claim for compensation, but if a period of seven years and a day has elapsed, he is outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>You are taking away more than the mere right of compensation in these cases.  You are stripping the man of the fundamental rights he has of being no worse under amalgamation than he was prior to it.  I do not see the necessity for it.  It has not been found necessary to introduce anything like that into the British Act or into the Rates and Valuation Act of 1925 in the British Parliament.  There has been no reason found for introducing this provision into the Local Government Act or any of the Acts passed by the Oireachtas, and I do not see the logic or the reason for introducing it here.  It cannot be said that the necessity has arisen for it, that there are instances to show that it is necessary, but a mere presumption that something may happen which the Minister has not indicated renders it necessary now.  I suggest to the Minister that it is unreasonable to introduce it into this Bill. It is introduced as a new principle for which there is no justification.  The amendment should be accepted and we would be thereby restoring the <i>status quo</i> as far as this particular portion of the Bill is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> Until the period is reached when a man may be dismissed without any compensation, a number of years would elapse, and in large organisations like this, so many men will die or retire because of old age during that time, as time goes on the men need not be redundant. They can be transferred from one station to another, but if a man is found seven years after the passing of the Principal Act to be redundant, he should not be deprived of any privilege the Minister is giving under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Dowdall and other Senators have said.  I think the Minister should accept this amendment.  It is very unreasonable to penalise these men in the manner that he proposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. BAGWELL Mr. BAGWELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there are some other points which the House might take into consideration in considering this limitation.  There has been a reasonable period allowed within which men may enjoy certain rights conferred by the Principal Act. Comparisons have been made with the English Railways Act and other legislation, but in the first instance it should be remembered that the English Railways Act was an agreed measure.  The Irish Railways Act was not sought by the railways amalgamated under it. They are a private concern and have to make their own way.  They are not finding it very easy to do so.  I think seven years is an ample period and I think that a limitation of this kind is only reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say it was a pity that the Labour Party when they were sharing around their amendments had not taken care to see that two amendments so alike in essentials as No. 1 and No. 5, should not have been given to the same Senator, but then Senator O'Farrell, who has some experience of railway affairs, makes exactly the same inaccurate statement that Senator Cummins so unfortunately made.  Senator Cummins said that this Bill takes away rights given to certain individuals by the 1924 Act.  Does Senator Cummins really believe that any men referred to <Col N="332" /> in Section 2 of this Bill had any rights given to them by the 1924 Act?  I think the Senator does not realise what the effect of the section is that he refers to.  He made a comparison with the British legislation, but the people referred to in Section 2 of the Bill are not brought into the British legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I might say that this amendment referred, of course, also to Section 4, and it was thought desirable for convenience sake, as the same arguments would be adduced as regards Section 4, to refer to the matter here, because the short-service men, if kept on, eventually become long-service men and their rights have to be protected.  If the Minister would confine himself to the principle, rather than debating points, it would be better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Debating points when I answer, but not debating points when the Senators make the plea.  It is a pity the Senators had not been asked to make themselves familiar with the difference between amendments 1 and 5, but then Senator O'Farrell did not even point it out to the House.  Let us keep to the principle that he raised.  Senator Dowdall made an argument with which Senator Colonel Moore agreed and with which I am in complete agreement in so far as I understood it&mdash;that redundancy is not likely to arise after seven years. I hold that any effects of the Railways Act of 1924 are going to be fully felt within about three years' time, and we say seven years&mdash;three within which the effects may be felt, and four during which there might be an exceptional case that would hang on for a longer period.  I agree with Senator Moore and Senator Dowdall that there is not likely to be any question of redundancy after seven years, but we want finality in this.  If we do not put in a period where is the finality? Finality is reached when every railway employee in the service of the company when the Railways Act came into operation has left the service or has died. That is the only way to get finality if you do not put in some definite period. I ask the House do they consider that the effects of amalgamation are going <Col N="333" /> to show themselves by bringing about redundancy in two or three years, and if so, then I ask them to say that a seven-year period within which claims may be brought for compensation for loss of office by redundancy is quite a sufficient period.</P>

If it is a just principle to extend protection only for a limited period in respect of railwaymen surely it will be good in respect of every other man.  I hope the Minister will come down to the merits of the case.  We do not presume to compete with him on debating points.  We only want reasonable justice for 17,000 men.</P>

      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  To delete all after the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; in line 30 down to and including the word &ldquo;cause&rdquo; in line 39 and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;for any cause other than misconduct or incapacity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I hope Senators will pay all the attention they can to this amendment. The last amendment was lost by one vote, that of a Senator who only came in and knew nothing about the matter. I wish to impress on the Seanad the vital importance of this amendment if the subsequent section and sub-sections of the Bill are to come into operation at all.  The amendment would make Section 2, sub-section (1), read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every officer and every servant of the amalgamated company who if he had not become such officer or servant would have been entitled to a gratuity under the first paragraph of the Third Schedule to the Principal Act shall, if his services are dispensed with by the amalgamated company within seven years after the passing of the Principal Act and whether before or after the passing of this Act for any cause other than misconduct or incapacity, be entitled to be paid by the amalgamated company...&rdquo;</P>

What shall a man have to prove or what shall he have to disprove in order to get compensation?  It is infinitely more important in the case of Section 4, which deals with a long-service man, up to 50 years' service, than in the case of a short-service man. What I want to put to the House is that there is not a bit of use in laying down a basis of compensation if there is put between the man and the compensation absolutely insuperable obstacles. I say in all sincerity that the Bill as it stands makes it impossible for one-twentieth of the men who may become redundant now or hereafter, or of the hundreds who have already become redundant, to prove a case.  The Minister may bring in some other words.  It is his business to do that if he seeks to alter the Act in a drastic form.</P>
      <P>As it stands the Bill makes it impossible for anyone to bring a case for compensation except, at the outside, one in twenty.  Ever since the Railway Commission in 1922 the companies were well aware that either nationalisation or amalgamation was morally certain. They were shaping policy in accordance with that understanding.  A number of positions that became vacant were not filled and as a result staffs were being gradually reduced.  When amalgamation took place the railways were working with minimum staffs.  A number of men were doing superior duties because the posts they were filling were not officially filled and they were carrying on as deputies.  The new company started with a skeleton staff.  Every man on the railway before amalgamation took place had a practical certainty of permanent employment, if amalgamation had not taken place.  The Act merely provides that all these employees and servants of the old companies became automatically servants and officers of the new company.  In accordance with such agreements, brought about for the public benefit&mdash;and in connection with a Bill which was not asked for by the railway employees&mdash;the fundamental principle was observed of either finding employment for them or compensating them on a certain basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basis was not an exceedingly generous one.  As I pointed out, a man <Col N="337" /> with 30 years' service to his credit who had 50/- a week prior to amalgamation and who became redundant would get a pension of only 25/- a week.  The less service the less compensation.  If they dispensed with half the staff they would at all events by that means be making very extensive savings in regard to working expenses.  What has happened?  Nearly always when there is temporary depression in trade or in traffic companies do not proceed to dismiss the staff immediately.  They hold them on for a certain period and gradually absorb them as vacancies occur.  They stopped recruiting and made use of the natural wastage, either where men were retiring from old age, death, resignation, emigration, or dismissal for incapacity or misconduct. They gradually absorbed the redundant staff in that way.  The amalgamated company could effect extensive economies by these methods.  They could hold people who were redundant until sufficient vacancies arose to absorb them and thereby avoid paying compensation or putting them out.</P>
    <P>What they are trying to do, unfortunately, according to the Minister's statement, is to dispense with them, by dismissing them forthwith, without paying any compensation and saying that it is not because of amalgamation. I think it is ridiculous to say they are not redundant because of amalgamation but because of reduction in traffic, improved methods of working, or any other economic cause.  The man in the first place has to prove that his services are being dispensed with by the amalgamated company on account of having become unnecessary in consequence of changes in administration due directly to amalgamation and absorption of the company, as effected by the Principal Act. He has to prove all that against what the company undoubtedly seek to prove&mdash; that his redundance is due to decreased traffic, reduction of renewal or maintenance work, to improved methods of working which would not have been feasible by the smaller or absorbed companies by which the officer or servant was formerly employed, or for any other economic cause.</P>
    <P>The railwayman, no matter what his position, who would attempt to try to <Col N="338" /> prove a case of that kind and disprove the other case brought up by the company's experts against him, would be only fit for a lunatic asylum.  Let us take a case, say a goods depot like the North Wall.  Suppose it is found that there is an annual reduction of 10,000 tons of traffic outwards and inwards to the North Wall Depot; there is a huge traffic outwards to cross-Channel stations and inland, and there is a huge inwards traffic for Dublin from the country and cross-Channel stations. Now suppose there is found to be a reduction of 10,000 tons of traffic in a year; that can be shown not only to affect the employees at the North Wall but, also, to affect the general chain of staffs which handle, either physically or in correspondence, the transportation of that traffic.  First, the goods are handled at the North Wall, and they are also handled at the receiving stations. If you reduce traffic at North Wall you reduce the work of the men there, and you reduce the work, to some extent, of the men at the various stations throughout the whole system dealing with traffic from North Wall.  You reduce the correspondence at North Wall affected by that traffic, the invoicing and the rest of it, inward and outward, and you affect the work of the various departments in the chief office&mdash;the goods department, the statistics department, the traffic department, and the accounts, and the cash department and other departments at the North Wall will be affected by this 10,000 tons of traffic in a greater or lesser degree.  You reduce the work of every man who deals with the administration of traffic right through the whole chain.</P>
    <P>To put that in concrete form it may represent the work of ten men for a year, but you cannot show in that way that ten men are redundant at any one station as a result.  You can show that there is a fraction taken off the work of a great many men.  You have five or six thousand men affected, and you cannot select ten men and say these men are redundant.  What you can do is if you have 200 or 300 men redundant and if you can prove that this decrease of traffic takes something off a man's duties you establish the case that redundancy is brought about by a decrease in traffic, and the claim of the <Col N="339" /> men for compensation fails.  And if that fails you can say there is a reduction in renewal and maintenance in connection with locomotives and permanent way, owing to improved methods of working, and you can bring forward officials from the statistics and accounts departments, and so on, in support of that statement.  If, after that, you feel you still have a weak case you can say that the redundancy is due to improved methods of working brought about by the genius of the new management.  If after that you still feel shaky you can plead some other economic cause.  You can prove that there is a depression in trade, and consequently that there is not the same amount to be handled, and there is no need to have the same amount of people employed now as when trade was booming.</P>
    <P>What chance has one individual, whether he be a porter or a permanent way man or a senior clerk, to disprove all these various things that can be advanced in a scientific way by facts, figures and argument put up by the company's experts if the company seek to make a case against him?  He has none.  You may as well say the work in this House is looked upon as not affording sufficient employment for 60 Senators, and consequently it is decided that 10 were redundant.  But who are to be selected as redundant?  It may be supposed, perhaps, that you could easily select them in the present circumstances from among the absentees. But suppose all Senators attended here, and it was still contended that there was not enough work for 60, and the numbers must be reduced by ten, then whom would you select?  You might say some Senators talk a lot and generally do not do a lot of work; others come here and obey the party Whips and vote for the Government and they may be held to be doing more useful work than those who hold up the House talking.  You may be able to prove that the reduction of work affects every Senator, but how can you make a case against any one of these if they claim compensation for redundancy?  It is as difficult for a railwayman to prove that he is not one of <Col N="340" /> the people affected by the various clauses set out in the Third Schedule.</P>
    <P>It is for us merely waste of time to talk of discussing the subsequent sections of the Bill if 2 and 4 are allowed to remain, postponing aspirations which nineteen-twentieths of the people can never hope to attain.</P>
    <P>A great deal of heat was brought into the discussion of this Bill in the other House.  The Minister in charge of the Bill made the extraordinary statement here the last day that my opposition to the Bill was actuated by the fact that I wrote him a certain letter which he characterised as absurd, and that, arising out of a feeling of pique, as a result, I opposed the Bill.  He must know very well that from the day the Bill first saw the light I publicly denounced it, and that, long before that letter was written, and before any of the debates in the Dáil took place, he must know that somebody, with some sense of justice, would have to make an appeal for elementary justice for the vested interests of 17,000 railway employees.</P>
    <P>It has not been found necessary to introduce these provisions into the British Act at all, and for that reason, notwithstanding what Senator Bagwell says, there is not one iota of difference governing the position in this Bill and in the British Act.  How can there be? The principle is the same: neither party asked for the Bill; it was forced upon them.  I appeal for serious consideration for my amendment, and I appeal to the Minister to come down from the hard, antagonistic attitude he has taken up.  If he has any grudge to satisfy in this matter, let him deal with us.  It is not right that people outside &mdash;honest working men, some in very responsible positions, some in very humble positions, but nevertheless all entitled to Justice at the hands of the Oireachtas&mdash;should suffer because the Minister may have a score to settle with somebody else in this House.  The Minister knows that amendments No. 2 and 5 are absolutely essential, or something comparable to them, before any man can possibly get compensation. His advisers admitted, privately, that if the company want to take advantage of this, no compensation need <Col N="341" /> be paid.  And they have said: &ldquo;Surely Mr. Keogh is not going to take advantage of such a position.&rdquo;  That is a deplorable position, but it is a fact.  I do not suggest <i>mala fides</i> on the part of the railway companies, but I suggest that men should not be placed at the mercy of one side in this business, but that they should be protected by the law and not have to appeal for mercy. If that is a good principle in one case it is good in another.  I have tried, as far as possible, because of the technical nature of the case, to put the position before the Committee, and if they take the view I tried to impress upon them I feel they will accept this amendment, or one that will enable those concerned to have a reasonable chance of establishing their claims to compensation when they lose their employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. BAGWELL Mr. BAGWELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee should be reminded, before they decide upon this amendment, what the position would mean to the railway companies if it were accepted.  It would mean that the railway companies would have to compensate every man discharged other than for misconduct or incapacity.  No matter how trade fails, no matter how little work there was to do, they would not be able to discharge anybody in such circumstances, except by paying compensation.  That is a position no business should be put into. The mover of this amendment has said that the amalgamation of the companies was done in the public interest. All I can say is that it is not in the public interest to have an impoverished railway company deprived by the passing of this amendment of the right of reducing their expenditure as all other companies are in a position to do. By passing this amendment the Seanad would be placing the railway company in an embarrassed financial position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter I wanted to know, for it looked as if Senator O'Farrell requires the railway company to go on with the same service <Col N="342" /> of men irrespective of their necessities. But inasmuch as the railway company have, since the time of the amalgamation, reduced their staff considerably, I now think there is a good deal to be said for Senator O'Farrell's amendment.  We all know what it is that leads to the slum population of Dublin.  It is the attempt to readjust the falling-off in trade, the varying employment and the uncertainty of employment for a section of the people, some weeks more and some weeks less. That means that people have to live near the source of their employment. Now, if the railways have already profited by the dismissal of so many men, I think they should now be at the minimum number, and they ought be provided for under this Bill.  I certainly do agree if the Railway Board is put into the position of being a judge of what is misconduct or incapacity, no ordinary workingman would have any earthly chance.  The impoverishment of the railways would be bad for the country, but the impoverishment of the proletariat would be worse.  It takes moral courage to say, as I say, that I do not understand the Bill, but I do understand the arguments.  In Section 3, sub-section (1) there is a clause which does not cover this.  It refers here in Section 1 to schedule 3.</P>

      <P>If it is decreasing the company should have had sufficient perspicacity to dismiss the workers before they took over.  Arbitrary employment is the cause of a great deal of trouble in this city, and it is the cause of a great deal of misery, too.  Lately on the Greater Dublin Commission we went into the question of slums.  We found that it was mainly caused by uncertain employment.  At the same time it is preposterous to suggest that any business could be run if dictated to by its employees.  With the powers that <Col N="343" /> the railway directors have there is a want of foresight if they have to insist on this arbitrary method regarding employment in future.</P>

      <P>I have listened very closely to the arguments advanced by Senators in favour of this amendment and these arguments appear to be that because certain provisions of the Act are capable of being abused, then they should be removed altogether. That seems an extreme argument. As the amendment stands now, it would, if passed, make the railways uneconomic for all time.  If there is a possibility of abuse why does not the Senator put up an amendment that would close the door to abuse?</P>

Would they be entitled to compensation?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>None.  I will take this amendment No. 2 and amendment 9 to Section 4 together.  It is quite gratuitous to bring these people under Section 2 in this Bill at all and to give them any compensation.  As far as having any objection to that, I could very easily have left them out of the schedule of the measure.  Now I will take amendment No. 9, which aims at Section 4, which is the more important section and goes to the root of the whole Railway Bill.  When the House passed the Compensation Schedule in the Act of 1924 it was on this basis that people should get compensation where they were being dismissed or given duties that diminished pay, and various other things; where that was due to amalgamation, then there should be compensation, and not in any other case; and that the amalgamated companies should have the same right to dismissal where trade fell off as any of the non-associated companies had before the Act was passed.  I put it that that was the principle under which the Third Schedule of the Railway Act operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that principle be admitted we say here that if a man's service becomes unnecessary, consequent on changes of administration due directly to the amalgamation and absorption of companies affected by or under the Principal Act, and not shown by the amalgamated company to have been caused by these various things, decrease of traffic, and so on, we want to get the Seanad to consider those various other things.  Is it the contention of any person in this House that if ten employees in the amalgamated company are thrown out of employment, by reasons shown to be due to a decrease of traffic, that these employees are to get <Col N="345" /> compensation?  If anybody argues that, then he can vote for this amendment. I hold that where men are dismissed through a decrease of traffic then the company should not have to pay compensation.  Senators have talked of that, and said that the company need only say that it is due to a decrease of traffic.  They have a great deal more to do than that.  They have to prove it to the satisfaction of the arbitrator.  Senator Gogarty has also said: &ldquo;What is the good of these workmen coming before a railway board armed with those figures, and how are they going to decide?&rdquo; The railway company has nothing to do with this decision.  The railway company has to bring forward its evidence, and if that evidence is not accepted by the arbitrator, then compensation will have to be paid by them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said <Col N="346" /> with regard to that argument applies to every one of those other things.  Is it considered to be an unsound and unfair thing that if a man's dismissal is due to a reduction in renewal or maintenance work, or to the introduction of improved methods of working or other economic causes, that should carry with it compensation?  I hold it should not, and I ask the House to agree to that.  Economic causes&mdash;the Senator says that in the last resort, if they had not any definite thing to put forward, then they can put forward economic causes.  They must define the economic causes and show that to the satisfaction of the arbitrator.  What is to be the effect of the amendment? That you take the number of railway employees in the service of different companies on the day of amalgamation and you stereotype that number for all time except where you can prove a man's incapacity or misconduct.  Is it to be considered right that a company should be burdened with a considerable number of men that they took into their services on the day of the amalgamation, and that they should not have the right every one of these companies had prior to amalgamation to dismiss them for any economic cause?  Senator O'Farrell and also Senator Gogarty said that the railways have now a minimum staff.  I would like to know what would the railway employees think of a situation arising here as arose in England recently, when the orders given were:&mdash;&ldquo;Recruit your staff, not to the numbers previously employed, but up to your traffic requirements.&rdquo;  It is absurd to say the railways here are down to traffic requirements.  Does he think that a full 100 per cent. of the workers would be required?  I should say that 75 per cent. would not be an overestimate of the number that would be taken on.  One has only to consider the amount of traffic carried over the lines from 1917 to 1923, and consider the decrease last year, and consider whether there is not sufficient cause in that decrease to have a considerable number of men dismissed.  I heard today that the number was 3,000, but I never before heard it put higher than 1,000; so that it is late in the day to have the number more than doubled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> Do not let there be any consideration here for the railway management.  I do not want it for them, nor do I ask for any consideration for the railway shareholders; they will be affected only indirectly by this Bill.  They will be affected only if the railways are so impoverished that they become an insolvent concern.  We are asked to stereotype the number of employees, but remember you have to pay for stereotyping the number of railway servants.  We hear business men talking about traffic rates.  We hear of farmers making demands for a reduction of rates.  It is the railway users who have to pay if this amendment is passed.</P>
    <P>You stereotype the number of railway employees at 17,000, the number taken over, and make the company keep them without advertence to the trade conditions, and you cannot dismiss a man for anything except incapacity or misconduct.  The railway management will say: &ldquo;Very well; it does not matter.  We have a good case to go before the Railway Tribunal for an increase of rates, and the man who pays in the long run will be the railway user.&rdquo;  The business man and the farmers' representatives here should have that before them, and think long before they pass any wild amendment of this sort that Senator O'Farrell has down.  I put it again as the basis of compensation: was redundancy due to amalgamation?  The section in the Bill in no way interferes with that principle.  I ask the Senators to consider these matters.  Is it considered right that the men should be paid compensation for any of these things mentioned, other than that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister inadvertently gave away his whole case, and then put forward the best argument that could be advanced in favour of the amendment.  The particular amendment under discussion is the principal one that has to be considered in connection with this Bill.  It seeks to retain what was guaranteed to the workers under the Railways Act of 1924.  When that Act was being put through here employees of the railway companies that were being amalgamated were guaranteed certain <Col N="348" /> things, and we thought it was too good to be true.  We thought in 1924 there was a change of heart, that at last these class distinctions we hear so much about were to be removed, and barriers broken down, that at last the working-class people were going to get the same treatment as everybody else. But we counted our chickens too soon. Suddenly the railway companies set to work and brought pressure to bear on the Government to take away from the working-class employed on the railways what had been granted to them under the 1924 Act.  When I was at school there were a few lines we used to read, and I think they are repeated still:</P>
      <P>Give a thing, take it back,</P>
      <P>God will ask you where is that.</P>
      <P>If you say you do not know</P>
      <P>God will send you down below.</P>
      <P>You gave the working-class people certain rights&mdash;the same rights as you guarantee to the shareholders of the amalgamated company&mdash;that their dividends would be secured.  There is nothing in this Bill to take these away. The Minister has said so, and I take it the Minister knows.</P>

      <P>We say the working people employed by the railway company were given certain rights under the 1924 Act.  We are not asking for any extension of them; we are simply asking that the rights granted be maintained.  Of course the House may take these rights away, we may be outvoted on this amendment, but that would not dispose of the justice of our claim.  The arguments put forward by Senator O'Farrell ought to convince members of this House that the amendment ought to be adopted.  If it is not adopted the Bill so far as we are concerned is of no further use to us.  We are satisfied that if the section now before the House is passed without amendment it will be impossible for any working man who is employed by <Col N="349" /> any of the railway companies and who loses his employment because of the amalgamation to prove that he was dismissed because of the amalgamation. If the section as it stands is passed the dice will be loaded against the workers. You can carry that section if you wish, but if you do we are satisfied that you will be deliberately taking away from a large number of industrious, hardworking people the rights you gave them under the 1924 Act.  If you do that, on your heads be the result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to correct a misapprehension which has been conveyed by the Minister.  He says the claim is to stereotype all the employees for all time that were employed at the time of amalgamation.  There is no such claim.  There is on the railways, as in most other companies, a more or less floating staff of about 5 per cent. There are people coming and going, retiring, dying, or being dismissed, so that you will have a floating staff of 1,000 out of 20,000 employees.</P>
      <P>The company would save practically all redundancies by simply holding their hands for a year or thereabouts, and recruiting no new staff until they had finally absorbed those for whom work was not available.  Surely the Minister and the House will admit that there must be some people redundant in any case, because of the amalgamation taking away sixteen headquarters and amalgamating them into one.  You must have some redundancies, otherwise it was a farce bringing in the Third Schedule.  The Minister's contention seems to be there should be nothing paid by way of compensation to them.  The Minister seems to suggest that this is a matter between the railway users and the railway employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, he brings in a measure and says that one small section of the people shall have to bear the trials and tragedies that are necessary in order that the public, as a whole, may profit.  That is preposterous and is equivalent to confiscation, and if a similar proposal proceeded from this side of the House it would be regarded as syndicalism and Bolshevism.  It is confiscating the rights of a small section in the interests of the community <Col N="350" />&mdash;that is what the Minister says.  He knows that will appeal to the gallery. Every person outside who pays 6d. for a ticket will feel the Minister is acting in his interest, and robbing the railway men in order that he may get his ticket at 5d. or 5½d.  He does not say that the protection afforded the shareholders should be taken away that the community as a whole may gain.  It would be impossible to go on discussing the subsequent stages of the Bill if this amendment is not accepted in some form.  The Minister has not relaxed. He knows what the result would be.  He is asking the Committee to pass this amendment, and he probably will get it passed.  The responsibility will not be ours.  The result of it will be legalised robbery, taking deliberately away from men by a deliberative assembly every right of any consequence they possess given under the Railways Act.  No amount of camouflage, or special pleading, or smart retorts, or bitterness, or playing with words will alter that fact, and the House knows that.</P>

      <P>The House should not lie under the impression that there is anything in the imputation of legalized robbery.  The Senator has not dealt with the point that if a man is dismissed because of decrease of traffic compensation should not be paid.  Not a word has been said about that.</P>

      <P>Economic causes <Col N="351" /> are not in the Senator's amendment. Is it right if a man is dismissed and his dismissal is due to economic causes and not to amalgamation that any compensation should be paid? The Senator referred to my remarks about railway users.  It is certain that the railway users will have to meet the Bill for whatever the Senator's amendment puts on the company.  With regard to the reference to the sixpenny ticket that a man may get for fivepence halfpenny, I have never stood for this, that someone could come and say: &ldquo;We are paying sixpence, and if no compensation were paid, we could have it for fivepence halfpenny.&rdquo;  If it is necessary to pay compensation to a man whose dismissal is due to amalgamation&mdash;and that is based on the 1924 Act&mdash;it is quite definitely preserved here.  The only things taken away are the items I have referred to, and not one of them has been argued against.</P>

      <P>If the Minister gets a majority in favour of his idea, it will be a barren victory.  A decrease in traffic as a result of amalgamation could easily be shown by the railway managers, and that would deprive the worker, who would, as a consequence of that decrease, be dismissed, of the right of compensation.  Amalgamation naturally causes a diversion of traffic, and consequently certain areas would show a decrease of traffic.  The people who will suffer from this alleged decrease in traffic will not be entitled to any compensation whatever.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister to allow this sub-section to stand over until the Report Stage, and to look into it with a view to meeting the objections from these benches.</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that the Master of the High Court&mdash;a very important appointment&mdash;must be a barrister of ten years standing&mdash;that he shall not only be a barrister of ten years' standing, but that he shall be a barrister practising at the time of his appointment. The Minister, in his speech on the Second Reading of this Bill in the other House, rather indicated that the recommendations of the Judicial Committee that was set up to inquire into the reorganisation of the courts, was being followed in this respect, but I do not think that is quite correct.  If my memory serves me right, the committee recommended that the person appointed to the position of Master of the High Court should be a barrister of at least ten years' standing, but I cannot imagine that they ever contemplated the appointment of a barrister who might have retired from the Bar for ten or twelve years previously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the report before me, but my recollection is that they would not recommend a person who had actually retired from the Bar.  The existing Master is only Master of the King's Bench.  He has nothing to do with the Court of Chancery, the Probate and Matrimonial Court, or the Bankruptcy Court.  The new Master will be the head official of all branches of the High Court.  He will be brought into daily and intimate touch with the new Rules of Court, procedure and practice, and upon him will devolve the task of advising and assisting every official on the staff.  For these reasons it will be obvious that it is absolutely essential the person appointed should be up-to-date in the procedure and practice of all the courts, and nobody but a barrister in practice could fulfil these requirements.  It is true that he will have administrative as well as judicial duties to perform, and while you could rely on a practising barrister to discharge both legal and administrative duties, you could hardly rely upon a barrister who may have retired for a number of years from active participation to discharge the legal and other duties that will devolve on the holder of the new appointment. As we know, numerous and drastic changes have taken place in the organisation of the courts in recent years, so that any person away from active participation and practice at the Bar must inevitably be out of touch with many things.  Again, we find that the qualifications for the Registrar to the Chief Justice are more stringent and exacting than those laid down for the Master, although the Master must be the superior officer, exercising as he does the functions of a Judge as well as those of an administrator.</P>
      <P>Section 23 lays it down: &ldquo;No person shall be appointed under this Act to be Registrar to the Chief Justice unless at the time of his appointment he either (a)  is a barrister of not less than ten years' standing, who is then actually practising.&rdquo;  The clause goes on to state the other qualifications.  Section 21 gives the qualifications:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No person shall be appointed under this Act to be Master of the High Court unless at the time of his appointment <Col N="358" /> he is a barrister of not less than ten years' standing who either is then actually practising or has previously practised for not less than ten years.</P>
    <P>I think it would be extremely unfortunate if this important post, now established for the first time, should be in any way hampered or injured by the appointment of an unsuitable person. In all probability it is a mere oversight that the qualification is so loose here whilst it is tightened up for an altogether inferior position.  Accordingly, I presume the Minister will have no difficulty in accepting the amendment.  The duties of the Master are of a judicial as well as of an administrative character.  The duties to be performed are extremely important. It seems to me unreasonable and impracticable to expect that anyone would be able to meet the requirements of the office successfully in view of the changes that have taken place, and in view of the new Rules of Court that will soon be before this House, unless he is a practising barrister and in intimate touch with all recent developments.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of this amendment, and on the Second Reading of the Bill I called attention to the nature of the office of the Master of the High Court.  It has been absolutely accurately described by Senator O'Farrell as an office largely judicial. Every day he is deciding points of law and of practice.  Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that the person who fills this office at the time of his appointment should be then a practising barrister.  The clause as it is drafted might lead to the most absurd results.  As the clause stands there is nothing to prevent a person who had been ten years in practice at the Bar, and who has left the Bar and gone into the tea trade, or gone away from the country, being appointed Master of the High Court.</P>

      <P>I would like to remind the Minister of what he said in the Dáil, referring to the Master of the High Court, on the Second Reading of the Bill on the 11th March:</P>
      <P>No officer, except this officer, could properly be put into a position where he might be called upon to censure any principal officer in the court or any particular officer amongst the courts staff.  Thirdly, we are following in this matter the recommendations of the Judiciary Committee's report, which Deputies will remember, was an unanimous report from men who, certainly, ought to be able to form a sound judgment upon matters of that kind.</P>
      <P>Might I say that I entirely agree with the Minister's estimate of the capacity of the Judiciary Committee to form an opinion on this point and, if the Minister was anxious to carry out the unanimous recommendations of the Committee, as he obviously was at the time, he could have no objection whatever to this amendment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an objection to the amendment.  The section as it stands states ten years' experience at the Bar, as an active practitioner, is a necessity and is a condition precedent <Col N="360" /> to appointment.  But the amendment as it stands precludes the possibility that a person having that experience and having that qualification who then passes on to an administrative sphere and acquires considerable administrative experience shall not be eligible. Let us consider this position of Master. Senator Brown says that the functions are largely judicial.  I would like to put as against that my view that the functions are largely administrative and, to a certain minor extent, judicial.  There may be a lot to be said for the point of view as I have heard it put here, that the man coming into this position should have the sawdust on him, that he should be fresh from the ring, and have a personal acquaintanceship with all the gladiators, and so on.  But, would there not be still more to be said for the point of view that, if a man had all that, plus considerable experience of the administrative side of the courts, he would be even more eligible and suitable for the position than the man with the sawdust on him?</P>
      <P>My objection to this amendment, frankly, is that it precludes a person&mdash; the person whom I would refer to as the most eligible for the position; that is, a man who had seen both sides&mdash;who had been a practising barrister for ten years and had that personal, intimate contact with members of the Bar which is desirable, and, in addition, considerable administrative experience and considerable knowledge of the offices of the Courts and the machinery of the Courts, as well as some experience in handling staffs.  Mark you, your barrister of ripe years is not perhaps the most suitable person you could get for a big administrative position in charge of a large staff.  He has, from the nature of his professional occupation, worked alone.  The Bar is a most highly competitive profession.  The barrister has to work on his own throughout his professional career. Sometimes one finds a man who has pursued that kind of work for a long period unwilling to delegate, and desiring to handle all the strings himself, to deal with everything personally.  The capacity for intelligent and discriminating delegation is one of the main factors in successful administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> Senator O'Farrell is thinking along the lines of a man who has retired from the Bar and the possibility of his being called back&mdash;a man who had given up active contact with the legal profession in any office being called back to fill this office of Master.  Candidly, I am not thinking along these lines, but I object to an amendment which would lay it down as a rigid rule that the only man to be called into this office would be a man who had ten years' experience at the Bar, and who had never left it, even to pass to another phase of legal work.  I am not talking or thinking in terms of the man who had severed his connection, but I am talking and thinking in terms of the man who had passed from the arena, to continue the metaphor, and who had gone simply to what is another facet, another phase, of what is essentially the same occupation.</P>
    <P>The report of the Judiciary Committee has been referred to.  That report sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the staff to be members of the Civil Service, and entitled to pensions and subject to retirement under its rules.

      <P>I am not prepared to accept that.  On page 25 of the Judiciary Committee's report I read the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All vacancies to be filled by promotion from the staff, due regard being had to seniority save in the following cases:&mdash;The Chief Official or Master of the Central Office as already recommended; the Principal Clerk entrusted with the taking of accounts in Chancery cases, and the Principal Clerk in charge of Probate and Matrimonial matters, who should, in both cases, be a practising barrister or qualified solicitor of not less than six years' standing; the official discharging the duties of the present Accountant-General, and the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy, who should, in both cases, be a duly qualified accountant, provided always&rdquo;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;provided always that any member of the staff who is possessed of the required qualification shall be eligible for appointment, and for this purpose a member of the staff of six years' standing who is also a barrister shall be deemed to be a practising barrister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>But apart from the Judiciary Committee's report, on the merits of the matter, I put it to Senators, lay and legal, whether a man who has both that experience of active practice in the profession, and considerable administrative experience in offices attached to the courts, is not the very man for the post.  I could get an administrative man who knows a great deal about court business and the machinery of the court system, and he would be open to the charge that he has not that intimate personal contact with the practising profession that would make him readily accessible to them in such difficulty as might arise and that a man in that position ought to have.</P>

He has ploughed a lonely furrow through life in the cut-and-thrust of his profession, but of administration and in the handling of staffs and the organising of offices he knows nothing.  And now I am objecting to an amendment which would rule out the man who would have both the qualifications of ten years' experience of active practice of the profession and the experience of the other sides of things&mdash;the administrative side, office organisation side and the handling of staffs.  I object to that.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to prescribe that, but I am not prepared to accept an amendment which compels me to take a man who is a practising barrister <i>et praeterea nihil</i> up to the date of the appointment.  If I can get a man who, in addition to having personal contact with the Bar, has also considerable administrative experience and knowledge of office administration, I say that is the man for this position. I am prepared to block the one evil the Senator pointed out of a tea merchant who is an ex-B.L., on Report Stage.  But I will not accept an amendment that precludes the appointment of a man who is a barrister of ten years' experience at the Bar and who then passes to the administrative side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that that is a reasonable and sound attitude to take up in this matter. We know exactly&mdash;it is my business to know&mdash;the nature of the duties that the holder of this office will have to perform, and I can see objection either to a man who was an administrator throughout his time or to a man <Col N="365" /> who was only a barrister and who had no further kind of experience.  It may be that in time we would be compelled to make a choice of a man who would have only one set of qualifications and perhaps trust to him to acquire the others, but I am not going to accept an amendment which precludes the appointment to this office of the man who has ten years' active experience at the Bar and then becomes a court officer and acquires considerable administrative experience in office organisation and in the handling of staffs.

He rather indicated his willingness to guard against any such occurrence by a subsequent amendment providing for the alternative of the person appointed being a practising barrister now practising and who may have held other positions that would qualify him.  I suggest the Committee should accept this amendment now and that on the Report Stage the alternative qualifications should be inserted.

      <P>I move amendment 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No person shall be appointed under this Act to be Probate Officer unless either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  at the time of his appointment he is a barrister of not less than ten years' standing who is then actually practising, or</P>
      <P>(b)  he was immediately before the commencement of this part of this Act Principal Probate Registrar or Assistant Probate Registrar of the High Court.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill stands at present there is no qualification laid down for this probate officer.  Yet a very large number of considerations which apply to the Master of the High Court apply to him.  It is true that he has no purely judicial function.  He acts as registrar to whatever judge is assigned to take the probate business of the High Court and he will have to carry out the administration of the principal registrar of what I might call the Probate Court.  In discharging both these duties and for their proper discharge it is absolutely necessary that he should be acquainted at the time of his appointment with the practice of what used to be the Probate Court and which was known until our late Act as the Probate Division.  Now, the Probate <Col N="368" /> Court, or rather the court which was the Probate Court, is part of the High Court and has a very peculiar practice of its own.  It has a practice which is embodied in quite a large volume&mdash;a text book of quite large size. It is a very technical and very difficult practice.  Nobody can properly discharge the duties of the probate officer unless at the date of his appointment he knows and understands the then existing probate practice.  The Judicial Committee made a report on this matter. It is contained in the paragraph which the Minister read and which you, sir, read, in which the Committee unanimously recommended that the Probate Court officer should be a practising barrister of six years' standing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">

I would be perfectly satisfied if the Minister would accept an alteration in it changing ten years to six years and to add the words to be found in the Judiciary Report, namely, if he is an official who has been six years previously at the Bar that his period of official service is to count and to be deemed to be practice at the Bar.</P>
      <P>I am not moving this amendment entirely on my own.  The suggestion came from the Incorporated Law Society, the body who represent the opinion of the solicitors of this country. They are strongly of opinion that this probate officer with whom their members come in constant contact should be either a practising barrister or a practising solicitor.  They told me they would prefer &ldquo;a practising solicitor&rdquo; left out, and accordingly I have only put in a practising barrister.  I am perfectly willing to put in &ldquo;practising solicitor&rdquo; as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seems to exclude the staff from promotion to the position of probate officer.  The only legitimate grounds for such an exclusion would be that the kind of man whom we would have as the higher class of court officer <Col N="369" /> would not be able to do this work. That is a contention which I am not prepared to accept.  Senator Brown has been quite frank with the Seanad. This is a trade union amendment.  It is an amendment aimed at excluding the ordinary Civil Service staff who work in these offices in the courts from promotion to this particular office.  I put it to Senators that the only justification for that would be if the view prevailed quite clearly and definitely that the kind of man whom we are going to secure as a higher class officer in the courts would not be capable of doing this work.  Only on that ground would it be proper to accept this amendment.  This Bill throws open to the staff through the ordinary process of promotion every office except two. These are the Master of the Central Criminal Court and the Taxing Master. The Master of the Central Criminal Court has been closed by Senator Brown's amendment.  I hope, however, to re-open it.  This amendment proposes adding to the number of doors that will be closed to the ordinary process of promotion from the staff and saying that the probate officer shall be a practising barrister or, as Senator Brown is now prepared to add, a practising solicitor.  I do not accept it, not for a moment, that the higher class of officer in the court staff at present or the officer that we would be likely to get in the future would not be capable of doing the work attached to the court.  The comment I make with regard to that is a comment made with a knowledge of the men and a knowledge of the type of work that is to be done in that court, and that comment is that there is nothing in the work which a man with a good university degree in law, and so on, could not take up, with his experience down there as court officer.  It is, I submit, unsound to suggest that no man but a practising barrister could do that kind of work. If that were true there is hardly a higher post in any Department of the Government, certainly very few in my Department, which should not be reserved for a practising barrister.  I put it to the Senator that he entirely underrates the capabilities of the higher class of civil servant.  I put it <Col N="370" /> to him that the higher class of civil servant can do things far more technical and difficult than superintending the issue of probates.  Men who are not even in the higher Civil Service every day in their lives do work as technical and as difficult in many Departments as the work of the probate officer.  I could quote the case of the officer dealing with death duties, income tax, and matters of that kind.  I am entirely opposed to this amendment. I think it would be very unjust to the court staff and very reactionary to fence off little positions here and there, and say that they are not to be open to the staffs of the court in the ordinary way, but that they are to be reserved for men practising in the legal profession.  I know men who are higher class court officials and I have a fair conception of the man who will be the higher class court officer in the future, and I say, with all due respect to Senator Brown, that that type of man is perfectly capable of doing that type of work and that it would be unjust to exclude him.</P>

The Minister has laid it down quite clearly that this is a purely technical <Col N="371" /> job.  The work, however, can be performed by a layman who is not a professional man.  The intention in the Bill is that this position shall be open for promotion within the Civil Service, and I feel in all the circumstances that I must support the Minister and vote against the amendment.</P>

He may be brought in from any department in the Civil Service, as I read the Bill as it stands at present.</P>

      <P>I have probably chosen an unfortunate example.  You simply have to put a certain amount of trust in the discretion of the Government which carries on the administration. We are not going to bring a man from the Department of Education and make him a Chief Clerk in Chancery or a Clerk in the Probate Office to do work of which he has no experience.  There is no intention of interfering with that in the future, or of making it otherwise than it is, a self-contained staff.  There may be exceptions. You may take an exceptionally good administrative officer from the courts and put him into a position in another department.  Conceivably that could happen, but you are not going to bring in a man from the Defence, Education, <Col N="372" /> or Local Government Departments, and put him at the work of the more difficult and technical offices in the court.  If it is desired to stop that, then, again, I will be reasonable and cater for and guard against fears and apprehensions which I look upon as rather absurd.</P>
      <P>I am not going to shut off from the staff work that I regard the staff is perfectly competent to perform.  I have not that poor opinion of the recruits we are going to get for the service of the State in any of its Departments.  I believe that in the future, as in the past, men will be produced by the ordinary process of administrative experience down there fully capable of performing the work both of the Probate Office and the Office of the Examiner&mdash; the position referred to in the other amendment.  Men who go into the staff of the courts very often have got a first-class honours LL.B. degree. They have knowledge of that work; they are getting their experience there, and it would be unfair to fence off the position from men of that type, whom we can get in plenty for the service of the State, and say, &ldquo;No, you cannot get it; you have not the hallmark, and you are not from the ring; you did not eat your dinners at King's Inns.  It is true you passed an examination very much more difficult than the Bar final examination, and that you had distinction in that university examination, but all that goes for nothing, because forsooth you are not a practising barrister or a solicitor.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>My objection is to the reference to a practising barrister, or a solicitor at all.  I feel that the staff are entitled now, at any rate, to what they never had in the past, and that is to have the avenues of promotion thrown open, and that every position which men are competent to fill, or can become competent to fill, by experience of administration, should be thrown open.  I do not deny that it is technical work.  So is income-tax and death-duties work, and a great many things in connection with the Departments of State are technical, but men are competent to perform them who have not any professional hallmark.</P>
      <P>I do not despair at all that the layman in the future will become competent to perform this kind of work. Why irritate the staff and create the feeling that the higher offices are not open to them, and that men will be brought in from an outside ring&mdash;from the Bar and the solicitors' profession&mdash; over their heads when there is no reason whatever for believing that members of the staff who are not professional men are not capable of doing the work?  I am prepared to accept the reservation saying that a certain number of years' service as a court officer shall be necessary.  I object to the mention of practising barrister or solicitor. I do not want the eyes of men at the Bar to be turned in the direction of the court staff, and I do not want the eyes of the men on the court staff turned with dread to men at the Bar with the feeling that they are to be brought in over them to the more lucrative positions.</P>

      <P>The Minister may think I am a little importunate about this, but I want to say that the Committee recommended that all promotions should go to the staff except in four cases out of the entire official staff, which numbers hundreds.  The recommendation was that otherwise the entire promotion should go to the <Col N="374" /> staff.  Posts included in the four or five excepted were these two I have mentioned.  All I am suggesting is, it ought not to be fair, I think, to rule out the possibility of appointing a qualified solicitor or a qualified barrister to these highly technical posts.  I think the thing would be fairly met in everybody's interests if what I suggest were adopted, that is to say, that the appointments should be open to a barrister or solicitor of not less than six years' standing, or a court officer of not less than six years' service.  That would not be ruling out a barrister or solicitor, and it would be unfortunate if it was found necessary to appoint a barrister or solicitor and it could not be done.</P>

      <P>This deals with the circuit court.  The Minister takes power to amalgamate a number of counties into a circuit area or to divide a county into two.

      <P>&ldquo;(3)  No county registrar shall be removed from his office without the concurrence of the Circuit Judge to whose Circuit Court he is attached.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senators will remember that I explained the reasons for this amendment when the Bill was up for Second Reading, and I need not repeat them now at any length.  In reality the county registrar is in exactly the same relation to the Circuit Judge as the Master of the High Court is to the Judges of the High Court, and the Minister in the Dáil admitted the logic of the position but he distinguished the two cases in this way.  He has agreed, and it is now in the Bill, that certain principal officers of the High Court cannot be dismissed without the concurrence of the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court.  He admits that that in logic ought to apply equally to the county registrar because he is really in the same position as the Master.  He, too, has judicial functions and his relation to the judge is the same as that of the other principal officers to the judges of the High Court.  But he says that a Circuit Judge is not always in touch with the county registrar, that he is only in physical touch with him for a certain number of weeks every year, some of them more and some of them less, and, therefore, he would not know enough about the county registrar to make his concurrence a necessary or proper condition of the dismissal of the county registrar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My answer is, he knows a great deal more about the county registrar than the Minister would know, and apart from that, although he is not in absolute physical touch with him he must be in constant communication, and surely the judge, who knows this officer so well, is at any rate in a much better position to form an opinion about the officer's dismissal than the Minister for Justice.  There is another grave objection to allowing an officer in this position to be dismissed by the Executive or the Minister.  He is, in fact, a judge. He performs or will perform most important judicial functions, and it is an <Col N="379" /> interference with the independence of the Bench that a person, occupying a real judicial position and exercising the real judicial functions, should be dismissed by the Executive.  It is contrary to the principle in our Constitution that our judges should be absolutely independent.  I, therefore, press very strongly on the Minister to let the logic which he admits in the case of the principal officers of the High Court also apply to the county registrar.</P>

      <P>The matter the Senator has mentioned, both on the Second Reading and to-day, of the comparison or contrast in the amount of contact between this county registrar and the judge on the one hand, and the Minister on the other, will be dealt with first.  There is no use in talking about the Minister personally and the number of hours he sees individual officials.  I do not have any personal contact with the passport officer in Cobh, but I am in constant administrative contact with that officer from one end of the year to the other.  In the same way I will be in constant administrative contact with those officials we are now considering, and there really is not any point or substance in urging that I do not see them in the flesh more often than the judge does because it does not turn on that.  The Minister's contact with officers is the administrative contact through the ordinary official channels of his Department and not so much the personal contact with which the Senator makes play.</P>
      <P>The independence of the judiciary is an impressive shibboleth.  Let us see we do not ride it to death.  One could set up other impressive shibboleths over against it.  One could talk about democracy and be very eloquent on that line.  I want to put it whether it is entirely wise to say whether an important public official down in the country on whom the public would be dependent for courtesy and satisfaction in the transaction of their business shall not be removable without the concurrence of a person who, for all practical purposes, is himself irremovable. Is that wise?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite, and in any case the Senator knows the High Court position was pretty well of a compromise to get out of an ugly and rather disedifying wrangle.  It was not my proposal that any officer in the High Court should be irremovable save with the concurrence of the judge.  It was something I accepted to guard against fears and apprehensions which I regarded as utterly groundless, but there are, at any rate, in the High Court officials in daily and hourly contact with the judges.  The county registrar is different.</P>
      <P>His judge is, perhaps, in his county for six weeks in the year, and he is away in other counties for the remainder of the year.  The judge is not in that constant contact that would enable him to form an opinion on the conduct or efficiency of the officer.  I put this point, too: that that public official performs work now, and will in the future perform work, with which the Judge has nothing whatever to do &mdash;the preparation of the jurors' lists and the matter of the franchise.  He will have tasks of one kind or another to perform for my Department and other Departments of the State.  Is the judge to pronounce upon the degree of satisfaction which he gives in the performance of these tasks?  I ask the Senator to think it over.  To some extent it is a paper point.  If the amendment is carried I will not lose any sleep about it, but I ask Senators whether this fetish, this shibboleth, of the independence of the judiciary, is not being overworked, and to say whether it is entirely wise that an important public official down the country, holding a very pivotal position, shall be placed to that extent out of popular control, that he shall be removable only with the concurrence of a person who is himself for all practical purposes irremovable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Circuit Judge may withhold consent. He may say: &ldquo;I know nothing whatever about that,&rdquo; and the official may in many respects continue to give the very reverse of satisfaction to the public and to the Department, but he cannot be removed because we are asked to provide that, and we are asked to <Col N="381" /> provide that because the independence of the judiciary might be infringed if we provided anything else.  The thing is not right, in my view; it is not sound.  The independence of the judiciary is being steadily overworked in the whole matter of this Bill.  I am told that this officer has judicial functions. He has to an almost negligible degree.  He has no original jurisdiction; he has no final jurisdiction.  Technically his functions are judicial, but it is just as true to say that to the extent of 99½ per cent. of the duties he is an automation.  The orders he makes are orders about which there can be no question.  He has no final jurisdiction. He is exercising delegated jurisdiction from the judge, and in every case there is an appeal from his orders to the judge; but he is also a big administrative officer performing, and he will be asked to perform, a great many tasks that the Clerk of the Peace was not asked to perform in the past.  He will be doing work for my Department and for the Department of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it is inadvisable to say that, regardless of the degree of satisfaction he gives or withholds in the performance of these tasks, regardless of the satisfaction or courtesy he gives or withholds to the public in his conduct, he shall not be removable, save with the concurrence of the Circuit Judge, who is under no obligation whatever to concur, and who is not himself amenable to the control of the public or their representatives.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of county registrar will be one of considerable importance and serious responsibility.  This Bill very carefully provides that candidates for this important position must possess certain professional qualifications and legal experience, but no provision whatever is made that these professional qualifications and legal experience will be backed by physical energy.  There is no age limit in this section, and I was <Col N="382" /> just wondering from the previous discussion whether some recommendations had not been made by the Judiciary Commission with regard to the age limit.  The Minister is responsible for the appointment of this officer and he carefully provides that he has legal knowledge, but he takes no thought, as I said before, whether he has physical energy to carry out the duties of this important office.  In the Dáil an amendment somewhat similar to this was moved.  The age limit was 50 years, and the Minister there said that it was possible he might not be able to get a candidate who could perform these duties sufficiently well under the age of 50.  There are thirty or forty solicitors in every county in Ireland, and I think it is a slur on those who are under 50 years of age to think that the Minister could not get a young man amongst them capable of performing these duties.</P>

We ought all to remember in connection with the office of registrar. that it is a pensionable office, and I think it would be a mistake in view of the insistent cry there is now for economy throughout the country, that the Minister should flout that cry, and appoint a man over 50 years of age. Possibly he may not, but he is leaving himself open to do it.  He is leaving himself open to the suspicion that he may do it, and I think that is flouting the demand for economy.  The amendment introduced in the Dáil was only defeated by two votes, the figures being <Col N="383" /> 27 and 29.  My amendment extends the age to 55.

My position in this matter is that it is unwise to attempt to tie the hands of the Executive Council in an appointment of this kind.

      <P>Senator Haughton should know that there is no such statutory office as Deputy Clerk of the Crown and Peace in the sense of a permanent separate appointment.  The position is simply this: that when the Clerk of the Crown and Peace goes away, or if he is ill, he generally gets his senior clerk to act in his absence. That is all that is meant by the Deputy Clerk of the Crown and Peace.  If the amendment were carried it would make all senior clerks who have from time to time acted in the absence of the Clerk of the Crown and Peace eligible for appointment as county registrars.

One of these summons-servers may go to a races or he may get drunk, and if these complaints have to go to the Minister and if he has to make investigation into the matter, the whole process of legal administration and justice might be brought into contempt.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe I have really rather a good case on this point. The proposal is to delete the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in the section, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;Circuit Judge.&rdquo;  The proposal is that the Minister should have nothing to do with, or be consulted as to, the appointment of summons-servers, or as to their remuneration. I think the first amendment is not precisely what was intended. We can take the two together. The Minister proposes to have quite a lot to say in these matters about appointments and remuneration and removal, and I do not see any good case against that.  I do not see any good case, for instance, for making the removal of the summons-server a matter <Col N="390" /> for the Circuit Judge.  It is an administrative act, and not in any way a judicial function.  I think we have a right conception when we say that the judges shall not in our judicial system of machinery of this State perform other than judicial functions, and that they shall have no executive or administrative responsibilities.  My second point is that the summons-server is not merely connected with the circuit court.  He deals also, or may deal, with the high court and the district court.  He is not so much an officer of any one of these courts as an officer under the Act when required in connection with all.</P>
      <P>My third objection is that the judicial control of this matter, as it existed in the past under the county court system, was not an outstanding success. A large percentage of the present men are too old, or too careless, or utterly unreliable.  I ask the Senator to consider whether it is wise to do what he suggests, to do away with all Ministerial control or responsibility in respect of these officers and put it on to the judges who, as I pointed out before in another connection, are no way responsible. He can do the obviously correct thing or leave it undone, just as he likes, and has not to answer to anyone for it.  Now you may say that in the case of misconduct on the part of one of those officers, surely it should be within the powers of the judge to censure him forthwith.  Why not give to the county registrar the power of suspension over court officers?  I think we will provide for that matter, for a case might arise that would require to be dealt with on the spot in a disciplinary way.</P>

      <P>My suggestion is that the power of suspension should be with the county registrar.  I would not bring the judge into it at all.  If he sees misconduct he tells the county registrar that the man's conduct deserves immediate suspension.  The Senator can take it that it is not simply looking for power in the matter.  It is considering what is administratively right, and he can take it that when any county registrar recommends dismissal <Col N="391" /> of a summons-server that he is going to go in the same way automatically, as, for instance, an officer in the Gárdaí would go if the Commissioner sent a strong recommendation to that effect to the Minister, who would bring it before the Executive Council.  It is simply providing the proper machinery.</P>

What will happen in fact will be that the present officers will be retained unless they are incapable, and so far as I know they are not incapable.  The only reason why an assignee is specially mentioned both here and in Section 56 is because of the nature of the duties he must have an existence separate from the registrar, and he must have a <Col N="392" /> statutory existence.

To insert before the word &ldquo;Save&rdquo; in line 11 the words &ldquo;Where any fines, amerciaments, penalties and forfeited recognisances have pursuant to an Act of Parliament, Ancient Charter or Patent been granted to, and for upwards of twenty years paid to the credit of any of the funds of any public body, corporation or council, they shall continue to be appropriated as heretofore; but.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to remove from the mind of the Minister or anybody here the idea that this proposal has emanated from me.  I received a letter from the Corporation of Limerick which reads as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The council have directed me to forward to you the enclosed copy of a resolution most rigorously protesting against the proposal in the Court Officers Bill now before the Dáil to divert to the National Exchequer the funds heretofore levied and paid over to the Corporation of Limerick. It is the opinion of the members that this Bill, if passed, will deprive the municipality of Limerick, the oldest in Ireland, of the fines that they have been receiving from time immemorial. It is a Bill that would seriously interfere with their rights and privileges. We shall be glad to see the matter followed up by you.&rdquo;  The resolution stated that the fines and penalties which have been levied in the city court at Limerick produce proceeds equal to a rate of one penny in the pound but that they leave the ratepayers liable for the maintenance and upkeep of the courthouse which was also erected at their expense, and without regard to the fact that a proportion of the fines and penalties are produced by the activities of the officers of the council in the enforcement of <Col N="394" /> the Public Health Acts and the Food and Drugs Acts and other statutes, and that they call upon their representatives to direct attention to the matter when that Bill comes before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Now, in order to make clear to the Seanad the way in which these ancient privileges of Limerick arose, I should first begin by saying that Limerick is a very ancient city, and I should ask the Seanad to let their minds go back to a period a thousand years ago when Ireland was groaning under the oppression of the Danes.  A Limerick man formed an army down in Limerick. He organised the country and inflicted a signal defeat on the Danes. He afterwards organised the whole country into a position to fight the Danes and finally defeated them and broke their power at the battle of Clontarf in 1014.  He was unfortunately killed at that battle, but his family carried on the Government in Limerick and by judicious administration they added greatly to the privileges of the city.</P>
    <P>When the Normans completed the conquest of England they extended their power to Ireland.  The King in power in Limerick at the time thought it desirable to make a treaty with them and accordingly met them with sufficient forces to command respect in the neighbourhood of Cashel and made a treaty with them which reserved the privileges which Limerick had obtained under the victorious Brian Boru.  That treaty was finally confirmed by a charter which was granted to Limerick by King Richard I.  (Richard Coeur-de-Lion), in 1197.  Under that charter Limerick elected, as its first Mayor, Adam Sarvant, in 1198.  I may say that London did not obtain the same rights until ten years later, Dublin till 110, and Cork 120 years later.  This charter was confirmed by King John in 1199.  Another charter was given by Queen Elizabeth which recited the provisions of the first charters.  King James I. of England and 6th of Scotland greatly enlarged these previous charters in 1609.  I will read the words of the charter.  By a curious coincidence there is in this very Section 49 one word &ldquo;amerciament&rdquo; which has been <Col N="395" /> transferred from this very charter of James I.  That charter recites that as &ldquo;the citizens of our city of Limerick have sustained not only intolerable wasting and spoiling of their goods, but, what is greater, the cruel shedding of their blood, we therefore in consideration thereof ordain, institute, declare and grant that our city of Limerick aforesaid be and remain for ever hereafter a free city&rdquo;; and it goes on amongst other things &ldquo;to grant by these presents to the aforesaid mayor, sheriffs and citizens and their successors the fines, redemptions, issues, amerciaments, forfeitures, perquisites and profits whatsoever happening, assessed, imposed or taxed or to be so, in the court to their own proper use and to the better support of this city.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does it not strike this House as somewhat peculiar that though Limerick has preserved its privileges down to the present day, that after all the vicissitudes it has gone through after the occupation by Cromwell and the violation of the Treaty in the time of William III., that these privileges have been continued and exist till now and that it should be reserved for an Irish Parliament, sitting here in Dublin, to revoke these privileges?  It is quite true, as you, sir, pointed out, the last day when this matter was before the Senate, that there is power under sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 49 in the Minister for Finance to direct that the whole or such specified portion as the case may be of these fines and penalties shall be paid into such fund as the Minister may direct.</P>
    <P>The people of Limerick rather object to be put into the position of Lazarus looking for &ldquo;the crumbs that fall from the rich man's table,&rdquo; and they do not want to be left to the tender mercies of the Minister to get what they had hitherto been entitled to receive.  This right, as I have shown you, by the resolution of the Corporation, amounts to the equivalent of 1d. in the £ in the rates and we have always been told that one of the essenials of proper taxation is that taxes should fall equally on the whole community.  It seems to us <Col N="396" /> that that essential is being violated by this Bill.  Why should Limerick be called upon to contribute a rate of 1d. in the £ while the rest of the country goes scot free?  We do not see why she should.  Personally I have a little experience of Ministers for Finance. I do not care whether he is the Minister for Finance here or elsewhere, but you are always met with the statement that the Treasury is empty with many calls upon it so that he cannot afford to be generous. We do not wish to be referred to the generosity of the Minister.  It is not generosity we want.  It is justice.  We want to have reserved to us unimpaired the rights which we have enjoyed for the last thousand years.</P>

      <P>We had better get the proportions of this thing to begin with.  I have a table here showing the amount of the fines collected and their apportionment.  I find that the total would be £22,000, of which £7,000 are imposed in the Dublin area and about £14,500 elsewhere.  Of that, £8,000 goes into the Fines and Fees Fund towards the upkeep of the District Court clerks; a sum of £3,250 goes towards the upkeep of the Gárda Síochána; a sum of £2,300 to the Revenue Commissioners; a sum of £4,500 for the Road Fund. Now, £3,000, and that is the item we are concerned with, goes to the local authorities, £400 to Cattle Diseases Fund, £250 to the Conservators of Fisheries, and £400 to the Gárda Síochána Reward Fund.</P>
      <P>Of the item of £3,000 to the local authorities, a sum of £1,200 goes to the Dublin Corporation, and £50 each to the Pembroke and Rathmines Urban Councils in aid of the impoverished ratepayers of those areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am passing on to Limerick.  The Senator must have a little patience.  That would be £1,300 in Dublin and district, leaving £1,700 to the local authorities outside Dublin. That is allocated approximately in these proportions:&mdash;Cork, £600, Limerick £350, Waterford £200, other places <Col N="397" /> £550, making a total of £1,700.  So far as I have been able to find out, each of the three cities mentioned gets all the fines inflicted in the city because of an Act, the Municipal Corporation Act of 1840, which has attained the age of 86 years.  I do not know what the principle underlying that Act was, but I am aware that the conditions in which the fines were then imposed were very different from the conditions which now exist.  The court was a local court, not part of a State-maintained system, as is the present position.  I do not regard that Act as having any particular sanctity which should make us slow to revise it after such a lapse of time and such a radical change of circumstances. I submit that the Senator should be prepared to consider this thing on its merits rather than invoke ancient charters and statutes granted and passed at a time when conditions regarding court maintenance and upkeep were entirley different.</P>
      <P>I stated in the Dáil quite clearly that we are prepared to investigate the merits of each case and make orders accordingly.  This apportionment of fines has become a veritable tangle. We ask the Oireachtas to cut clear away from the entire thing and leave it to the persons and bodies with a good case to show.  That gives a retaining power to the Minister for Finance and myself to make orders resurrecting any right of apportionment for which a case can be shown. The view underlying the Senator's amendment is that the merits do not matter.  It is the ancient charter or patents that matter.  I put it to him that it is not reasonable to regulate the affairs of what may be called the Limerick Police Court in the second decade of the twentieth century on the lines the advisers of James the First thought suitable for whatever court was in the City of Limerick in their time.  I could weary the Senator and his colleagues on this matter of fines.  I could show the tangle they led into.  Let me take out of the memorandum one instance.  There is a sum of £550 out of £1,700 divided among a number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Act passed seventy-two <Col N="398" /> years ago, the Towns Improvement Act of 1854, rather more than 100 towns had special rights to fines inflicted in those towns.  Such towns formerly enjoyed two local courts, namely, the ordinary Petty Sessions Court and the Towns Court, the latter constituted under the 1854 Act.  If an inhabitant were arrested in an advanced state of intoxication and disorder he might be brought before either of these courts. If he were brought before the Petty Sessions Court and fined 5/-, the town got 2/6.  If he were brought before the Town Court and fined 5/-, the town got the whole 5/-.  That was complicated enough, but under the Courts of Justice Act of 1924 the authority of both of those courts merged and vested in the District Court and then the position becomes a strange one.  The District Justice is now the Town Court. Solomon, in consultation with the Supreme Court here, could scarcely decide whether the town is entitled to the 5/- or to the 2/6, and these are the kind of tangles and problems that exist under the apportionment of those fines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>We must get to a clear, definite position.  We are letting a case be made for the revival of such rights as can show a case for revival. Surely it is the merits that matter. Does the Deputy think we are inserting this provision in the Bill to take £300 off the City of Limerick?  We are not, because this whole tangle of fines takes up the time of a staff in endless book-keeping, and very often it is the merest book-keeping, because very often the body which is to get the fine is another Department of State.  It is no lust for the £300 that inspires this, but it is to get clarity in administration and to prevent unnecessary calls on the staff in endeavouring to pick their way through what has become a veritable maze.  If there is a case made for the revival of an Order, or the apportionment to the City of Limerick, then the Order will be issued.  We are out for clear administration. <Col N="399" /> Really, any District Court Clerk ought to be able to say off by heart all the persons or bodies in the country who are entitled to any apportionment of fines.  I suggest also he ought to be able to say why.  But there is no one in the country who can give you a clear statement of the law in this matter. I did, under pressure in the Dáil, give a considerable amount of information. I never suggested to them, and would not, that it was exhaustive, because I warned them it would be impossible to give them exhaustive information as we had not got it.  I gave them so much that I succeeded in wearying them in the Dáil.  Really, I ask the Senators to agree that these apportionments, arrived at many hundreds of years ago in entirely different circumstances, cannot stand immutably because of reverence for their age.  If a case cannot be made to-day <i>hic et nunc</i> they ought to disappear.</P>

      <P>The Minister asked us to take the merits of the case.  There are merits, and the merits are the antiquity and the romance connected with this charter.  I am surprised to see the Minister, who has a certain amount of <Col N="400" /> romance and poetry about him, trying to persuade us that he is an accountant and that the idea of the Government was to turn the system into a cash register or totalisator.  Surely it would be better to get the good-will of the city of Limerick for this small concession of £300.  This city had a magnificent record when Dublin was kow-towing to Henry II.  It is the only city practically that justified its existence in its resistance to the Norman and the Dane.  The good-will of that city should be invited.  Limerick has a good deal to be grateful for, too.  It was selected on account of its physical advantages as the seat of the great power scheme.  The Minister cannot persuade the House that he is an accountant and that he has an opportunity of saving on this.  It is only a miserable sum.  I am not going to be drawn away from the question which, I take it from Senator Barrington's excellent address, is the antiquity and romance attaching to that Treaty, for the sake of £350.  I do not think the Minister would be wrong if, with a stroke of the pen, he allowed that ancient right to remain.</P>

I am a conservative in these matters.  Brian Boru gave this charter originally, and I will certainly vote that the city of Limerick should retain its right in this matter of 2/6 or whatever it is.  I think it should not be appropriated by the Minister for Justice and put into the Treasury.  I object to that altogether.  There was no difficulty about this for 1,000 years, but <Col N="401" /> now the matter is questioned.  It always went to somebody.</P>

It applies to all towns with ancient charters, if there are any, that are entitled to these fines.  I am only suggesting that we should make this amendment watertight.

The law enacted one thing long ago in an entirely different set of circumstances, and I suggest that public bodies now, when circumstances have changed, when there is a question of a new law, <Col N="402" /> ought simply to take up the attitude that &ldquo;the Law giveth and the Law taketh away,&rdquo; and if they like to add: &ldquo;Blessed be the name of the Law,&rdquo; it is not for me to object to it.  This charter business ought to be examined.  I wonder what proportion of the £300 comes under the Senator's blessed charter. I do ask Senators not to be carried away by Senator Dr. Gogarty's romance in this matter.  I ask them to form a mental picture of the administrative cost, involved by endeavouring to make out apportionments of fines, and try to see that the proper people are getting them.  I ask them to remember just how much of the time and the energy of officials, regarding whom we hear and see so many complaints, will be expended on this petty question of fine apportionments, and whether it is good business to pass the Senator's amendment.</P>
