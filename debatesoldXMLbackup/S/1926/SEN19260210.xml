    <P>Report presented from the Joint Committee on Standing Orders (Private Business), dated 2nd February, 1926, that no notice of appeal from the Report of the Examiner of Private Bills in the case of the Limerick Harbour Bill, 1926, had been received within the prescribed time, and that the said Limerick Harbour Bill, 1926, is accordingly deemed to have been read a first time in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Before the Seanad proceeds to take up the public business, I wish to mention that a vacancy has occurred in the numbers of our Sessional Deputy Chairmen.  For <Col N="348" /> each Session we appoint two members of the Seanad to form a panel to take the place of the Chairman or Vice-Chairman in the event of both being absent through any cause.  The vacancy has been occasioned by the fact that Senator Bennett is now Vice-Chairman and is no longer eligible to act as Deputy Chairman.  I ask Senator Toal if he could see his way to act.  Senator Toal would make an excellent Sessional Chairman.  If it is the wish of Senators to appoint Senator Toal they will please say &ldquo;Tá.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The next business is to elect a Senator in place of the Earl of Dunraven, who has resigned. In accordance with the Standing Orders, I have to inform the Seanad that two candidates have been nominated, namely, Samuel Lombard Brown, Esq., K.C., 63 Fitzwilliam Square.  His qualifications are stated to be:&mdash;A Barrister of 44 years standing; King's Counsel since 1899; a Bencher of the Honourable Society of the King's Inns since 1905.  He was also a Senator from December, 1923, to December, 1925.  The other candidate is Mr. Daniel Patrick Moran, of 43 Anglesea Road, Balls-bridge, Dublin.  His qualifications are stated to be:&mdash;Editor of &ldquo;The Leader,&rdquo; a journal which for the last 25 years has endeavoured to educate the Irish people to a higher conception of their national and civic responsibilities; a consistent supporter of the Irish language, and a pioneer of the Irish industrial movement.  The ballot papers will be distributed now.  We will allow an interval of ten minutes for the distribution and marking of the papers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know if the Minister for Defence could give us any idea as to when he is likely to be able to introduce a permanent Defence Forces Bill.  I approve, of course, the principle of an Annual Army Bill, but that does not mean that there should not be some Bill of a permanent character in operation governing the defence forces of the country. The Bill, of which this is merely a continuance, was passed without discussion of any kind in either House.  It was merely drafted, introduced and passed in a very hurried and excited time, and that is the Bill under which the army is controlled and maintained at the present time.  The Bill was passed in 1923, and sufficient time has now elapsed to enable the Government to introduce a Bill of a permanent character, or, at all events, to give the Oireachtas an opportunity of discussing the Bill under which the Defence Forces of the country are now being maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there is no military school at the present time in existence, and one wonders how the officers of the Army are being trained.  If we are to have an Army at all, I think it should be an efficient one, and the efficiency of the Army depends to a large extent on the efficiency of the officers. If there is no military school one finds it difficult to see how efficiency can come about except by accident.  There is one other matter I would like to have information upon.  I understand that recently instructions were issued to the effect that the Army officers, from the rank of Commandant upward, were to ride to the hunt in future, and <Col N="351" /> provide themselves with the necessary equipment, except the hunter, which is to be supplied by the Army.  I want to know whether that order has been issued with the Minister's authority, or merely on the authority of the Army Council.  Are these officers, who are not, I think, too highly paid, to get any additional allowance to enable them to follow the hunt and to keep up the style of the round of social engagements and conventions that inevitably follow?  That must involve a certain amount of hardship on officers who are married and who have families, and who feel at the same time that they must keep in the front rank so far as social convention is concerned. What is the object of this order?  Is it to improve the tone of the Army or to improve the horsemanship of the officers, or is it to raise the social position of the Army in the eyes of the community?  I do not think there is any other question that I want to raise, but I should like to have some information with regard to the points I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say a few words at any rate.  It appears to me that the Army is quite unnecessarily large and quite unnecessarily expensive. I think it should be reduced. There is no one to fight, and I think it is really useless.  I believe the proper thing would be to have a very small Army, a few regiments, about 5,000 men or so, and to train a large number of officers, and to have a large reserve force.  I will not go into details. I leave that for others.  With reference to what Senator O'Farrell said about the officers.  I am afraid you must have a reserve of officers, because if they are all obliged to go hunting there may be casualties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> Some of them may not be very young men or very sprightly, and they may find it difficult to ride across country. I think it a very good thing they should be able to ride, and if they are able to hunt so much the better.</P>

      <P>As regards the remarks of Senator O'Farrell, it is proposed, during the continuance of the measure which is now before the Seanad, to introduce a permanent Bill to the Oireachtas.  I hope that Bill will become law by the time that the present Bill will have expired.  As far as a military school is concerned, officers have been getting military education as far as practicable with the resources at our command.  At the present time arrangements are being made to send a delegation of officers to America for the purpose of seeing what can be got from the experience there in forming a proper military school in this country. That delegation will probably be sailing in the next couple of months. It will report back to the Army Council and the Government as to the best means of equipping a proper school for training our officers in the best possible manner.</P>
      <P>There has been no order either by the Minister or by the Army Council that makes it incumbent for any man in the Army to keep a hunter or to go hunting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>It is optional for any man to keep a hunter.  There are certain regulations whereby an officer can have a hunter fed and foraged by paying a certain amount of money, but there is no obligation on any officer, high or low, to keep a hunter or to go hunting.  Colonel Moore said we should not have an Army, and that it is too large, and is useless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator said it was large and useless, and that we had no one to fight at present.  I do not agree with that.  The Army is a necessity. Some people may think it is too <Col N="353" /> large and some may think it is too small, but I say that the Army up to the present has been the salvation of the country.  Whatever we may think about the National Army, we would not be sitting here to-day but for it, and that is a point Senators should take to heart.  The strength, equipment and control of the Army is a matter of serious consideration for the Government at all times.  If any retrenchments have to be made, they will be made with due regard to the security of the country.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that the medical profession will, I believe, welcome this Bill, not so much for what it contains as the possibilities it opens up.  I hope and trust that the Government may succeed in carrying on the negotiations, that they will secure what they require, and that, at the same time, the medical schools in Ireland shall not be in any way jeopardised.  It is well known that the General Medical Council have raised the standard of medical education in the United Kingdom, and Irishmen have very much contributed to that standard.  Within the last few years two Irishmen have introduced changes for the better, one in the branch of Public Health and another in midwifery.  These changes have been accepted by the General Medical Council, and they are now in operation for the benefit of the medical schools in the United Kingdom.  Seeing that Irishmen have largely contributed <Col N="354" /> to the high standard, it would be rather a pity now if anything should occur. This Bill, although it is simply prolonging the <i>status quo</i>, gives the Government the necessary time to make proper and sufficient arrangements.  I hope and trust it will pass here at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>I should like to know if the House could be informed as to what the position is with regard to the setting up of a new Medical Register. One hears rumours about negotiations going on, and I think it is due to the Oireachtas that it should know the position of the Government in the matter.  Does the Government stand by its originally expressed policy of setting up a Medical Register, or, on the contrary, has it departed from that, and if so, to what extent?  I do not ask for any statement that might prejudice the smooth course of any negotiations now going on.  In discussing this Bill the House is entitled to have some indication as to the position in respect of this question, and as to the extent to which the negotiations referred to by Senator Sir Edward Bigger have progressed.</P>

      <P>I should like to protest against what the President has said.  These negotiations are being constantly carried on in the dark without people being informed as to what is likely to happen as a result of them, or what they have been let in for. They are simply told the result, and are given an ultimatum.  I do not like that method, and I protest against it, although that is useless, as Ministers think themselves omnipotent and the cleverest people in the world, and that all they have to do is to make an arrangement and say that is the best possible.</P>

      <P>I hope that whatever happens in the conference between our Government and the General Medical Council, nothing will occur to jeopardise the happy fraternal feelings at present existing throughout these islands.  There is a very brotherly feeling amongst the members of the great medical profession.  Recently in England Irishmen competed for valuable medical appointments that in some cases were worth a four-figure sum, and they got the preference. Recently there were vacancies in the British Government service, and Corkmen got the appointments in every case.</P>

      <P>In answer to Senator Colonel Moore, I would like if persons like himself, who are suffering from nerves, would be more specific in making any charges they have got to make.  Mere wild statements on public platforms and elsewhere alarm nobody but nervous people like the gallant Senator.  With regard to this matter, a rather favourable condition of affairs exists in which people have come together with a view to finding a satisfactory solution.  A solution, no matter how satisfactory, will not please all parties and the Government has no intention of taking from people who are dissatisfied with it an opportunity of expounding their objections when the proposals are being put before the Oireachtas.  I can only say in conclusion that if the effect of these objections is no more dangerous than in the past I will be perfectly satisfied with the result.</P>

I take it from his replies to my couple of questions that he resents any question being asked and that the idea is to present us, as we have been presented in other cases in the past, with an accomplished fact, and then to ask: &ldquo;Why did you not put up an alternative?&rdquo; It seems to me that he resents an inquiry from any member of the House in respect of matters which concern the whole community.</P>

      <P>This matter stood over from the last sitting because there was an amendment suggested, I think, by Senator Jackson.  I think there were two amendments, one of which was accepted by the Minister and the other remained over to give him an opportunity of expressing his views on it.

      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  To delete all after the word &ldquo;carrying,&rdquo; in line 47, down to and including the word &ldquo;container&rdquo; in line 50, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;oil in bulk.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section as it stands seems to be limited to vessels capable of carrying 25 tons or more of oil at one time.  This Bill is for the purpose of preventing the pollution of waters and not to prevent oil being brought in.  It seems unnecessary to mention any quantity.  On <Col N="357" /> the last day that this Bill was under consideration I mentioned that as much damage could be done by a vessel containing 5 tons of oil as by a vessel containing 25 tons, and I cannot understand why the application of the section should be limited to a vessel carrying 25 tons.  If the amendment is inserted the sub-section will read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>This Act applies to any vessel which is capable of carrying oil in bulk and accordingly the word &ldquo;vessel&rdquo; shall in this Act (save where otherwise expressly stated) be construed as referring to and meaning only a vessel to which this Act applies.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Bill stands its application under Section 2 is confined to vessels which carry over 25 tons of oil in all or more than five tons in any one space or container.  The amendment will apply the section absolutely to all vessels and would differ materially from legislation in respect of this matter in other countries, notably in Great Britain.  Practically all the vessels transporting oil which come here have also to enter harbours in England.  The Ministry most affected here by this matter would be the Ministry of Fisheries, and they have accepted the Bill as it stands.  While it might appear that a considerable amount of damage could be done by the smaller vessels, it must be borne in mind that the fishing vessels themselves are of such dimensions as to carry lesser quantities of oil, and in consequence their activities would be very seriously interfered with if this amendment, were passed into law.  It is true that the letting loose of a small quantity of oil&mdash;I think six quarts would cover a square mile&mdash;is very damaging, but there are less dangers to be apprehended from fishing vessels in respect of any such loss than from other vessels.  It is a material economic consideration to the fishing vessels to be careful of the supply, and the Ministry of Fisheries does not apprehend any danger or ill-effects from leaving the section as it is drawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> In addition to that there is corresponding legislation in other countries. It would certainly be a hardship to vessels having business in harbours in Ireland and also in England to have a different set of laws appertaining in both countries on a matter of prime importance to both countries.  In the circumstances I am advised that the inclusion of this amendment would not materially strengthen the object in view and would prejudicially affect the industry which every possible effort should be made, not alone to keep in as sound condition as it is at present, but to improve as much as possible.</P>

      <P>I suppose there is no question that we might rely on the Minister for Fisheries to watch what is happening when this Bill passes and keep us informed, so that if Senator Jackson's point was right and if damage was done we would have some chance of hearing about it, because otherwise once this Bill is passed we would hear no more about it.  It might be no harm if the Seanad would ask the President to ask the Minister for Fisheries to watch the matter, and if it were shown that damage was done, the question would receive attention.</P>

      <P>I think the Senator's suggestion is a very good one. The demand for this legislation has come from many sources.  The primary source is the fishing industry.  There is the secondary source&mdash;the information which comes from the ports and docks and from seaside places and so on.  Then there are bodies which are interested in birds' plumage.  The birds' plumage is seriously affected by this peculiar film which spreads out in an almost limitless expense.  Experience has shown that the danger is apprehended from those large vessels to which a few gallons of oil is as nothing, whereas in the case of the smaller vassels, they are more alive to the damage done in this way and would necessarily restrict the damaging effect upon the fish.  I will bring before the notice of the Minister for Fisheries its effects upon fish, and if it be necessary to extend the operations of the Bill to the small vessels, I believe he would introduce the matter to the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the last sitting Senator Sir John Keane indulged in various criticisms of the administration of my Department, dealing particularly with the Public Bodies Order, 1925.  That criticism falls under four headings.  Under the first heading comes the criticism of Article 3 of that Order.  Senator Sir John Keane maintains that this particular Article means, in effect, the stultification of the Oireachtas, because it is an essential condition of putting this Order into effect that it should be laid for a certain length of time upon the Tables of the two Houses.  He contends that if I can change that Order afterwards, without tabling the amendment or the alteration, in the same way before the two Houses, it really renders the position of the Oireachtas very invidious. I think that the Senator overstated the case on that occasion.  It is true that there have been certain changes made, but I have no power to alter this Order according to my own sweet will by any means.  The Order is specific and definite and I have only a certain dispensing power.  In particular cases where it is found that the Order does <Col N="360" /> not suit the particular cases, this Article 3 gives me the power to dispense a particular local authority, if it so desires, from the Order.  That is, in so far as the Order might be unsuitable. But I have no power to vary the Order.  If I never issued an Order the local authority would have complete powers to carry on, and it is only a reversion to the former conditions if I do not press or insist on the Order being applied.</P>
      <P>Article 3 is very necessary.  When you have to deal with a great number of local authorities, it is very hard to devise a system of accounts that will be equally applicable and suitable to all; and occasionally difficulties arise which will make it necessary to have the power of dispensing on particular occasions.  This Article is not a new departure by any means.  There was a similar Article in every Accounts Order issued since the Local Government Board came into being, and it has, in fact, been taken, word for word, from the Public Bodies Order, 1904.  Cases arise continually that I cannot anticipate, and these cases make it necessary to have this power.  For example, if a local authority had not for any reason struck a rate before the 1st March, that local authority could not strike a rate at all for that year, if I had not that dispensing power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy to see the difficult position the local authority would be placed in if this power were not given, and for that reason I think it is reasonable to ask the Seanad to allow this old-established article to continue, and it is more necessary in the present time when the whole machinery of Local Government is changed.  The second criticism is of more importance; that is the criticism of Form 52.  That arises in this way: There was an amendment moved here when the Local Government Bill was going through the Seanad, and I do not think that Senator Sir John Keane is in a position to throw any stones at this particular matter, because if he is not actually the <i>causant</i> he is the <i>causa sine qua non</i> in the matter, because he seconded the amendment which brought about all the trouble.  The amendment was considered by my officials and myself, <Col N="361" /> and we amended it in some particulars, and in its present state it was finally carried here in the Seanad.  But in our anxiety to oblige the Senator we overlooked the great trouble that this was going to give to the various local authorities responsible for striking rates in the country.  It undoubtedly throws a great deal more applotting work on the various local authorities. It makes it necessary to show on each demand note the actual amount in each particular case that is being demanded in respect of road services.</P>
    <P>At the time we overlooked the fact that it was going to give us so much trouble.  The law stands that way at present, and I have no power to alter it.  Even if Senator Moore was anxious to give me power to break through the Act of Parliament I do not think I could very well do it.  In giving effect to that particular amendment we issued an Order which went slightly further, by showing not merely the cost of road maintenance in a particular case, but also the cost in respect of various other essential services.  This was really unnecessary. It derives its sanction from the Order, whereas the others derive their sanction from the Act itself. Accordingly, by availing of Article 3, which the Senator criticised, I have been able to relieve local authorities of important additional work connected with the working of the different services. The actual amount for the roads must stand until I have an opportunity of bringing in an amending Bill to the Local Government Act.  Probably all parties will be in favour of that amendment when I bring it forward.  I will not have time to do so before the present rate is struck.</P>
    <P>The Senator also criticised the method of accounting for road expenditure, and in particular for materials, prescribed by Article 58.  I thought that Article would be particularly acceptable to the Senator because it went a long way towards carrying out views he has frequently expressed in the Seanad.  The Article goes into detail considerably more than is usual in such accounts.  I think it gives the Senator practically everything he desired. It is necessary to show in that <Col N="362" /> form of account the amount expended on each particular road.  The rates are segregated and against each particular road is set out the cost of material, of machinery, and of labour.  It is not a fact that in each particular case the cost of the machinery or the material is averaged for the whole county.  If, say, a road or a section of a road called No. 1. is under consideration against that is set out the cost of machinery employed on it.  If you have a steam-roller working on that road for 50 hours at a cost of, say, 10/- an hour, which would be, approximately, the cost of a steam-roller, then you set against that £25.  In the same way, if you take material from different sources the cost of material, from each particular source is put down.  For example, you may take material from two quarries. The material from quarry &ldquo;A &rdquo; may be purchased at 10/- a ton, and material from quarry &ldquo;B&rdquo; at £1 a ton. In each case you have to set out the number of tons of material taken from the particular quarry, or otherwise the account would not be in order.  It is very difficult to explain clearly a technical matter of this kind without actually being able to demonstrate with figures.  I think if Senator Keane looks carefully into the matter he will see that is the fact.</P>
    <P>The Senator brings forward a constructive proposal of his own, but as in the other case, I do not think he has given it very careful consideration. His solution of the difficulty is, that we should allow 25 counties to continue as they are, without issuing any Public Bodies Order.  The Senator must realise that the Public Bodies Order that was in force before this Order came into effect, was devised to meet a totally different set of circumstances, and for Local Government machinery which included the rural district councils.  It would be impossible to administer the present Local Government system with the old Local Bodies Order.  Not only does this replace the previous Local Bodies Order; it also replaces the Procedure of Councils Order which deals with procedure in connection with public works.  If the Senator peruses the Procedure of Councils Order he will <Col N="363" /> see that it would be absolutely impossible to fit it in with the new arrangement. The present Order is working very satisfactorily in the country.  It is not perfect.  It is a very difficult thing to devise at short notice an Order dealing with the whole work of local government, and to make sure that it will in all respects be watertight. On the whole, the Order is working with very great satisfaction.</P>
    <P>I am not at all opposed to helpful criticism, but, at the same time I think very little good can come out of vague, general criticisms of this kind.  If we are to arrive at any useful solution this is a matter that we must go into in considerable detail.  If the Senator brings forward a pamphlet or brochure showing his solution of the various problems that confront us in this matter I will be prepared to give it careful consideration.  At the present time this Order is the best we can devise and it has fulfilled its purpose extremely well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamMolloy" hpid="Mr. MOLLOY Mr. MOLLOY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOLLOY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there was an amendment put forward to Article 52 to set out the amount of the rates and that it would be placed on the back of the demand note.  I understand the added cost of doing that in the different counties will be from £100 to £300, and also, that the particulars which will be on the back of the demand note will be supplied to each Civic Guard station.  That will entail another demand from the taxpayer. With regard to Article 57, the Senator brought forward what I considered a constructive proposal about the roads.  Anyone who travels through the West of Ireland now would imagine there was no such thing at all as roads.  The countryside is a swamp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the present system of road-making will be a success or come to any pitch of perfection unless there is a road fund, or some other fund, to be drawn on besides the present method of taxing the people for road maintenance. The ordinary person in the country with a horse and car claims that the road is good enough for him. What he wants to know is, why he is to pay 3d., 4d. or 6d. in the £ to keep <Col N="364" /> roads in perfect condition for motor lorries weighing 3, 4, or 6 tons, and that compel him to keep towards the dyke?  I think the Minister or the Government will have to take the steps that were taken by the Northern Government, and tax lorries so that they will pay for the damage that they do to the roads.  It is hardly fair to taxpayers who own horses and cars that they should have to pay for the upkeep of roads for 8-ton lorries.  I would ask the Minister to look into the matter and try and devise some constructive method, besides taxing the ratepayers, for keeping the roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think for a moment that the Minister would consent to annul this Order, but, as I said when proposing the motion, it is the only constitutional method one has of criticising the Order as a whole.  In spite of the Minister's explanation, it still seems anomalous that the Minister may limit his power of variation.  He has absolute power to depart from the Order as he wishes.  The Minister for Finance, through his Exchequer, has absolute power to print notes.  He may not do it, of course, but it is a dangerous possibility for the Minister to be able to alter this Order, which has received the sanction of Parliament in a definite form.  Article 52 was revised before its final introduction into the Bill.  It was reviewed by the Parliamentary draftsman.  It was never my intention in seconding it that it should take the form it did.  What object is there in knowing the particulars of each demand note?  What the ratepayer wants to know, and what he is told certainly in London, and, I think, in other places, is the ingredients of the total amount demanded. Say, the total rate struck in an area is £100,000, how much is spent on the roads, debt charges, and so on?  There is one calculation for the one area, and it is printed once on the back of every demand note.  I do not see how by legal subtleties this extra work is involved, which the Minister admits is involved.  This is a technical matter. I am prepared to have it tested by a qualified accountant that the forms and instructions, as drawn, will not give <Col N="365" /> accurate information as to the cost or expense of machinery.  It is simply the total amount which will be divided up and there will be an account shown. In order to get the necessary information for the road the county surveyor will have to devise separate accounts altogether from those official accounts. That would involve extra labour, whereas the special account could have been embodied in the Order.  I do not know whether the Minister is quite clear in regard to my constructive suggestion.  I am satisfied that this present Order, which is going to remain, should be allowed to run.  That will not affect the suggestion that one county should be taken outside it and that a real live system, proved by actual experiment, should be allowed to develop in that county.  Let it run and the only way you will be able to devise a practical method will be by trial and error.  It will take time, but however expert people who sit in a room may be, they cannot devise a system which will work properly.  You can by actual experiment build up a system.  You can try something the first year; by experience you can amend it, and gradually after three years' experience you will evolve a workable and efficient system of accounting control.  Having brought that and satisfied yourself that it is working properly, you can make that the subject of a new substituted Accounts Order.  I do not see how that fails to be a constructive suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter, and that is one important respect in which the control of the Central Authority failed. In all accounts of great detail, such as the appointment of nurses and substitutes, we are continually met by the veto, of the Local Government Department when the sum involved may only be £1 or £2.  Yet in the all-important respect of under-estimating, appearently local authorities are allowed to do what they like.  Anyone who reads the paper can see the grave difficulties into which many of these county councils have got with their banks. That has been the result of a policy of under-estimating expenditure and over-estimating the grants-in-aid likely to be received for the last three years. <Col N="366" /> It was specially stressed last year when the councils were going out of office, and they have landed their successors in a large deficit which in the case of one county I know would be 4/- in the £ in addition to the extra cost for the debts of the past.  As far as I can see, there is no regulation or method by which the local authority can ensure that a sufficient rate is struck.  The rate is first struck by the local authority, and not until after it is struck does the Department of Local Government know what the amount is. I think if they are to control in such detail they should control that very important point and ensure that local authorities be liable for the current year for all the charges arising in that year, and that they should not be allowed to pile up deficits which are creating a serious position throughout the country.  Having made my protest, I shall now ask the leave of the House to withdraw the motion.</P>
