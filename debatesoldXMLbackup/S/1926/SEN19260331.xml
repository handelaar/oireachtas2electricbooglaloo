      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in the opinion of the Seanad the system of Irish Local Government and of Irish Local Finance is unsuited to the practical needs and resources of the Free State ratepayers generally; and that steps should be taken by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to ensure that expensive works of permanent utility should be financed by means of Local Loans, with appropriate periods of repayment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to express my appreciation to Senators for giving me this opportunity of discussing the question of local administration.  I am aware that many Senators have attended at personal inconvenience to themselves, and I appreciate their action very much indeed.  Their only reward will be, I suppose, that they will know they have assisted in ventilating a very important question.  I hope that will be sufficient reward for their assistance.  I make no apology, really, for inviting a discussion on local administration. Some three weeks ago I gave notice of this motion in response to a general invitation from the Cathaoirleach.  We have discussed some details of it in the meantime, though I did not take part, but I followed the discussion, and I was rather interested to gather from the remarks of Senators that, on the whole, their minds seemed to be proceeding very much in the same direction as my own.  I am not going into details generally, in respect to local administration, but, on the whole, I foresee a measure of general agreement, from questions raised by Senators, as to the lines on which an improvement of local administration might proceed.  To prevent any misunderstanding I would like at the outset of my remarks to <Col N="702" /> make this statement.  I have had very long experience of local administration in this country.  I have had considerable experience of local administration in England.  I worked for many years with the Irish Local Government Board.  Sometimes I opposed it on questions of public policy, but most times I was in complete harmony and collaboration with it.</P>
    <P>As a result of my experience of local government I have a very great respect for that Department.  I consider the Department compares exceedingly well with any similar government department in any other country.  I have a very great admiration for the intelligent and public-spirited way in which our Local Government Department attends to the duties it has to discharge. If I make any slip in the course of my remarks I hope it will not be taken that I intended in any way to reflect on the Irish Local Government Department.  As I say, it is a most efficient Department, perhaps the most capable that this or any other country possesses.  I worked too long with it to wish in any way to carp, criticise, or make any unfair remarks as to the administration or the capacity, generally, of that Department.  In any remarks that I may make to-day, or in the future, when discussing this question I hope it will be understood that I do so in a spirit of friendliness to the Department.  Having mentioned the Local Government Department there is another matter to which I would like to draw the attention of the Seanad and the public, generally.  In a sense, I think our Local Government Department is the most important Department of administration we have. No Department affects the public more generally than that concerned with local administration, and none touches our daily lives at so many points. There is no Department that comes home more constantly, that is, I may say, more ubiquitous, to the ratepayer or taxpayer as that concerned with questions of local administration.  Perhaps, in a sense, it may be described as the most important Department we possess.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of the duties which the Local Government <Col N="703" /> Department has to transact I think it is only fitting that the head of that Department should be, <i>ex-officio</i>, a member of the Executive Council.  That is my view.  Of course, I make no complaint about the present arrangement. The present arrangement, as far as the composition of the Government is concerned is transitory, more or less, but I hope when this country settles down to transact business in a normal way, that the Minister for Local Government will be, <i>ex-officio</i>, a member of the Executive Council.  I throw out that suggestion for the consideration of the public generally.  May I say that in the short time we have been managing our own affairs, in spite of all the difficulties, the question of local administration has not been neglected.  Last year, or the year before, we passed a very comprehensive amending Act, as far as local government is concerned.  As far as it went, and speaking generally, I think that Act was drawn up on right lines.  No doubt, the advantages of that Act will become more apparent in the near future.  In my opinion we are only at the beginning of our reform, or adaptation of a system of local government.  The amending Act that I referred to will probably be followed by other Acts as there are many ways in which local administration can be improved, notably in the direction of making it more adapted to the circumstances of this country.  I am not complaining of the action or inaction of the Government in this matter.  As I say, they have already introduced and passed an Act which is useful so far as it relates to local administration.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that our local administration will have to be further adapted to the circumstances of the country.  I would like, with the permission of the Seanad, to lay down certain lines according to which, in my humble judgment, the adaptation of our local administration might usefully proceed.  It will be understood that in any remarks I make I am simply making suggestions for the purposes of discussion.  It does not follow that because I make a statement I consider that statement to be a good one, but I believe it to be true and the best and <Col N="704" /> the most suitable to deal with the situation for the time being, at all events.  It does not follow that I am infallible, and the Seanad will understand that in making these suggestions I am simply laying down a basis for discussion.  I do so in a friendly way towards all our existing institutions, such as they are.  If it be found that my proposals are not suitable, of course, they will not be agreed to, and I shall not be in the least bit disappointed. I think we have come to recognise in this country that there is no use in a man getting up in a public assembly merely to carp and criticise. I think everybody who chooses to take the public into confidence in relation to our public affairs, should deal with all issues in a practical, common-sense way. He has a right, of course, to express his opinion, but he should not indulge in the very easy task of criticising simply in a destructive fashion.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal with this question, firstly, from the executive, and secondly, from the financial point of view, and I shall make certain suggestions for the public consideration.  We all know that our system of local administration is based upon the English model.  There was no other active model in operation 30 years ago when we reformed our local administration. In the same way as many years before, when we established our Poor Law system, there was no other model or exemplar by which to go except the English one.  The English system of local administration is suited to the needs and the circumstances of England.  It is an easy thing for England, with her teeming population and her gigantic wealth, to indulge in an expensive system of local administration.  My experience of local administration in this country&mdash;I spent a great many years at it in every shape, from Co. Councils to Harbour Boards&mdash;is that we could have quite as efficient a system of local administration in this country, much less expensively if it were not modelled as our present system is, on the English plan.  At the same time, I am not a destroyer, and I would prefer, without scrapping anything, to utilise the machinery and structure we have.  I say at the outset that our local administration is too expensive for the capacity <Col N="705" /> of the country.  It is founded upon the English model.  The English can afford an expensive system, but I do not think we can.  The taxpayers&mdash;and by taxpayers we mean ratepayers as well, because it is the same people who pay all the taxes&mdash;are carrying a burden which is beyond their capacity. There is no doubt about that.  In fact, the whole country, in my opinion, is keeping up an establishment which is too expensive for its income.  I think that we could simplify and centralise our local administration very advantageously. I think we could enlist in the practical operation of local adminstration, expert management.  No business nowadays can be conducted without expert management, and it is no argument to tell me that we cannot find experts in this country in local administration as in everything else if we choose to look for them.</P>
    <P>Thirty years ago when local administration was amended this country was given a multiplicity of councils, and one of the reasons for the multiplication of these councils was that their operation would be instructive.  Well, we have 30 years experience of that administration, and I do not think really that we have anything more to learn. I do not think the people of this country in any case are inept at local administration. I know that in other countries where Irishmen manage local administration they manage it with considerable success, and I do not think that in this country we really need&mdash;in fact it has been shown that we do not need&mdash;the multiplicity of councils we have under the old system.  I think the time has come for us now not so much to make speeches and attend to procedure or to deal in legal technicalities and matters of that kind.  The time has come for us to administer and administer capably.  That is the problem before the country, and it is with a view to a solution of that problem I intend to make certain suggestions.  In the first place, we need administration adapted to the country's capacity to pay.  I have stressed the point that in our local administration we ought to enlist the services of specialists in many directions.  I reaffirm my belief in the abundance of capacity in the country, and my conviction that if that capacity <Col N="706" /> is to succeed it must specialise.  I will ask the Seanad for a moment to consider the wide range of local administration, and the services that we have to administer.</P>
    <P>First we have relief of the poor. Then we have housing, we have our hospitals, we have our roads; we discussed our roads for two days last week.  We have sanitation.  We have, as part of our local administration, the very important question of marine works.  We have forestry, as we were reminded yesterday by one of the Senators, and we have many other things besides.  I simply note these various matters to emphasise the wide range of the scope of local administration, and to enforce the view I hold, that for proper local administration of so many subjects, specialised administration is necessary.  I read you just now a long list of subjects, and I could read you many more.  The Seanad will realise that the administration in all these matters is not a question for either officials or amateurs.  We were governed in the old days by officials. Now some people tell us that we are governed by amateurs.  I do not believe that myself, but others may disagree with me.</P>
    <P>Local administration is not a proper field for officials, no matter how good they may be, for officials are hidebound, and the amateur in local administration is simply hopeless.  That is my experience.  I throw this out now as a basis for discussion.  If it is not found to be a good scheme let us have another scheme.  Let us put forward practical proposals in the discussion of public questions in this country.  I would suggest that we should appoint a Local Government Advisory Commission. I would not have a large Commission. I would have a Commission, say, of four.  I would have as a member of that Commission a representative of Irish Labour; I would have a representative of the Irish medical profession; I would have a representative of Irish engineering, and, finally, I would have a representative who would be expert in business finance.  I would call all these people experts.  I suggest a Commission of four, but that is a matter for discussion.  I would start with this <Col N="707" /> Commission of four.  I would entrust to this Commission the devising of a common policy of local administration. There are various directions in which we spend the ratepayers' money year after year.  These matters are not coordinated. It seems to me that very often the ratepayers' money is not spent to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>I would entrust to this Commission the duty of devising a common policy for local development in all its different branches.  I am not just now going to say anything about the roads. I would give this Commission power to see that this continuous policy is carried out.  Of course, this policy would be spread over many years, and in all probability none of us would be alive to see the completion of it.  What I would like to have in this country is a continuous policy, not a happy-go-lucky policy of sporadic administration but a continuous policy devised by the best minds on matters relating to Irish local administration.</P>
    <P>I would give our existing county councils advisory powers as to the finances of the general policy.  I am sure there would be no necessity to urge upon them to exercise their powers.  But I would see that they did exercise their powers, and exercised them fully, and on all proposals, all estimates, all schemes for public improvement, I would give the county council advisory powers.  In the event of their disagreeing with the Local Government Commission, I would give them the right of appeal. I would give them the right of appeal to an accessible tribunal here in Dublin, which would be appointed, half by the Local Government Board, and half by the General Council of Irish County Councils.  I think that a tribunal of that sort would see that there was fair play between the Local Government Commission and the county councils in general.</P>
    <P>How would you find your Commissioners? There is no lack of capacity in this country.  It is only a question of finding the men.  They are there. It does not always follow that the gentleman who talks the loudest, or whose name you see most in the newspapers, <Col N="708" /> is the most capable person.  But you can find the capable persons.  You can find them through the Civil Service Commission or through their Selection Board.  I think you have a Selection Board that could lay its fingers tomorrow or next day on capable men to fill all these four different appointments.  There was a time when I thought that the politician was a very splendid person, when I used to be a politician myself.  There is always, in connection with popular or public appointments, the difficulty, particularly in local government bodies, of making appointments from some political aspect or another.</P>
    <P>There is always the possibility of political influence being brought to bear on appointments.  I would eliminate that altogether.  I would leave the selection to the Civil Service Selection Board, and therefore there would be no politics in it.  I would have no advertence to a man's politics in connection with local administration. Local administration is not so much to make speeches or support one side more than another, but to administer. Now I come to the sheet anchor in my scheme, as far as the ratepayer is concerned.  Before appointing the Local Government Commission, I would fix, in every locality throughout the Free State, the maximum standard rate beyond which local taxation in no instance could ever possibly go.  Of course, if, under the administration of the Commission and the assistance of the County Councils, you could reduce the rates, so much the better.</P>
    <P>I think the fixing of a figure beyond which the rates could not be raised would be an essential part of the programme, and it would be to the advantage of the ratepayer.  It may be that the standard rates would not be reached in many cases.  But if you could co-ordinate your local administration, you could give them some central direction, you could have a common policy on which the administration of the country would proceed and you would be able in due time to effect economies in many directions.  We know how much overlapping there is, and how much money is wasted and spent in utterly unreproductive directions. <Col N="709" /> If we are to have a central administration and a centralised policy, we can get economics in many directions. I cannot conclude this speech without saying something about voluntary help.</P>
    <P>I think that in local as in other branches of administration local help is of the utmost value.  My opinion is that in local matters every important local establishment, whether an hospital, industrial school, or whatever it may be, should have a voluntary visiting committee which would inquire into the condition of these institutions, look after the people in them, provide them with newspapers and magazines, and generally assist in the improvement of these institutions in their various spheres.  One great advantage of volunteer help in these matters is that you foster and preserve a healthy interest in local matters.  The best way of discovering how improvements can be made and carried on is by voluntary investigation.  May I remind the Seanad that I notice an extraordinary increase in the interest taken in the Oireachtas in local matters.  When we first started operating we used to have, occasionally, questions.  I went to some pains to look up this matter in the records of the Seanad and the Dáil, and I found that for one question asked a year or two ago on local matters there are now fifteen.  That shows how much interest the public are taking in local administration, and it also shows how an efficient voluntary local association can assist our services. These associations, of course, would have free access to the Local Government Commission, and if they had any views to express regarding local matters they would be considered.</P>
    <P>So much as to the administrative side of the question, and now I turn to the financial side.  That side in a sense is all-important.  There is no use telling me that the financial condition of this country is satisfactory.  It is not. Neither is there any use in telling me that the financial position of our local authorities is satisfactory, because it is not.  I have good reason for knowing what I am talking about, and it is really time that the public should begin to give this question of national housekeeping <Col N="710" /> their very serious attention. There is no short cut to prosperity. Some people tell the Minister for Finance that if he does this, that, or the other thing, the country is going to bloom like a garden, and that all our troubles are going to end if you put a tax on some things.  That will not happen.  There is no short cut to prosperity. All these developments and evolutions in a useful and sensible direction are a question of time.  What is of importance is that people should have a definite idea, and consider how best and most efficiently to carry it out.  That is my strong view as regards administration.  Now, the taxpayer and the ratepayer, who is the same person in this country, is over-burdened, and the consequent financial position of the local authorities is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I would like the Seanad to look at this matter from an angle at which it has not been hitherto approached, although you, Leas - Chathaoirleach. went very near it yesterday, and I thought you had stolen my thunder. What is the population of this country? We do not know exactly, but we shall know when the census returns are available, and I hope we will not have as long to wait for them as we had for the results of the Seanad elections. However, we can make a guess that the population of the Free State must be in or about 3,000,000.  We are not the whole, but only the three-quarters of Ireland.  Of that 3,000,000 the people who pay the taxes are the heads of families, the breadwinners, roughly speaking.  The children and the very old people do not pay taxes.  The main burden of the taxation falls on the heads of the families.  How many of such are there in the Free State?  It would be a very liberal computation to assume that there are 1,000,000.  The Free State with that 1,000,000 heads of families is now paying at least £30,000,000 sterling a year.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for the coming year in this State may disclose something between £25,000,000 and £26,000,000 with rebates.  Local taxation in the old days, when I was associated with it, used to be about £4,000,000 a year. Therefore, if I allow £5,000,000 a year for our local taxation, and I think with <Col N="711" /> that figure I am under the mark, then your one million heads of families are paying £30,000,000 a year.  The head of a family in this country cannot afford to pay £30 a year in taxation. That being so, we must come to our Minister for Finance and ask him to relieve us, but the poor man cannot.  He has got his Estimates, his liabilities, certain outgoings to meet, and he has to find money for all these things.  He cannot give us relief right away; he can only do it by degrees.  I do not hesitate to say that you can reduce what I must call your excessive taxation, both national and local.  It is the same persons who pay the taxation, local and national.  There are two directions in which you might improve matters.  There are certain branches of expenditure which I would place in the category of permanent expenditure. I think the public money in this country, as far as possible, should be spent under the aspect of an investment. There are many things which are now developed and promoted by annual contributions from the central or the local rates that might, advantageously, be left to the liquidation of posterity.</P>
    <P>There is no more important question before the country or before the city of Dublin than the question of housing. For the last three years I will not say unfortunately, but certainly against my will, I have to a certain extent become a citizen of Dublin.  I do not want to compare the streets of Dublin with any other capital.  You would find just as bad streets in New York, Paris, Sheffield or Liverpool, but I do say that your back streets in Dublin are a disgrace to civilisation.  I say that the slum quarters in all great cities are a disgrace to civilisation.  This country is now beginning its career with a clean slate, and it has a magnificent future before it.  Therefore, I see no reason why the people of this country should not tackle seriously and gravely this question of housing, not merely in our cities, where it is a burning issue, but also in the rural districts.  I am glad to say that the Local Government Department has already taken steps in this direction.  I think in view of the circumstances of the country and the <Col N="712" /> times we have passed through, that our Local Government Department has behaved magnificently.  It will be news, I think, to many, that within the last two years, with the assistance of our Local Government Department, ten thousand houses have been built in the Free State.  That, I think, is a magnificent record.  About half that number was built in urban areas, and the other half in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The time has come, I think, when the present policy in regard to housing cannot be further pursued, because the country cannot afford it.  The question, I think, must be dealt with in another way.  In this country you have some excellently managed local councils. Some of these bodies have the power to issue local municipal stock.  I think more of them should get that power, and that such stock should be given the status of a trustee investment. In that way, I think you would get, within limits, a very large sum of money.  There would be the additional advantage of securing Irish capital for a perfectly sound Irish investment. That is one of the things I would urge. As I say, I would make the stock of first-class councils, and there are quite a number of them, a trustee investment. That is a way, I think, in which the housing problem might be tackled.  For general operations carried on by local administrative bodies, such, for instance, as road-making up to a certain point, marine works, sanitation and water supply schemes, etc., I would issue local stock.  The carrying out of works which had met with the sanction of the Minister for Local Government and were certified as being useful, I would finance by means of a local development stock, the stock to be repayable in a period of years.</P>
    <P>In connection with this I would have a sinking fund.  I would not issue all my stocks at once.  I would issue, say, stock to the value of one, two or three millions, or whatever the amount might be that was required to start some undertaking with.  I would make each issue of local stock autonomous in this respect, that it would end itself automatically at a certain time.  That would enable you to take advantage by and by of the fall in the price of <Col N="713" /> money.  The price of money at the present time is very high, but it is not always going to remain high.  In five, ten, or twenty years' time it will be much less than what it is now.  I would start my local loans stock on the understanding that a certain proportion would be repayable, say, in sixty-five years, at the current price of money to-day.  When the next stock was issued the money might be much cheaper.  It would run for the same period of years, but would be redeemable at a correspondingly cheaper price.  These, of course, are all details. Once the principle is admitted, I venture to submit that some reorganisation of our local system of administration on those lines would be beneficial. We are beginning in this country to-day with practically a clean slate, and we want to make it a happy country. We want to give everyone a chance of living decent lives, and, as far as we can help it, happy lives.</P>
    <P>The Local Government Department can exercise an important influence as regards the future development of the country.  It is time, I think, that we took the matter in hands.  I would like to point out, of course, that none of the reforms I have referred to can be expected to bear immediate fruit, but the sooner you arrange your machinery to carry out your permanent policy the sooner will the future administration of this country be placed on a permanently satisfactory basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this motion of Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde.  The first part of his resolution deals with the question of local administration generally in the country.  I think any person who has had experience of local administration will agree that some change is necessary from the type of administration of local affairs that we have had in the past.  Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde suggested that a Commission should be appointed to inquire into the best methods on which the local administration of the country should be carried out.  I am not so sure that the appointment <Col N="714" /> of a Commission on these lines would prove a success, because of the difficulty you would have in finding expert people to put on this particular Commission. It is my experience that if you are to give representation to the different interests concerned, you will find it almost impossible to get the expert people you want for such a Commission. I think there is a case to be made for very careful consideration of the whole system of local administration in this country.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde, of course, has wide experience of local and national administration.  I have a little experience of the administration of local affairs, and from my experience I say some change is necessary in our system. I do not altogether agree with the views of Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde on the question of expert administration by the Local Government Department, because I have met a number of experts who had very little common-sense. I think that the views of men of the world, battling in the world, doing business on most questions of the day, and dealing with local administration, are of equal value to those of the experts on local administration.  I leave that portion of the motion at that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second portion of the resolution, Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde dealt with the whole question of finance.  But before coming to that particular aspect, I would like to say this: I agree on the question of administration in so far as possible that a central authority ought to be established to deal with the problems of roads and housing.  These are two services that, I believe, could be better managed through a central authority than by local authorities.  I believe, in regard to these two particular services, it would be of immense value to have a national authority set up to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of finance I think I said yesterday, and, indeed, I said it repeatedly here, that I am always very nervous of attempting to say anything upon this very important matter.  I have not had too much experience of finance; my difficulty being rather that I could never get hold of sufficient finance.  But on this question of finance and the question of local <Col N="715" /> loans for the purpose of carrying out work of a permanent nature, I think there are two sides.  I have a limited experience of this question of finance. To satisfy myself, I endeavoured to get at the root of the question with regard to advancing loans for housing purposes. I found that the Corporation of Dublin, at various periods had been granted loans, for the purpose of erecting houses, and, at the time the loans were paid, for every £ that had been spent on building houses, £3 had been spent in paying interest to the moneylenders. I think that is a state of affairs that calls for very careful consideration. Of course, the money was borrowed for a long period, and the people who lent the money got the market value for it, but the people who paid the money back did not get sufficient value.  So on the question of local loans, particularly for housing, I think it is hardly fair, that for every £ to be applied for erecting of houses to get over the appalling state of affairs referred to by Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde, people should have to pay £3 interest.</P>
    <P>On that particular question I may say this: If there is one social question that affects me more than another, it is this question of housing.  I think I know Dublin, and I know its slums, as well as most people.  I was born in a tenement slum; I know the evils of it, and I think that people who talk of the slum system and the evils of slum life, have no conception of what it means.  I could shock every member of this House or any other assembly I ever faced, if I attempted to describe the condition in which our unfortunate people are compelled to drag out a miserable existence; but one must have some sense of decency in discussing this question.  But I say this: From what I have read and seen, of other great cities across the water, there is a lack of public spirit among the moneyed classes in this country.  I am speaking generally.  In other cities I have visited I have seen that the leading manufacturers or business people or wealthy inhabitants of these particular places have spent huge sums of money on the erection of proper dwellings <Col N="716" /> for the working people to live in. I say, and I regret to have to say, that there is a lack of public spirit among the larged industrialists or moneyed people of this country in respect to coming to the aid of their poorer fellow-beings.  I say that because of this fact that I believe our housing problem will never be settled by borrowing money to do it, and unless some good agent comes to our assistance, in respect of advancing money, and charges half the rate of interest at present current, or some such thing as that occurs, we will have to wait a long time for the solution of our housing problem.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde is to be congratulated on bringing this motion forward.  It is a question affecting the life of the country and it is, as he says, all-important.  We can build up our nation in any way we desire and I think there is a genuine desire among all classes of the community, no matter how much they may differ in detail, that we should build a State worthy of the people who live in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir EDWARD BIGGER</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde on his able review of local administration.  He has covered a very wide field&mdash;a field that is, perhaps, too wide for an afternoon's discussion.  I should much prefer that he had confined himself to one branch of the motion, and I should have thought the best branch would have been that to which Senator Farren has just alluded&mdash;the housing question.  We have a great many schemes in operation such as tuberculosis schemes, child welfare schemes, hospital schemes, schemes for the medical inspection of school children and the attendance on the sick poor.  Those are all very admirable, but the most outstanding question, from a public health point of view, is the question of housing.  I hope the Seanad will pass a resolution to the effect that we should have a housing council.  The housing conditions are appalling in Dublin. They are appalling in some of the other towns as well.  I visited a number of towns, including Waterford, Cork and Limerick, and the conditions there are <Col N="717" /> appalling.  I suggest that we should concentrate on the housing question at first, and try to bring about a real and radical change.  If we could do that, we would be doing a very great service to this country.</P>

      <P>The introducer of this motion has covered a good deal of ground, some of which is directly relevant to the exact terms of the motion and a great deal of which is indirectly relevant.  The thing which interested me most in Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde's speech was his statement that he would issue £3,000,000 of local loans immediately.  Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde is the Irish Chairman of one of the largest banks in this country&mdash;the bank which has the largest number of local branches.  It is of very considerable interest to have from an authority such as he undoubtedly must be, the assurance that £3,000,000 could be issued as local loans.  If he had only assured us as to what the rate of interest on these local loans would be, everything would have been covered.  Personally, I have always advocated borrowing for the purpose of large constructive works in this country.  But I do not believe that that borrowing can be by way of local loans, if you are going to get the best possible terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am strongly in favour of housing and other works being undertaken by a central authority by means of borrowing. I believe, as I have said here before, that the State can afford to borrow for a definite constructive programme. It cannot afford to borrow for anything else.  I am not sure that it can afford not to borrow for a constructive programme.  I do not think the Seanad should pass this resolution without grave consideration, because it declares that it is by means of local loans that these large constructive schemes can best be undertaken.  I would not set myself against Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde, with his large banking experience, if it is his considered judgment that it is by this means that money can be had on the best terms.  But my opinion is that it is by having State backing that you will get the money at the lowest possible rate.  I believe that the credit of the State is pretty good and that money <Col N="718" /> for a State loan could be obtained at a reasonably low rate.  But I have very grave doubts if a loan running to millions could be obtained by local borrowings.</P>
    <P>I do not want to follow Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde through the whole of his speech.  A great deal of what he said I agree with.  Some of it is, to say the least, arguable, but I think he has done a useful service in bringing forward the question of the importance of these constructive works and the necessity for having them carried out. But our general sympathy with the subject should not allow us to pass this resolution, as representing our considered judgment.  There is one debatable question dealt with in that resolution to which I have referred&mdash;local loans.  Secondly, I should say that it is far too drastic to declare that we are satisfied that the system of Irish local government and Irish local finance are unsuited to the practical needs and resources of the Free State ratepayers.  To say that they could be improved would be all right, but to make such a strong statement as is contained in the resolution is, I think, unwise.  For that reason, I hope the resolution will be either modified or that it will be rejected.</P>

      <P>With the bulk, if not all, of Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde's statement I am in agreement. He started by suggesting that the Minister for Local Government should have a place in the Cabinet, instead of being an extern Minister. With that I think everybody who realises the enormous amount of money handled by the Local Government Department, as compared with other Departments having representatives in the Cabinet, will agree.  A certain newspaper tells us perpetually the amount spent by a certain Department. We know the figure by heart&mdash;£46,000. That is nothing to what is spent by the Local Government Department.  I think Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde did well in drawing attention to the fact that the Minister for Local Government is outside the Cabinet proper. With regard to a Commission.  I suppose the old Local Government Board left such an ugly odour behind it that the <Col N="719" /> new Minister was not inclined to set up a body like that again.  But I think the time will come when a commission, or at all events an advisory board, will have to be set up by the Minister. There is one point on which Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde and myself will not agree&mdash;the composition of that commission or advisory board.  He omits what is to me a very important element that should have representation on an advisory board.  The affairs of the women and children of Ireland which are handled by the Local Government Department are so immense that at the Poor Law Commission at present sitting a tremendous amount of evidence has been given in favour of the formation of a Children's Ministry, or at all events, that a corner of the Local Government Department should be devoted to the care of children who are supported by the State. I think that neither an engineer nor a financier could fill that post, and I would suggest to Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde that a woman is the most suitable person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator has interested me very much by his references to voluntary help.  Listening to the evidence given before the Poor Law Commission, one was struck tremendously by the subconscious demand for that.  There are in some of the properly organised countries a system known as the Elber-felt system&mdash;a system that began in Germany and spread to many other places.  I hope that before long such a system will be adopted here.  It consists of the State having power to appoint or nominate certain persons to look after the poor who are destitute. In Germany they give the relief to the poor people.  These visitors, or almoners, have charge only of from four to six families.  They deal with these families all the time.  The relief given by the State passes through the hands of the almoner to the people. The almoners take the place, in a way, of our old relieving officers, or, as they are now, home assistance officers.  If we got such a system working in cooperation with the home assistance officers, we would be doing a great deal both for the people who pay and for <Col N="720" /> the people who are destitute.  The almoners take a personal interest in these families until they have them on their feet.  The home assistance officers cannot do that.  If there is any discussion later, I hope that this system will not be forgotten but that some means will be found of extending its benefits to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Sir Thomas said that we are starting with a clean slate.  I do not think we are, but rather that we are starting with a bad heritage.  Until we can get rid of that heritage, I do not think we can do wonderful things.  Anglicisation has killed the spirit of our people. The poor law system has demoralised us and it will take many years of patient progress to get the people back to what they were before that system was put into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>It was proposed by the mover of this resolution to appoint a Commission, the personnel of which was outlined.  I do not know exactly whether it is the Senator's intention to give the Commission executive powers, but the attitude of a Government generally to losing its control over a body of that sort would be antagonistic.  That would be properly so unless they were very sure of the personnel of the Commission, and that it consisted of men seized of their subject and of the staunchest integrity, because, by giving them those powers, you practically pass over a function of Government to them. Shorn of executive power, the recommendations of such a Commission would probably meet with opposition by the particular Departments affected. Innovations will no doubt be suggested. You cannot deal with a large problem like that without dealing with it radically, and the whole army of officials whose work will be dislocated by those suggestions and on whom additional work will be thrown will range themselves against the acceptance of those recommendations.  Ministers are largely influenced by their permanent officials, who know more about the working of their Department than any Minister can be expected to know unless he is a Minister with many years' experience in one Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal point I wish to refer to <Col N="721" /> is the method of facilitating public bodies, by Government loans, to undertake matters that call for immediate attention. I refer to projects and schemes that are held, more or less, in abeyance for the want of definite facilities. It is not the function of a bank to grant long-term loans to public bodies and to tie its money up for long periods.  No matter how banks may be placed in that respect I, having some banking experience, know that it does not come within the function of a bank to lend out its money and tie it up for long periods.  Public bodies will expect, besides, a low rate of interest.  In many of the projects on foot throughout the Saorstát and in contemplation, short period loans are no use.  Most of those projected are in a sense unremunerative. Some of them are in the immediate future unremunerative, and only become remunerative in time.  In other things, like sewage and drainage schemes, you get no immediate result until fifteen or twenty years.</P>
    <P>A scheme like an afforestation scheme would not yield any tangible revenue for twenty years.  But if you want to improve, you cannot wait for years until the money comes from some unexpected source or until the country gets prosperous.  Then where are you going to get the money from?  Public bodies can get money by the issue of stock. They issue local stock, with the sanction of the Local Government Department, within the borrowing powers of the particular body.  Again, you have special local Acts of Parliament giving enabling powers to public bodies to borrow in a particular way, and then you have another method set down in certain existing Acts like the Public Health Act and others.  The Local Government Department will give sanction, to a certain extent, under those Acts.  The Public Works Department comes in in other matters like drainage and sewerage.  All those sources are dried up for the present. Most of your public bodies are at the end of their borrowing powers, and if they float stock locally, people are not in a position financially to contribute. The loan may be a failure, and you certainly require to offer an attractive rate of interest to induce private people <Col N="722" /> to put their money into stock of that sort.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the remedy.  The Government could take the matter in hand and float a loan.  It would have to be lent out again from the Central Fund to those public bodies.  The Government may be in a position to float a loan redeemable at a certain time, say within twenty or thirty years, and in that way facilitate the public bodies.  The Government will be in a position to get the advantage of a lower rate of interest than the local bodies, if they floated a loan on their own security. The State security is a better one and would command a lower rate of interest.  Again, some of the public bodies are driven to the end of their borrowing powers.  The housing need is very rife.</P>
    <P>I think it would be advisable if facilities in the way of loans were given from the national standpoint, irrespective of localities.  The Government dealing with, say, a housing scheme would simply expend the money in places where it was most needed, entirely irrespective of the good name or the financial standing of any particular municipality, urban or rural district. I believe that great advantage would be derived if there were instituted a national control of housing and other schemes.  Senator Farren has made the statement which he believes he is in a position to prove, that for every pound spent on building operations, fully three pounds are paid in interest.  I do not know if the Senator confines that to housing schemes.  All I can say is that that matter can only be accounted for by very bad finance.  In regard to all these schemes a sinking fund is arranged and the principal and interest are redeemed at a certain period.  There may be private people who advance money at usurious interest for certain specific purposes. Cases like that would account for the interest being excessively high, but I do not think I ever heard of such an unfortunate result as that in any public undertaking.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde's proposals, he makes reference to certain conditions which, I think, rather affect his proposal.  He <Col N="723" /> suggests a maximum rate of local taxation beyond which local authorities cannot go.  One cannot tell what may happen.  Accidents may occur; a whole water supply scheme may break down; an electric lighting project may, through some catastrophe, collapse. One can never tell what is ahead.  If one could see a number of years ahead one could make arrangements accordingly. On the whole I do not think any Commission or any public body would be likely to agree to recommendations with a proviso of that sort. The main weakness in this proposal is, I think, that it aims simply at setting up a Commission.  That would be over the head of the Local Government Department. I think it has been stressed by several Senators that there would be a difficulty in making adequate investigation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Seanad is indebted to Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde for having put forward this motion.  The scope of it is so comprehensive that, necessarily, he was obliged to deal with it in a sketchy way.  He did not wish to dogmatise; he rather preferred to provoke a discussion with a view to seeing what might usefully be done in this matter. While I cannot vote for the motion, I do suggest that a Private Member's Bill might be prepared on lines outlined by the Senator.  Then we would be in a position to deal in a more concrete fashion with the matter; such a Bill might be amended and, possibly, it might be adopted by the Local Government Department.  I quite agree with the Senator in many of the matters he has referred to.  When the Local Government Act of 1898 was passed it was based on the English model.  Since then various enactments have been put into operation, all of which, as was mentioned when the recent Local Government Act was under discussion, tended to add to the emoluments of officials, and to add to their pension allowances.  When new appointments are being made these matters.  I think, should be very closely scrutinised with a view to effecting economies.  While <Col N="724" /> yesterday I opposed what I called the stunt for economies, I think that economies can be effected.</P>
      <P>I agree, thoroughly, with the suggestion for expert administration in local government.  I think the elected representatives on many public bodies might be fewer in number.  I believe they would be very much more effective by reason of being fewer.  From my experience of a City Commissioner in Cork, and from my experience of a Commissioner's administration in the rural areas, I have formed that conclusion. Though I speak with less knowledge in regard to Dublin, I think the result of the administration in Dublin by Commissioners is to be commended. I do not, of course, advocate Commissioners purely and simply as officials of the Local Government Department. I am as great an enemy of bureaucracy as anyone.  On the other hand, I know that there are urban councils, a number of county councils, and a number of boards of health, on which there are a great many men who sought election, and who are undesirable; very many of them are inefficient. If more suitable men were elected to those boards it would be a great step in the direction of proper administration. I believe that fewer men would be more effective; with a smaller range of choice you would get better men. These men, acting in an advisory capacity and with local knowledge, would add greatly to efficiency in administration. I know that in America city managers have done useful work.  On the harbour authorities in America are experts who have an advisory board to guide them, but the main power and authority rest with the expert administrators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such matters as housing, roads, afforestation, drainage, etc., have been referred to.  I agree that such matters cannot be adequately dealt with by local authorities.  They should be national undertakings.  As Senator Sir Edward Bigger has said, housing is too important a matter to be dealt with as a detail even in any local government scheme.  The improvement of housing conditions, if properly dealt with in this country, would necessarily run to a great deal of money.  I think the <Col N="725" /> problem should be faced and the money should be secured by loan, or even by extra taxation if need be.  It will cost money, but the expenditure will not be unproductive. You will save in the amount of money that is now being spent on tuberculosis schemes, on hospitals and workhouses, and on various other remedial measures of that type.  If you house the people properly they will be healthy, and remedial measures of the type I have referred to will not be necessary. Afforestation and drainage schemes, if properly directed, would be immediately remunerative.  I think that those schemes that I have referred to in connection with roads, afforestation, and drainage should not be included in a local government scheme.  Until Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde puts his proposal in a more concrete form in regard to local loans, I would not feel qualified to discuss it in detail.  I seriously suggest to him that he should put into a Bill the rather rough outline which he has sketched here, with a view to having it discussed more closely than it is possible to discuss it at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'HANLON Mr. O'HANLON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde has raised an interesting matter for discussion but I am not in agreement with the main portion of his proposal and I beg leave to comment on one section of it.  Senator Mrs. Wyse Power has already commented on the suggestion to set up a commission and I suppose it would be expected that the representatives of agriculture should have something to say on that matter.  Senator Esmonde dealt with the ills and shortcomings of the local government system and expressed the view that a remedy might, perhaps, be found <Col N="726" /> through the establishment of such a commission.  In dealing with the personnel of such commission, he said that there should be representatives on it of Labour, of the medical profession, of business men, and of the engineering profession.  I submit that the people who contribute the main portion of the rates are farmers, and I think it is only in keeping with modern democratic principles and tendencies that people who contribute the main portion of the rates should have adequate representation on such a commission.  Senator Esmonde was once a strong protagonist of agricultural interests and a champion of the farmers' cause, and I would be surprised if anything weaned him from that allegiance.  I think the Seanad should not recommend an increase in the borrowing powers of local bodies.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Douglas that it may be necessary, and sound economically, to have State borrowing, and out of the funds thus provided to undertake big, national reproductive work. I do not think that it is sound economy to increase the borrowing powers of local bodies.  There is a lot to be said for the old saying, &ldquo;Pay as you go.&rdquo; I think it would be sound policy for our local bodies to do that rather than indulge in squandermania.  I think it is sound economy to inculcate in the minds of local bodies the principle of paying as they go, rather than to concede to them further borrowing powers. I cannot agree with the motion and must vote against it.</P>
      <P>Motion put, and, on a show of hands, declared lost.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.35 p.m. until April 21st.</P>
