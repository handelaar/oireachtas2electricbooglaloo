    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Title be postponed and that Sections 1, 2, and 3 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>(1)  The parent of every child to whom this Act applies shall, unless there is a reasonable excuse for not so doing, cause the child to attend a national or other suitable school on every day on which such school is open for secular instruction and for such time on every such day as shall be prescribed or sanctioned by the Minister in respect of such day.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any of the following shall be <Col N="3" /> a reasonable excuse for failure to comply with this section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that the child has been prevented from attending school by the sickness of the child;</P>
    <P>(b)  that the child is receiving suitable elementary education in some manner other than by attending a national or other suitable school;</P>
    <P>(c)  that there is not a national or other suitable school accessible to the child which the child can attend and to which the parent of the child does not object on religious grounds to send the child;</P>
    <P>(d)  that the child has been prevented from attending school by some other sufficient cause.</P>
    <P>(3)  Until the year 1936 the following shall also be a reasonable excuse for failure to comply with this section on not more than ten days during the period beginning on the 17th day of March and ending on the 15th day of May next following in any year in respect of a child who has attained the age of twelve years, that is to say, that the child has been prevented from attending school by reason of his having been engaged in light agricultural work for his parent on his parent's land.</P>
    <P>(4)  Until the year 1936 the following shall also be a reasonable excuse for failure to comply with this section on not more than ten days during the period beginning on the 1st day of August and ending on the 15th day of October next following in any year in respect of a child who has attained the age of twelve years, that is to say, that the child has been prevented from attending school by reason of his having been engaged in light agricultural work for his parent on his parent's land.</P>
    <P>(5)  A school shall be deemed to be accessible to a child for the purposes of this section if, but only if, either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the school is situate, in the case of a child who has not attained the age of ten years, within two miles measured from the child's residence along the shortest way lawfully and conveniently available for him or, in the case <Col N="4" /> of a child who has attained the age of ten years within three miles similarly measured; or</P>
    <P>(b)  there is a suitable means of conveyance to the school available for the child from a point within a reasonable distance from the child's residence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In Section 4, sub-section (2), to add at the end of the sub-section the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e)  that the child is receiving instruction or training in the practical work of the business, trade or occupation of his parent or by which he intends to earn his livelihood.</P>
      <P>This is my own addition to the reasons I have given for having a child absent himself from school.  I think the most important part of the education of any child is instruction or training in the practical work of the business, trade or occupation by which he intends to earn his livelihood when he is attending school.  Unless the child commences to do some work at an earlier age than 14 or 16 years I fear he will get a distaste for the work, and that it will be very difficult for him to settle down to proper work in his occupation. When a child commences at an early age to learn how to do some light work it generally happens that he takes an interest in it, and that the work is a pleasure instead of being a task.  It is all very well to endeavour to have children get ideas that they are aspiring to a higher grade than that in which they are born.  I think it is more desirable that they should realise the actual fact that in order to gain a livelihood in this life the principal thing is that they should be trained in work in the same sphere as that of their parents.  As the Bill stands there is a condition that a child should be prevented from attending school by some sufficient cause.  I do not know whether the training of the children would be regarded by the District Justice who hears the case as a sufficient reason.  I think it is an important reason because there is some work, especially on a farm, that cannot be done efficiently unless the child is trained at a fairly early age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenjaminHaughton" hpid="Mr. HAUGHTON Mr. HAUGHTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HAUGHTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I must oppose this amendment.  I think it is accurate to say that one of the most important subjects that could possibly engage the attention of this House is the subject of education.  I think that in the interests of all classes of the community the education of the child ren, whether they be the children of noble lords, or the children of agricultural labourers, should claim the anxious attention of the Legislature, not only in this country, but in all countries in the world.  The amendment of Senator Linehan seems to me to contain the idea that farmers' children might be hired out to work for other people, and in these most important years of life in which education is so paramount and so vastly important for their upbringing and future in life, or that they might be engaged working as agricultural labourers instead of availing of the few paltry hours at their disposal for education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently in Cork City there was a very important annual conference of those engaged in primary and secondary education, in which a vast amount of interest was generated.  Those of us who had the privilege of attending some of the meetings, and also of reading what took place, could not but be greatly inspired at the keen interest taken by educationists throughout Ireland in putting high ideals before the youth of our country: of trying to have them brought up on a par, at any rate, with the children of some of the great nations of the world.  The competition before this country, and Great Britain, and other nations, in the days to come, as we all know, will be keen, and if the agricultural people are not fully qualified and equipped for the battle of life, they will go under and remain as mere agricultural labourers to the end of their days.  I know that farming and agriculture is the occupation of the majority of the population of this country, and is in itself the most important industry in Ireland and will remain so.  In their own interests, I venture to say, it is important to the farmers and the agriculturists that every hour that can possibly be spared should be devoted to the education <Col N="6" /> of their children.  I regret that in Section 2 the age limit of attendance at school is not sixteen instead of fourteen years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that an amendment such as this should be put down to this important measure. As a matter of fact, if this amendment were accepted it would destroy the whole principle of this Bill.  If Senators will look at amendment No. 3, which deals with the same matter, they will find that it is urged as a sufficient reason for the child abstaining from school attendance that the child is working at agricultural work.  Now the whole principle of this Bill is to see that the children, in this country, shall, at least, get a smattering of education to fit them for their future in life. I think the farming community requires education as much as any other section of the community.  Notwithstanding all the pleas that everybody is making to educate the child of the farmer and the farm labourer, it is astonishing that a farmer should come along to sabotage a Bill of this nature which means so much for the future of this country.</P>
      <P>Everyone admits, at present, that, no matter what expectation a boy or a girl, a man or a woman, may have, some education is required to enable them to earn their livelihood, and that the most menial occupation, at the present day, requires some education.  It is admitted that the limits outlined in this Bill are meagre enough to allow children to obtain sufficient education to become good citizens and to enable them to earn their bread.  I sincerely hope that this amendment will be scouted out without further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamYeats" hpid="Dr. YEATS Dr. YEATS">
      <NameTxt>Dr. YEATS</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Seanad to Article I. of the Convention of Geneva which, I understand, was signed by the representative of the Irish Free State:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Children under the age of fourteen years may not be employed or worked in any public or private agricultural undertaking, or any branch thereof, save outside the hours fixed for school attendance.  If they are employed outside the hours of school <Col N="7" /> attendance the employment shall not be such as to prejudice their attendance at school.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That Article certainly represents the opinion of the great majority of those identified with the teaching of children all over the world, and I do not think the Free State should depart from it. It is very doubtful if it is keeping within the spirit of it, as it is, in view of the exemptions that are given at certain seasons of the year, but I am quite certain the Seanad will not support any resolution which makes further breaches in the Convention of Geneva.  I would like to point out to the Seanad again that we are spending on the education of our children what amounts to £1 5s. per head of the population per annum.  In England and Scotland they spend about £2 10s. per head of the population per annum. Our trade rival, Denmark, spends what amounts to about £2 15s. per head of the population.  In Norway the proportion is about the same.  Of course that is counting not only taxes but rates, and shows that already our education is starved.  It is certain that our children are going into the battle of life very poorly equipped to face rivals, to put it no higher.  In any case the children are going into the battle of life unequipped because enough is not spent on education.  The proposal in the amendment is that the inefficient education the children are being given should be made still more inefficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. CUMMINS Mr. CUMMINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CUMMINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the character of this amendment is so obviously reactionary to the whole spirit of the Bill that it requires no argument in this enlightened chamber to convince Senators of the futility of adopting it. The matter was discussed at great length in the Dáil.  The idea of a child of ten, say the son of a shopkeeper, going behind the counter and being trained in his father's business before he is able to multiply six and a half by seven is to me preposterous.  The child of a tailor, learning to sew buttons at ten years of age, would seem to be another suggestion embodied in the amendment, and so on <i>ad lib.</i>  Instances might be enumerated of gross <Col N="8" /> anomalies being perpetrated.  The whole spirit of the Bill and the object with which it has been introduced would, I should say, be completely nullified if any of the Senator's amendments were accepted.  The proposal in amendment No. 4 would mean that there would be irregularity in attendance between the 17th March and the 15th July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to a point of order.  I am only moving the first amendment.  I am not moving the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. CUMMINS Mr. CUMMINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CUMMINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  Is it seriously contemplated that a child of ten years of age should be kept at home for the purpose of learning its father's business by slaving at that business? A child of that age is not capable of taking instruction in business matters. Except in very rare instances, a child is not mentally developed at that age to do that&mdash;although we are precocious enough in this country&mdash;we would want to go to a warmer climate where the human intellect develops more rapidly than it does in this country. The amendment would mean chronic irregularity in attendance, and would necessitate that irregularity throughout the whole period of the school year.  Everyone knows that it is not possible for a teacher to divide a class of ten or twelve pupils into three sections owing to the inequality that exists in their progress.  What would happen is that vivacious children who attended regularly would be dragged back to the level of those who did not attend, and, as a consequence, would lose interest in their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some experience of what that means in the North of Ireland.  I was teaching in a school where the children attended on alternate days.  The matter went even still further.  On the days that they attended school they worked from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m., and in the evening after school they worked from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.  The parents, unfortunately, were not able to earn sufficient to support their families.  The children came to school tired, and, when the teachers were not engaged with them, they slept at every opportunity, especially on days when they <Col N="9" /> had been working in the mornings.  I hold that the whole responsibility for much of the misunderstandings that exist between the North and the South of Ireland is due to the slave child system of employment that was in force in Belfast in those years.  It was impossible for children to have a wider outlook or to have their intelligence cultivated so as to bring them into line with more progressive countries.  That is what the amendment suggested by the Farmers' Party would do here.  It has been acknowledged on all sides that farming education is in a most backward condition.  We have had complaints from organisers of the Irish Agricultural Society and the Department who go through the country lecturing farmers on up-to-date methods. The organisers say that the failure of these lectures was due to the lack of intellectual cultivation on the part of those who attended them.  In some places it was impossible to get these people to do anything that was suggestive of progress.  I believe that state of mind would disappear if farmers' children had a better primary education giving that education in rural areas the necessary bias that would lead up to agricultural progress. The amendments would be most reactionary, and would push back the hands of the educational machine in a quarter in which they need to move most rapidly&mdash;that is amongst the farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EarlofKerry" hpid="EARL of KERRY EARL of KERRY">
      <NameTxt>EARL of KERRY</NameTxt>
      <P>Another argument in addition to those that have been urged against this amendment occurs to me.  Supposing that the amendment was in every way desirable. how would it be possible to make sure that the children were, in fact, receiving instruction in their business? Surely you could not in every case rely on the words of the parents that such instruction was taking place.  The only way to make sure would be to have a host of inspectors to ensure that the instruction was being given.  To me that seems a stronger objection than those already urged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>The very foundation of this Bill for compulsory attendance and to give facilities for the education of children is largely set off by lack <Col N="10" /> of continuity in attendance.  Senators with children, who watch their progress from week to week in the schools, know that if they remain away for any time owing to sickness or otherwise, they evince considerable dislike to returning. Their memories have been dulled, and when they return they are not in touch with the class.  The teacher of course cannot devote special attention to such children in order to make up the arrears, and the result is that for the balance of the year the pupil is behind the others.</P>
      <P>Parents are not disposed to attach that importance to the education of their children that the matter deserves, and compulsion is necessary to make parents do their duty.  We find also that owing to the lack of continuity in attendance, when children reach school leaving age and when they should be equipped to avail themselves of the facilities for technical education, the teachers of technical schools complain they have not got the number of pupils that they would like to deal with, largely for the reason that the children have left the primary school at a certain age.  When they come along to the technical schools it is found that they have not received sufficient education and are not able to stand the test required or to assimilate the teaching given in the technical schools.  That is largely due to the fact that there have been so many breaks in the education of the child up to that point and owing to that lack of continuity in his education he is not sufficiently equipped to take up a technical course.  The point does not need any stressing at all.  I am surprised that Senator Linehan has moved such an amendment.  I presume he speaks for the whole of the farming class, but I question it.  I would ask him to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is some misapprehension as regards the effect of this amendment.  There is nothing whatever in it about hiring children or about sending them out to employment.  It simply means that there will be additional education of a technical character given to the children that will equip them in the way of earning their livelihood when they get to a certain age.</P>

      <P>That may be the meaning of it, but undoubtedly it might have the effect pointed out by the Senator, because if he were hired out he would be, in the words of this amendment, receiving instruction or training in the business of his father. If his father was a farmer and hired him out to an adjoining farmer, the boy would be receiving a training there in the business of his father.</P>

I think the effect of this amendment would be to get children into the work when they come to that age.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EDUCATION (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Linehan's amendment has been rather satisfactorily dealt with from my point of view by the various Senators who have spoken on the matter.  I hope that they represent the majority of this Assembly.  When this Bill was before the Dáil, I had occasion to compliment one Deputy when, after the Second Reading, he was able to propose an amendment, the effect of which would be practically to nullify the Bill.  I think I can congratulate Senator Linehan on having surpassed that.  This amendment in effect says, &ldquo;Let us go back on the Second Reading and nullify <Col N="12" /> the effect of the Bill.&rdquo;  It makes the Bill, as Senator Kenny and Senator Cummins pointed out, wholly unenforceable. First of all, suppose that the excuses are genuine, then it practically means that the children are to stop away whenever their father has anything for them to do at home in his particular business.  On the other hand supposing that the excuse is not genuine, there will be the difficulty pointed out by Senator the Earl of Kerry, that it will be impossible to prove it.  The amendment undoubtedly as down on the paper would have the effect of nullifying the Bill as a whole. I am not at all inclined to quarrel with the draft of it.  There is something more to object to than the draft.  There is the whole idea behind it.  The idea behind this amendment if accepted would result not merely in putting us into the position we had before the Bill was introduced, but would put us into the position before 1892, before the existing Act, which has proved by no means satisfactory, was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might point out that in the last remark Senator Linehan made, he said that this is an amendment granting exemption from attendance at school, but it is not an amendment to compel children to engage in certain other occupations. I gather from his last speech that what he was aiming at, was that they should attend school, and, in addition, that they should be sent to milk cows in the morning and in the evening and engage in labour of that particular kind.  That is not what the amendment even attempted to do, and by no stretch of the imagination could it be brought within the purpose of the amendment.  Even if it could, I am not suggesting that it would be accepted. I want to make that clear.  I quite agree with the Senator that education is not confined to schools, and I wish the parents and people of the country generally could be convinced of that, but this Bill is confined to schools.  It is because we are convinced that sufficient attention is not given to children in the matter of their attendance at school that this Bill is necessary. We want to see the attendance increased.  I quite admit what Senator Yeats has said, that if you compare <Col N="13" /> the expenditure on education in this country with the public moneys paid by the several authorities in rates in other countries, we do not prove ourselves to be exceedingly extravagant in these matters.  But I think it right to see when we are expending money, even the rather meagre sum we are expending, that we should not try to nullify its effect by doing what Senator Kenny has referred to as the breaking of the continuity of attendance and therefore practically ruin our whole system.  Senator Linehan quite rightly called attention to the fact that he was only taking one amendment. But when he said that there was no intention of providing for the possibility of the child being engaged by anybody other than its parent, I wonder whether he had quite forgotten the other amendments he was going to move.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and negatived.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 4, sub-section (3): To delete in line 35 the word &ldquo;May&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;July.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (3) provides that for a period of 10 days from the 17th March to the 15th May children may be kept at home to assist in certain work.  I ask that the ten days be within the period from the 17th of March to the 15th of July.  The object of that is to enable children to assist their parents at a very important period of the year when they would be of some use to them, and that is the period of thinning and singling out of the root crops. The root crop will probably be fit to be thinned about from the middle of June to the middle of July.  In tillage districts that is the period when the assistance of children will be most valuable to their parents.  I understand that the period already specified in the Bill from the 17th March to the 15th May would cover other districts where turf-cutting and potato-planting are in operation.  My amendment will not increase the number of days on which a child may be kept at home.  It merely alters the period, and it would be only ten days in any case.  The <Col N="14" /> change of date proposed in the amendment would be of advantage in tillage districts.</P>

      <P>I regret I have to oppose this amendment also.  The time allotted to the education of youth is altogether too short as it is; a paltry four hours a day is, I believe, the maximum time available.  Fixing the date from 17th March to the 15th May means the period of exemption would run over no less than 33 days for each child, and the suggestion of the Senator, I calculate, would mean 75 days. I understand from professional teachers that irregular attendance at school is one of the most objectionable and reprehensible things in the conduct of education.  It is most unfortunate that some fixed date cannot be arranged for Easter.  I know that school boys from some of the schools across the Channel came over on their holidays to this country after the Easter was over. Extending this date to July would be altogether too long, and I, therefore, regret I have to oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to think this amendment is a reasonable one.  We have already the principle maintained and accepted in the Dáil that a certain number of days should be set aside for the purpose of allowing children to assist their parents in the farms.  None of the advanced educationists in this assembly ever dissented from that point of view.  The only argument that may be advanced against it is as regards the question of continuity, but continuity is already broken by the Bill.  If it is a great advantage to the farmer, or whoever it may be, to employ his child three days in July rather than three days in May, I think it is a concession the legislature should allow.  There is no doubt that the argument advanced by Senator Linehan is quite right. June is undoubtedly the period in the year in which a small child could be very usefully employed in the operations he describes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view it is not necessary for his argument or mine to consider whether it is right or not to employ a child on a farm under 14 years of age.  The <Col N="15" /> only question is, whether having accepted the principle that a child is entitled to be employed for ten days on its parents' farm, that concession should be given in July rather than in March, April or May.  I think it is probable that from the point of view of the child June or July would be much better than March or April.  He will then have warm sunshine on him, and he will be better for the violet rays.  It does not interfere with his school attendance, as it is permitted to him to absent himself for ten days, but whether his absence occurs during the month of May, June or July, or any other month, will not effect the issue.  Continuity is broken, and the period of the break of the continuity would not interfere with the purpose of the Bill as it stands.  I have pleasure in supporting the amendment.</P>

      <P>Is not the whole issue a question as between the potato and the turnip?  Under the Bill ten days have been given to the child from the 17th March, which I think most people will look upon as the date when potatoes are planted.  Senator Linehan's amendment is supposed to cover the thinning of turnips.  As far as I can see, the question is as to whether the planting of potatoes is a more important thing than the thinning of the turnips.  I should myself give the vote in favour of the potato.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. CUMMINS Mr. CUMMINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CUMMINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this on the ground that it is extending the period of concentration of study by two months.  Any farmer, I think, in any part of Ireland who sets about his work in time would have the bulk of his farm work done by the 15th May. Extending the period of irregularity of attendance from the 15th May to the 15th July would be extending it over a very vital period in a child's school life.  Promotions take place at the end of June.  If a child is careless in his attendance up to the last week in June, the desire will come upon him to remain, perhaps, in the same class with perfect complacency the next year.  If he does not get a fair chance of putting final touches to his preparation for what is looked upon as the great annual <Col N="16" /> test in the school year, that child becomes dissatisfied.  It would not be in keeping with human nature if he found himself treated at the end of the school year by his parents in this indifferent way in the matter of education, and he would say to himself: &ldquo;I will take it easy another year in this class,&rdquo; thus cultivating a habit most injurious to that child's future.  Children go into the new standards in the month of July.  If a parent who is, say, in the turnip line should take it into his head to keep a child, or his whole family, away from school during the first fortnight of July and concentrate them on thinning turnips during that period, the whole year is practically ruined for them, because they are not there to get the initial stages of the programme they will have to study in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know how necessary it is to build on a solid foundation.  The child who is absent during these opening days cannot make progress with the rest of his class and is left behind, and he has no desire to study when he finds himself in such an invidious position. The consequence is that he is trying for the next six months to build upon a foundation that cannot be properly laid, if a teacher is doing justice to the other pupils who are regular in attendance. Then, again, new time must be taken into consideration.  In the present day I think there is ample scope for a child's energies from 3 o'clock or 3.30 in the evening until 6 or 7.  We hear that it is necessary for the farmers to wait until the day is well aired and the grass well dried before any work can be done in the harvest, and that it is often mid-day before any effective work can be done.  Well, midday and three o'clock are not so far apart, and I think the superfluous energies of any child capable of doing work on a farm will be used up more effectively from 3 o'clock to 7 o'clock, than they would in the earlier portion of the day.  It is extraordinary what a lack of unanimity seems to exist amongst farmers in this matter.  If my memory serves me right, I believe Deputy Gorey stated in the Lower House that the help given in the spring time by children is practically negligible. He was backed up on that occasion, <Col N="17" /> I understand, by Deputy Heffernan. Now, it would be well if the farmer Deputies of the Dáil and Senators should hold a council of war, occasionally, when they intend to attack educational progress, and at least show to us that they have considered the problem seriously, and that they are unanimous in their opposition.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further for me to say except to point out that this amendment extends the period of irregularity to the particular time of the year when regularity is most essential for the successful working of the schools and the advancement of the children.  This is the time when irregularity begets indifference on the part of the children and discourages teachers.</P>

      <P>I hope the Seanad will not pass this amendment or any other amendment which would tend to make the administration of this Bill difficult.  I believe it is to the interest of the whole country that this Bill should be effectively carried out.  Senator Bennett made a somewhat plausible case, namely, that because we have agreed to what I consider an objectionable section&mdash;at least the Dáil has agreed to an objectionable section, and we have not put down any amendment against it&mdash;that we should now agree to more objectionable sections.  I should also like to draw the attention of Senators to sub-section (2) of the same section by which you will find that in this section we are providing excuses for the school children not to attend school, a thing most of us prefer not to do if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that section we find it is a good excuse &ldquo;that the child has been prevented from attending school by some other sufficient cause.&rdquo;  That is bad enough, and there is the further excuse by which the child may be employed at home for quite a long period of the summer.  The Senator who moved this has a further amendment which provides that he need not be employed at home&mdash;that he may be, in fact, employed elsewhere.  All these things would add greatly to the difficulty of working the Bill, and I hope the Seanad will not pass these amendments.  I do not think these amendments are in the <Col N="18" /> interests of the farming community.  I would like to point out that we are told that because the Dáil has agreed to this that we should extend it.  The Dáil has apparently reluctantly agreed to it.  It is apparent that they looked upon it as an objectionable thing which is more or less necessary for the time being.  I hope this amendment will not pass.</P>

      <P>I doubt if Senator Cummins is quite wise, or if he is not too optimistic in expecting the same iron discipline in the Farmers' Party as there is in the Labour Party. Otherwise I agree with what he said. I had doubts about putting this section in the Bill, and I may say as the Minister for Education I had to blush for putting it in, but as the representative of farmers, at least of a farming community, I find it necessary to make some provision in this matter on behalf of the farmers owing to the economic state of the country.  That is the reason the provision is there.  Now, that being so, we find that this is the position: Take the case that was particularly in our minds and that was argued in the Dáil, namely, the case not of the person in the potato line or the turnip line if I may quote Senator Guinness, but I take the case of the <Col N="19" /> ordinary small farmer who was not in any line but who had to live.</P>
      <P>There was an effort to provide for his economic needs, and it was felt that there were certain periods of the year when it would become a matter of urgent necessity for him to keep his children at home to do urgent work. Now, the two classes of urgent work that we consider so, would be the planting of potatoes in the springtime and the gathering of the harvest.  Hence the two exemptions&mdash;the two limitation periods.  It was not so much the fact of useful work capable of being done, but the urgency of this work.  We felt that if a favourable opportunity were lost in the springtime it would damage chiefly the economic position of the child, and hence the exemptions.  If one takes the case brought forward by Senator Linehan, the thinning of turnips, I suggest that there is not the same urgency about that as there might be in taking advantage of a couple of fine days in the spring or harvest time.  Supposing the labours of the child were necessary&mdash;I am not discussing the merits of that question&mdash;there are the Saturdays and there are, for instance, the long evenings in the summer, in June and July. There are even the advantages of the summer time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that goes to the advantage of thinning turnips.  Remember, the person we had in our minds was not the man with many acres of turnips to thin, but the small farmer, and it seemed to us that if we were making an exemption it could be made only where necessary, because if you extend this exemption to ten days over the whole period you are doing something more than amplifying the principle.  In connection with that, the people who have the enforcement of the Act, the Gárda Síochána, have to extend their vigilance in this matter, and it is one which is extremely difficult to control. They have to extend the period months beyond what they otherwise would have to extend it, and consequently it makes the control of the school on behalf of the teachers exceedingly difficult. Again, you have the break in continuity. <Col N="20" /> We are allowing the break in that continuity, but we do not want to extend it more than is necessary or justifiable.  It is a question between the potato and the turnip, and the reason we voted for the potato is that it is a vital matter for the potato.  It is not so vital that the turnip should be thinned either this week or any other week.  That is practically the whole case.</P>

      <P>I agree, and am very much indebted to you.  I put the amendment on paper at the request of the Technical Education Authorities. I was advised that it was impossible, within the ambit of this Bill, to obtain our object, because, as you pointed out, it applies to elementary schools and not technical schools.  Our object was to have children required to attend technical schools for a certain number of hours every week.  The alteration of the amendment, as you pointed out, is the nearest we could go to the terms of this Bill.  It has been pointed out to us that there is no question more important than the question of education, and in the whole education question I <Col N="22" /> venture to think nothing is more important than that which teaches a boy or girl a trade and makes him self-supporting. For my part, I think I should rather see a boy or girl a good carpenter or cook than taught all the learning and erudition which scholarship can teach.  I even venture to think that the learning of a trade might be regarded as of greater importance than scholarship in a subject the utility of which has lately been so much discussed, the learning of the Irish language. As I pointed out, our object is only partially obtained by the amendment on the paper.  I hope, nevertheless, if for any reason the Minister objects to it and lays before the Seanad reasons, sufficiently cogent, for its rejection, at any rate, that he will be able to tell us if he will give the subject of our desire his consideration.  Perhaps at no very distant date he may produce a Bill by which all children in this country will be compelled to undergo a certain amount of technical education.</P>

To my mind, it does not appear to be so, and would necessitate, I think, the introduction of a separate Bill.  In any case the Minister has power under this Bill to compel children throughout the country between the ages of fourteen and sixteen to attend school. I appeal to him now, as I did on the last occasion, not to schedule areas in which this Act should be imposed, but to schedule the whole of Ireland as an area in which compulsory attendance up to the age of sixteen shall be enforced. That power we have, and the Minister will soon learn from the country that there is no definite and distinct opposition to that proposal.  I believe personally there is not, and I claim to be acquainted very generally with three or four counties of Leinster and some in Connaught.  I worked in both.  I believe that opposition would not be forthcoming to any extent. That would overcome the difficulties of the situation with which the amendment of the Earl of Wicklow is faced.</P>

As the circumstances of the different areas permit we can, in such <Col N="24" /> areas, extend the ages from fourteen to sixteen and change the programme for that particular area.  It was intended for the normal pupil who had reached the age of fourteen.  If we make his attendance compulsory, as we are about to do, it was intended that the training he would get from fourteen to sixteen should be much more of a vocational character than in the school that he was attending up to the age of fourteen.  For instance, in agricultural areas the programme might include&mdash;and it is a matter for each particular district, and what they require&mdash;Irish, English agricultural history, geography, rural science, applied mathematics, mensuration, agricultural calculations, manual instruction and training, singing and drawing and so on.</P>

      <P>I am coming to that.  Instead of applied mathematics and mensuration, and manual instruction, for girls, we would have courses of domestic economy, cookery, needlework, physiology and hygiene. That is for rural areas.

You would not have agricultural history and geography, but instead you would have commercial history and geography, and ordinary science would be substituted for rural science, and you would have manual instruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is possibly one weakness in this Bill which comes into the second sub-section of Section 24, providing various powers for the Minister.  It does not give powers to limit instruction, attendance at which might be compulsory, to any of these subjects. If the Seanad thinks there should be power also given to the Minister to limit or not, in certain areas, between the ages of fourteen and sixteen, the instruction on certain subjects such as the Minister thinks fit, I could bring in an amendment of that kind upon the Report Stage.  I might say this Act applies to the whole of Ireland up to the age of sixteen except So and So, but I object to saying that the Act <Col N="25" /> shall apply to the whole of Ireland, and then straight away exempt the whole of Ireland from the Act.</P>
    <P>There are very few places where you could put immediately into effect a School Attendance Bill.  There are other places less difficult and more ready to receive this exemption up to 16.  In the city of Dublin and of Cork you might have a fair prospect of success if you made the Bill compulsory up to the age of 16.  But apart from the financial difficulties involved, we would come into conflict with the economic conditions if we were to apply a regulation of that kind in Connemara or Donegal, or in portions of the County Kerry.  I think it is better to have the law and enforce it than to make a gesture, and yet have the weakness not to enforce it.  I prefer having the power, gradually, to extend the Act and insist upon its enforcement rather than to pretend that we are in a better position than we are actually and allow laxity.  I think it is better that we should gradually advance, as inquiry shows we are justified in doing, rather than merely say we are in a splendid condition.</P>
    <P>Between now and the Report Stage I would consider the introduction of an amendment to sub-section (2), to the effect that in elementary schools the Minister will also have power to limit the subjects at which certain pupils may be compelled to attend.</P>

I am not dealing with the merits of your amendment now, and you can say whether you can accept the suggestion made by the Minister or not.

Section 6 provides that where a seizure is made the sub-sheriff has to make an itemised inventory of the goods or chattels seized and present it to the apparent debtor within 48 hours.  Section 8 enables the same sub-sheriff to sell the chattels after the expiration of 24 hours, so that the inventory need not be presented until 24 hours after the goods or chattels have been sold. I do not think that is a reasonable arrangement. The debtor may have been away from home when the seizure of miscellaneous chattels was made, and he gets no inventory from the sub-sheriff until 24 hours later, although the goods were sold within 24 hours of the seizure.  I think that is rather sharp practice.  If a debtor were aware of the exact amount owing he might be able to make some arrangement or get his friends to save the goods from being sold.  It is the debtor's interests that they should not be sold below the market value, and it might be to his interest if they were not sold at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It looks like court messengers acting as cattle rustlers or members of the Ku-Klux-Klan swooping down and seizing goods and animals, taking them away to some unknown destination. selling them after 24 hours have elapsed, and then giving an inventory to the person from whom they were seized.  We are not going to encourage respect for the law or strengthen the course of the State's writ in the land by a kidnapping atmosphere and to enable sheriffs, so to speak, to take people by surprise in the execution of the law.  The sheriff has power to sell <Col N="28" /> the goods if he desires to do so outside his own bailiwick so that the dangerous intimidation that Ministers stress so much is removed.  I think there must be some protection for debtors who are not necessarily criminals.  The amendment is a very small adjustment providing that the inventory shall be submitted 24 hours after the seizure. Of course, an alternative amendment would be to leave the time for the inventory 48 hours and to extend the time within which the goods might be sold to 72 hours or to a longer period.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding to deal with the merits of the Senator's amendment I would like to ask the consideration of Senators, generally, for the position in which I was placed with regard to this amendment and some four others.  This Bill was before the Seanad roughly one month ago&mdash;some date towards the end of March.  Last afternoon at 4.30 or 5 o'clock a batch of amendments were handed into the Clerk's office.  A month has elapsed since the Second Reading of the Bill, and it is not unreasonable to make the comment that the amendments might have been put in sooner than last afternoon. Amendments after all may be substantial.  They may be proposing whole new sections in the Bill, and it is proper that they should receive right consideration, not merely by the Minister and his Department, but by the colleagues of the Senator proposing them.  I cannot say when Senators received these five or six amendments that were handed in last evening.  I can say that they did not reach me, or any official of my Department, at 3 o'clock to-day.  Obviously there is something wrong.  At any rate I was entitled to expect when they were put in that the staff of the Seanad, recognising that this Bill was down for consideration to-day, should have taken speedy steps to bring these new amendments to the notice of my officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning I discussed this Bill with my officials, and discussed it entirely on the basis that I had to deal entirely with one amendment, that is the amendment of Senator Linehan but in the restaurant at lunch time, a <Col N="29" /> couple of minutes before three o'clock, I could be told that a great many other amendments had been handed in, and would come up for consideration to-day. In fact I have had time to go into the amendments sufficiently with my officials whilst the Education Bill was under consideration, and I am prepared to deal with them, but it might well be otherwise.  My Bill might have been the only matter on the Order Paper for the Seanad, and I would be in the position of having to deal with those amendments after very inadequate consideration or of being compelled to ask the Seanad to leave these amendments over till some future date. I simply make that comment, that it might be possible to so improve procedure that that state of affairs would not recur.  I recognise that occasionally when the interval between the Stages of a Bill is short that there has to be a certain amount of give-and-take as between Ministers and the Seanad.  In the case of this Bill the interval has been very long.  I think that the amendments might have been handed in earlier, and that I should have received a prompt word from the staff of the Seanad that they had come in.  They were handed in last afternoon, and up to 3 o'clock to-day I was unaware of any amendments other than that of Senator Linehan.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister proceeds to discuss the merits of the amendment, may I say in addition to what he says, that I entirely sympathise with his statement.  I had intended myself to call attention to the fact that practically all the amendments on the White Paper were not delivered until late yesterday evening when, as a matter of fact, under our Standing Orders, they were bound to be delivered before 11 o'clock yesterday. Consequently they were late under our Standing Orders, and had the Minister raised the point and objected to dealing with them, I should certainly rule that his objection was reasonable and right.  He has not done that but he has called attention to the fact that although the amendments reached the staff of the Seanad late yesterday evening, he got no notification of them until <Col N="30" /> late this afternoon.  That was, I think, irregular.  I think he should have got the earliest possible intimation of them and I think he will perhaps give me the credit of saying that I have always done my best to facilitate the passage by the Ministers of their Bills before this House and have given them every reasonable facility and every proper latitude.  I am sensible that he has a cause for complaint in the matter.  I shall see that for the future amendments of this kind are delivered at the earliest possible moment and that they are transmitted to the Minister in charge.  As the Minister has himself elected to proceed with those amendments and to discuss them, I have nothing more to say.</P>

      <P>This amendment might well be considered with the following amendment.  It is not on the whole an unreasonable amendment, when one remembers that this Bill, unlike some of its forerunners, is a permanent Bill and sets out permanently the law for the enforcement of the orders of our courts.  I do not think that it is too much to ask that within forty-eight hours of a seizure an itemised inventory of the goods seized <Col N="31" /> should be left with the owner, or in his absence with the responsible person in possession of such chattels.  I think in effect and in practice that there will be no difficulty in ensuring that before court messengers, or bailiffs as they are now called, leave the premises, such an inventory shall be left with the owners of the premises.  Occasionally the thing may prove a little difficult, say, in the case of an out-farm on which stock is seized.  The farm might be nine or ten miles from the residence of the judgment debtor, and it was with an eye rather to the exceptional cases that we made forty-eight hours the time rather than twenty-four. However, I would not object to twenty-four.</P>
      <P>I think even in these exceptional cases, or even in the case of a seizure from an out-farm some considerable distance from the residence of the debtor, that we will be able to manage it within a period of twenty-four hours. I see the justice of the comment which draws attention to the figure of forty-eight hours in Section 6 and twenty-four hours in Section 8, as the period within which a sale may take place. If goods have to be kept, it means more costs are accumulating for the judgment debtor.  Even storage of furniture costs something, and the maintenance and care of live stock is a considerable item.  If, in addition, you are compelled to take some special precautions against re-seizure, against a kind of illegal re-seizure by the judgment creditor or his friends in custody on the part of the under-sheriff for any considerable time, it becomes a problem.  However, taking the two together and recognising the substance of certain of the Senator's representations, I would not object to making the two figures 48&mdash;to the retention of the figure 24 in Section 6, and to making the figure in Section 8, 48 instead of 24.  The Senator may take me as accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 13, which enables the under-sheriff to seize property, not alone of the debtor, but of his relations, has been justified.  It has been justified by the Minister principally on the grounds that although a similar section was in the temporary measure for the past three years, that he had received no complaint of any hardship or any injustice being done under it to any person.  I hold that the section was inoperative during those three years because the Minister issued a special circular to the under-sheriffs directing them not to enforce this Section 13 to its fullest extent, and that the objectionable part of it was not to be put into operation.  Therefore, the Minister's argument in justification of this Section 13, that for the last three years he received no complaints, falls to the ground.</P>

It just pointed out to the under-sheriffs that the duty was not imposed on them to seize the property of third parties, but that the Act simply vested in them the discretion to go ahead with the seizure in cases where they believed the third party claim to be bogus, and they were relieved of the onus which heretofore existed of a personal action if they made a <i>bona fide</i> mistake.</P>

      <P>&mdash;and therefore the Minister's argument that he did not receive any complaint is no justification for the continuance of this sub-section (1) in Section 13 of the permanent Act, I think that when a sworn declaration is made by a third party, by which that third party incurs a liability to prosecution for perjury, for making a false claim, that should be sufficient to insure that the property of the wife or husband or child of the debtor would not be seized and disposed of by the under-sheriff.  I think that is a very reasonable amendment, and some regard ought to be had for third parties. The creditor has his remedy.  He need give no credit.  There is nothing to compel him to give credit.  If the creditor finds that not only can he seize the property of the debtor but that he can seize the property of all the debtor's relations, I fear that there will be more injudicious giving of credit in the future than there was in the past.  I submit this amendment as a means of setting the matter right and doing justice to the creditor, the under-sheriff, <Col N="35" /> and the third party.  I cannot imagine that any person who had not <i>bona fide</i> held property would make this sworn declaration and run the risk of a prosecution by the State for perjury afterwards. I submit this amendment for the consideration of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I am not a lawyer, and personally I do not understand the effect of this section.  If it means that a wild scamp of a boy can go out and run up debts, and that then the creditors or officers of the court can come and seize the father's goods, I think it is monstrous.  I see that some Senators signify that I am wrong. In that case I do not understand the legal interpretation of the section, but as I read it, that appeared to me to be the effect of this section.  I quite appreciate the desire of the Government to meet and counteract the bogus third party claim.  I think the husband and wife certainly being one, I would make them one in respect of debts. The husband should not be allowed to say &ldquo;These goods are my wife's,&rdquo; and similarly the father should not in that case be allowed to say &ldquo;These goods are the property of my children.&rdquo; Surely the presumption is that a son or daughter, living in the father's, the debtor's, house, does not own the chattels, lands or stock-in-trade.  That appears to be the interpretation of this section, and a judgment against the son or daughter can be enforced against the property of the parents.  If that is the case I think that the section deserves very close attention from this House, and this amendment, in the light of ordinary common-sense, seems right.</P>

      <P>When I first read Section 13 rather carefully I thought it was open to the objection that has been raised by Senator Sir John Keane, but on looking into another section contained in the Bill I do not think that that is so.  The only thing that Section 13 does is to relieve the under-sheriff from the liability of an action if he seizes goods under a judgment against one member of the family, and the goods are alleged to belong to another member of the family.  It would mean <Col N="36" /> that in a judgment against the son, chattels belonging to the father would be seized under that section, and this section relieves the under-sheriff from that liability if it were subsequently proved that the goods were not the son's but the father's.  But then if you turn to Section 21 of the Bill you will find that the right of interpleader and the process of interpleader is now given to the district court, which is the most convenient court for the purpose. If there is a judgment against the son, the father makes a <i>bona fide</i> claim to the goods.  The sheriff has the right to go into the court and have an interpleader and settle who is the real owner of the goods.  Is he to deprive the person of the right of action against the sheriff where he has on good faith seized family goods which are not the property of the debtor?  He has still the right if he has a <i>bona fide</i> case to claim the goods and get them back from the sheriff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The interpleader process had better be clearly known to Senators, for a good deal turns on it in connection with Section 13.  If a sworn declaration of ownership is served on the under-sheriff, together with the amount of the debt or the value of the goods seized, whichever shall be the smaller, that leaves the road clear to the interpleader process.  The under-sheriff, in the event of those conditions being fulfilled, returns the goods and holds the lodgment much as a stakeholder, and leaves it to the court to say as between A, the owner of the goods originally seized, and B, the judgment creditor, as to which is really entitled to the sum of money that has been lodged.  That is the process of interpleader.  The under-sheriff is a man having no personal interest in the money.  His position is that he has seized certain goods from A on foot of a debt.  The claim is advanced by the third party B, that those goods are not <Col N="37" /> the property of A, but are, in fact, his own personal property.  He says to this new claimant B: &ldquo;As between yourself and the judgment creditor let the court decide,&rdquo; and the court can decide on the following conditions: &ldquo;You will get back these goods if you lodge with me the amount of the debt, or the value of the goods seized, whichever of these two may be considered the smaller.  I hold these stakes, and leave the court to decide as between you and the judgment creditor where the ownership of this sum of money should lie.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the process of interpleader. The object of the amendment can be secured, I submit, under the provisions of Sections 21 of the Bill by the process of interpleader.  The under-sheriff is not obliged by Section 13 to seize the goods of any person other than the debtor, and sub-section (2) of Section 13 makes that clear, but if he believes that a bogus claim has been made he is entitled to seize and is indemnified against action.  In the past, when he was not so indemnified, he did not seize but returned a <i>nulla bona</i> but he is now indemnified against that personal action under threat of which he functioned in the past.  No personal action will lie against himself if he in the exercise of his discretion believes a particular claim to be bogus, and if he makes up his mind to proceed with the seizure he is relieved from the menace of a personal action.  But it is open to the third party claimant to make the under-sheriff comply with the condition precedent to the process of interpleader, and to make a statutory declaration and the necessary lodgment in proof of good faith in establishing the substance of his claim.  Thereupon the sheriff is free to seek the arbitration of the court as between the third party claimant and the judgment creditor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now in the straight, clear case where the under-sheriff believes the claim to be bogus and proceeds with the seizure and no such steps are taken, it would appear on the face of it, there was not much in the claim, but assuming, and I have admitted throughout the theoretical possibility of it, the under-sheriff in exercising the powers which we propose to confer on him under Section 13, makes a <i>bona fide</i> mistake, what is the position?  Then the person whose goods <Col N="38" /> have been seized has 48 hours grace, that we agreed by Senator O'Farrell's amendment to extend to him, instead of the 24 hours as it was.  He has 48 hours in which to take the appropriate action, to make this statutory declaration and arrange with the under-sheriff for the lodgment of the sum which will release the goods.  Then it is no longer a question of the goods, but a question of the sum which he has lodged for the release of his goods.  The sheriff holds that much in the capacity of a stakeholder, and he goes to the court and says: &ldquo;Decide between A, the judgment creditor, and B, the third party, as to who is to get the sum of money which is now in my hands.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a note of that.  The question of the costs of the under-sheriff is within the discretion of the courts, and when the court is satisfied that the under-sheriff has acted properly in having resorted to the interpleader, he is allowed his costs incidental to the proceedings as against the unsuccessful claimant, or the execution creditor, as the case may be.  If the third-party claimant wins the case, and the court thinks the under-sheriff did right in coming along with his interpleader process, then the court will give him his costs as against the judgment creditor.  If, on the other hand, the third-party claim is disposed of, the costs of the under-sheriff are liable to be made part of his expenses, so that Section 21, I would urge, meets the case of the <i>bona fide</i> mistake of the under-sheriff in exercising his powers under Section 13.  I would apply the same remarks to the amendment of Senator Linehan and Senator O'Farrell.  They would simply change the object aimed at by Section 13.  The intention is to guard against seizure by the under-sheriff of goods belonging to a person other than the debtor, where such person has a legal claim to the goods and adduces legal evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the object of the amendment, but it leaves the door open to fraudulent claimants.  A person can obtain the release of his goods by making a statutory declaration.  I am afraid the <Col N="39" /> process will be resorted to, readily and frequently, of making a simple allegation in order to secure a <i>nulla bona</i> return by the under-sheriff.  Let the statutory declaration be made, but, in addition, let there be the lodgment which will show good faith and reality in the claim.  The moment these conditions are applied, Section 21 comes in by way of interpleading, but if you dispense with the lodgment and simply leave it that the moment the particular form is served on the under-sheriff that the under-sheriff will return the goods, then a great many of these formulae will be flying about.  The new position will not then be a substantial improvement on the old, and the old position was calculated to bring the law into ridicule.  When any member of the family other than the judgment creditor puts forward a claim that those goods were his or hers the bailiff went home, reported to the under-sheriff and the latter returned a writ of <i>nulla bona.</i>  Senator Sir John Keane said: &ldquo;Surely the suggestion is absurd that a son or daughter owns the stock on the land of the householder.&rdquo; It is absurd just as it is almost equally absurd in the household to suggest that household equipments and fittings are the property of the children rather than of the parents, but those claims were habitually made, and a cautious under-sheriff, recognising that mistake meant personal liability, never proceeded, although in his own mind he would have very little, if any, doubt of the bogus nature of the claim.  It was sufficient to deter him.  When the result of a <i>bona fide</i> mistake was personal liability, he returned <i>nulla bona</i>, went back and said there was nothing there; that the property belonged to the good man's wife, his wife's sister, or daughter or eldest son, and that everything he saw in the house was not his.  The under-sheriff took no risks.</P>
    <P>That was the position in the past, and that is the position I am attempting to deal with by Section 13.  I see no other way to deal with it than by leaving to the under-sheriff the question of whether or not he will go ahead with his seizure in face of a third-party claim, and we are asking him to go <Col N="40" /> ahead when he is satisfied that the third-party claim is dishonest.  By Section 2 the judgment creditor has no right to insist that he shall go ahead and seize the goods of someone other than the judgment debtor.  We are prepared to guard against any right accruing to the judgment creditor to have the goods of someone who is not the actual debtor seized.  It is a problem that, I think, defies any other solution than the one in the Bill.  You have got to leave it to the commonsense and discretion of the disinterested under-sheriff as to whether he will go ahead in a particular case, and then you have your interpleader proceedings to meet admittedly the odd <i>bona fide</i> mistake which may occur.  I think it would be extremely rare myself.</P>
    <P>These provisions were in operation for three years, and neither by interview nor correspondence nor through a Deputy have I heard of a case of hardship.  Senator Linehan says that is because I sent out a mysterious circular. Let us clear that up.  The circular was sub-section (2) of Section 13, which was not in previous Bills. It was simply a reminder to the under-sheriffs that there was no duty on them to seize the goods of someone other than the judgment debtor.  It was explanatory and told them the object of the Bill was to vest in them a discretion to proceed when they were satisfied that the third-party claim advanced was a bogus claim.  That section is inserted in this Bill simply because we believed that it was absolutely necessary for the removal of doubts, and because this is a permanent Bill, where there should be no vagueness about a matter of that kind.  The circular issued to the under-sheriff did not prevent the full operation of those provisions.  The provisions operated throughout the last three years.  They were extremely useful, and in no single incident was a case brought to my notice.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will keep an open mind between this and the Report Stage on clause 13, because at present it is subject to the infirmity brought out by Senator Keane, and that is due to the fact that the test is made, not of goods <Col N="41" /> found in the house or on the lands of the debtor, but goods found wherever the debtor resides, which is the weakness of the section.  The result of that is that a boy of sixteen might go to the adjoining village, pledge all his father's credit without his father's knowledge, and then, because he resides with his father, the goods are presumed to be his because they are found in his residence.  If these words were left out it would be quite a reasonable thing to make a <i>prima facie</i> case so that goods found in the house or on the lands of the debtor were liable, but this clause extends it to all goods found in the place where the debtor resides and he may only be there for a night or a week.  If those words, &ldquo;other place of residence,&rdquo; are left out, I think the clause would be reasonable, because that would be confining it to goods in the house or on the lands that belong to the debtor.</P>

      <P>I think you do not appreciate my point.  I was making a point in support of your contention. The point I was making was that in that case you put the father's chattels and everything up to satisfy the boy's debt if once it was proved he was living in the same house as the father although he had no claim upon the house and it did not belong to him. I am pointing out you would get rid of that if you put in the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; and confined it to the goods found in the debtor's house or on the debtor's own land.  As it stands at <Col N="42" /> present it is a very sweeping and drastic provision and to my mind is not cured by Clause 21, because Clause 21 does not compel the sheriff to intervene, but gives him the opportunity if he wishes.</P>

      <P>First of all, I would like to get it quite clear that it is not the intention or the object of Section 13 to enable the goods of someone other than the judgment debtor to be seized towards payment of the judgment debtor's liability.  This is our position: The object of Section 13 is to counter, in a way which we believe to be effective, the bogus third party claim which in the past sufficed to reduce so many decrees of the court to waste paper.  In the facing of that problem we have not been able to find <Col N="43" /> any better set of provisions than those contained in Section 13.  With such remedies for a possible <i>bona fide</i> error as Section 21 provides, it is not intended that the goods of the son shall be seized in fulfilment of his father's debts, or that the goods of the father shall be seized in fulfilment of his son's debts.  The process of interpleader is open to them just as it would be open to a complete stranger whose goods might accidentally have been seized in fulfilment of someone else's debt&mdash;the statutory declaration, the lodgment in proof of the substance of one's claim, and the court process.  The actual position in which the under-sheriff was placed in the past was an intolerable one.  He received a decree on foot of shop debts.  He went along to the residence of A.B., the judgment debtor. He went and cast his eye on some valuable piece of furniture, but he was told, &ldquo;Do not touch that; it does not belong to him, it is mine.&rdquo;  Perhaps that is the claim of the eldest daughter.  And so on through every member of the family.  Each one takes his turn and claims whatever goods the under-sheriff or his officers wish under the decree to seize.  The under-sheriff could not rebut these claims.  He knew they were unsound and he had no doubt they were bogus claims, but he was not in a position to rebut them.  It is very difficult in a house when the daughter says that a writing desk or a sideboard or something of that kind is hers, to disprove the claim.  You do not believe it, but it is utterly beyond your power to rebut it.  That is the picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come along then with Section 13, and we say to the under-sheriff: &ldquo;&lsquo;Where you believe the claim to be bogus you need not be deterred by the idea that if by one chance in one hundred you make a mistake you are going to be held personally liable.  We relieve you altogether of personal liability.&rdquo; And then we write in this sub-section (2) of this section to make it clear to the judgment creditors, that they are not entitled to have the son's goods seized in respect of the father's death or <i>vice versa;</i> that there is no right being conferred upon them; that all we try to secure is that the overcautious <Col N="44" /> under-sheriff who habitually returns <i>nulla bona</i> in face of bogus third-party claims, will not continue to do so in the future; we have taken away the fear of the personal action from him.  It is not intended to make the family collectively liable for the debts of one of the members of the family.  The interpleader process will be open to them as to an utter stranger. If there is a danger lurking in the words &ldquo;or other place of residence&rdquo; that can be examined.  It is not at all our intention to try and have the goods of people other than the judgment debtor seized.  If there is anything in these words which contains that possibility, they must be examined.</P>

      <P>As your section stands, if the sheriff goes into a house where a boy is living with his father, he is entitled to say all these things belong to the boy, because they are in his residence, whereas if these words were left out he could not say it, because the house or land would not belong to the boy.  As long as you leave in the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; the sheriff is entitled to go and take everything he finds in the boy's house or land.</P>

      <P>You are giving an immense benefit to the sheriff.

That is <Col N="45" /> quite right, but you have gone further and entitled the sheriff to go against any member of the family, and seize everything in the house, merely because the child is living in the house. That is what I am trying to point out. You do not require that for the purpose of your section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is assumed that we are out in a rapacious mood to seize the goods of every member of the family in respect of the debts of one member of it, and if I am challenged as to whether that is technically or theoretically a possibility under Section 13&mdash;subject, of course, to the remedies in Section 21&mdash;I think I would have to answer that it is, and I would have to answer that all these technical and theoretical horrors are there in that section to provide against actual and concrete abuses that exist, and that have for so long existed, in the <i>nulla bona</i> returns to the judgment creditor who has gone through costly court processes to get his decree and then is met by the dead wall of the third party claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The under-sheriffs will understand, and will be made to understand, that the sole purpose of this section is to provide the only effective remedy we have been able to devise against the third party claim.  They are not to seize the goods of a father in respect of the debts of a son.  They are not to seize the goods of a son in respect of the debts of a father.  But where they believe that particular property is, in fact, the property of the father, if claimed by the son to void the decree of the court, then, believing that, they are able to go ahead without the terrors of a personal action and the son, let us say, who is going to claim the property is left with all the remedies, firstly, that of an interpleader, to put the sheriff in the position to interplead under Section 21, and the remedy provided by the remaining portion of sub-section (1) of Section 13, that is, the personal action against the judgment debtor by way of an action for monies paid on his behalf, if a mistake were to occur.  I should say in a genuine substantial claim the interpleader process will be more often resorted to but there is the other, that if a son's property <Col N="46" /> is wrongfully and in good faith seized by the under-sheriff in respect of the debts of his father, then he has a legal claim against the father for monies paid on his behalf if he can make good his title.  The Section says:</P>
    <P>. . .the person to whom such goods, animals, or other chattels so taken in execution in fact belonged shall (if such goods, animals, or other chattels, should prove not to have been the property of the debtor) be entitled to recover from the debtor by action the value of such goods, animals, and other chattels, together with such damages as such person shall have suffered by reason of such goods, animals, or other chattels having been so taken in execution.</P>
    <P>I have regarded this matter all along as not so much a choice of evils, but a choice between an actual existing evil on a great scale and the purely theoretical technical possibility of an injustice occurring under Section 13.  I do not believe, and I would not be prepared to say it would occur.  I would only be prepared to say that it is a technical possibility.  These provisions have been in operation for three or four years.  Can any Senator say&mdash;no Deputy was able to say&mdash;that a single instance of hardship was brought to his notice in the operation of this provision? I cannot say it, and no official in my Department can say it. No under-sheriff has had to report to us that his exercise of these powers has led to any feeling that injustice had been done, and it has been the current law of the country for four years.  I am asking for it to be continued, and I see no danger lurking in it.</P>

      <P>We have listened to a very lengthy explanation regarding Section 13.  I do not know what impression it has made on the minds of other Senators.  It has merely created <Col N="47" /> greater confusion in my mind as to what is the meaning of the section. The Minister actually alleged that the position of the child, parent, wife or husband, of the debtor was for practical purposes the same as that of any other person from whom goods might be seized on behalf of a judgment debtor.  The Minister says that the child or parent may proceed by way of interpleader.  If that is the case, and if he puts in a claim, does that prevent the sheriff from executing sale? If that is what the Minister states Section 13 seems to me to be absolutely unnecessary.</P>
      <P>Section 13 lays it down definitely that no action shall lie against the sheriff in respect of any goods or chattels seized from the wife or husband, parent or child, of the debtor and that in lieu of such action, an action may be taken by the person to whom these goods may be said to belong, against the debtor.  In these circumstances the sheriff who goes to seize goods is not liable to bother his head about any thing he seizes.  He simply would go along, effect his sale, realise the goods, and let the person who claims ownership of the goods proceed as he will.  The suggestion that the aggrieved persons, the real owner of the goods, may proceed against the debtor from whom the creditor was unable to get anything at first, is absolutely absurd.  Surely, if the debtor had any visible means, the sheriff would be able to get them just as easily on a first visit as he would be on behalf of the new debtor, the person from whom the goods were wrongfully seized.  The suggestion I make in another amendment is that where such a claim is made the sheriff, before selling these goods or chattels, shall satisfy himself of the validity, or otherwise, of the claim by way of interpleader as set forth in Section 21.  The Section will still not leave him open to any action; no damages can be given against him.  I think that would protect him sufficiently.</P>

      <P>That is what I suggested.  I do not think it would be reasonable to ask you to dispose of this now.  I think you will find it requires some substantial alteration, even for the purpose of giving effect to what the Government desire.  They desire to get rid of bogus claims by relatives to the goods of the man in the house.  Because he has them there <i>prima facie</i> they should be held to belong to him, but surely you do not want to extend it so as to seize everything in the house where the debtor may be a lodger or guest?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 21 has been misunderstood.  Senator Brown has pointed out that &ldquo;may&rdquo; there has reference to the District Court.  This is a new provision in relation to the interpleader, that interpleader processes may be taken before the District <Col N="54" /> Court in cases where the amount at stake does not exceed £25.  That is the limit of the civil jurisdiction of the District Court, and the &ldquo;may&rdquo; does not apply to the interpleader process generally.  It only applies to this new provision in regard to interpleaders, that it can be taken before the lower courts in respect of a sum not exceeding £25.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explain the position?  Under the law as it stands in the case you put of a married lady, if her property was taken in a judgment against her husband provided she lodges the money in court she can get an interpleader if the amount is under a certain figure, namely, £25.  That interpleader may on motion of the under-sheriff be brought to the District Court, and if above £25 it has to go to the Circuit Court.  But unless she has got the money to lodge she cannot interplead, and the remedy that she had before of suing the debtor is the only one that remains to her. She cannot sue the sheriff, and she cannot interplead except on the terms of lodging money in court.</P>

      <P>Having in mind that the Married Woman's Property Act was gained in the past by a long and severe struggle in the House of Commons I cannot support this amendment.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">

It does not get one much farther to keep on repeating that the most shocking cases are theoretically possible under the section, in the face of sub-section (2) which gives no right to the judgment <Col N="57" /> creditor to seize any goods other than the goods of the judgment debtor, and in the face of the repeated assurances that the section seeks merely to combat the bogus third party claims put forward by members of the family of the judgment debtor.  Let us suppose that all the things which we are told are theoretically possible happen when this Bill is passed, clearly, then, it would be a case for the repealing of the Act.  Let us suppose that a state of affairs one-hundredth part as bad as that which prevailed with regard to the bogus claims and the <i>nulla bona</i> returns with respect to judgment creditors who were entitled to have their decrees executed&mdash;let us suppose that a position one-hundredth part as bad as that grew up under this Act, there would be a case for a revision.

      <P>The Minister would have a free mind if we did not pass the amendment of Senator Brown now and we would be much more free in our action if we did not adopt the amendment at the moment. We only heard it a few minutes ago and we have not heard it debated.  If we started upon Senator Brown's amendment now some of us might have a good deal to say about it. I agree with Senator Bennett that we ought to have our minds clearer on the matter and not to have a definite decision registered against us when we come to consider it again if we do not oppose it now.</P>

      <P>I think the <Col N="60" /> position would be rendered simpler if we had an assurance from the Minister that he would undertake to consider this amendment between now and the Report Stage.  I do not understand that he has gone that far but I am in the hands of the House.</P>

      <P>I have gone that far, but only that far.  I have not definitely said that if Senator O'Farrell and Senator Linehan withdraw their amendments that I will bring up an amendment on Report.  I have said that I will give very careful consideration to everything and to the many things said in the course of the debate here, with regard to Section 13, and the possible implication of certain words in that section.  It would be unfair to leave Senator O'Farrell under the impression that if he withdrew his amendment that an amendment would be brought forward on the Report Stage providing substantially the same thing, because that is not the position.</P>

      <P>I would like to say what the business is remaining over.  We have concluded all the business at present available except the remaining part of this particular Bill, and that stands over in order that the Minister may consider what his attitude will be to this proposed amendment of Senator Brown, or whether he would propose to bring in an amendment of his own to deal with the matter. The only other Bill that could with any probability come from the Dáil in the course of the next week is the Damage to Property (Amendment) Bill, 1926.  I do not feel justified in summoning the Seanad to meet for that Bill.  In addition to that, there is public business of an open-air character which I understand will occupy the attention of many Senators during Tuesday and Wednesday of next week.  Therefore the House stands adjourned until Wednesday, 12th May.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.20 p.m.</P>
