    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Title be postponed and that Sections 1 to 5 inclusive stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
    <P>(1)  Save as is otherwise authorised by this Act, every local authority shall, before making an appointment to an office to which this Act applies, request the Commissioners to recommend to them a person for appointment to such office.</P>
    <P>(2)  Whenever a local authority does not, within three months after an office to which this Act applies becomes vacant or (in the case of a new office) is created, either request the Commissioners to recommend to them a person for appointment to such office or make an appointment (other than a temporary appointment) to such office under and in accordance with a provision of this Act dispensing with such request, the Minister may on behalf of such local authority request the Commissioners to recommend to such local authority a person for appointment to such office.</P>
    <P>(3)  On receiving such request as aforesaid from the local authority or the Minister (as the case may be) the Commissioners shall select in <Col N="630" /> accordance with this Act and recommend to the local authority one person for appointment to the said office or shall, if they so think proper, select in accordance with this Act and recommend to the local authority two or more persons for such appointment.</P>
    <P>(4)  On receiving from the Commissioners their recommendation under this section, the local authority shall appoint to the said office the person recommended by the Commissioners or, where more than one person is so recommended, such one of the persons so recommended as they shall think proper.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 6, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 19 the words &ldquo;a person,&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;persons.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill was getting a Second Reading I ventured to express the view that local authorities ought to have received some consideration in the matter of those appointments. While I accepted the principle of competitive examination for public appointments, I was of opinion that the public opinion of the country had not been sufficiently tested, nor had the ability of bodies, recently appointed, been sufficiently canvassed or understood. This Bill suggests that they should be completely deprived of all voice in the appointment of officials and employees.  In my view, in a democratic State the idea should be not to eliminate but to train people, selected by reason of some capacity by the electors of the country, to an intelligent interest in all matters dealing with political and administrative affairs. This Bill, to my mind, completely prevents the local authority from having any voice in the management of officials, and while I have a rather formidable number of amendments to the Bill, I think it will be found they all boil down into this: that the local authority should be associated with the Minister and the Commissioners, so far as they may be, in those matters. In connection with the first two <Col N="631" /> amendments proposed, perhaps I might be allowed to move them together.  If the first amendment is not accepted, it would be impossible to give effect to the amendments I have to subsequent sub-sections of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to try and secure that there will be associated with the Commissioner and the Minister, the Local Authority in the selection of those people.  I do not intend to propose that they should have any real veto on the matter but simply that their opinion should be considered in all those matters of appointments.  It is, of course, evident to each of us that there will be cases of appointments arising in which the local people would be the most competent judges.  They are aware of the capacity, at any rate, of the people in their own neighbourhood.  We all know competitive examination is an ideal thing but we cannot close our eyes to the fact that people may possess all the qualities enabling them to pass competitive examination and yet lack some of the moral and civic qualities which are essential to the discharge of the duties delegated to these officers.</P>

      <P>I think it is certainly <Col N="632" /> admitted that some better system is necessary in order to get the most efficient persons to carry out the duties of the local authorities.  The present system, as those of us with experience of it know, leads to canvassing, and the almost inevitable result that the most efficient candidate is rarely appointed to the vacant post.  The Department of Local Government appreciates that and the section here proposes to remedy that recognised evil in our local administration.  There is a general feeling throughout the country that the present trend of legislation is towards centralisation, that everything is being drawn in, as it were, to central control by the Government.  In a sense, there is a good deal to be said in favour of that, but yet in a community like ours, which has been enjoying certain democratic privileges and retaining in our local parliaments throughout the country local control, a sudden change like this is resented.  I have no fault to find generally with Section 6, but as it limits the request to one person, I think there is something to be said in favour of the amendment.  Section 6 certainly effects this&mdash;that you will have people recommended for the appointments who are efficient.  They may be recommended under heads 1, 2 and 3, but No. 3 will be eligible and efficient in every way.  It has been urged that this final selection should be allowed to a local authority because they may be aware of certain moral or other deficiencies on the part of a candidate.  I think the Civil Service Commissioners, so far as the existing officials are concerned, from whose ranks promotion is generally made, have an accurate record, not only of the intellectual capacity of every official but also of any vicious or other habits that may attach to the officials.  They have sources of information which they are able to tap and they would be able to guarantee in that respect that the man recommended would be suitable.  For the reasons I have given and the reasons given by the mover I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to know how the proposer of this amendment wishes to justify the results of examination.  They will either have to be kept secret or given to the public, <Col N="633" /> and a gradual feeling of injustice will arise if a man who comes first in an examination out of, say, fifty candidates, is refused by the local authority because he has not these local attractions that we hear so much of.  I think the purpose of the Bill is to get over the influence that the local candidate has on the local authorities which stultifies the examination test.  I am not a believer in the efficacy of examination in producing the most perfect officer for executive work.  It is a Chinese system and therefore it has a good deal of authority, but inasmuch as it centralises the working of the Civil Service, I think we will agree the mover of the amendment will have to show how examination results are to be overcome if he gives the local authority power to override those results, inasmuch as the whole scheme is to prevent&mdash;I do not like to call it by a stronger name than &mdash;influence in the country.  I am not sure that this is a practicable suggestion. The result of the examination is one thing and the result of the election locally is another, and those are interests which are opposed.  I cannot support the amendment because I see clearly it hits at the whole scheme of the Government in appointing, as far as the instruments of selection go, the most efficient person for certain posts. Until the mover of the amendment shows how he can override that without opening up again the field of influences that we have been trying to abolish&mdash;in other words, opening up the whole system of corruption again&mdash;I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I adhere to my interpretation.  The Senator binds the two so closely together as to render them hardly distinguishable.  I put it to him as a professional man, if he were appointing an employee, whether he would do it on those abstract judgments or whether he would not be influenced by his personal knowledge of the candidate.  That personal contact <Col N="634" /> is very important, and I think where there are local candidates who are in any way qualified, not necessarily topping an examination and not necessarily judging by Civil Service conditions, those local candidates should be submitted to the local authority.  I think it is very important that there should be intimate and harmonious relations based on knowledge and local association between the local authority and its employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am undoubtedly in favour of the system of competitive examination and have a considerable belief in its efficacy, there are imperfections in everything and there may be imperfections in that.  On the whole, however, I think it is very satisfactory to have competitive examinations.  Also I agree that the system in vogue in the country of canvassing and personal influence ought to be stopped by every means that can be adopted.  Still, Senator Bennett and Senator Kenny have experience of this matter, and I think there is something to be said for what they allege.  I think some allowance should be made in the matter.  Senator Sir John Keane has also pointed out some faults, about which I agree with him, and I think the Minister should accept an amendment to a certain extent modifying the matter&mdash;for instance, if he agreed that the three persons first in the list should be submitted to the local authority and that they should select the one they would prefer, there would be a certain amount of veto with the Minister.  I think that would meet the matter, by gradually bringing the Minister into personal contact with the people of the place and at the same time giving him certain freedom in the matter.  At present, I understand he is not obliged to recommend the person who passes first in the examination.  I should like to know from the Minister whether I am right in that?</P>

      <P>The Senator, for the purpose of his argument&mdash;he is fairly entitled to get the information&mdash; is asking whether under the Bill, as it stands, you would be entitled to reject the man with the highest marks or are you bound to appoint him?</P>

      <P>The Local Commissioners will make the selection by means of a competitive examination or through a selection board.  Under the Bill, they have power to select one man and send him to the local authority for their acceptance, assuming he gets the highest vote.  In a case where there may be three or four candidates with almost equal qualifications, their names are sent down to the local authority for final selection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, in addition to that, the Minister steps in.  I am not <Col N="636" /> sure that he is bound to accept the recommendations of the Commissioners, so really the whole thing is taken away from the local authorities and handed over to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is pursuing his investigation and is asking, have you got any power under the Bill or otherwise to set aside the action of the local authority, if they have agreed to the person recommended by the Commission?  Supposing the Commissioners recommend A.B. for appointment to the local authority and the local authority appoint A.B., has the Minister any power to set aside that?</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>You could not set him aside for subsequent misconduct because it would not have occurred.  Let us quite understand what the Minister states&mdash;that is, that the candidate selected and recommended by the Commissioners to the local authority, if appointed by the local authority, <i>ipso facto</i>, gets the post.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister to look a little further into this, because I was under the impression that the Minister for Local Government had a right of veto for reasons satisfactory to himself in the case of any appointments to a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  It does not arise out of the Bill because the power is there already.  It was not necessary to re-affirm it, and the Bill does not take it away.  It would really seem as if the Minister had&mdash;I <Col N="637" /> am not saying it is not right he should have&mdash;in the case of every local government appointment, a sort of veto on the appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is right that he should have a voice in the matter.  I suggest for the consideration of the House that the Commissioners should send down three names to the local authorities and let them say which they will accept.  I think that would come under Senator Bennett's amendment.  That would give more freedom in the matter than if they were tied down to one person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great difficulty in making up my mind with regard to this amendment.  The weight of evidence is against accepting this amendment because if we accept it, it means if an examination is held, the person who gets the highest number of marks and who should, by right, be appointed, may not be appointed.  If three names are sent to the local authority, someone with a local pull may get the position, thereby doing injustice to the person with the highest marks.  I supported the Bill on the Second Reading because undoubtedly the passing of this Bill will mean that something in the nature of a local Civil Service wil be set up in the country to fill those appointments.  If the Bill is worked as it is intended to be worked, the question of appointments other than for professional men will not arise in a very short time because, if we start with a lower clerical staff and have a system of examination, I hope in a few years' time the highest posts will be filled by promotion because the men who have passed into the Civil Service will have qualified then for the filling of the higher posts. I would imagine that in any test that would be held of a competitive nature for the filling of professional posts the degrees and experience of the candidates <Col N="638" /> would be taken into consideration and that it would not be merely a schoolboy examination.  In the case of the appointment of medical men, there will, I suppose, be a medical man on the Board of Examiners, and experience will be taken into consideration to a greater extent than if it were a boy copyist that was being examined.  On the whole, I think it would be a bad principle to submit three names to the local authority.</P>
      <P>I have fought for the rights of local authorities in this House harder than anybody else, but at the same time I recognise from experience the difficulties with regard to appointments to these higher posts.  I hear people talking about corruption and all that sort of thing.  In many cases the fault was not with the poor man or the poor woman on the board, but with others.  Anything we can do to remove the taint of corruption from local boards we should do.  If we accept the principle of this Bill, I think we cannot accept the amendment.  If we accepted the amendment we would stultify ourselves, because we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that if a local man were third on the list and the names of three or four candidates were sent down to a board in any part of the country, the local man would have sufficient pull to get the position as against the better qualified candidates. We all must recognise that.  For that reason, I think it would vitiate the principle embodied in this Bill if we accepted the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question has been raised as regards the right of the Minister to withhold sanction to appointments.  Under every Local Government Act that I know of the Minister has power to refuse sanction to appointments made by any local authority.  Every appointment was subject to the sanction of the Minister.  I think that is right.  But does anybody imagine for a moment that if the Commissioners held an examination and made a recommendation, which recommendation was acted on by the local authority, that any Minister would have the audacity to refuse sanction to such an appointment?  It would be impossible for a Minister to take up such a position as that.  That <Col N="639" /> argument, I think, is absurd.  The object of the clause in the Local Government Act providing for sanction of the Minister to appointments was, I think, to prevent people being appointed who were not qualified for the position.  The whole weight of argument is against the amendment and I propose to vote against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>The real objection to this amendment is that if it be passed it will reintroduce the very evil it was intended to prevent&mdash;that is, canvassing. I shall not say anything about corruption.  I am perfectly willing to believe that there was no corruption in regard to these appointments.  But there was canvassing.  That was what this Bill was intended to end.  If you pass this amendment and make it compulsory on the Commissioners to send down at least two names, you will reintroduce the old evil of canvassing.</P>
      <P>I should like to explain what, to my mind, is the position of the Commissioners as to recommending the man who gets the highest marks at the examination. In a sense, it is true that he need not get the highest marks, but in another sense it is true that he must. The examination will consist of two parts.  One portion of the examination will be conducted in the ordinary way by means of examination papers.  The names of the candidates will be arranged in order of merit.  The candidates will then go before the Commissioners to see what credit they will receive for other qualifications, such as personality, character, intelligence and so forth.  Very probably the candidate getting the highest number of marks will not get the highest marks in respect of other qualifications.  Another candidate may get marks for other qualifications which will bring him to the top and, in that way, he will have to be recommended as the most suitable.</P>

      <P>The four amendments on the paper have the same purpose&mdash;to compel the Commissioners to submit a panel to the local authority.  Under the Bill as it stands, in cases where there are several candidates, with practically equal qualifications, the Commissioners can, at their discretion, submit those names to the local authority and they can decide which candidate they consider most suitable for the position.  But if those amendments are accepted, it will make it obligatory on the Commissioners to submit two or <Col N="641" /> more names to the local authority.  In the case of an examination, where one man got 100 per cent. and another man 50 per cent., it would leave it open to the local authority to elect the 50 per cent. man.  I do not think that would be desirable or that we should do anything to make such a situation possible. In fact, I feel so strongly on the matter that I should prefer to withdraw the Bill than allow an amendment to go through which would really undermine the whole position.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of examination, what happens in actual practice is that, except in the case of very minor posts, there is an oral as well as a written examination.  Candidates get marks for personality, character and experience.  In many cases, we have had candidates turned down, although they got the highest marks in the written examination, on the ground that in respect of personality and experience they did not come up to the proper standard.  Just at the moment, there is a case engaging attention where an appointment to the office of Secretary to an Agricultural Committee was made by a selection board, who turned down a candidate who had very high theoretical qualifications.  They selected a man who had not qualifications nearly so high, but who had a great deal of practical experience.  When the result of the examination was submitted to the local authority, they refused to accept the decision of the selection board.  I expect that that case will be submitted to me for final decision in a short time. It shows that those selection boards are not entirely composed of theorists.  They deal with these problems in a practical manner&mdash;oftentimes, in a far more practical manner than the local authority.</P>
      <P>There is provision in another section of the Bill for restricting competition to particular areas in certain cases.  In cases where the appointment is not a very important one, it may be considered desirable that the office should be restricted to natives of that area. If the local authority makes such a recommendation to the Commissioners, they can take that into consideration. That preserves a good deal of authority to the local people.</P>

      <P>Senator Gogarty was anxious to know how proper selection could be arrived at and the spirit of competitive examination upheld, if more than one name were sent down to the local authority.  I desire to ask the Senator a question, if I may.  The Minister has explained that, in practice, a selection board considers qualifications other than mere book knowledge. As a result, competitive examination, as such, is sometimes set aside and the other qualifications of the candidate are taken into consideration.  That much has emerged from the Minister's argument. That being the case, I ask the House to consider whether, when it comes to considering personal qualifications&mdash; moral character and so, on&mdash;local opinion should not be consulted.  We have it from the Minister that <i>ab initio</i> competitive examination, as such, is set on one side.  That being so, it is eminently desirable that the names of more than one of the persons who have qualified by competitive examination should be sent down to the local authority, who will have with first-hand knowledge an opportunity of considering the moral and intellectual qualifications of the candidate.  On this question I think the local authorities should be allowed to enter into consultation with the Minister.  For that reason, I think the House will agree that the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; in this section should be deleted and the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; inserted.  When we have done that, we can consider the further ramifications of the Bill and we can limit the number of persons as we desire.</P>
      <P>Senator Brown detailed the system by which examinations would be held. It was a very specious argument but I cannot see anything in the Bill which lays down a flat programme.  It does not state the qualifications which have been alluded to, and I maintain strongly that it is only the local authority that could have full knowledge in regard to these personal qualifications. For these reasons, I ask the House to accept the amendment.  I do not think any reasonable argument has been urged against it.  In course of time, it will be shown that these bodies will have to be consulted if the interests of the country are not to be neglected.</P>

I am in favour of Senator Bennett's amendment, but I do not agree that the construction put upon it by this House is the only construction. The construction put upon it by this House is that the names of the three candidates who secured the highest number of marks should go before the local authority and that from these three candidates the local authority should make a selection. That is not the construction I choose to put upon it.  The construction I prefer to put upon it is that in the examination a standard of qualification would be set.  If one candidate be outstanding, he would more or less set the standard of qualification, and only his name would be submitted by the Local Appointments Commissioners to the local authority.  But in a case where two or three candidates reached a <Col N="644" /> more or less level standard of merit, I think a certain discretionary power should be left to the local authority and that the names of those two or three candidates who had reached a more or less equal standard would be submitted to the local authority, the final decision being left with that body.</P>

      <P>I think there is a distinct difference in what we are driving at.  Sub-section (1) of Section 6 refers to a request by the local authority to the Commissioners.  What Senator Bennett seeks is that the local authority should have power to ask the Commissioners to send down more than one name.  The local authority has only power under the Bill to ask for one name, but the Commissioners <Col N="645" /> have power to send down more than one name if they so choose.</P>

      <P>If that power is to be given, the Seanad must amend sub-section (1) of Section 6 by altering it to read &ldquo;a person or persons&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;a person,&rdquo; because this sub-section seems to limit the power of the local authority, in making a request to the Commissioners, to &ldquo;a person.&rdquo; What the Senators, interested in the amendment under discussion, desire, is to give the local authority power to say to the Commissioners that they would like them to recommend one or more persons for the appointment.</P>

      <P>This proposal strikes at the root of the Bill. This is not a qualifying examination. It is competitive, and not only written but oral.  The Selection Board will take everything into account.  If a man has a bad stutter or a bullying manner, it will be taken into account.  If we are going to leave it to the local authority to choose between two or three candidates, we will revive the whole system of canvassing which the Bill is devised to end.  Even if only two names are submitted to the local authority, we would have canvassing the same as before. It is the aim and object of the Bill to prevent canvassing and the exercise of influence of any kind.</P>

I take it that the Commissioners will not see the candidates but will receive the papers and will find that candidates possess certain literary or other qualifications. I do not think, therefore, that the personal defects which Senator Sir Nugent Everard refers to will be taken into consideration.  They are not a selection board.</P>

      <P>It would leave it with the local authority to decide whether it should be one name or two names.  As the Bill stands, the decision on that point is left to the Commissioners.  They can send down more than one name, if they find that candidates possess fairly equal qualifications.  But if the local authority were given this power, the Commissioners would have no option but to send down a few names, even though one candidate received 90 per cent. and another candidate 50 per cent.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That prevents the local authority from asking that more than one person be recommended but it does not tie the hands of the Commissioners themselves, because, even if they receive no request at all from the local authority, it is still open to them, under Section 6, to send down more than one name.</P>

All it seeks is to give the local authority additional power as regards the request to the Commissioners.  It still leaves under sub-section (3) the option to the Commissioners to recommend one person or more.  It would be absurd to say that they should recommend more than one person if only one person reached the requisite standard.  But I would <Col N="647" /> submit that with the acceptance of this amendment it is not necessary to put it in at all, that really the option is with the Commissioners, and this amendment does not take the option from them.  It really gives the local authorities the privilege of saying: &ldquo;We request you to recommend to us one or more persons.&rdquo;  It does not restrict the powers of the Commissioners in the slightest degree.</P>

      <P>I am not quite so sure about that, and I want to try to see if we can get this thing cleared up and see what is the nett issue before the House.  I think we are wandering away from the matter.  It seems to me that in the Bill as it stands the Commissioners have an absolute discretion of recommending to the local authority a person or several persons.  That is so far as the Commissioners are concerned.  When you come to the local authorities the section itself provides that they shall have power to request the Commissioners to recommend a person, but that does not seem to me to confer any right upon them; it is only a condition precedent to the Commissioners proceeding <Col N="648" /> to hold an examination.  It is practically giving notice to the Commissioners that there is a vacancy to be filled and that they require to have a person appointed to it.  That does not at all entitle them to have a particular person appointed.  The section only gives notice to the Commissioners that there is a vacancy for which a person has to be appointed, and then it goes on to say that the Commissioners, in sending recommendations for that appointment, may send in more than one name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'HANLON Mr. O'HANLON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not still a slight inconsistency?  It is accepted that it is within the powers of the Commissioners to recommend one or more names to the local authority, and is it not logical, when the local authority knows that that is within the powers of the Commissioners, that they should ask for one or more names to be recommended?  That is all I ask, and it is consistent enough.  When they know the Commissioners have the power the local authorities should at least be allowed to ask that one or more names be sent down.</P>

This is in order to please the Seanad.  I think any practical individual would say that it would create a very difficult situation for the Commissioners to put in an arrangement which, if they act in one way, may cause them a great deal of trouble, and in another may do a great deal of harm.

    <P>Whenever a local authority or the Minister requests the Commissioners to recommend a person for appointment to an office to which this Act applies and the Commissioners with the concurrence of the Minister are of opinion that, having regard to the nature of the duties of that office, the knowledge and experience <Col N="654" /> necessary for the efficient performance of those duties, and the qualifications prescribed under this Act for that office, the person or persons to be recommended for appointment to that office cannot be satisfactorily selected by competitive examination, the Commissioners may dispense with the competitive examination required by this Act and may select the person or persons to be recommended by them to the local authority by such means and in such manner as they think proper.</P>

      <P>I am making one more attempt to get some small recognition for the local authorities and their capabilities. Here we come to the question of the appointment of professional persons to posts on the selection of the Commissioners and the Minister.  I would suggest that when they are considering what appointments are to be filled by competitive examination they might take the local authorities into their confidence and consult them.  We have now come to the stage at which a certain appointment may or may not be filled by a competitive examination, and I think that we ought to have consultation between the persons who know best, the Minister, the Commissioners and the local authority, to permit of that being done.</P>

It would leave it in the power of each individual local authority to decide what particular qualifications are of a kind that would necessitate having the appointments made by means of a selection board instead of by examination.  I think that that has been decided from the national point of view.  In the case of those county medical officers, in one instance the county council might be anxious to have the appointment made by means <Col N="655" /> of examination, and in others by means of a selection board.  I do not think that individual local authorities should have any say at all in matters of this kind.</P>

      <P>We have now come to the last section of this very drastic Bill.  We have had local authorities completely snubbed and put into what the Ministry regards as their proper position&mdash;put into, in my opinion, a position of irresponsibility. I am afraid that men of self-respect will, to a large extent, be deterred, in future, from exercising their duties on local authorities.  Having done all this, having completely taken out of the hands of local authorities, any power or any consideration in regard to competitive examinations or appointments, we come to this section which provides for the paying of the piper after the tune has been called. The Commissioners call the tune.  They set up a national system of competitive examination of which Mayo, Kerry, Galway, Limerick, Cork, Clare and Dublin are given equal shares, and having done this they now resort to getting the money.  They say to the local authority, &ldquo;you are worthless as a body but you are very useful as a taxing machine.  You are completely unable to discharge useful functions and you must now pay for the system which we set up.&rdquo;  I maintain that this system is a national one, and, that being so, I do not think that under this Bill funds should be provided by each local unit.  The hope of various parties here was that a system of examination was being developed, and I do not think that they will fail to agree with the view, that under a system which has eliminated their responsibility they should be made to bear the cost.  I do not think it is necessary to go into the merits or demerits of the case and I, accordingly, move the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be very little difference in the end.  If the councils are not asked to pay they will simply overlook what the cost is going to be.  If it is to be put into the general demand note of the Government on the whole community without any real specification, there will be very little about it, whereas, it will keep the local authorities very much in touch with the whole thing if each council has to consider the assessment made upon it.  It will make local bodies look after their affairs carefully when they have to pay the cost.  I think it is better to let it be paid by each county, as, in either event, the share which each citizen will be called upon to pay will be pretty much the same.  Local bodies will know what they are being charged. I do not agree with the statement of Senator Bennett that the only function of county councils is to select members for various posts.  I think there are a great many other things in which these councils have considerable duties to exercise.  I think it would be a great mistake to remove this from amongst the matters which are brought directly under their observation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  According to the provisions of the Bill, a council would have to subscribe to the expenses of this Commission even though they had not a single appointment to make during the year.  All the expenses will be pooled and each county will have to pay in proportion to its rateable valuation, <Col N="658" /> not in proportion to the amount of work which it has put on the Commissioners. According to sub-section (1) the expenses of the Commissioners are to be provided for by moneys voted by the Oireachtas and sanctioned by the Minister for Finance.  I think by that arrangement the expenses of the Commission will fall in a very even manner over the entire Saorstát.  It will have this further advantage, that it is possible that the Civil Service Commission, which holds examinations for all the posts throughout the country, might be amalgamated with these Commissioners, so that there would not be overlapping. In that way expenses might be kept down to a moderate amount.  Instead of having the ratepayers paying this expense, I think it should fall, as provided in sub-section (1) on the taxpayer. It does not make much difference but I think there may be opportunities of preventing the overlapping which I have mentioned by having a regular Civil Service Commission, as they have in other countries, enabling local bodies and Government departments to obtain the best men for their service.</P>

      <P>This is only one further indication of a very vicious principle that is gradually eating into public life, namely, the tendency of the central body to impose regulations, desirable, perhaps, from their detached standpoint, without any demand and against the will of the local authority. There may be cases, for instance, such as the appointment of medical officers of health in which these conditions would be desirable, but in the long run the principle is not desirable.  If, in addition, to having the power to impose these regulations, you also have power to throw all the costs on the local authority, you get back to the principle of taxation without representation, a principle which should be resisted. <Col N="659" /> Local authorities are more and more being made what I may call the marionettes of the central authority, and if, in addition, they have got to pay the costs, you are going to undermine their responsibility, and further aggravate that feeling of discontent which I know is very strong in the country.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of paying the entire costs of these examinations, except when the excess of the costs is over the amount voted by the Central Parliament in respect of this expenditure.  I am sorry that I do not agree with Senator Bennett on the subject.  As I understand it, if there is an excess in that expenditure the local bodies will be made aware of it.  That, I think, would be an advantage as it would focus their attention more directly to the expense involved in carrying out these examinations. If there happens to be a larger amount spent than that allowed for by the Oireachtas it would be up to the ratepayers to ascertain the cause of it.  I think it would tend to increase local interest in regard to these examinations. I desire, also, to say that I do not think that this Bill will make the least difference in regard to people going on local councils.  My own experience on many local bodies was that this question of appointing candidates was an unmitigated nuisance.  There was canvassing from morning till night for all sorts of posts, and any Bill that relieves local representatives of that great nuisance will be of great benefit to the public and of great convenience to themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Sir John Keane's view of this matter is quite right and that it should not be discussed in relation to the profit or loss of the Commissioners in carrying out their duties, but rather in regard to the principle underlying it.  If a loss is made owing to the extra duties of the Commissioners the proposal is that arbitrarily an assessment shall be made over the whole area.  As pointed out by Senator Linehan, bodies which did not benefit at all will be assessed in proportion to their valuation in the <Col N="660" /> same way as the local authorities that called most upon the services of the Commissioners during the financial year.  As another Senator has said, these things pay for themselves by the fees received from applicants.  If there is a profit is there going to be a distribution? The first sub-section of Section 12 provides that the remuneration of the Commissioners shall be paid out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas.  Is the principle of allocation or assessment applied in connection with all other functions and duties, outside this Bill, in connection with the duties performed by the Civil Service Commission? They perform duties affecting every local authority but is there a like assessment made upon them from time to time.  If there is not this is an innovation. If it is an innovation that is well founded it may reasonably be argued that in the case of every Department of State functioning generally, and in the case of various local authorities there should be a proportionate assessment, according to the nature and extent of these functions during the financial year.  That would give rise to complications in auditing and accounting to which no Government would be equal.  I think Senator Sir John Keane put his finger on the spot when he asked whether this was a proper principle, whether it was well founded.  If it is an innovation here I think it deserves the closest examination, and for my part I cannot support it.</P>

      <P>This is really something in the nature of a storm in a teacup, because, as Senator Barrington pointed out, the receipts will probably cover the cost of administration.  As regards the point about an innovation of principle, we have a precedent in the case of the Combined Purchasing Act.  I think the whole matter depends on the question whether the Bill is in the interests of local authorities or not. Practically every Senator has expressed the view that, taken as a whole, the Bill will be of benefit to local authorities. That seems to be the general view and, if that is the case, I think it is up to local authorities to pay for it. I do not see why it should be made a charge on the central fund.  I do not <Col N="661" /> think that we are making any imposition on them in asking them to pay <Col N="662" /> for something that is going to be to their own advantage.</P>

Prior to that date there was in existence in the building, recently vacated on the west side of Stephen's Green, an institution which was known as the Museum of Irish Industry and the Government School of Science Applied to Mining and the Arts.  That older institution which had been doing somewhat similar work came to an end in 1865, and under a Treasury minute of that year, the College of Science was established. The purposes for which the College of Science was established were these: It was intended to give instruction and to give diplomas or associateships or degrees in subjects which, at that time, were not taught in the practical way in universities in which they ought to have been taught for practical purposes. The main object of the institution of the College of Science was, however, to teach and give diplomas or associateships to a very large number of students in this country, who either had not the time to go through a university course, in addition to their professional course, or who had not the means to go to a university.  It was, therefore, founded mainly for the purpose of providing the youth of this country, who could not afford either the time or the money to go to a university, with the highest possible form <Col N="664" /> of technical education and to give them those associateships as a hall-mark of qualifications in their professional work.</P>
    <P>It had three faculties&mdash;a faculty of agriculture, a faculty of applied chemistry, and a faculty of engineering, which included mechanical and electrical engineering.  It had two other courses which they did not call faculties&mdash;an economic and industrial course and a course for science teachers.  That is, there were three faculties and two courses, or five sets of subjects in which the students could obtain teaching and a diploma or associateship. The College of Science was successful from the very first.  In the report of a Commission on science and art in Ireland, in 1869, the members of which included Professor Huxley and the late Professor Haughton, of Trinity College, it is stated: &ldquo;In the Royal College of Science, Ireland possesses an institution which, in the number of its professorships and in the general course of study, is more complete as a pure school of science than anything of the kind in either England or Scotland.&rdquo;  The average number of students in the College of Science over the sixty odd years in which it has been in existence was something about two hundred.  They were nearly all non-university students.  There was a practice, and there still is, or rather has been a practice for Trinity College to send a small number of students to the College of Science for a kind of post-graduate course in practical work by means of the equipment which they have not got at Trinity.  I believe that the number of students in Trinity College for that purpose was never very great.  It varied from ten to five or six.  I think there was a similar practice in the old Royal University and in its successor, the National University, of doing the same kind of thing in a small way. It may be taken for granted that the great bulk, a hundred and sixty out of two hundred students, were non-university men, who either could not spare the time or had not got the money to go through a long university course.  The College of Science was, therefore, fulfilling an absolutely essential <Col N="665" /> function in this country, not fulfilled, and not capable of being fulfilled, by the universities, and it was doing it well.  What does the Government propose to do with this institution under this Bill?  They are perfectly frank about it.  In fact, the one thing that I like about the attitude of the Government in introducing this Bill is their perfect frankness.  They are going by this Bill to put an end to the College of Science and to hand over its buildings, its equipment, and its money to increase the endowment of a university which, unfortunately, as we have got to admit, is very poor.</P>
    <P>Now, really a more shameless proceeding never was effected by an Act of Parliament.  What provision do they propose to make for 150 or more non-university students who have been using this institution for their professional education?  Absolutely none. Now the object of my amendment is that when this institution, with its buildings, its wonderful equipment and the money which is used to keep it going are handed over to the National University, that they should provide for those non-university students who are now cast out into the world without any means of getting what they got before, and that they should provide for them similar teaching, similar diplomas and similar hallmarks when they go out into the world as were provided for them by the College of Science.  I ask the Seanad to put in the provision that the demise in the lease that is to be made under sub-section (1) of Section 1 of this Bill shall not take effect and shall not operate at all until the National University of Ireland and University College, Dublin, acting together, provide the means and make adequate provision for teaching students who have not matriculated in the university the subjects hitherto taught in the College of Science and grant them the same diplomas, associateships, or whatever you like to call them.  Surely if ever there was a case in which there was justice and fair play on the side of an amendment then this is one, and I earnestly hope the Seanad will support it.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that in these matters there is always a certain amount of jealousy raised against the National University, and therefore I am not inclined to support this amendment in its present shape.  If Senator Brown had said that the National University be instructed, say, to supply facilities for the students who previously attended the College of Science, I would be inclined to back him, but when he says that this is not to happen until such and such other things happen, I do not think the amendment is one that I would like to support.  Several statements were made by the Senator which I do not think are in accordance with my views.  For instance, one of his main points was that the College of Science was a separate institution and should be a separate institution because it gave certain facilities to students who were not and cannot be members of a University.  The College of Science at South Kensington, which I know pretty well is connected with London Uni-University in much the same way that it is proposed to connect the present College of Science with the National University of Ireland.  I see no difficulty whatever in that.</P>

      <P>I presume that the University authorities will continue to teach in the College of Science as heretofore. Everything, I imagine, will be the same except that instead of having two separate institutions you will have the two united under one authority. I really do not see much in the point that the Senator has made.  Another point that the Senator made was that the students he refers to will not have time to attend the University.  They attend the College of Science now and <Col N="667" /> they will have to attend in the same way under the proposed new arrangement. As a matter of fact, I believe the course runs for a period of five years.</P>

      <P>In any event, it does not make much difference whether the course runs for four or five years. I do not see very much in this point about the time that the students will have to give in attending the courses at the University.  They have to give the same time attending the courses in the College of Science.  I agree that those who have passed certain examinations and who have got certain qualifications should, in the future, be given whatever facilities were afforded to them in the past.</P>

      <P>One could have a good deal of sympathy with the views expressed by Senator Brown, but this point is not quite new.  I am rather surprised that no practical proposals have been initiated by any section, either in the Dáil or in the Seanad, with regard to this matter since three years ago, when the College of Science was practically wiped out.  In a speech made in the Dáil by one of the Ministers, I cannot recall which, there was some such scheme forecasted some time ago as is now incorporated in this Bill. The matter was discussed sympathetically by the Senate of the University. The desire was expressed on the part of the University to continue, as far as they possibly could, the usefulness of the work hitherto done by the College of Science.  The National University being a poor university, and what I might call a popular one, wishes to attract to itself all the students that it possibly can.  Evidence of its usefulness to students of the class who previously went to the College of Science will probably be shown in the development of the Shannon scheme. It will be the duty of the university to educate those students and to fit them with the qualifications which they ought to have.  Any fundamental mandatory powers put into this Bill as against the National University would. <Col N="668" /> have the tendency to cause delay and to interrupt the usefulness of such courses of study as were given in the College of Science.  If such powers were given in the Bill they would probably have the effect of compelling the university to alter its statutes.  That would only delay the carrying on of the kind of work that was done by the College of Science to a later date than is forecasted in this Bill.  I think it may safely be left to the educational and the university authorities concerned to provide such teaching as is necessary for these students.</P>
      <P>If the amendment were carried I do not think it would affect University College, Cork.  The authorities of University College, Cork, have forecasted the provision of certain courses for those who propose to take up creamery management.  Intending students for this course have already entered on their preliminary courses of study, and perhaps if this amendment were accepted they might be delayed in following their course.  The amendment, however, probably does not affect University College, Cork, but I have no doubt that University College, Dublin, has also made suitable arrangement for its students.  If the amendment were accepted the efforts of the students attending University College, Dublin, for a year or more would be nullified.  Nobody denies for a moment the extremely useful nature of the education that was given in the College of Science.  Unfortunately, most of its students, more than two-thirds&mdash;I think I would be right in saying three-fourths of them &mdash;went abroad.  I think there was only one student in the Agricultural Faculty who ever qualified for an associateship. The College of Science was established in the year 1865.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read the report of Professor Huxley and of his fellow professors who visited the College in 1869.  Since then technical schools have been established all over the country.  Senator Brown gave us no idea as to how far the universities were prepared to give assistance in the training of teachers for technical schools.  As regards University College, Cork, it almost strained its statutes to permit certain classes of students to take lectures at the technical <Col N="669" /> schools.  These lectures were recognised by the university authorities. I am sure that what was done in Cork will also be done in Dublin as the necessity arises.  I ask the House not to hold up or delay this Bill or to put any restrictions on the university authorities which would tie their hands. I am perfectly certain that they are only too willing to agree to do whatever is necessary to be done for the educational advancement of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>If one were to support Senator Brown in the case he has made there is one result that would arise which, I think, the House has not yet had brought to its notice.  That is, that if there is any delay in this matter there will be no College of Science at all, because the grant in support of it will fall through and there will have to be another vote of moneys made. Senator Brown's arguments would be unanswerable if the proposal of the Government was to abolish the College of Science.  That would be a distinct hardship on certain classes of students who take advantage of the college.  If, as has been stated, 200 students were each year to be deprived of any education in technical science, certainly that would be a hardship.  I suggest that the adoption of the Senator's amendment would result in the abolition of the College of Science, because it would prevent its merging in a more adequate body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The College of Science has been a bone of contention for many years with the other universities.  Trinity College, by the way has not as broad a curriculum as the National University, however deep, intense and excellent it may be.  There are certain faculties in the National which are not in Trinity.  For instance, there is architecture.  When the College of Science becomes merged in the National University it will thereby broaden its curriculum.  Take the case of a student doing a four years' course and already in his second year, he can easily get <i>ad eundem</i> credit in the National University for the time he has done without losing a term.  His associateship will be lost if this amendment is carried.  The only <Col N="670" /> hardship as far as I can see is about the fees.  If the qualifications in specified scientific pursuits, such as chemistry and agricultural science which are outside the three that Senator Brown's amendment provides for were to cost more it would be a hardship, but if they were only to cost as much as the National University students pay, instead of an associateship you will have a far better type of education and a better degree.  I am not sure that very much is gained by a course of science for people who have not had the advantage of a course at the university. You usually produce a scientific pedant.  The university is not an arbitrary class distinction.  It is a necessary method of making the diploma useful; that is to say that a man who is to become a scientist must be an educated person, and surely a university is not an extraordinary or an unreachable career, particularly in the National University.  I think that the sooner the National University, which will have to get an increased grant in the long run, is linked up the better.  The College of Science by becoming merged in the National University will be greater than if it were to stay on as it is at present.  This is a matter that should not be delayed. The acceptance of Senator Brown's amendment would mean delay.  I believe that when the College of Science becomes a part of the National University it will mean a broadened endowment, that it will be better for the country and for all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to give my strong support to Senator Brown's amendment.  I should like to remove the idea given expression to by my friend Senator Colonel Moore. He said that this amendment was calculated to arouse a feeling of jealousy towards the National University.  I should like to assure him that I do not believe there is the slightest shred of evidence for that idea, nor do I believe there is the slightest chance of such a feeling being aroused.  As far as I am concerned I would be equally opposed to the College of Science being merged in Trinity College.  The reason why I take up that attitude is <Col N="671" /> because I believe that in the case of the great majority of the 200 students who attended and availed of the education given by the College of Science their ordinary business and the education they had previously received would be incompatible with a university course.  I have known a great many of these young men, having met some of them in my own employment. I may say that it was a common rule that when a young man became an apprentice at Inchicore he was required to take out a course at the College of Science or at a technical institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great bulk of them took the course at the College of Science. Why?  Because they had neither the funds nor the time to go through a university course, two considerations which in their case were very important. A young man engaged in mechanical engineering, which calls very largely for physical exercise as well as mental training, has not the time to pursue the course of study that it would be necessary for him to pursue if he were following a university course, and going in for a university diploma.  For instance, he does not want to spend his time learning languages, however desirable that may be.  Senator Gogarty of course has told us that the standard of education should be raised and enlarged. The training that such a young man got in the College of Science, because of his previous experience as well as the career he aimed to follow in the future, suited him exactly.  If he were to go through a university course it would mean a waste of time and money for him.  The College of Science was established by the British Government and the present Government has inherited it.  They got an immense amount of equipment with the college as well as the funds that were provided by the British Government. To take these funds away from the class of young man that I have been speaking of, and to apply them to the purpose of bolstering up the funds of the National University, which we all regret are insufficient, would, to my mind, do a serious injury <Col N="672" /> not only to these young men, but to the country at large.  I hope before the College of Science is transferred to the National University that the latter will have to afford&mdash; and this is all the amendment asks&mdash; the same facilities to those young men in the future which they enjoyed in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'HANLON Mr. O'HANLON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Barrington says that the ordinary run of life of some of our young people would be incompatible with a university course. That assumes that University College, Dublin, will not make provision for non-matriculated students in certain courses in the university.  I submit that that is an assumption for which there is no basis in fact.  I think, and I have reason to believe, that the National University will invite the type of student who will take a course say, in science, engineering, applied chemistry and the natural sciences.  I take it that the university will invite that type of student.  What Senator Brown asks is, not that the National University should invite that type of student&mdash;and this is the point I object to in his amendment&mdash;but that the non-matriculated student of the National University should be eligible for a university diploma, or associateship. I think the Senator's case would be met quite properly and fully if students of that type who attended courses in science, engineering, applied chemistry and the natural sciences, on attaining a certain proficiency and on giving a certain attendance at the specified courses in the university, were then given a certificate.  I think that would meet the case sufficiently well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is somewhat unfair that a scheme of this kind for which the country has been asking&mdash;the type of constructive legislation that is evidenced in this Bill, for which I might say the agricultural community in particular has been calling and asking for quite a considerable time so that the educational interests of this country might be brought into keeping with the requirements of the people in their ordinary avocations&mdash; should be held up because the university might not grant a diploma or <Col N="673" /> an associateship to a student who had not even matriculated or pursued any of the courses in the university.  I think the case would be met fully if the National University did undertake, or even if the Minister was in a position to say that he believed it would undertake, to provide the facilities already provided in the College of Science, to enable those students to take a course in special subjects, and afterwards to grant to them a university certificate as regards the subjects in which they had specialised.  We do not want the university to cater for aspirants to the high standard degree or the low standard associateship, but we want a high standard maintained all round. We hope that the faculty of agriculture in University College, Dublin, will now get a better endowment and that it will be provided with greater facilities on merging with the College of Science, and that it will exercise a greater influence than ever; that it will raise to a higher standard than ever it alone, or the College of Science, could aspire to.  We hope it will aim to keep the standard in that faculty high.  We hope, too, that the faculty of agriculture in the National University will soon come to be looked upon as high as the faculty of agriculture in any university in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMESON</NameTxt>
      <P>A great many of us quite agree with Senator O'Hanlon's remarks.  I think, however, that in what he has said he has rather confused the point at issue.  He is really an advocate in what he has said of the policy which Senator Brown's amendment aims at.  Those of us who agree with Senator Brown do not wish in the slightest way to interfere with the parts of the Bill that deal with agriculture. I think it is quite wrong to mix up subjects that have nothing whatever to do with what this amendment aims at.  The amendment deals with one particular class of student, who has not got either the time or the money to matriculate in the university.  I think the whole Seanad will agree with the remarks made in favour of the amendment. Nothing has been said to show that the case made for it is not a perfectly just <Col N="674" /> one for the Seanad to deal with.  I am prepared to go a long way to support the remarks of Senator O'Hanlon, but I believe he is driving at the very same thing as Senator Brown.  I think that the Seanad, before it passes this Bill, should take care to have a clause inserted making it necessary for the National University to provide all the arrangements suitable for the class of students who availed of the College of Science heretofore.  That is the whole thing in a nutshell.</P>
      <P>At present there is nothing in the Bill to that effect.  It may be perfectly true that the authorities of the National University may make all those arrangements. It is one thing to have the matter unmentioned and entirely at the mercy of the authorities of that university, but it is quite another thing for the Seanad to indicate its belief that the arrangements that obtained heretofore for the 150 or 200 students who attended the College of Science and took out their degrees there, should be made available for that type of student under the proposed new scheme that we are now discussing.  That is what Senator Brown's amendment aims at. The question of delay has been mentioned. I think the whole Seanad agrees that a Bill of this kind, shot at us in this way and when we may be told that if we do not pass it or interfere with it, we will be holding up the financial settlements of the country, is just one more instance to prove what I think many of us hold, that the Seanad is not being properly treated. We all want time to debate a Bill of this kind, and we should not be hurried. I think Senator Dowdall is right in what he said.  If the Seanad carries the amendment, then, of course, we are going to hold up a whole lot of things which we all want to go on.  I wonder if the situation could be met by leaving out the section that holds up the demise, and by passing a resolution making it compulsory on the National University to provide such arrangements as will meet the needs of students who cannot afford to matriculate or follow a university course.  I think everyone agrees that there is that class of individual in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we should allow a Bill <Col N="675" /> of this class to pass without doing our best to see that the needs of that part of the community are as well supplied under the new arrangement as they were under the old.  I am in agreement with Senator Dowdall when he says that the diplomas were used by Irishmen who went abroad afterwards. I believe, as regards our systems of university and scientific education that we should aim to give the freest and the best that can be provided so as to enable our young men to compete for situations they may offer outside of the State.  We have lots of clever young people in the Free State and it ought to be our care to see that educationally they are as well equipped as the youth of any other country in the world.  I think that in this case we should stand by the poor young people who in the past availed of the opportunities given by the College of Science.  I believe that could be done without any of the interference which some Senators who are opposed to the amendment seem to think would take place.  I think it would be wise for the Seanad to insist that a clause would be inserted in the Bill making it necessary for the National University to provide this kind of education and not to compel these young men to matriculate and go in for a full university course. I ask the Minister seriously to consider whether he could not make a regulation to meet the case of Senator Brown's amendment.</P>

      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy both with those who are in favour of the amendment and those who are against it.  This is not the first time that this question has been debated.  I recollect that before the War some conferences were held on this very subject.  As Senator Jameson has said, it was then suggested that a university course was not necessary for students who proposed to go to the College of Science, as their people could not bear the cost of sending them to the University.  The matter was allowed to remain in abeyance and nothing was done.  The question has now suddenly cropped up, and I imagine that the circumstances <Col N="676" /> of the last few years have obliged the Government to bring it forward.  I approve strongly of the idea that any young man who passes through the College of Science should have matriculated and taken a university course. Unless he has had a good general education he cannot be expected to take full advantage of the science course at the College of Science.  If, amongst the farmers of Ireland, there was the same keenness for university education that there is amongst the farmers of Scotland then the idea of doing something that would release a student from the necessity of pursuing a university course would be laughed at.  The whole idea of a university course is to fit a man for any walk in life.  There is the desire amongst the farmers now that their sons should go through a university course.  I do not know whether the Minister could see his way to agree to a provision to the effect that after a certain period these diplomas would be given without insisting on matriculation in the case of the students.</P>

      <P>I regret that I shall have to oppose this amendment.  The Bill makes for greater efficiency in the case of the National University of Ireland. The only reason I can see for the amendment is that its supporters fear that the National University of Ireland is not ready to provide the means of education which they believe to be essential in the interests of the community.  I have not that fear, and I am perfectly satisfied that the National University without any amendment such as this will arrange for courses of instruction such as have been adumbrated by Senator Jameson and other Senators.  I suggest that it would not be wise for us to hold up a scheme which makes for the greater efficiency of the National University. It would mean delay if we were to agree to this amendment and I do not think we should agree to that.  For some time I was associated myself with the authorities of University College, Cork.  When an appeal was made to them they agreed to make arrangements for an extensive course of extern lectures.  I am sure that something of <Col N="677" /> the same nature will be done by the National University.</P>

      <P>The amendment, in whatever form it is before the House, is one thing, but the assumption that underlies the whole thing is another, and it is with that <Col N="678" /> assumption I would like to deal here. That the College of Science as a separate institution is no longer going to exist is absolutely determined.  I do not think anybody can stop that.  Payment of funds will lapse in regard to the College of Science in September, and unless these moneys are renewed the College of Science, even in the limited way it has been carrying on, will lapse.  It has been carrying on for three years in a semi-dying condition, with 50 per cent. of its professorial staff vacant and with a large number of the assistants also away from their work.  But because the College is no longer going to exist as a separate institution there seems to be an assumption that there were courses in the College of Science which are to be no longer available for the class of students who attended the College of Science.  I do not think anybody who has taken the trouble to go through the statutes of the National University and the courses provided by University College and taken these in conjunction with the new arrangements under the Bill in regard to agriculture, can have the slightest doubt that what I have said is accurate in every respect. There is going to be no point in which provision was made for a student heretofore at the College of Science in which he will be defeated under the new arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be misapprehension here regarding that and there has been a great deal of talk upon it.  Senator Jameson founded his case entirely on one phrase&mdash;the poor student who cannot attend the University.  Senator Brown and Senator Barrington added to that a reference to the student who had neither the time nor money to attend a University course.  The phrase crept into Senator Jameson's remarks, which I am not interpreting literally, when he referred to the student who has neither the time nor money to matriculate.  Anybody who has gone for matriculation, as I did, knows that neither the time nor money spent on matriculation need cause any worry, but I am interpreting the Senator's remarks as meaning the time and money spent in obtaining a degree.  That is an entire fallacy with regard to the <Col N="679" /> College of Science.  Actually, if you compare the courses, the graduate course is a three years' course.  The course for a diploma for the associateship was a four years' course.  There was a shorter course in agricultural science and rural economy set up, and no student ever availed of it in the history of the College of Science.</P>

      <P>No.  The Senator is alluding to the creamery management course.  One student qualified in that course, and he afterwards went to South Africa.  There might be a fallacy in assuming that there were as many hours work put into a University course as used to be put into the College of Science course.  I came here to meet the objection that all students who are put through the mill of the College of Science courses have to attend at the laboratory, whereas the University students might be doing the <i>dilettanti</i> about town until three or four weeks before an examination and then pursue a period of cram under a coach to pass the examination.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that anybody has made the statement that the courses in the College of Science were availed of by people who had not time to go to the university, seeing that if they had gone to the university they would have wiped out a year's course completely as compared with the College of Science course.  A student would not have to attend in a university anything like the number of lectures he would have to attend in the College of Science in any year.  In addition, there were laboratory courses insisted on in the College of Science, whereas, in the University College, they were not insisted son to the same degree, but that has been tightened up now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The College of Science fees are at the pre-war rate, and they were not raised for the reason that it was known arrangements were likely to be made in regard to the College, and it was not thought desirable to attack the question of fees.  If you compare the fees for the College of Science courses with the fees for similar courses in the University College, pre-war, the College of <Col N="680" /> Science courses were much dearer, but the university course is now much dearer than that of the College of Science.  In University College there has been at least 70 per cent. of an advance in college fees on the pre-war rates.  It will cost a student no more to-day to take out a three years' course in the university than it cost a student of the College of Science to take out a four years' course.  If you take a year off the College of Science course, and if you take the old scale of fees the University College student paid for three years, and equate that, the College of Science student had to pay only three-fourths of the amount of fees to be on an equality so far as fees are concerned.  So the argument about the poor student who cannot attend the university courses goes by the board.  My statements are accurate and we can prove their accuracy by taking the hours required for attendance at lectures, the subjects, the fees and comparing them with those in the National University.  The College of Science fees are pre-war fees and have not been raised because it was known that new arrangements were to be made with regard to the College, and it was not thought fit to tackle the question of fees.  The British Government gave notice before they left the country that it was their intention to deal with the fees question and the Minister for Finance also gave notice of that.</P>

      <P>Whatever they spent on the College of Science course I should say that less time and less money would be spent on the university course, and they will get the same courses at the university which will lead them towards a double degree if they care to add on certain subjects. With regard to the time and money, let me make this point as to the work of the College of Science: Senator Brown has quoted from the 1869 report, <Col N="681" /> which was rather carefully drafted.  It says that: &ldquo;In the College of Science, in Ireland, I saw an institution which, in the number of its professorships and the general courses of study, is a more complete and pure school of science than anything existing in England or Scotland.&rdquo;  In fact, I may say the British Government, before they left, gave notice that they were going to see that the restaffing was put on a better basis.  They had too large a staff of professors for the work done.  I am not denying the excellence or the diligence of the work done by the professors of that college, but I think when you compare the number of the staff with the number of students who attended the courses, that nobody could have stood for the existence of the system.</P>
      <P>I remember, in the Dáil, making the statement that if you added on the 19 charwomen to the staff that the staff numbers would be equal to the number of students attending the College in any one year.  They ran into 100, and if you took out the charwomen the staff numbered only 19 less than the number of students.  I do not know where Senator Brown got his figures. I had the figures worked out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I took it up and I gave the numbers for a certain period of years, for some of which there were undoubtedly ex-officers and ex-soldiers who had got grants to enable them to take out courses in the College of Science, and at one time it could be said there were 100 occasional students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated that there was an average of 200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The word average was used, but I queried it and when I got the figures in detail I was able to prove my statement, which was that leaving out the post-war years and the ex-soldiers who were on special grants the average number of students was less than 100.  I urge one thing as a proof of that, and that is the old calendar of the college <Col N="682" /> which gives at the end the holders of the diploma and associateship up to date.  That list includes people who have gone abroad and who have died, so it actually includes everybody who has got a diploma or an associateship. The total number of diplomas and associateships given since the foundation of the college is about 750.  If we had an average of 200 students for a period of 60 years, and if we consider that those who advanced to the diploma or associateship would number at least 50 per cent. of the students who attended the college courses, there should have been more than 750.  That was the total number granted by the college in that period, though there were certain people thrown in to swell the total.  They used to be described as those who attended the jerry-built summer courses, courses that were given when experimental science became the rage here. People were hurried up to attend these courses when they should have been recuperating on their vacation. Teachers were put through a three or four weeks' course of experimental science sufficient to get them a year ahead of their pupils, and in three or four years they got sufficient knowledge to enable them to become experimental science lecturers or teachers.  Adding these people, I cannot see where you get the average of 200 for the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Brown has referred to the five faculties as set out in the syllabus. The fourth faculty is an economic and industrial course.  The particular syllabus I have is not very up-to-date. The economic and industrial course started somewhere about the last two years of the proper existence of the college and no student ever took it. There was a shorter course for the associateship in agricultural science and rural economy, and no student ever took it.  This particular examination Senator Dowdall referred to with regard to creamery management was taken by one student only, who afterwards cleared off to another country, but I believe he has returned since. There were also courses for engineering and agriculture, and what is called applied science.  This Bill is backed by <Col N="683" /> the Minister for Education, who has assented to the proposition that the educational facilities granted in any country will be granted here.  One would not expect he would approve of a Bill which took away from one class of students the educational facilities hitherto granted to them, and he is in favour of this Bill for the reason that if you take the three big courses, engineering, agricultural and applied sciences, they are all better provided for in the new system than they were in the old.  Can anyone deny that agriculture is not going to be better dealt with under the new system?  I do not think there is any disagreement on that, and that in the new arrangements made in Cork and Dublin there is much better attention to be paid to students who desire to get instruction on the scientific aspects of agriculture than they received before.</P>
    <P>The engineering student will in future be able to get a course in which he can have not merely what he used to have&mdash;electrical and mechanical engineering, but there will be electrical, mechanical and civil engineering in one faculty now, a proper university faculty, and that will be open to the student who wants to take a scientific course in engineering.  I put it that chemistry and physics are much the same no matter where they are taught If anything, you are going to get a better course in chemistry and physics when you have teachers of pure science and special lecturers in applied science all grouped in the same institution, and courses scheduled out.  In regard to the professors who are there, and the lectures which may be given to students, there is not the slightest doubt that anybody who looks at the new arrangement will see that as far as simple provision is concerned there is going to be much more provision than there was before for students who are going to take out courses in agricultural, engineering or applied sciences.  With regard to associate students, there used to be three classes of students in the College of Science. There were associate students who were prepared for the ordinary diploma or associateship in the College of <Col N="684" /> Science, and there was a shorter course leading towards the diploma associateship in agricultural science and rural economy, and there were what are known as associate students.  The second class we may drop out, for though the courses were there nobody availed of the opportunities given.</P>
    <P>Associate students had to do a four years' course, pay fees, and pass an examination every term.  These were non-associate students, which means this: that a student of good repute could come into the professor's classroom, plot out his own course, go before certain professors, get entered in the roll, attend classes, and at the end of the year after passing an examination he could get from the professor or group of professors a certificate for attending those lectures, and also possibly a certificate of proficiency in regard to the lectures.  These two classes will have to be catered for under the new system.  There will have to be a distinction made with regard to the associateship. When I have to put to myself the problem, Are the associates going to be catered for as in the past?&mdash;I have again to make this division of classes:&mdash;First, students who five years hence would be attending at the College of Science, if it existed, would be the first class; secondly, those who have entered on courses of study ordinarily leading to a diploma of associateship now going through the University; and thirdly, people who years ago obtained a diploma of associateship on which they would build afterwards to proceed to a Fellowship in the College of Science.</P>
    <P>These are the three classes that fall for consideration here.  I will take them in their reverse order.  The associateship diploma could be taken as a foundation for gaining the higher title of Fellow.  That type of student will be better catered for in the University system.  There is an allowance made for that in the statutes of the University. With regard to the higher degree Statute 8 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The University may grant the following higher degrees ... to students, whether matriculated students of this University, or non-matriculated <Col N="685" /> students who, without having been previously admitted to the primary degree in any faculty in this University shall have carried on under conditions prescribed by regulations, independent research in the University, or a constituent college and shall have fulfilled all other prescribed conditions.&rdquo;  Then there follow the degrees: in the faculty of science, Master of Science; agricultural science, Master of Science and Doctor of Science; in engineering, Master of Engineering, and in commerce, Master of Commerce.  The original Statute A of the University dealt with the conditions as to granting degrees to students.  It may be the object there that the student could previously have got the Fellowship of the College by submitting a thesis or a dissertation which would meet with the approval of the Council or for original published work, which contributed in a marked degree to the advance of science.  There is sufficient room within that to have Associateship taken as a foundation for the granting for cause or merit shown of something higher which will correspond to the Fellowship of the College of Science.  There will be no longer that title given to it. There will be a university degree of Master of Science or something of that sort open to students who are now associates and who need not be admitted to the primary degree of the National University before proceeding to the higher degree.  And, in conversation, the President of University College, Dublin, told me that arrangements would be perfected for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Students who, some years ago, entered for the associateship of the College of Science and have been carrying on their work for the last couple of years, more or less under the auspices of University College, Dublin, are in this position that they will proceed to either of two things&mdash; an associateship, if they want it, which up to the past year has been granted under the authority of the Department of Education, or to a degree granted by the university authorities on the results of the course and examination held there.  In the transitional stage, most of those <Col N="686" /> people were scholarship holders and were warned that changes would have to be made and they took their scholarships subject to those conditions. Most of those are taking courses which will lead to the old associateship or to an equivalent degree in the university.  We have the third class of student who might have been five years hence attending a course leading to a diploma of associateship. That student will have to become a student of the university.  I hold he ought to become a student of the university.  The argument, with regard to time and money, having disappeared, I do not know what else there is to deal with.  If it has not disappeared, I can argue further on that when the difficulties present themselves.  If it is a fact that it is as cheap, and entails no greater call on the students' leisure than would be entailed in a university in getting a degree, then I hold that the time and money argument is gone.  If the point is about matriculation, I think that should be faced quite openly.  The student going on for a diploma of associateship in the College of Science had to pass a qualifying examination and that was of matriculation standard.</P>

      <P>There was a requirement with regard to compulsory subjects.  There was English, I think there was mathematics, and there was, I am pretty certain, although I speak with more diffidence of it, the question of another language.  I am pretty certain <Col N="687" /> there were three compulsory subjects for the qualifying examination of the old College of Science.  There was mathematics, there was English and another language.  There is outside this the question of compulsory Irish, and let it be understood that the Minister for Education had, at any moment, if the College of Science were continued as a separate institution, the right to put in Irish as a compulsory subject for entrance as it is in matriculation. With the general tendency of this country, there is not the slightest doubt that if the College of Science lasted as a separate institution, Irish would have been necessary, and Irish would become a definite, essential element of the entrance examination for the College of Science.  The subjects for the entrance examination, as detailed here for the associateship students entrance examination, 1924, are: (1) Irish or English, (2) Mathematics, (3) one of the following, not having been selected under (1): Irish, Greek, Latin, French or German.  So that a student had to select Mathematics, English or Irish under (1), and under (3) some language.  These were the arrangements as laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When people talk of carrying on the College of Science under the old conditions, it ought to be remembered that those conditions were not unchangeable. They could have been changed pretty well at any moment.  In the old days there was a Council and it was supposed to be on the advice of the Council that changes were made.  The Council had very little to say on that. It was a question of the Department in the old days, and at present responsibility lies with the Minister for Education. With regard to the associateship, if it is thought fit by the University to allow diplomas to be granted to those people without matriculating, there is power to do that.  I myself, speaking now as a member of the Senate of the National University, would urge very strongly against any such thing being done and would insist that people who previously took the course for the diploma of associate should, for the future, become University students in the ordinary <Col N="688" /> way, passing the matriculation examination. But there is provision made for the other matter.  Statute 3, Chap. 48 of the University speaks of academic distinctions other than degrees, and 3 (a) answers this amendment, and, in part, Senator O'Hanlon's next amendment.  It sets out that diplomas may be granted in certain subjects, including applied science, education, architecture, journalism, and agriculture, to students who, although they may not have matriculated, shall have completed the course of study prescribed by the University....</P>
    <P>So, if it seems good that students should be allowed, without matriculating, to proceed to something called a diploma, the University statutes have already made provision for diplomas being granted to non-matriculated students in the two matters that count as far as this debate is concerned&mdash; applied science and agriculture.</P>
    <P>I was prepared to speak on the amendment as it stood and to advert to the terms, but as the terms have been changed I am not referring specially to these.  What actually this amendment amounts to is, that it continues the College of Science, sort of within University College, Dublin, and it stereotypes for ever courses that happen to have been in operation at a particular date.  My answer to that is that there is, definitely and clearly, provision made for any student in any of the subjects he used to take out, but it is not being made as it would be by the insertion of an amendment such as this.  You are not setting up this position&mdash;that you stereotype for all time certain examinations and courses which happened to be grouped in a particular way just when this change happened.</P>
    <P>Senator Barrington referred to Inchicore students who used to come to the College of Science.  Pretty well all of them used to come before the technical schools were established on their present basis.  Hardly a single Inchicore student lately has gone near the College of Science.  Even in the five years preceding the war, they all went to the Bolton Street Technical Schools. Senator Brown was very frank.  The dissolution of the College of Science, we <Col N="689" /> were told, was undertaken in order to do good to the National University. That is undoubtedly the wrong way to look at it.  I detailed the steps along which the Government proceeded to this when speaking in the Dáil two years ago.  The steps were:&mdash;(1) There was and could be no case made for the continuance of the College of Science as a separate institution, as it was an unnecessary duplication and reduplication of other institutions.  (2) For the better carrying on of the work which used to be done in the College of Science amalgamation with a university was essential.  Co-incident with that&mdash;those two points being established&mdash;there came forward this point that there was a certain university college that was left badly off financially, and was definitely embarrassed by a debt and by the provision of buildings.  It was seen that by the amalgamation of the two institutions the first two points with regard to the College of Science could be met, and the position of University College, Dublin, could be eased.</P>
    <P>If the College of Science, as a separate institution had any case made for its continuance the position of University College, Dublin, could and would have been met by provision from the Exchequer.  The building debt would have been wiped out and further funds for building would have been granted to it.  The needs of University College, Dublin, are not being met to any degree by what is being done now.  The President of University College, Dublin, is taking over immense liabilities with the College of Science, and the provision of money which falls with it is very small.  If people sat down to work out the finances of this arrangement they would find that the loose money which really falls on account of it into the coffers of University College does not amount to £1,000 per annum. I have outlined the steps along which the decision was taken&mdash;that there was no case made and that it was not possible to make a case for the continuance of the College of Science as a separate institution; that for the better carrying out of the work which the College of Science was intended to do it was necessary that it should be amalgamated <Col N="690" /> with a university; once these two things were established there followed then this other point, that there was a university college embarrassed financially and that the amalgamation of these two institutions gave you the fullest possible provision for the work ordinarily done by the College of Science&mdash;better provision than it ever had&mdash;and that it gave you economy in administration at the same time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the object of this amendment is to give students who wish to receive instruction in the subjects taught in the College of Science the same facilities, without taking a full university course, that they had before the College of Science was absorbed by the National University.  One of the pleas put forward&mdash;a very sound and proper one&mdash; is that there are and will be students who desire to qualify in science, and who have not the desire or the opportunity of pursuing the full university course.  The Minister has made the extraordinary statement&mdash;without giving any reason for it&mdash;that a student can, in the National University, get the same scientific training that he got in the College of Science and, in addition, take on the full university course in the same time, at less expense and working fewer hours per day than he did in the College of Science for scientific training alone.  That seems to me to require some explanation.  It may be quite true, but it would seem to indicate that either the professors of the National University have some marvellous method of imparting knowledge in a rapid way not possessed by professors in the College of Science, or that the engineers they will turn out will be very much inferior to those turned out by the College of Science. It must mean one or other of these things.  It may mean, of course, that the new students will be of a particularly brilliant type&mdash;of the type of the Minister himself&mdash;and that they will be able to absorb knowledge at a much more rapid rate than other students.</P>

      <P>It is suggested that they may have given too many lectures on scientific subjects.  The matter wants to be cleared up, in order that those of us who have open minds and are anxious to be properly informed may be properly informed.  If a statement of that kind is made, I think it should be explained how it is possible to effect this wonderful task of which the Minister spoke.  It is all very well for Senator O'Hanlon and those speaking for wealthy farmers, with money to spend on the education of their children, who can afford to spend the necessary time in pursuing a full university course, to advocate that every student should take a full course before taking a degree in science.  But we must take facts as they are.  There are poor students whose parents cannot afford to allow them to remain one month longer than the period necessary to enable them to qualify in engineering or any other scientific subject.  In my opinion, the effect of this Bill will be to make scientific knowledge a closer borough than it has been, because it will necessitate a student taking a full university course in order to get a degree in science.  The extraordinary argument has been advanced&mdash;I heard it urged last year&mdash;that because many of the students of the College of Science were compelled to emigrate in order to earn a livelihood, that was a reason why the College of Science should be abolished&mdash;that there is no justification for giving instruction in a subject which provides training for people who have to emigrate.  The predecessor of the present Minister for Education said in the Dáil that he was not in the least concerned with the type of education that would be given to those people who had to fly from our shores to obtain a livelihood in other lands. But the parents of those children have some consideration for their future, and the Minister responsible ought to consider that.  If you are not able to provide <Col N="692" /> employment at home for the 30,000 people who leave our country every year, it is, I submit, a cruel and immoral proposition to say that you will let them go forth to the outer world absolutely bereft of the knowledge and training necessary to earn a livelihood in competition with foreigners.  I hope that argument will not be put forward again.</P>
      <P>We have compulsory Irish and we are teaching it to thousands of people who will have to go to America or the Colonies when they grow up.  Still it is advocated that it should be taught.  The greatest flight of all is from the Gaeltacht.  The argument seems to be advanced that because these people for whom we cannot find employment at home have to go abroad, any institution that caters for them is self-condemned.  We cannot all be Senators or Deputies or Ministers. Some people have got to work, and, if we cannot find work for them at home, then we should see that they get such training as will enable them to earn in another country that livelihood which their own country is unable to provide them with.  I have not heard yet any sound argument against this amendment. The Minister thought he saw a wonderful peg on which to hang his hat when he pounced on the words, &ldquo;compulsory Irish,&rdquo; as being behind the whole thing.  But he admitted that compulsory Irish would probably be a subject in the College of Science if it had continued as a separate institution. Then, opposition to this proposal has been attributed to jealousy on the part of Trinity College.  I hold no brief for Trinity College or for any other college.  I am concerned only for the interest of those who have very little money to spend on education&mdash;those who desire to get the best specialised knowledge they can in the shortest possible period.  This amendment, I believe, marks a step in that direction. Since it does&mdash;I have yet to be convinced that it does not&mdash;I am going to vote in favour of it.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Minister most carefully.  He is always most ingenious and interesting, but, with great respect, he did not answer <Col N="693" /> the point which is the very kernel of my amendment.  He said that the subjects which were taught in the College of Science would continue to be taught in University College.  He said that it would be possible under their statutes&mdash;though I was not quite able to follow him there&mdash;to give diplomas or degrees in every subject in which an associateship or a diploma could have been given by the College of Science.  That may be so; I am willing to accept the Minister's assurance that it is so.  But that is not the point.  Will a student get the same kind of <i>cachet</i> from the National University that he got from the College of Science?  Will he be able to obtain these benefits without having to take some other university course?</P>

      <P>It is suggested that he ought to matriculate.  I agree. Matriculation is a small thing.  He had to matriculate when he was in the College of Science, and it is right that everyone who is to get an associateship or a diploma of this kind should have a preliminary education entitling him to enter the institution. But that is a small thing, and nobody could object to a person having to pass the ordinary matriculation examination of the National University when wishing to pursue the course in University College that he formerly pursued in the College of Science. But what I want to ensure by my amendment, whatever form it takes, is that once a person gets in there, as a matriculated student or as a non-matriculated student, he will not have to take any university course other than the professional course he would have taken in the College of Science. If it would be possible to attain that end by any other words I am willing to alter the form of my amendment, and accordingly I would suggest that the matter be allowed to remain over until the Report Stage.  If the Minister can suggest any way by which the Bill will ensure that a student will not have to pursue some other and further course than he <Col N="694" /> would have pursued in the College of Science I will be perfectly satisfied.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Senator that it is not a question of statutes.  I can assure him that there is a great liberality to make courses.  What I think the Senator wants to be sure of is what are the courses in University College, Dublin. It is the schedule of subjects rather than the statutes that he wants.  I can give him the calendar which he can study between this and the Report Stage.  It is quite wrong for the Seanad, sitting in this particular year, to put into a Bill that will be a general Act containing this particular demise for ninety-nine years a clause that stereotypes the same courses which happen to be in existence now at the time of the change over.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the amendment will effect.  If the Senator wishes that the Seanad should now pass judgment upon what the future courses of instruction should be I do not see how you can bind the university.  I suggest an easier way.  Money has to be voted every year for the university, and the Estimate has to be examined every <Col N="695" /> year in the other House.  There can be an examination of the courses students have to go through each year. and one can compare that with the old associateship of the College of Science.  But you cannot say now what in five years hence ought to be either deductions from or additions to the associateship course.  It seems to me to be rather a dangerous matter to put into a Bill of this kind that will last for a considerable period an amendment the effect of which will be to stereotype the courses.  That matter can be watched from year to to year.  That takes away a certain point, because as it would only come up on the Estimate, and as this House has no control over the Estimate it could not be raised here.  But in the Dáil representations and protestations could be made.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of Section 4 a new sub-section (3) as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) The grants to persons erecting houses shall be similar in amount to those given to local authorities, <Col N="698" /> viz., £60, £80 and £100 respectively, for the three classes of houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I notice that in the Dáil this Bill was passed without any amendments being carried, although some amendments were submitted.  The most important amendment moved there to this important and welcome Bill was one very much on the lines of this.  I cannot see why the speculative builder should be penalised to some extent, and that a group of societies and local authorities should get larger subsidies than the courageous builder who, of his own accord, and single-handed, speculates in the building of houses which, as we know, are very much needed all over the country, especially in the district from which I come.  I do not make the suggestion that the builder of houses on a smaller scale than that of building societies should get a larger profit.  I suggest, on the contrary, that he should be in a better position to sell his house more cheaply to would-be purchasers.  Formerly, those who made it a practice of building and selling houses to the general public kept on that work continuously, even from father to son, and gave continuous employment.  Why these gentlemen should be singled out and not given the same facilities&mdash;I know the facilities under the Bill are not to be grumbled at&mdash;as societies and local authorities I do not know.  In the Dáil, our worthy President suggested that building societies did not very largely take advantage of these facilities.  I do not think that we should wait for building societies to make up their minds as to starting work at the expense of others.  It should be a case of first come, first served.  I do not see why a speculative builder should not be facilitated and encouraged in every way to start work.</P>
    <P>I know there is a limit to the amount, but as the President has said, it may not be so easy to get a larger sum than £300,000 out of the Minister for Finance.  I am glad to notice that very large sums have been passed for the improvement of public buildings such as the Post Office, the Four Courts, and the Custom House in the city of Dublin. Nobody can accuse the Government of extravagance in the matter of these <Col N="699" /> public buildings, because they left them lie there until other buildings that were more urgently required for public works were first put in hands.  In Cork there is one public building, the late Municipal Buildings, which still presents a very unsightly spectacle.  It is a very ghastly-looking thing, but I should say, of course, that the money that was earmarked for that has been diverted, and rightly so, in the interests of the public for the building of 160 odd houses.  I think the President and the Executive Council might bear that in mind and try to induce the Minister for Finance to be a little more liberal and to advance more than this sum of £300,000 for the districts that suffered &mdash;a sum that would be necessary to pay the extra figure indicated in my amendment. I do not think that a very large sum would be required.  I accordingly move my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned when this matter was raised in the Dáil&mdash;it was not raised in exactly the same, but in much the same, way&mdash;that the cost of building a particular house was usually a little bit higher than the cost of building a number of houses.  In the case of a private person building a house we have had the experience of the last two years in connection with the Housing Acts.  In the year 1924 the sums asked for in this amendment were provided, and last year in the case of private persons the sums were reduced £5 per room.  A three-roomed house, under the 1924 Act, had a subsidy of £60; a four-roomed house, a sum of £80, and a five-roomed house, £100.  Last year these sums were reduced to £45 for a three-roomed house; £60 for a four-roomed house, and £75 for a five-roomed house.  Our experience during the year was that much the same degree of activity prevailed even though there was a reduction in the amount, and the policy which we have adopted is that public utility societies and other organisations of that character would build these houses and partake of the higher subsidy.  They cater for a class which was unable to undertake the building of a house unaided, and the local authorities were able to give practically the same sum as is provided <Col N="700" /> under the 1925 Act and also under the 1924 Act.  It is not considered a good policy to depart now from the sums which were provided under the 1925 Act.  Quite a number of persons started on the work of building and were perfectly satisfied with the amount provided, and to interrupt that now and to give a larger subsidy to persons who had not the initiative or the courage of those who started under the Act of 1925 would, in the opinion of persons very closely identified with housing proposals for a great number of years, not be considered advantageous.  It is quite possible that they might say, &ldquo;Well, if there is no great fear of activity during this year, then, next year a larger sum must be provided.&rdquo;  In that connection as in all others, we have got to consider the various other services in the State which have to come under the consideration of the Minister for Finance.  We have also got to consider the fact that these Acts are now only two years in operation, and that something like 8,000 houses are either under construction or have been already built. That is a very considerable character to give the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the English subsidy, there the Government gives a sum equivalent to about £78.  They give an annual sum, but capitalised, it amounts to about £78.  The local authority is enabled over there to add sums which bring the £78 up to £100 in some cases, and in other cases, to £120.  Our contribution here, compared with that, is much more generous.  Apart from these grants themselves there is the advantage here which, as far as I know, is not in operation over there.  There is a scale of rates for property for a period of 20 years.  A person who builds under this Act gets practically the equivalent of 50 per cent. of the rates remitted.  Starting in the first year there is a remission of 95 per cent., going upwards by 5 per cent. each year, reaching in the 19th year practically the full thing.  In the twentieth year the full rates are charged.  The incidence of charge there in respect of rates is much easier in the earlier period when a person is called upon to distribute the largest <Col N="701" /> amount of money and when he is building his house.  All round, I should say that the total advantages derived by a person building under the Acts here are approximately 50 per cent. in excess of what is allowed in England. When we are discussing the Minister for Finance and the sums of money which he makes available for housing or any other service, I think we must certainly make up our minds that we are not in the position to give 50 per cent. greater advantages here in respect of public services than they are in England.  There is a larger sum given to the local authority and the public utility society, and the reasons for that are as I have stated: that they deal with classes in the community less able to help themselves, and the burden on these bodies would be greater than they could bear if it were not that these larger subsidies were made available for them.  A very considerable amount of activity has taken place in this matter. Owing to the short period that has elapsed since the first Act was passed and the greater advantages that are given to public utility societies and local authorities under last year's Act, the full advantage of these public utility societies has not yet been felt. I observe from a publication which has been issued that this matter is now becoming much more under the notice of persons and that a very considerable amount of activity is taking place. I notice in one church it was mentioned that quite a number of utility societies have been formed.  Here is a quotation from a leaflet dealing with the matter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Members of your Committee helped in the formation of the Linenhall Public Utility Society, Ltd., which has been organised by members of St. Paul's, St. Peter's and Grangegorman parishes and is providing 63 houses on the site of the old Linenhall Barracks.  The Dublin Commercial Public Utility Society (with 12 houses), the Civil Service Public Utility Society, Bray Public Utility Society, are also executing plans for the erection of houses for special groups.  The St. Barnabas' Public Utility Society completed 62 houses last year, and <Col N="702" /> has a further 73 in the course of erection.</P>
    <P>Your Committee would like it to be widely known that investments are urgently required for the several public utility societies, and for the Association for the Housing of the Very Poor.  A member of the Jacob family has given a munificent donation of £1,000 for the association.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is an organisation that has certainly done excellent work in the city of Dublin.  Quite a number of other such societies are in the course of formation, or have been at work already, and until the full effect of the work of these public utility societies has come into operation I think it would be unwise to consider the extension of the grant. We want to see some real co-operation through other bodies in the city than municipalities in the solution of this housing problem.  Unless we get that, and they are prepared to bear a part of the burden the great task will lay before the Government and municipalities. I think, on the whole, bearing in mind that 212 houses were constructed by speculative builders in 1925 in the city of Dublin that is evidence of the fact that it is a commercial proposition.  Full information concerning these Acts has not yet been widely disseminated, and it would be unwise to alter the incidence of the subsidy.  Studying Acts of Parliament is not the <i>forte</i> of the speculative builders, and I think we will leave them to develop still further the work they have done during the last year.  Consequently, I do not feel justified in accepting the amendment.</P>
