      <P>I had hoped that Senator Brown would be here and that it would not have fallen on me to speak on this measure.  Since this Bill passed through the Dáil much new evidence has come to our hands, which, I think, we should take into consideration.  I have been reading the reports of the various inspectors.  I think I will have the feeling of the Seanad with me when I say that we should not force the children into schools unless we have such assurance from the Government as will make us satisfied that these schools will be put into a fit condition to receive the children.  I will read here the words of one of the inspectors: &ldquo;There is a very considerable number of school buildings ill-adapted in the first case to serve as schools, and now in a bad state of repair, damp, uncomfortable, and often insanitary.  A few are mere hovels, yet frequently overcrowded, a menace to the health of the children and teachers, an eyesore to the passers-by and a standing reflection on all responsible for their condition.&rdquo;  That is an extract from the report by Mr. Tierney.  He has reported on the general condition of the schools in his area.  He is inspector for Mayo, part of Leinster, the whole of County Longford, and portions of Westmeath.  You have practically in every inspector's report something of the same kind.  A majority of the schools are not in this condition but evidently a very considerable minority of the schools are in this condition.</P>
      <P>Speaking on this matter on the 11th June last the President said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I leave this question of primary <Col N="520" /> education, I should mention that there is one further matter&mdash; also an important matter in our quest for efficiency&mdash;with which the Minister for Education hopes to deal as soon as possible.  This country has always suffered from the inadequacy of its school buildings.  The disturbances of recent years have left us still more seriously in arrears in this important particular, and the operation of an effective School Attendance Act will increase still more the lack of proper accommodation for primary education.  To meet this difficulty the Department of Education is having a thorough census made of the primary school-buildings of the Saorstát, and when this is complete, it may be necessary to ask you to make further provision in the Estimates to bring the primary school accommodation up to the level necessary for complete efficiency.</P>
    <P>Now we have not had those further statistics as to the state of the schools. We do not know whether the Government will be able, whether it will get that necessary support to put all these schools right.  But it should be our business to see that it gets that support.  I should like also to suggest to the Seanad that the proper method of doing this is not under the Estimates. I hold that this should be done by a national loan.  It is a non-recurrent expenditure, precisely the kind of expenditure that is usually met by a loan. One feels that if the vote is put on the Estimates that it will not be adequately and amply dealt with.  I would like to do something further. I suggest to the Government that they should appoint a commission to consider the whole question of school buildings in the State.  A great effort should be made to put these schools right, and that means that the attention of the country should be drawn to the matter.  Furthermore, we should see that the right methods are taken and that the right form of school buildings is adopted.  The Government has already a commission inquiring into the school curriculum, but they have not a commission set up for the purpose of inquiring into <Col N="521" /> the school buildings.  My suggestion is that it should be a point of honour to the Seanad not to ask the school children to enter those buildings until they are certain that these buildings are fit to receive the children.</P>
    <P>To be able to do my duty as a Senator in relation to this question, I, myself, before this Government report was put into my hands, saw a number of the schools. I saw schools in Dublin and in the country.  I was shocked by what I saw in the Dublin schools.  I saw schools where the children were learning their lessons by artificial light at noon-day, because the windows were too small. I saw schools where two classes were being held side by side, because there was not room to give a separate class to each.  That means wear and tear to the nerves of the children and to the temper of the teachers.</P>
    <P>I also saw another thing to which I wish to draw the attention of the Government. Many of these schools are filthy.  A minority of the children who come to them, I should say a substantial minority, are filthy.  There are no adequate basins, sometimes no basins at all, in which the children could wash themselves.  I have seen schools where the children are perfectly clean.  I have seen one school in Dublin where the floors are washed once a week and brushed every day.  Many of the country schools are never washed at all.  I have seen a school lately in a South of Ireland town managed by the Sisters of Mercy, and it is a model to all schools. There the part of the house that is used frequently is washed once a week and brushed daily.  The children are perfectly clean.  What can be done there can be done elsewhere in Ireland.  But you cannot have these things done unless the country is prepared to spend the money.</P>
    <P>It should be a matter of honour to the State no matter how poor it may be, to spend that money.  You must not, for instance, do what is almost always done&mdash;get this work done by the children. It must not be the business of the children to keep the school clean after they have done their day's work in the school.  There must be properly appointed <Col N="522" /> people to see that the school is clean and also to see that the children are clean and that they are sent to school clean.  When the children are not clean they should be made wash themselves in a proper place provided in the school.  If you do not do that you will not have a centre of civilisation in the schools and the children might as well remain at home.  I think you cannot secure any of these things without more expense, and, of course, a more efficient system of inspection, than you have at present.  The inspectors who come from the central authority will not be able to keep an eye on all these things.  There is an obvions way out of the difficulty, a way which we cannot take, perhaps, but a way which the North of Ireland has taken, and that is to put the care of the school buildings in the hands of local committees.</P>
    <P>One of the Government inspectors strongly urges that upon the Government. That is done practically all over Europe.  It is done in Catholic Austria as it is done in Protestant Scandinavia. The committees differ from country to country.  They are constituted in various ways, but I think these committees exist practically everywhere.  I should like to add that the difficulty in appointing those committees does not come from one religion alone.  It comes just as much, if I understand it, from the religion in which I was born as it comes from any other, but it is not to the credit of the State that no way can be found out of the difficulty.  If we cannot have local inspection, which would mean inspection by inspectors who have local knowledge, then we must devise some equally efficient method.</P>
    <P>There is one thing on which I feel strongly.  As long as you carry on the present obsolete method of education in your schools you will have the usual strain between the master and the pupil.  You will have the usual problem of children being punished by a master with a bad temper, and your only way to prevent that is when the so-called punishment books are regularly kept.  Those are books in which the teacher is bound <Col N="523" /> to record the punishment inflicted, and why it is inflicted.  My experience is that those punishment books are not kept because there is not sufficiently adequate inspection.  I do not say that the present inspectors are not most able men, but you want more numerous inspection or better local inspection to secure efficiency in those things.  If the Government can convince me that it is able and willing to make these buildings suitable for the children, that is to say, to make them clean and sanitary&mdash;and many of them are not sanitary&mdash;to make the floor space sufficient and to make them reasonably cheerful, I am prepared to give my unimportant vote in favour of this Bill.  If they do not, I cannot give it.</P>
    <P>I am not asking anything extravagant. I think we ought to do whatever is done by other countries of the same wealth as this nation in order to ensure the welfare of our children.  We should consider, for instance, that there are at present some arrangements, not I think always very wise, as to the feeding of school-children in the towns. There are none in the country, and judging by my own countryside, where I live during the summer months, it is needed.  Children will start early in the morning.  They will be the greater portion of the day in school and they will have no adequate meals.  They come away hungry, and it seems, if not very necessary, at least very desirable that they should have food.  Then, of course, many other countries, perhaps not richer than this, have found means of seeing that children are properly clothed and that they have proper books.  These are all difficult but desirable things.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to speak on the question of the curriculum.  It is being considered by a Commission at this moment.  I wish that the Government had introduced a comprehensive educational measure dealing with all the details before asking us to compel children, by law, to go into the schools. Whether it is good for the children or not depends not only on the building but on the nature of the system under which they are taught.  I am sure for <Col N="524" /> a child to spend all day in school with a stupid, ill-trained man under an ill-planned system, is less good for that child than that the child should be running through the fields and learning nothing.  I should like to draw the attention of the Government to one nation which has reformed its educational system in the most suggestive and profound way; that is Italy.  It has not produced a system unique to Italy.  It has simply gathered together the results of experiments all over the world.  They are now teaching a system of education adapted to an agricultural nation like this or Italy, a system of education that will not turn out clerks only, but will turn out efficient men and women who can manage to do all the work of the nation.  This system has been tried in Ireland.  There are some schools carrying it out.  There is one large primary school managed by nuns in the South of Ireland which has adopted practically the entire Italian system and which is carrying it out with great effect, and has found that it is applicable, and that its teachers do not need special training to carry it out. The Italian Minister who adopted that policy was warned by everyone that it would not be possible to get this elaborate system carried out by partly educated people.  It has been proved possible and of great benefit to the children.</P>
    <P>In order to give an intelligent vote &mdash;at one time I thought it would be a silent one&mdash;on this question I have kept two clear principles in my mind.  One is that we ought to be able to give the child of the poor as good an education as we give to the child of the rich. Of course the rich man's child remains longer at school.  I have consulted teachers and people accustomed to the latest methods of education, and they are all clear that there is no reason why the education of the children of the poor should not be as good, while it lasts, as the education of the children of the rich.  I would like to suggest another principle, that the child itself must be the end in education. It is a curious thing how many times the education of Europe has drifted into error.  For two or three centuries people thought that their various religious <Col N="525" /> systems were more important than the child.  In the modern world the tendency is to think of the nation; that it is more important than the child.  In Japan, I understand, the child is sacrificed to patriotism.  I have seen education unified in America, so that the child is sacrificed to that of unified Americanism, and the human mind is codified.  We are bound to go through the same passion ourselves.  There is a tendency to subordinate the child to the idea of the nation.  I suggest that whether we teach either Irish history, Anglo-Irish literature or Gaelic, we should always see that the child is the object and not any of our special purposes.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Senator Yeats has said and I can give some figures that he perhaps had not time to get.  At present there is not school accommodation in the city of Dublin for one-fourth of the children that should be at school, and there is also no census of the number of children that should be at school.  Senator Yeats has not spoken too strongly about the schools.  I visited many schools in 1912 to examine children for another purpose.  In one school in High Street the playground was the crypt of St. Audeon's Church.  There are bye-laws existing defining the cubic space to be provided for each child but they have not been enforced. To compel children to attend these concentration houses&mdash;I know conditions are modified by the Bill&mdash;would be an inhuman thing to countenance.  It is an unwise thing to send children to a school that is too small.  It is not even a wise thing to send children to a school, the health of which is not certifiable on inspection.  When an epidemic occurs in the city the schools are closed.  The schools are a centre of danger to child life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This city may be termed the city of beautiful children.  Anyone who has marched in the national pageants we have on the occasions of public funerals will see the whole street lined by the most beautiful children that any country could produce.  What happens these children between 12 and 16 years of age when there is a sudden falling off in the health of the city's youth? <Col N="526" /> The blame cannot be altogether laid on the schools, but it may be laid down to the disregard for child life that there is in this city.  That disregard will be augmented if we countenance huddling children together in premises that are at present totally unfit for them.  No one has discussed hitherto the importance of the site of the school.  The school ought to be in the most beautiful part of the town or the city.  What are the facts?  Our schools are situated in congested areas&mdash;slum areas&mdash;where there are more than 250 people to the acre.  With modern transport every day growing and the extraordinary facilities for connecting outlying districts, it ought to be easy to provide covered 'buses for school children.  It may be very expensive, but a great deal of expense will have to be gone to in education before we realise the dream that we have of our own importance.</P>
    <P>Except the schools run by the religious bodies, I do not suppose there are in the city schools fit to send children to.  There are one or two, perhaps, but I cannot be quite certain that they are not run by one or other of the religious bodies of the different denominations. Apart from the site of the school, the fact of sending children to schools that are ugly has its effect on the minds of the children and on their attitude towards education.  Instead of being easily taught the general effect is to associate education in the child's mind with the misery of the slum.</P>
    <P>I think the by-laws, now in abeyance, are not sufficient to make the schools suitable.  The trend of the criticism that we see in the papers is vague criticism of public expenditure, forgetful altogether of the fact that the money is spent in this country, and that it is bringing in certain results.  We will have to add to the Bill for education, I am afraid, a grant from the Central Fund, to make the schools worthy of the pupils.  I would like to hear anyone mention a school that can be considered fit for modern education.</P>
    <P>First of all, we want many more schools, and schools twice the size, to accommodate the children.  We also want a census of the number of <Col N="527" /> children that should be provided with education.  It will then be time for the Minister to promise adequate housing for the children.  When the children are compelled to go to school the next thing will be to compel them to undergo certain inspections, and that may mean that they will have to submit to certain operations.  That is one matter that should be considered before anyone gives consent to compulsion of that kind.  That would arise with the compulsion of the child's presence in the school, and would end easily in compulsion of the child to go under an operation. One must depend on the public sense before that will happen.  I can see the seeds of compulsion if we insist in sending children to unsuitable buildings which have to be closed when any threat to the public health arises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree almost entirely with the remarks made by the two Senators who have previously spoken in connection with this Bill.  I want to say, however, that this Bill is not intended to deal with the questions raised by the previous speakers. This Bill is designed mainly for the purpose of enforcing the attendance of school children at school up to a certain age.  The other questions that have been raised have certainly a direct bearing on the attendance of children at school, but this Bill deals mainly with the compulsory attendance of children up to the age of fourteen years.  I think it will be generally admitted by anybody who has considered the question of school attendance in this country that it is absolutely essential that compulsory powers should be brought into operation to compel parents of children to do their duty by their children and to compel parents to see that the children at least get a smattering of education.  It is a notorious fact that in this country during recent years some parents&mdash;I am sorry to say a large percentage&mdash; have been very negligent with regard to seeing that their children at least get a smattering of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The returns of attendance available, of the number of children who are actually on the rolls in the various schools, show that the average attendance <Col N="528" /> was about 60 per cent.  That was in regard to the actual number of children that was registered on the rolls.  It is a notorious fact that in many districts quite a large number of children were not entered on the rolls, but the actual attendance of children of school-going age entered on the rolls was only about 60 per cent.  That is a lamentable state of affairs.  This Bill has for its object the remedying of that state of affairs, to see that that is ended immediately, that the children should be made to attend school, and that if those who have the custody of the children do not do their duty by the children, steps will be taken by the State to compel them to do so.  I welcome this Bill.  I have had some experience, being a member of a School Attendance Committee in the city, and I see the absolute necessity for powers to compel parent to do their duty by their children.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I regret about the Bill.  That is that the compulsory powers end at the age of fourteen.  I think that is a mistake.  I think the age limit should be extended beyond the age of fourteen.  That may be due to the fact that in some industrial countries there is a good deal of employment for children when they leave school at the age of fourteen, but I think it will be admitted by anybody who pays any attention to this question that in this country there is not employment for young children to the same extent as there is in other large industrial centres.  It is almost impossible in the cities, towns or country districts to find employment for children at the age of fourteen, and for that reason I regret that the age for compulsory attendance is not extended beyond fourteen.  Between the ages of fourteen and sixteen most of the children in this country are to be seen running about the streets of our towns and cities in a semi-wild state.  That is the period in life when it is necessary that most attention should be paid to their education, and I regret the age limit is not being extended beyond fourteen.</P>
    <P>I think what Senator Yeats has said is true, that there is not sufficient school accommodation in the country at present <Col N="529" /> to house the children, if we are going to insist on their attendance at school.  It is true that in Dublin, if all children of school-going age were to attend school, there is not sufficient accommodation for them.  That is a lamentable state of affairs, but it should not deter us from compelling parents to send their children to school.  If there is not sufficient accommodation we ought to be able to afford to build more schools.  However, the fact that there is not sufficient accommodation is no excuse for the parents to neglect to do their duty in this matter.  With regard to the insanitary state of the schools, I think there is a good deal in the complaint made by Senator Yeats. That brings me to a statement made in the Dáil on the Second Reading by Deputy Good, with which I thoroughly agree.  He said that he regretted that this question of education was being dealt with piece-meal, and that it was not being dealt with on a comprehensive scale.  The question of meals for school children is dealt with under the Schools Meals Act, and the question of school accommodation is dealt with under the Supply Services, and so on.</P>
    <P>I think it is a pity that a Committee should not be appointed to inquire into the whole system of education from the primary schools to the universities and to draft a scheme whereby children who are endowed with brains, even though their parents may not be in possession of much of the world's goods, would get the best education that can be given to them.  I think in every progressive country no matter whether the father of the child happens to be lord or a labourer, if the child has sufficient brains and ability, the State should supply the wherewithal to develop those brains.  I agree with Deputy Good that the whole question was not dealt with on a comprehensive scale.  I can say, knowing what I do, about the position of affairs in Dublin, that children are not being properly looked after and that they are not even getting a smattering of education.  I welcome this Bill as part of a general plan of education that we hope will be introduced at a later stage.  I hope the House will pass the Bill because it is absolutely essential that these compulsory <Col N="530" /> powers should be given to the Education Authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. CUMMINS Mr. CUMMINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CUMMINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House should be thankful to Senator Yeats and Senator Gogarty for having raised the question of school buildings.  I think it is a question that could not get too much ventilation no matter whether the opportunity is appropriate or not.  Undoubtedly the Compulsory Education Bill and the schools have a distinct inter-relationship but I think the case that they made against enforcing compulsion was founded upon a wrong theory.  In 1892 and 1893 an Education Act was to be enforced in this country or, I should say, was made available for enforcement in this country. It was accepted in many centres of the thirty-two counties.  Amongst them was Belfast.  At that time Belfast had grown to such dimensions that it had nothing like the accommodation for, perhaps, one-tenth of the children who were attending the schools, but somehow schools did spring up.  Schools were actually built in Belfast by the teachers in some cases. We had, strange to say, the rather peculiar position of a teacher building his own school and appointing himself as manager of the school and being recognised by the Board of Education.  I do not say that such a thing will happen under the conditions that will be brought about by the new Compulsory Education Bill, but I give what happened in Belfast, and it was this: that hundreds of schools, schools with playgrounds on the roofs and in the basements, where sunshine and air were admitted, sprang up rapidly, and continued to spring up in Belfast, which is the best equipped city in the British Isles, or at least will be when the present scheme is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is owing a good deal to the fact that compulsory education was put into force in no half-hearted way, but was put into force by committees who were in earnest and determined to do their work.  I believe that the enactment of the compulsory education measure will be the spear-head by which suitable school buildings will be secured.  It was stated in the course of discussion that there was no school building in Ireland suitable for primary <Col N="531" /> education purposes.  I question that very much.  I think some of the schools erected in this city and throughout the country within the last twenty years compare favourably with any schools we find throughout the British Isles.  I should not like that the question of schools and their condition, which I recognise is very bad, should be made an instrument by which to torpedo this measure.  I think, on the contrary, that the Bill should be made an instrument by which we could secure good schools.  With regard to forcing children into schools where the accommodation is insufficient, it should be absolutely out of the question to compel children to attend schools of that kind.  There would be no case against the parents of those children if they refused to send them to schools where the accommodation is insufficient. I take it that the provisions in this measure would not be enforced against such parents, as it would be very unjust and unwise to do so.  No judge or justice would for a moment think of inflicting even the most trifling punishment on parents for refusing to send their children into insanitary buildings.  With reference to the medical inspection of schools, I am sure that the Medical Association will render the parents immune from any unjust treatment in this matter.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the present system of maintaining the schools has failed.  This question has agitated the minds of educationists in this country for years.  I think it is the foundation of many of the difficulties with which the nation is confronted.  The system of management of schools by managers has not been a success.  Local committees are absolutely necessary to meet the new condition of affairs. When I speak of local committees let me be distinctly understood: the committees will be of such a character as to assist the present managers of schools in such matters as the provision of suitable buildings and playgrounds, and perhaps meals, for which a certain amount of provision is available already.  An impression that has caused difficulties always as between managers and local bodies was that the <Col N="532" /> local bodies would eventually interfere in the managers' right of appointment and dismissal of teachers.  I believe so far as the position of the managers is concerned in their relation to the teachers that matter could be left absolutely untouched, and still effective committees could be set up in every county to deal with those matters. Without local committees you cannot have a local rate for education.  That is pretty obvious, and I think the sooner the Government tackles this matter the sooner will they arrive at the ideal system of education for which we all hope.</P>
    <P>Any attempt to postpone the enforcement of this measure would undoubtedly prejudice the chances of the people as regards the provision of better schools.  You have a number of partially built schools through the country at present.  In many schools we have two qualified teachers, where the second teacher has to subsist on what is practically half the salary he would have if the children were permitted to have the benefit of the instruction of those teachers.  The cost of putting it into force will.  I admit, be substantial, but from estimates I have had I think the amount will be considerably below what some people think.  I have some experience of the working of the Act of 1893.  It did useful and effective work, more perhaps by the moral influence exercised by a committee in a locality than by the actual enforcement of the powers that were vested in them. There are two grave flaws I think, in the present measure.  First amongst those I put the clause that would have us consider a boy's education completed when he reaches 14 years of age.  That is the period when a boy has a wider outlook, and he has to be catered for in a very particular way.  At that period he is very little beyond the illiterate stage, but he is beginning to appreciate what learning means.  At present boys are allowed to hang around looking for employment, and to become a general nuisance to everybody for two or three years until they are in a position, perhaps, to go on the unemployment dole.</P>
    <P>I think the nation would be doing a serious thing in neglecting its duty towards <Col N="533" /> these boys and girls.  In Germany and other countries the State considers it its duty to take charge of the children not alone up to the age of 16 but up to 18, 19 and 21 until they become a genuine asset to the State, and not become more expensive to the State than they were to their own parents. Uneducated persons are most expensive to the State.  When I speak of education, I mean it not alone in the literal but in the technical sense, that is as regards educating a boy to enable him to make a living for himself.  I think when the machinery of the Act comes to be set up by the Minister he would be well advised instead of scheduling the areas to which the 16 years' limit would apply to schedule the few areas to which it should not apply, or I would even go further and schedule all areas as areas to which it should apply and wait and see what would happen.  I believe what would happen is, that in very few counties would the Minister find any body of public opinion which would oppose the enforcement of the Act up to the age of 16 years.  I understand the Minister has that power in his hands, and I would suggest that he should use it to the fullest and wait for developments.</P>
    <P>We are not slow in giving expression to our feeling in this country, and if there was opposition to the enforcing of the Bill in any county, or from any area, the Minister may be assured that he will hear it very readily and it will be a great guide for him.  Now the other flaw I consider in the Bill is this question of exemptions.  It has been suggested to me, indeed, from more quarters than one&mdash;I am not now speaking as the official representative of the teachers&mdash;that perhaps it would be better if in connection with these forty-eight school days, that is, the period within which pupils may remain absent for two periods of ten days each &mdash;the schools should be opened for a shorter time and that compulsion should be exercised in making all pupils attend for some hours each day less hours perhaps than the ordinary school day.  I am throwing the suggestion out to the Minister for his consideration. It is only a matter for consideration as to how, for these forty-eight <Col N="534" /> days, the pupils are to be kept in touch with the schools and with the sequence of work that will be taking place in the schools.  These are the two points.</P>
    <P>Again, I may come back to the fourteen years age-limit.  I think it is deplorable that some efforts should not be made, even at this late hour, to link up the primary schools with the technical schools where technical education is available throughout the country.  I know, from experience, that this would mean no extra cost to the State.  Boys and girls in centres where technical education is at present available leave school at the age of fourteen and fifteen, in many cases perfectly well qualified to avail of the excellent training by itinerant teachers and others in those centres.  At night, in the schools in the villages and towns throughout Ireland, we find very few in attendance.  Hundreds of those boys are walking the streets while not half a dozen are in attendance at the technical classes. Their attendance would mean no extra expense for the State and no extra employment of teachers.  The average is thirty pupils for each of these teachers.  More frequently the average found in actual attendance is five or six or seven or eight.  You have practically derelict schools where the teachers are paid the same salaries as if the schools were in full working order.  The work in these partially attended schools is not so well carried out because the spirit of emulation does not exist.  Applying compulsion to primary schools is one thing, but to technical schools is another thing; but I think where classes are available in localities throughout Ireland for technical education something should be done to induce pupils to come into these classes.</P>
    <P>Then, with regard to the question of distance, I think that a child that is ten years of age will be quite able to walk the three mile distance without putting any great hardship upon it. I welcome this Bill, and I recognise that the Minister has done excellent work in bringing it before the House, and that, all the conditions being taken into account, economic, financial, and otherwise, the Bill will do a good deal <Col N="535" /> if it secures that every child with the exceptions mentioned shall attend 180 days at school out of 200, which is the usual number.  I think that is doing a great stroke of work for educational progress in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that every member of this House is in favour of the principle of this Bill.  I do not suppose there is any country in which compulsory attendance at school is more necessary than in this Free State. I do not think there is any country in which so many children under the age of fourteen make fewer than one hundred attendances in the year at school.  The necessity for a Bill of this kind is all the greater at this time when, what I might call the burden, although a useful burden, of an additional language, is being put upon the shoulders of the children.  That will mean all the more need for regular attendance at school and more effort than ever before.  I think we are equally agreed that the only chance of real success for this Bill and the only justification for putting it into absolutely general operation, in this country, would be the provision of suitable buildings for those children who are compelled to come to school while getting their education.  My only reason for intervening in this debate is this: I wish to call the attention of the Minister to a speech delivered by President Cosgrave in the Dáil on the 11th of June last year when the Estimates for the Department of Education were under discussion.  President Cosgrave said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I leave this question of primary education, I should mention that there is one further matter&mdash; also an important factor in our quest for efficiency with which the Minister for Education hopes to deal as soon as possible.  This country has always suffered from the inadequacy of its school buildings.  The disturbances of recent years have left us still more seriously in arrears in this important particular and the operation of an effective school attendance Act will increase still more the lack of proper accommodation for primary education. To meet this difficulty the Department of Education is having a <Col N="536" /> thorough census made of the primary school buildings of the Saorstát, and when this is complete it may be necessary to ask you to make further provision in the Estimates to bring the primary school accommodation up to the level necessary for complete efficiency.</P>
    <P>Now, sir, that is a most satisfactory statement.  It says that this serious question of school building has been engaging the attention of the Government, and I should be very glad to hear from the Minister that the Government are still of that opinion, and that as soon as they get that complete census, which I take it will not take them very long to get, of the schools in this country which are not fit for the education of the young they will carry out what is practically the undertaking by the President that these school buildings will be improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCostello" hpid="Mrs. COSTELLO Mrs. COSTELLO">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. COSTELLO</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think some of the discussion has been relevant to the Bill.  If the Government take increased powers they will have increased responsibilities, and I agree with a great deal of what Senators said with regard to the schools.  I know some of the schools in the country; they are not exactly dirty, but they are bare and uninteresting.  I intend to vote for the Bill, although I regret the necessity for abstention.  The main clause in this Bill deals with permitted abstention. I see the Minister is giving powers under this Bill until 1936.  I do not quite see the necessity for ten years. It is an experiment, and I think five years, at the outside, would give him ample opportunity to judge how the scheme is working.  It seems to me ten years is too long.  I should like to ask the Minister does this Bill apply to the children of itinerants such as tinkers. Nobody seems to take any heed of these people.  They are wandering all over the country and the children are running at large.  No effort is made to turn them into good citizens.  Other countries have had this problem of dealing with practically what are nomadic peoples.  In America they have the gypsies and Indians.  The Indians roam around.  At the age of eleven or twelve they are bound to be sent to <Col N="537" /> school for a certain number of years.  I think it is time we should consider this class.  Someone said to me, leave those alone, they are so picturesque.  Anyone who sees the conditions under which they live, will not agree with that.  Nurses have to go on the roadside to attend them in child-birth.  The children that remain, and whom we see, are only the more robust; the others die.  I should like to ask the Minister do those people come under this Bill.  I do not know how many there are in Ireland or whether they are included in the Census.</P>

      <P>Having been in close touch with what I always looked upon as a most useful experiment and having attended the annual meeting of that body only a few days ago, perhaps I may say I can give the most useful object lesson that could be obtained in Ireland.  I refer to what is called the Mary Weir Charity.  The genesis of that charity is interesting. She was a little girl of poor parents, who had come to one of the schools in the district I refer to; whether it was wet or dry, snow or frost, she came. She had to subsist from morning till evening, probably as you see most of the poor children subsisting, on a dirty crust.  This girl afterwards went into the service of an English gentleman. By faithful and long service in his employment she won his regard to such an extent that on his death-bed he left all he had to her.  You hear of bequests by ladies of noble birth.  This is a story of the bequest of a lady, not of noble birth, but of noble character. When she died she gave a large portion of her wealth to endow the charity which may well form a lesson to any Minister for Education in any part of the world.  There are four parishes on the borders of Meath and Westmeath. They are Killalen, Kilmeelin, Kilshiar and Ballylough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was appointed as Chairman to the Committee and I do not think I missed for the last fifteen or more years a single meeting.  We visited those schools and a more horrible condition of things has hardly been described by any of the speakers here.  The bequest was sufficient to put those schools in <Col N="538" /> decent order and to build, where necessary, not only sanitary accommodation, but to provide heating, lighting and luncheons for the children on any day they attended school.  There was also sufficient money to provide boots and shoes for the very poor, although boots were sometimes more dangerous than wet feet.  To arrive with boots wet through, and to sit in a cold room with them on, tends more, than any other condition I can imagine, to ill-health. I was going to tell you the result, and perhaps if the Minister for Education would like to get full particulars, I can give him the address of the Secretary. The attendance has improved to such an extent that there is no parish, I think, in the whole diocese that can compare with this group of parishes to which I refer.  The health of the children has been good; their appearance is extremely good, and there is no playing truant in those parishes.  They all like to come to school.  They are not only fed, but they are able to do lessons in a room comfortably heated.  It did not cost much for each school, and I thought by this time any Minister for Education would have gone to see those schools and the experiment which. I maintain, ought to be imitated in all schools.  All I can say is, that it has completely convinced me that a small outlay in the feeding of the children&mdash; cocoa and bread is all they have&mdash;and a proper attention to the accommodation of the school, would work wonders amongst the juvenile population of the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that this Bill will be regarded by the Seanad as non-controversial and I will say very little on it.  But I cannot allow to go uncontroverted certain statements made by Senators Yeats and Gogarty.  They were to this effect: they regarded the present expenditure on education as inadequate and suggested large and substantial future expenditure for school buildings.  I should myself regard the present figure of the education Estimates as the limit, and I would ask the Minister to see whether within that figure he could provide the services required in connection with schools and school buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EDUCATION (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal first with the main contention here which to a certain extent does not belong to the Bill proper but is, perhaps, incidental to it, that is the matter raised by Senators Gogarty and Yeats who spoke most strongly on the subject referred to afterwards by most of the other speakers and then by the last speaker, if only to disagree with the views urged.  Now it is quite obvious if I may put it so mildly, that there was a certain amount of exaggeration in the speeches of Senators Gogarty and Yeats.  I think Senator Gogarty suggested that there was not a single school in Dublin suitable for its purpose as a school building.  If that is so, we are up against a problem that will stagger Senator Sir John Keane even more than the real reading of the Bill.  Last year we spent in North Dublin £14,000 in the building of schools.  That was in the Drumcondra area.  Altogether there are five thousand schools in the country, and if we have to postpone anything in the nature of compulsory attendance in schools until we can bring all these schools up to the standard required by Senators Gogarty and Yeats we would undoubtedly be putting the matter of the attendance of children at schools on the very long finger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the actual criticism of the schools, and I try to give what is our point of view now as it was our point of view last June.  There is no change so far as the Government are concerned. We recognise the seriousness of the problem.  But it is one matter to recognise the seriousness of a problem, and another to fail to recognise the seriousness of the particular problem with which this Bill deals.  To suggest that we ought not go on with that portion of the scheme until we are ready to make an advance all along the line as regards school buildings is not a practical suggestion.  I think that in many of the schools, according to these Senators, we would require a new set of teachers before we can send the children to the school to the present class of masters.  That would mean that we would, as far as school attendance is concerned, leave the matter as it is for years until all these <Col N="540" /> other matters are settled and permit the present unsatisfactory condition of things to continue for years.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Senator who spoke about the unsatisfactory accommodation that there is at present a Compulsory Attendance Act in force. Reject this Bill, and that Act is still there.  It will be administered in Dublin by the same people who administer it at present&mdash;that is, so far as the City of Dublin is concerned.  That ought not be forgotten.  Therefore, unless you repeal the existing Act, you could not, so far as Dublin and many other of the larger cities in the country are concerned, achieve the aim which Senators Yeats and Gogarty have put before the Senate.  As Senator Farren has said, the attendance at school is decidedly bad in this country.  Seventy per cent. of the pupils on the rolls is the average, and, as has been pointed out, this is probably 60 per cent. of the children in the country between the ages of six and fourteen.  That, undoubtedly, is extremely unsatisfactory. Some children never go to school, or else they go to school so irregularly that their attendance there possibly is not much good, and is certainly very disturbing to the rest of the children. It is impossible for the teachers effectively to carry on their schools unless they can be reasonably certain of good regular attendance of those children who actually do attend the school.  It is in order to cope with those very obvious defects that this Bill has been introduced.</P>
    <P>There is at present, so far as the schools are concerned, a new census being taken.  That census is not yet completed.  When that is completed we will know where we are.  Senator Yeats quoted from the Inspector in Mayo, and parts of Leinster that border on the Shannon, but Senator Gogarty did not quote from the Inspector for Dublin, for the Senator condemned every school in Dublin.  He would, if he had looked into the report of the Inspector for Dublin, see that that is not borne out by the Inspector for this particular area.</P>
    <P>There are undoubtedly many schools &mdash;the exact number we do not know&mdash;<Col N="541" /> that are not in a proper condition; but, bad as they are, the Seanad should consider the alternative.  These schools are generally in congested districts. They are very often in poor districts, and there are poor districts in the city and in the country, so that the choice is between going to these schools&mdash;I am merely looking upon it from the health point of view&mdash;unsatisfactory as they are&mdash;or remaining at home.  What is the choice so far as health is concerned? Taking the bulk of the homes of the particular people I am talking about in the cities and in the country, would it be any advantage to the children to stay at home?  Are the homes of the people from whom we are compelling the children to go out, so satisfactory compared to those schools? It is well to pause and consider, not one side but the whole effects.  What I am saying is that the unsatisfactory condition of many of the schools is no real reason for postponing the particular measure now before the Seanad. Senator Gogarty suggested that we should bring all the children out to the garden suburbs.  Well, if there are sixty thousand children in Dublin, we would require a few 'buses, and I am afraid Senator Sir John Keane would receive another shock.</P>
    <P>I am not going to suggest that the present expenditure on education is the limit.  I have done nothing to encourage any belief on his part to that extent.  In the Dáil most of the Deputies in the Farmers' and Labour Parties, and also Deputy Good, pointed out that economy in education was disastrous. It is not possible to deal with all these problems at once.  We can only deal with particular problems when we are ready to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Costello raised a question about the children of people generally known as &ldquo;tinkers.&rdquo;  Undoubtedly they are meant to be covered by the Bill.  How to make the Bill apply to them effectively is an extremely difficult question.  I would be ready to consider with the greatest sympathy any effective amendment put forward for dealing with that class.  If I can think of any amendment myself between this and the Committee Stage I may be able to bring a suitable one <Col N="542" /> forward.  The other points are really ones for dealing with in Committee. On the question of age, that was the subject of a rather long discussion in the Dáil, and the objections were examined.  I feel that we have, considering the whole economic circumstances of the country, from that point of view, gone as far as we could go.</P>

      <P>I can very briefly explain what this Order means.  A date was fixed in the permanent Summer Time Act passed by the Oireachtas last year.  The Act provided that that date might be varied by an Order of the Minister for Justice. Last year the time at which Summer Time came into force was different in the Free State and in Northern Ireland, and I think was also different in France.  This year, if you pass this motion approving of the Minister's Order, Summer Time will commence on exactly the same date in the Free State, in Northern Ireland, in Great Britain, and in France.  The date is, I think, 18th April.  It is hardly necessary to argue that that is clearly an advantage, and that it is very clearly, generally desirable both from a railway and general business point of view.  It is extremely awkward to have different dates on which the time is changed in the different countries.</P>

In reference to Senator Sir John Keane's motion there is an amendment standing in the name of Senator O'Farrell. Senator O'Farrell is very anxious about his amendment but he has been detained on public business.  I am expecting him here every minute.  Perhaps if we passed on to the motions standing in the names of Senators MacKean and Fitzgerald we could deal with them first.  With regard to these motions they are practically identical and, of course, I could not have a discussion on both.  The only difference I see is that the drinks are not mixed. Senator MacKean deals with spirits and beer while Senator Martin Fitzgerald is confined to whiskey.  I think the motions are practically identical and I would suggest to Senator MacKean that if he introduced into his motion the question of the excessive taxation of whiskey that would cover both motions.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Executive Council be requested to take into consideration for the purpose of their Finance Bill for the coming year, the existing duties on spirits and beer, with a view to their reduction and consequent relief to the trade and commerce of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is confidently assumed not only by those connected with the liquor interests but by the general public that there will be some substantial remissions made in the duties on Irish whiskey and beer in our coming budget. I have tabled this motion before the Budget is introduced to this House so that the Executive Council and the Minister for Finance may have the help and guidance of the suggestions of Senators who will discuss this motion.</P>
      <P>The Senate has no power to amend a Money Bill&mdash;only to make recommendations beforehand as when financial decisions have been arrived at they are not likely to be altered.  At the present moment there is a universal outcry against oppressive taxation not only here but in every European country. The pessimists and the &ldquo;grousers&rdquo; and those opposed to the Free State Government, have focussed their hostility on this question of taxation, and can always command a sympathetic audience as the burden of taxation is almost intolerable, and it would seem if something to alleviate it is not done soon, the country will drift into bankruptcy. It is a duty of the members of the Oireachtas to offer what helpful suggestions they can to the Government, and it is in this spirit that I hope the suggestions on this motion will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no interest that can put forward a stronger claim for the remission of taxation than the liquor <Col N="547" /> trade.  Directly and indirectly this great trade contributes a large share of the taxes which enables the Government to carry on.  Taxation which draws away from a trade so much capital that cripples its initiative and expansibility is unjust and an economic crime.  Month by month we see the diminishing returns in the duty on spirits, showing that this trade is being slowly but surely wiped out.  The Government, on the one hand, is financing out of the taxes a beet-root project, the result of which is extremely problematical, and, on the other, they are taxing to its depth an industry which is giving more employment and is of much more financial benefit to the State than ever the beet-root project can hope to be.  The decline in Irish distilling is keeping pace with the increase of taxation.  In 1901 when the duty was 11/- per gallon on whiskey, there were thirty distilleries in Ireland, which kept in constant employment 10,000 families; but as taxation increased year after year and time after time, the industry was being gradually crushed out.  In 1921 the duty was raised to £3 12s. 6d., and in a few years there were only twenty distilleries, giving intermittent employment, and to-day not three distilleries in the Free State are working full time.  During these years Persse's Galway Distillery expired; Devereux, Wexford; Cassidy's, Monasterevan; Walker's, Limerick, to mention only a few of the principal distilleries, have also closed their doors and thrown their workers out of employment and forced them to emigrate.</P>
    <P>Like many of the corn and the flour mills, the ruins of the distillery buildings will stand as reproachful reminders to our people of the downfall of another industry which formerly gave much employment.  But not alone the workers in these concerns have suffered, but also the farmers whose oats and barley were bought by the distillers and the brewers, and the railway companies, the shipping companies, the canal companies, as well as carters and tradesmen, will also suffer. It is a great pity, at the present time, that some of the Irish distilleries should be wiped out of existence and <Col N="548" /> that Scotch whiskey should be allowed into the country to compete unfairly with the home-made article.  Scotch whiskey comes in 30 underproof.  It is to the benefit of the shopkeepers to sell it in preference to Irish whiskey, the strength of which is 25 underproof. Scotch whiskey, therefore, is a few shillings a bottle more profitable to retail on the part of the publicans than the Irish-made article.  The Cathaoirleach, some nights ago, stated at a social function that he was glad to see the people of Ireland were beginning to laugh again.  It is easy enough to laugh at a well-prepared festive board, but I think that the workman who has to pay 8d. for his bottle of stout and 1/8 for a glass of whiskey will not laugh much until the Government sees its way to give him a chance.</P>
    <P>I would point out further that the by-products of the distilleries afford valuable feeding stuff for pigs and cattle and were utilised for many purposes. Now foreign feeding stuff has to be bought whose value as a food is not in it with the products of the distilleries. I submit it is obvious then from these facts something should be done to lighten the burden of taxation on Irish whiskey and beer.  The teetotal people should remember that the present high duties are not assisting their cause but are increasing illicit distillation.  Some years ago there was much controversy over the respective merits of pot still, which is now practically the only whiskey manufactured in Ireland, and patent still, and Scotch whiskey is mostly patent still. In those days I heard the different kinds of spirits thus described as follows: Pot still, a liquid stimulant; patent still, liquid excitement; potheen, liquid madness.</P>
    <P>In this humid and variable climate of ours most people find the necessity for some stimulant to increase physical and mental vitality.  Teetotallers should also remember that if there are not luxuries to tax the Government will, in the inspired words of the Governor-General, have to tax stir-about.</P>
    <P>Now criticism which is merely destructive and has no constructive suggestions to make is of little use.  Therefore. I would suggest to the Executive <Col N="549" /> that they take off as much duty as will permit Irish whiskey to be sold at 1/- per glass even if it necessitates the general reducing of the standard strength to 30 u.p.  With regard to stout I would suggest that the Government should approach Messrs. Guinness and Co. who are making an abnormally large profit, so that by equally reducing the manufactured price, and remitting duty, they should permit stout to be sold at 4d. per bottle or per pint.  If this were done the ordinary middle-class people and workers would laugh again and a good deal of the hostility to the Government would be abated and the pessimistic feeling now so common would disappear. The pessimistic feeling is largely responsible for the want of of effort and efficiency in work.  The younger generation, fed up with the perpetual fault finding, now consider their country as a fit place to live out of.  Of course there would be a serious loss of revenue but the revenue month by month is rapidly diminishing anyway.  To make up for this loss extra duty should be put on foreign spirits&mdash;Scotch whiskies, gin, rum, brandy, etc.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest to the Minister that he should put a prohibitive tax on the medicated and faked wines which are now flooding the country, and which analysis show to be rotten trash.  Such wines as Wincarnis, Hall's wine and the other worthless trash are sold with nothing of any value connected with them, but the label and advertising matter.  Our Ministers seem to be bitten with the fine frenzy of legislating, but the country is fed up with legislation.  It has got legislative indigestion, and it would be much better if our Government turned its attention to work of a constructive kind. This generation has suffered enough and made sacrifices enough to secure the measure of liberty we now enjoy, and something should be left for the next generation to do.  The Minister for Finance has told us the London Agreement has enhanced the credit of the Free State and increased its borrowing possibilities; why not then float a loan which would help to ease the burden of taxation for the next few years?  It would ease the great burden of taxation <Col N="550" /> which is now pressing generally on the people, and which is specially oppressive to the trade on whose behalf I move this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I would like to point out that we had in Ireland a very valuable industry in distilling, for which we had a world-wide reputation in the past.  A number of the distilleries have been wiped out.  In dealing with this matter I will confine myself to recent dates, as there is no use in going back to ancient history.  In 1900 the taxation on whiskey was 11/- per gallon.  The quantity of whiskey then made in Ireland would have been about 14 million gallons, roughly.  In 1909 the taxation on whiskey increased from 11/- to 14/9.  Immediately after that taxation came into operation the production and consumption of spirits went down, and the revenue derived from the taxation of spirits was much lower in 1910 and 1911 than in 1908. Even as late as 1921 we had 12 large distilleries working and giving employment to a great number of men.  In Dublin three distilleries employed over 800 men, and paid in wages over £100,000.  These three distilleries are now carrying on business with less than 70 men and with wages under £15,000. We are talking about unemployment. These distilleries bought over one million barrels of barley and oats in the year, and the total of barley, oats and rye bought this year would not exceed 70 thousand barrels.  In the years 1923-24, in the County of Carlow, the average price was 25/- per barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning I was speaking to a man who told me that in other years he bought 12,000 barrels, but this year he only bought 4,000.  Another man also made the statement at a meeting of farmers that in 1923-24 he bought 25,000 barrels, and this year he did not buy a barrel.  The fact is that what produces the revenue, what makes the mare go, is being absolutely wiped out. I would like to call attention to the fact that in a small district consisting of Kilbeggan, Tullamore, and Monasterevan there were three distilleries, and none of them is working to-day. These, between them, purchased and gave a good price for the produce of <Col N="551" /> 5,000 acres of land.  We are asked to till the land.  They gave 25/- a barrel for barley, and then the land was tilled. Now they are giving 17/6, and the thing is absolutely wiped out.</P>
    <P>These distilleries have not made one single gallon of whiskey this year.  In 1923 we had twelve distilleries working, and to-day we have three, two on middling time, and one on practically no time.  That is the state of affairs in the twenty-six counties.  The duty on whiskey in 1909 was 11/-.  Then it was increased to 14/9, and during the whole period of the war the duty on whiskey remained at 14/9.  In 1919 the duty was increased to 30/-, and in 1920 to 50/- &mdash;that, of course, was under the British Government&mdash;and in 1921 it was increased to 72/6.  I would like the House to consider what that tax means.  The cost of production of whiskey at proof gallon, after giving a good price to the farmer for barley and oats, would be about 4/-.  Any man who cannot make a decent profit as a manufacturer at 4/- ought to get out of the trade.  You pay a duty on that of practically twenty times the cost of production.  If a man bought a collar for 6d., but before he put that collar on his neck it cost him 10/-, how many collars would he wear?  There is no industry or product, I do not care what it is, let it be even gold or diamonds, would bear a taxation of six times the cost of production, not to say twenty times the cost.  Here you are wiping out an industry in which there is actually invested over £5,000,000, not to speak of the immense amount of employment that the industry gives.  In Carlow we have invested £152,000 for the production of sugar. What does the production of sugar mean?  I can buy and ship into the Port of Dublin to-day and deliver all we want of sugar at 15/- per cwt.  In round figures that is 1½d. per lb., yet we are creating an industry in Carlow and giving a bonus of 2½d. per lb. for the making of sugar.</P>
    <P>We go and spend in ten years a great deal over a million pounds of money in producing what can never pay.  I wonder what is the sense of establishing an <Col N="552" /> industry in Carlow, and, for the purpose of doing that, taxing us here for it and taxing the man in Kinvara.  A man in Kinvara raised a field of barley and sold it here in Dublin.  He had a market for the stuff.  But the man in Kinvara who grew his barley cannot send that barley to Carlow.  The man who grew barley down in Bandon sold it to the distilleries in Cork.  Where can he sell it now?  Still he is being asked to grow more barley.  Where the man got 25/- for his barley in 1924, he is now getting only 17/6.  But he cannot get even 17/6.  That is only a nominal price. He cannot sell it at all.  The barley is on his hands, and he is told to feed pigs with it.  That reminds me of the man who complained that his chickens were drowned by the bursting of a water pipe and when he complained of this to the water rate man, the latter told him to keep ducks!</P>
    <P>Here you are deliberately wiping out an industry which is a credit to the country.  In any part of the world wherever one went, one found that Irish whiskey was held in very high repute.  Now what do you do?  You have here an item of £50,000 to put up a bottle works.  And we were told last year that you could have any kind and colour of bottle you like, black, white, yellow, green, or any other colour. You have not even white, green or yellow bottles and if you import those bottles you have to pay 1/- a dozen duty.  Any Dublin merchant who imports bottles into Dublin will have to pay 1/- a dozen.  You can bring them in holding Scotch whiskey which represents a by-product of yeast at sixpence a dozen.  All the bottles you want you can bring in under a by-product of yeast which will compete with the high-class product of our own home-grown barley.</P>
    <P>I do not like to take up the time of the Seanad with too much figures.  But in the Dublin Distilleries alone the amount of employment given would come to £70,000 a year.  These men were earning good wages under decent and good conditions of employment. Every man of these was earning on an average at least £3 per week.  Now you take these men and you put them with their backs to the wall and give them <Col N="553" /> the dole.  Is it not most disheartening? Then you ruin an industry that has made a good name for Ireland, has given so much employment and has purchased so much agricultural produce from the farmers.  I say it is not only unhealthy but it is immoral.  It is ruinous.  Things happened in the past when the old woollen industry was ruined here, many strange things happened. Now we have what is supposed to be a Free State.  There is no reason why we ourselves should follow in the steps of England.  The Minister for Finance and the Executive Council did a wise and bold stroke last year.  I take off my hat every time to the Ministers we have in the Saorstát.  I think they are the most wonderful body of young men that has ever come to the front anywhere.  I think that if they would only take into their counsel men of older experience than themselves they would do much better even than they are doing.</P>
    <P>I saw yesterday where the Minister for Finance remarked when somebody spoke of setting up a Geddes Committee that the officials could put their fingers in the eyes of the Committee and fool them.  I do not think that any set of Government officials or civil servants would be able to fool the Members of this House.  I do not think these officials would be able to fool Senator Foran or Senator Farren or the Chairman; I think the man who would be able to put the winkers on them would have to get up very early in the morning.  I say that while the Minister for Finance is a very able man, he has not yet attained that experience which comes from age and being matured and having grown up in business.  He has not as yet attained that sort of experience. I look at the Executive Council as being the most wonderful body of men in the world.  Compare them with the Ministers in France.  We here at home do not recognise their abilities fully.</P>
    <P>But look at France.  France is a country where finance has made one gigantic blunder after another.  Gigantic blunders have been made by finance in England.  One day the Cabinet there is up to its eyes in one thing and the next day they are up to their noses in <Col N="554" /> something else.  Here you had a young untrained Government and it has done extraordinarily well for the country. With a little more thoughtfulness they might do better, and I suggest that permitting a big industry to be wiped out is a thing that ought not be thought of, unless the industry was a bad one and I do not think anybody can say that this is a bad industry.  From a revenue point of view I might point that there is far less revenue being got now than formerly from this industry.  And then you have fifty times more potheen being made than you had in the past. Any day I want it I can buy 500 gallons of potheen.  That is an absolute fact.  There is no trouble about it.  It is being made wholesale.  The men who start to make potheen know their ground.  You might as well try to catch them as to catch a poacher. If you want to prevent a poacher from catching a rabbit you will have to catch him before he catches the rabbit. If you take into consideration the wages paid in this industry of distilling, the capital employed, the market that this industry gives the farmer, and the injustice that is being done to the revenue, you will admit that there is a strong case made for the motion. The revenue that was got in the past from this industry is not now raised from it.</P>
    <P>The Government is losing in many directions.  A distillery that is making no money not only pays no duty but it pays no income tax.  The employees who worked in that distillery are not paying income tax because they have now no revenue from which to pay it. I can, if the Seanad wishes it, give figures which would astound it as far as the returns go.  These figures show what we did produce a few years ago and what we are down to now.  This year the amount of whiskey produced in this country is less than one-twentieth of what it was ten years ago. That is caused primarily by the high taxation on spirits.  The industry cannot stand the high taxation that is put on it.  Scotch whiskey, made as a by-product of yeast, is competing with Irish whiskey.  Irish whiskey cannot compete with whiskey which does not cost more than one penny a gallon to <Col N="555" /> make.  If this whiskey were not taken into their stocks in Scotland at one penny a gallon it would go down their sewers.</P>
    <P>It is sold in this country at 35 u.p. The only regulation is that a shopkeeper is to put up a card marked &ldquo;Scotch Whiskey, 35 u.p.&rdquo;  A man can have more than 35 u.p., and he buys it cheaper.  Here, if an Irishman has whiskey 30 u.p., except he puts the card in such a way that every customer will see it, he is fined under the Food and Drugs Act.  There is another thing. Good whiskey will not bear reducing by water and be clear the same as other whiskey will.  With these few remarks I ask the House to say that the distilling and the other taxes are entirely too high and that an opportunity should be given to this important industry to live.</P>

      <P>Senator Fitzgerald has talked a great deal about barley and about the small amount that is being produced now in comparison with former times.  I should like to say something very interesting with regard to barley.  There is hope for the Irish farmer still.  You have all heard of Webb and Sons, great seed merchants.  I know Mr. Webb.  This is what happened.  You must all remember that this season has been the worst season for barley known for many years owing to the rain. Webb and Sons, one of the largest seed merchants in the United Kingdom, look for their seeds everywhere throughout England and Europe, because they wish to sell their customers the best seed they can.</P>
      <P>After Mr. Webb had searched everywhere for good barley seed he came to Ireland.  That barley was grown on the border of Queen's and King's Counties. He bought the whole of the produce of that farm and paid a record price for it.  That only shows you that the Irish farmer, under most exceptional circumstances, could grow as good seed as anyone in the world.  I think fifteen to twenty tons of barley were taken.  It was sampled, and after sending a man over, Mr. Webb took the lot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JACKSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not profess to <Col N="556" /> know very much about the importation, sale or manufacture of whiskey, but I think Senator Fitzgerald has raised a very important point as regards industry.  I cannot understand why the Government has not taken action long ago.  I refer more particularly to the substitution of Scotch for Irish whiskey.  Irish whiskey cannot be sold unless it is lower than 25 under proof, but Scotch whiskey can be sold at 50.  My attention was drawn, some time ago, to large casks on the country roads in the district from which I come. I asked some of the men what they were carrying home, and was told that it was whiskey and other articles of that kind.  I was also told that where formerly there would be eight or ten cases of Irish whiskey with one of Scotch, now there would be ten of Scotch to one Irish.  The Government will hardly meet the question of taxation in a hearty spirit, seeing that it means a loss of revenue, but why they could not put an embargo on Scotch whiskey, and compel Scotch distilleries to sell on equal terms with our own, I cannot imagine.</P>
      <P>I have been told that the taste of people for Scotch whiskey has been changed.  So long as Scotch whiskey is in consumption why should the Government allow it to come in on such favourable terms to the detriment of our own whiskey trade?  If the publican gets greater profit on the sale of Scotch whiskey, then it is his duty to tell his customers that Scotch is better. Even with a reduction of taxation it will take some time to change the tastes of the people again, but if the present taxation goes on, as Senator Fitzgerald said, soon you will not need any Irish distilleries.  It is decidedly a loss from every point of view, and a most serious thing for the country.</P>

That that would be a relief to the trade and commerce of Ireland, is cant.  I have no other word for <Col N="557" /> it.

      <P>It has been represented that enormous quantities of barley and oats are now used for the production of whiskey.  Surely the resources of civilisation as to the use of <Col N="558" /> barley and oats are not exhausted if these crops are not turned into whiskey.  People are encouraged to produce more of these crops and they can be used more generally for the production of food which I submit is more advantageous to the country than the production of whiskey.  The Government wants money for a great many things.  We had a Minister here to-day who frankly admitted, as the President admitted in the Dáil, that money is wanted for education and for school buildings.  I submit that if money can be raised in this way, which is optional taxation, it is very much better than any other form of taxation that is suggested at the present time.  We have other interests pressing for the relief of taxation.  Most of us would be pleased if we got relief on income tax.  I believe it would mean that capital would be available to finance trade and industry. If we are to take the duties off liquor I can see no relief of taxation in our time.  It does not need a very astute mind to recognise that a great deal of the expenditure necessary in this country has been caused by the abuse of drink.  It is only necessary to read the returns of the mental hospitals and the prisons.  I am not here to make a temperance speech but when we see the misery, which is preventable, that is caused by drink and when we see people who are interested in these trades standing up to advocate the remission of taxation I repeat it is cant.

      <P>I rise not for the purpose of opposing this motion, or of discussing it, but to suggest that the occasion on which it has been brought forward is not at all opportune.  It is brought forward less than three weeks from the introduction of the Budget in the Dáil.  The Minister knows perfectly and accurately what money he has to get, and I am perfectly certain that both he and the Government have made up their minds how they are going to get it.  If the Minister for Finance has made up his mind to reduce the duty on spirits and beer, then the motion before the Seanad is unnecessary. On the other hand, if he has made up his mind to leave those <Col N="559" /> duties as they are, we will be only stultifying ourselves by passing the resolution. Another reason why I think we ought not to do more than discuss this subject, and certainly not allow it to go as far as a division, is that it is no use suggesting that the duties on spirits and beer ought to be lowered, unless you have some alternative plan by which the money which is necessary for the running of this country can be provided. Neither the mover nor the seconder of the resolution suggested any alternative by which the money now produced by these duties would be obtained.  I suggest to the Seanad that this is an inopportune time to have brought forward this motion, and for our own dignity it would be better, after discussing it, as thoroughly as Senators please, to let it be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I confess that I am astonished at the arguments of Senator Brown.  I really never heard an argument in principle which seemed to be so absolutely wrong as he has brought forward.  He suggests that it is a very inopportune moment to press for a reduction in taxation; firstly, because the Ministers have already made up their minds or intend to make up their minds on the matter.  I really forget now what reasons he put forward secondly, but they seemed to me to be very unreasonable.  Are we to close our mouths here and not say anything about a reduction of taxation?  He also suggests that unless a Senator can provide an alternative method of raising taxation, he is not to say anything. As far as I know, and as the Senator himself must know perfectly well, it is not our business to suggest alternatives. It is the business of the Ministry appointed for that purpose, to find out the best method of raising taxation.  It is our duty, and the duty of the Dáil, to say that taxation should be reduced if we think so, and it is the business of the Ministry to find out how that could be done.  To suggest that nobody is to criticise anything unless we go into all the details of how it is to be done, seems to me to take away entirely from the duties of the Ministers themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dowdall made a very extraordinary attack on two Senators.  He <Col N="560" /> is, himself, I understand, a business man.  He deals in various things and does that mean that he is never going to raise any question dealing with his own business because it might help himself?  Are the farmers here to say nothing regarding their own business because it concerns themselves?  They represent the farmers, and they are bound to bring forward anything here concerning the farming class.  I think it is rather insulting to raise the question in that way, and I am astonished the Senator did so.  I do not intend to argue the liquor question.  I am, myself, opposed to intoxicating drink, but the main point in this matter is the question of Scotch drink, which is notoriously very bad, while the Irish whiskey is very good.  That matter was inquired into at great length a few years ago.  The whole question of distilled spirits was gone into.  The pot-still whiskey is manufactured on entirely different basis to the Scotch whiskey, which is patent-still.</P>
    <P>Those Senators who oppose this motion seem to think that taxation must be allowed because the Minister wants it, but it has been shown that there is an actual reduction in revenue owing to the excessive taxation.  The State has been taxed to such an extent that there is a reduction of the income provided by taxation.  I do not know why they glossed over that point.  For many years one of the greatest questions between England and Ireland was the question of taxation on Irish whiskey, and all our Parliamentary representatives resolutely opposed the taxation of Irish whiskey, because it was an unfair burden on the industry. Now these matters have changed, but the taxation is still too excessive.</P>

I think we should allow Senator Toal to have an opportunity of moving his motion and speaking to it <Col N="561" /> now.  When that is disposed of, we will see whether we will adjourn consideration of the motion at present under discussion to the next sitting or resume it this evening.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in the opinion of the Seanad the upkeep and maintenance of the main roads and trunk roads of Saorstát Eireann should be made a national charge.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion standing in my name for discussion here to-day is no stranger to any of us.  Such a proposal in one form or another has appeared repeatedly in the public Press during the last four or five years, but up to the present I have not seen anywhere an intelligent discussion on so important a proposition. The handing over of the trunk and main roads of the Saorstát for maintenance by the State will ultimately be shown to be either a right policy or a wrong one.  More likely, perhaps, some middle course will be decided on as the most desirable.  At this stage I do not desire to press my views very definitely. My intention is to arouse discussion on a matter of great public concern, and acting in the spirit of the Cathaoir-leach's suggestion I am convinced that a debate in this House on a matter of so much importance to the economic life of the Saorstát cannot fail to be helpful to those who must ultimately find a solution.  As I have already indicated, the subject is controversial but without committing myself to any definite proposals I cannot fail to be impressed with the information in my possession, that most European countries and most of the American States have for their leading roads, adopted a system of State control either altogether or in part.  France, of course, is the great example, whose national routes were in existence entirely under State control before the time of Napoleon and were, until the war at all events, a model to the entire world. I regret to say that I fear the condition <Col N="562" /> of the roads of France is not in a satisfactory condition at present.  Other countries followed the example of France, and to-day there is scarcely a country in Europe where the State system of control is not in operation in some or every degree, as regards their main roads.</P>
    <P>England was the last important European country to adopt the system of partial State control and with characteristic British caution it was begun about 1909 in a very tentative way, and consisted merely of a system of State subsidies to local authorities who, having got the grant remained the administrative authority.  About the end of the war, the Road Board as we know it, gave way to the Ministry of Transport and with the aid of the country surveyors and their assistants a system of trunk and main roads, or as one might call them, national routes of the 1st class and 2nd class were scheduled, and the proposal was that the State should pay 50 per cent. of the cost of the maintenance and repair of the 1st class and 25 per cent. of similar work of the second class.</P>
    <P>Hitherto it should be noted the Road Board merely contributed towards the cost of special improvements and nothing towards general maintenance. For some time prior to the establishment of the Ministry of Transport the question as to whether there was an obligation on the State to pay for the maintenance as well as the improvement of the main roads, was hotly debated, and was decided in the affirmative by a Royal Commission on Local Taxation in 1901, and by a Departmental Committee on highways in 1903. Thus, at the present day the local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland are relieved of the cost of ordinary maintenance to the extent of 50 per cent. on first class roads, and 25 per cent. on second class roads, as well as receiving a contribution towards all approved special improvements of about 50 per cent.  This scheme is, of course, in operation also in the Six Counties, as I have indicated, where it has been given an extension in this manner.  The Six County Government contributes 60 per cent. of the cost of maintenance of first <Col N="563" /> class roads, 25 per cent. of the cost of the second class roads, and about 15 per cent. of the cost of the third class roads, and in addition, the local authorities receive a contribution of about 50 per cent. towards the execution of special works of improvement.  It may be said that the Free State contributes considerable sums towards special improvements within its area, and that I freely admit, but if there is a case for State intervention in the case of special improvements, there is surely as strong a case for State intervention in the case of maintenance, as it is the traffic for which they are improved, in order that they may adequately carry it, that eventually wears them out.</P>
    <P>Now, let me say again that I do not desire to put forward quite definite views at this juncture, but I do think I have made a case for serious discussion, and let me hope, also, whatever decision is come to here to-day, that this matter will not be allowed to drop until we here have thrashed it out thoroughly and in the best interests of the State.  I am aware that the railway interests are opposed to any considerable improvement in the roads, at all events to the extent of developing existing competition with the railways. As a railway shareholder, I am not naturally forgetful of the fact that the development of the highway borne traffic could reach a stage which would mean death or the next worst thing to the railways; and one must not forget that it would be serious to do violence in that degree in a poor country to so many people who have invested a good part of their savings in railway stock, not to talk of the many institutions, charitable or otherwise, that depend for a good part of their income on railway dividends.  Here, too, however, discussion may reveal a solution.  It would be wrong in any case to ever again allow the railways an undisputed monopoly, for the high railway freights which would result would be one of the greatest hindrances to economic development.  If by any chance such a monopoly should again come into being, I for one would work strenuously for reasonable but effective State supervision of all railway <Col N="564" /> charges.  There need be no monopoly whatever, for there is a middle course if we can fix it properly.</P>
    <P>We must develop, by whatever means we can, our tourist traffic, and for that reason our national highways must be sufficiently good to attract the visitor with the motor car.  In whatever form the State controls matters like these they can be satisfactorily adjusted in such a way that every interest can be considered and no interest I hope will receive more consideration than that of the farmers on the ground that it is they who above all others keep the wheels of the Free State revolving.  I must not forget the labourers whose position at the present time is not nearly as good as what they are entitled to expect under a well-regulated State.  I hope that whatever proposals are carried into effect they will mean more work for the labourers and less of the demoralising dole which in my experience is by no means liked by the best labourers in this country.  In any case, the labourers deserve more con-consideration than they have received hitherto.  I disagree with much of the criticisms that have been made on labour and I can certify from my own knowledge that the efficiency of labour on the county roads with which I am familiar is as high as could be expected. Now this question is a very serious one at the present time.  As most Senators know, the country is not in a position to bear any higher taxation and if we are to provide for the traffic that our roads will have to maintain we will have to have increased taxation. Within the last 15 or 20 years the expenditure on the roads has trebled. No doubt we will be told that many grants had been made but I hold that the grants that had been made were not at all sufficient and I hold that we will never have proper roads under the present system.  We must have some kind of central control before we can get the roads up to a uniform condition.</P>
    <P>About two years ago I think the Government announced that they were going to give a large grant, something like one million of money, for road expenditure. I think the local authorities were a good deal disappointed in <Col N="565" /> regard to that grant because from my experience I find that the grants we have received have partly come from local taxation, that is, from motor taxation, and from the Damage to Property Account.  I think if we are to get our roads up to the standard required in Ireland it would be necessary that we would get at least some State aid.  I hope the Government will take serious notice of the strong feeling that exists all over the country that sufficient taxation must be put on heavy lorries. Our roads were not built for carrying the heavy traffic placed upon them at the present time.</P>
    <P>I remember, on the passing of the Local Government Act when we took to repairing the roads, we had to start at the foundations.  We tried to build them up for the ordinary traffic, and the roads are certainly not fit to bear the new traffic that has since been put upon it.  Therefore, I think if motor lorries are to be allowed to destroy our roads they must pay for them.  The farming community at the present time can not afford to pay higher taxation, and I appeal to the members of the Seanad to impress upon the Government the necessity for immediate legislation either in the form of State control or partial State control, or whatever other method they consider best in this matter.  I hope the Government will take serious notice of the necessity of introducing legislation at the proper time to deal with heavy motor traffic. I am convinced, and I speak from experience, that if the Government do not take up this matter immediately they will not be able to put their legislation in force in connection with this matter before January next.  This is a very serious matter.  Even in Northern Ireland they have come to see the necessity for increasing the taxes on motor lorries.  Something must be done in the Saorstát, and I hope the result of this discussion will enable us to arrive at some proper solution of this question. The ratepayers are not able to bear any more taxation in regard to the roads; they have made great efforts to keep them up to a reasonable standard; they have gone as far as they can, and it is now for the State to try and assist in whatever manner they <Col N="566" /> think right to maintain the roads at a proper standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesParkinson" hpid="Mr. PARKINSON Mr. PARKINSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. PARKINSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion.  Senator Toal has told us that the effect of his motion will mean increased taxation.  Those of us who are unlucky enough to pay some little taxes know that the country is not in a position to spend any more money on national taxation.  I would make this suggestion to Senator Toal as an alternative means of revenue: that the Minister for Finance should consider the taxation of one or other of the trusts that supply oil, which is the main motor power for all heavy transport.  Ireland at the present time is supplied with oil by four different trusts.  We are told it is good for trade to have competition.</P>
      <P>The only competition I see existing at the moment is that between the heavy lorries delivering petrol to the various towns.  That may be of some interest to the farmers and others who watch these fellows racing along the roads, but it is not of any possible benefit to the people who buy petrol.  The price of petrol is a flat price, and it is now and has been a higher price than that in London.  Up to lately the price of petrol here was 2d. per gallon more than in London, and it is now 1d. more. I would suggest to the Minister that instead of having four competing companies with a flat price he should give the total supply of petrol to one company and the Government should make the price themselves.  That would eliminate three-quarters of the wear and tear on the roads.  There is not a very great difference in petrol; it is all practically the same sort of material. If the price were fixed at a flat rate based on the London price of petrol the users in this country would get their oil at the London price.  A royalty could be levied on the oil supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The oil used in this country would be about twenty million gallons, and I suggest that a royalty of threepence per gallon would produce £250,000.  On that a capital sum of £4,000,000 could be borrowed, which could be devoted straight off to the reconstruction of the roads, which, as Senator Toal <Col N="567" /> wants, would be under State control. I think that the Seanad might embody that suggestion in Senator Toal's motion.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I was away on 3rd March when the Cathaoirleach mentioned the business of the Seanad.  He said there were several matters in which many Senators here were quite qualified to give a lead to public opinion, and at any rate to impress the public with the conviction that so far as we can we are anxious for a full and free discussion on these matters.  I agree with that entirely, but I fear you, sir, have let loose a flood of oratory which it will be difficult to stem.  Senators must now settle definitely and decisively the affairs of the nation, and in a satisfactory manner, I am sure.  You will listen, sir, with forbearing patience to all we have to say.  I must inform you candidly that I shall not play a lone hand in this matter.  I have listened with much interest to Senator Toal's long statement on his motion, but surely it is a very old story calling on the Government to help in this matter. We have heard that for many years in this country, and I thought we had rather done with that sort of thing.  It reminds one of the resolutions that used to be passed and put into every local paper one had the misfortune to read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only does the Senator call on the Government, but practically his motion is nationalisation of our highways.  Are we going to nationalise our highways, for that is what it amounts to?  I feel myself borne on the wings of fancy to the big square of Moscow where Socialism is preached and Communism is worshipped as a god.  I am quite ready to have that statement refuted.  The nationalisation of our main and trunk roads is an extreme which I doubt this Senate will reach.  I ask myself what really is the object of this motion?  Is it to relieve the farmer from paying rates, or is it a move on Senator Toal's part because he feels that a general election is looming in the distance in 1927?  If it is to relieve the farmer of his rateable dues, one must remember that he uses the roads like other <Col N="568" /> citizens.  In a small State like ours of twenty-six counties, the motor traffic is intensive, and what is more, the motor traffic has come to stay.  That has been argued in this House many times, and I have had much pleasure in listening to it.  Imagine the roads without motors, as I and many here have seen them.  The farmer drove his produce to the nearest railway station, and he had to pay dearly for freightage.  Now he sends his produce by his own car or his own lorry.  He loads it up at his farm, and unloads it at the market which suits him.  There is only one loading and one unloading.  Anyone who understands trade will say that that is the proper way under modern conditions to carry on trade.  Does the farmer want the present state of affairs entirely done away with?  I imagine he does not.  If not, what does he want?</P>
    <P>I fail to find any constructive policy whatever in the motion put forward by Senator Toal.  The Senator calls on the Government to supply funds, and then he says that the farmer objects to overtaxation.  He further says that the heavy lorries are cutting up the roads. Well, we all know that.  If the State pays for the upkeep of the main and the trunk roads the money must be found somewhere, and it can only be acquired by increased taxation.  The Senator has answered himself twice in his address.  Everyone, not only in this country but on the other side of the water, is howling about taxation, and I feel inclined to howl with the loudest of them.  That form of grumbling is excessively satisfactory to the individual, but the masses take not the smallest notice of these disgruntled people, or anyone else.  They want to get to the nearest market to buy or sell as expeditiously and comfortably as they can.  Possibly we are all now motorists.  If we cannot afford a motor we ride a push-bike; failing that, we take a horse-drawn vehicle, or an ass's car; failing that shanks' mere, the latter being slow but sure, especially when one is driving his pigs, cattle, geese or turkeys to his favourite fair. I hope the Seanad will not pass this motion.  It leads to nothing and is only a pious opinion, but it does this: it is asking the Government for more <Col N="569" /> money.  I want to know where that money is to come form?  I do not see any way whatever of getting it.  The Senator suggested that there should be a tax on lorries.  Senator Parkinson said that the price of petrol would go up. Well, that cuts both ways.  He knows that as well as I do.  I therefore feel that the Senator has led us into a blind alley and I am not going to follow him. If this goes to a division I shall go into the division lobby against the Senator.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will remember that during the discussion on the Local Government Bill last year I struck a note of warning and suggested&mdash;not with any sinister intent&mdash;that certain events would happen which have actually happened&mdash;that in many counties the ratepayers in the form of the farmers would obtain control of the councils and that they would be driven in their economy along the line of least resistance.  I said that this would mean a reduction of expenditure <Col N="570" /> on the roads.  The councils would naturally be reluctant to reduce expenditure on the services of the poor, and in many other respects their hands were tied.  Now the roads were the only item of expenditure which they could reduce.  I pointed out those things.  That has now happened, and we are faced with a problem of considerable magnitude, and one which we must view with alarm.  The expenditure in this coming year on our roads is below the limit which will enable the roads to be maintained satisfactorily. Further, once the roads begin to deteriorate, they will deteriorate rapidly, and then we will be met with an enormous capital expenditure to put those roads right again.  Now, I did not move this motion to embarrass the Government.  I fully appreciate their difficulties.  The problem is one of intense complexity, not only on its technical side, but on its financial side.  It is a policy which must be approached with regard to long views.  No hand-to-mouth method of treatment to meet all this will bring us any nearer to a solution, but will in fact land us in further perplexities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have further to recognise at the outset that motor transport has come to stay.  Motor transport is civilising in its effect in so far as rapid locomotion can be said to have a civilising influence. I think, however, that that civilising influence is much exaggerated, because it has led to trouble in the way of nerves and restlessness. However, in ordinary parlance, this mechanical perfection of rapid locomotion is regarded by most of us as having a civilising influence.  The present Lord Balfour had in the eighties the problem of developing congested districts by light railways.  We have the problem before us all the time.  The obvious method would be to improve the roads and rely on motor transport with all the flexibility it possesses, to support the needs of transport.  There are, in this motor transport, possibilities for future enterprise.  We all know that if they wished it, our railways to-day could not raise capital, and any extension of transport service, if we are going to rely on private enterprise must be met out of the development <Col N="571" /> of motor service.  The present difficulty of competition between the roads and the railways which is carried on to the serious deterioration of the roads is the outcome of economic causes, to that extent that motors can provide certain services to the public at a certain cost.  Naturally, the owners of the motor service have no special regard to the harm they do to the roads.  They try to supply the service. In so far as it is competition to benefit the consumer, it must be respected.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the tendency all along the line in this as in all economic affairs is to ignore the third of the three parties&mdash;Labour, capital, and the consumer.  And the consumer is a very important party.  I regard the development of motor services as the best protection the consumer could have for cheaper transport.  I notice the tendency of syndicalism&mdash;a combination of capital and the workers to entrench themselves to the detriment of the consumer. If we unduly restrict the development of our road service beyond what is wise and necessary in the interests of road finance, we may bring about that state of affairs and entrench certain interests in the railway service to the detriment of the consumer which should be the first consideration of the State.  The policy of the State, therefore, should be one of a minimum restriction so as not to dry up all the living springs of individual effort and capitalistic enterprise.  The benefit to the consumer, as distinct from those directly engaged in transport services, should be the main concern of the State.</P>
    <P>Regarding the bearing on this subject of railways, I should say that the railways certainly should be allowed to compete with the roads on equal terms.  Where the law prevents their doing so, the law should be amended and they should be given the necessary powers for equal competition.  We hear a good deal about the contribution of railways to the rates for the maintenance of the roads.  But when we come to an examination of the amount in detail we find that it is very considerably exaggerated.  The railways pay <Col N="572" /> 19 per cent. of their revenue in rates, and only 18 per cent. of that 19 per cent. goes to the roads.  These are the figures for England.  Now, with regard to the roads, the problem is so very difficult by virtue of the fact that a few vehicles can do a great deal of harm.  I have been given information about a district where six lorries plying on the roads are calculated to do harm to the extent of twenty thousand pounds a year to the roads.  That cannot be met merely by taxation.  You cannot tax those lorries out of existence. That gets you so far and no farther.  It does not recognise the necessity for encouraging motor services up to a certain point.  It is merely a restriction on other services.  The regulation of vehicles must be accepted undoubtedly and it is the first step.</P>
    <P>But there is great danger if you do not proceed with caution, that you will limit the vehicles to the detriment of a progressive policy.  I suggest that any regulations you make must be tentative and entirely as a matter of expediency.  Your policy should be to improve all your roads, and a rather gradual abandonment of the policy of limitation.  You must at first, before you get your roads in order, be satisfied with a considerable measure of restriction.  I am not prepared to go into details.  I would suggest a profitable restriction to the amount of a five-ton weight.  But you must not be satisfied with that.  There is a great danger that the Government would be satisfied with that.  There must be a definite policy as to the improvement of the roads so that you would gradually lessen these restrictions, and ultimately arrive at a far higher axle weight. What the figure would be, or what the exact amount would be, I am not prepared just now to suggest.</P>
    <P>The next point is what should be the regulating authority.  Such regulations, as there are now, are quite unsuitable to meet the case.  It is necessary, first of all, for the county councils to make application, then for the Minister to make an inquiry, and then for certain restrictions, on the result of that inquiry, to be enforced by the Order of the Minister.  You cannot possibly deal with this matter on a <Col N="573" /> county basis.  These lorries are mainly on through service and they must be dealt with on all-Ireland basis.  The Minister should have power to deal with them in this way; he has his Roads Advisory Board.  Fresh legislation may be necessary, but there is also necessary a consolidation of the existing enactments.  That is not an important matter, but it would be a convenience to have all those laws brought up to date.  With regard to the immediate measures&mdash;I do not want to debate without putting forward constructive proposals&mdash;what I put forward, first, is the regulation of speed.  I am not prepared to be cross-examined as to where the limit begins.  Those lorries are limited to twelve miles an hour, but when they get out on a country road they go as fast as they like.</P>
    <P>All the experts say that is where the harm is being done.  I think the police are doing their best, but I also think that pressure should be brought on them to do more.  If the heavy lorry, instead of doing, possibly, thirty or forty miles a day, is able, by increasing its speed, to double its distance that, of course, affects the finance of lorries. Their overhead charges are then being spread over double the mileage.  I do not know what the powers are, but the regulation of tyres is important.  All tyres do harm, and some people say rubber tyres do most harm, but it is obvious that rubber pneumatic tyres do less harm than iron tyres.  Vehicles that use rubber should be favoured. The restriction of routes is not very important, because if you restrict them on one route, they will go on another and do harm.  In certain cases however, the restriction of routes may be a useful auxiliary.  The supervision of axle weights is most important.  There are temporary portable weighing-machines manufactured for this purpose which can be used as surprise tests on lorries which are passing.  Without a rapid determination of weights it is difficult to institute prosecutions for excessive weights, and whatever weights you decide on you want some means of rapid determination on the roads in order satisfactorily to sustain a prosecution.</P>
    <P>With regard to finance, the main doctrine that users must pay is sound <Col N="574" /> and it should be the headline for the whole of this advance on road-making. The horse-power tax is not in accordance with that principle.  It has no regard to the amount of damage a vehicle does for the mileage it runs. The fuel tax is undoubtedly much more equitable.  The Farmers' Union and Farmers' Congress are pressing for a fuel tax.  I know owners of commercial engines, who use the same fuel as the motor vehicles, will be strongly tempted not to discriminate too closely between how the fuel is used and to use the tax-free fuel which he gets for his engine or motor vehicle.  A certain moderate ration might be allowed for whatever the vehicle is and any fuel in excess of that should be taxed.  It will be a case of rough justice but I think it will be just enough to fix the ration. I prefer the tax on fuel far more than the gradation of taxation according to the weight of the vehicle.  All those gradations seem difficult and inequitable, at least, on the taxpayers.  It is very hard to know where to begin and by what proportion to fix the tax.  It would be far better to restrict all vehicles over a certain weight changing the varying restrictions as the roads improve, and then to allow all other vehicles to work on a fuel tax.  That would be the fairest way to treat them. Now we come to the question that Senator Toal dealt with and that is the main roads and how they should be supported.  I agree that the main roads should be a central charge subject to a contribution from the local rates.  It would not be fair to free the local rates entirely of all charges on the main roads.  There should be some basis worked out which represents the charge previous to the date when motors came into use, say 1904 or some date like that.</P>
    <P>It would be quite possible to add a percentage representing recent prices and make it a fixed basis for five years from the local authorities to the Central Fund, if the central authorities would undertake all charges for the maintenance of the main roads, the local authority continuing to maintain secondary roads.  When I say that, I do not mean that the Government should set up a separate Department. <Col N="575" /> It could be carried out, as it was carried out in England, through the Executive of the County Councils, by paying all in excess of local charges. If they liked they could take power to remove county surveyors, even over the heads of local authorities, for not doing the work according to their requirements. The question of road construction finance is a most difficult one. You are met at once with conflicting difficulties between capital and maintenance. To reduce these, it is above all true that the first cost is in the end the cheapest.  There is this to be said, that nothing could be more costly than the present system of road maintenance. Very considerable sums are spent on roads, but not enough for the traffic, and they fall to pieces within a year.  The first thing most counties do is to stop tarring the roads.  That is like building a house and leaving a lot of leaks in the roof.  Within a short time it is damaged and in a few months such a road is as bad as it was before the repairs were undertaken.  That is the difficulty.  Unless you have considerable outlay and capital cost to put the road in a certain condition with modern traffic there is very heavy depreciation in a short time.</P>
    <P>As regards finance, I suggest to the Minister that at least the Road Fund revenue might be capitalised.  I would also suggest that certain roads which are main roads might be put in order to bear motor traffic up to a reasonable weight of vehicle.  That would be, at least, so much to the good.  I would not do it in all cases, as that would mean that there would be no funds for assisting in maintaining the other roads.  I do not see why motor duties should not be ear-marked, and also the duties on motor parts, for the maintenance of roads for the motoring public, and portion of that, if not the whole, capitalised.  My policy is that private enterprise in motor development must not be arrested; the consumer is the first consideration; lorry regulation decreasing in degree should be imposed; speeds and weights must be drastically controlled; there must be central regulation and central financing <Col N="576" /> of all roads; and consolidation of laws, future and past.</P>
    <P>An enormous asset to the roads in this country, apart altogether from their civilising influence, is the tourist. Large numbers of tourists who might come to this country would have their own motor cars.  Tourists are always in search of a holiday in a country to which they can take their cars without restriction and where they can enjoy good roads.  People of small means feel the effects of bad roads much more than others.  Any Senator who has been on a holiday, as I was in France at one time, when the roads were bad, hesitates to return after such an experience. No more fertile means of encouraging tourists to a country can be suggested than the maintenance of the roads in good order.  In addition to that, it is a source of progressive revenue for, as the roads get better, more people buy motor cars.  The upkeep of a motor car is a serious consideration. Bad roads mean very considerable tyre and chassis damage.  As the roads get better the maintenance of the car is reduced; more cars are in use, and more licence duty is paid.  I impress upon the Government that such measures will do more than anything else to add to the amenities of life in this country and increase the revenues of the State. I move my motion as an amendment to Senator Toal's motion.</P>

      <P>While agreeing with <Col N="577" /> Senator Sir John Keane I would like to qualify his remarks to this extent, that it is a strange paradox that never were the roads of Ireland better than they are at present.  Within the last few years we have never had better roads in the country than those made with macadam cement and Trinidad Lake asphalt.  Many beautiful boulevards have been created round the city.  At the same time what has caused the apparent deterioration is the increased motor traffic.  Over a year ago we had all these questions regarding the upkeep of roads raised.  I do not intend to repeat my remarks now, but I do say that in the rivalry between the road and the railway, we have a dying industry in the railway and a growing form of traffic on roads which are inadequate for it.  The tendency is to fight against it.  If we are not careful we will get such road control that the roads will not be better than the railways, and speed limits, deliberately preventing output, will be nearly as bad as traffic obstruction.</P>
      <P>There is a very good example to be had by looking at the Dublin Tramways Company and seeing how they met competition on the roads.  Inasmuch as the trams run on rails the tramways in Dublin can be considered a railway. The Tramways Company went in very early for the purchase and equipment of 'buses and they run the service from the country into the city.  They were the first to get what is tantamount, because of the excellence and popularity of the service, to a monopoly.  When the tram company realises the advantage of the 'bus system they will discontinue paying a high rent to the Dublin Corporation. It is possible that we will not then have any competition in Dublin, as that class of passenger traffic is about the best paying class.  If the railways have not sufficient capital to equip lorries for short distance runs the railways of Ireland are bound to disappear, and I do not think they will be able to pay the shareholders by letting out their highways as cement pathways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In America the problem is more acute, because they have there a motorcar for every seven persons.  The railways there meet the rivalry of the <Col N="578" /> roads by a system of motor transport connecting stations at short distances from one another.  The trains do not stop at small stations, but provide motor traffic to cater for them within definite circles from the station.  I cannot see a wedding between the railway and the motors for the reason that a business firm such as Guinness's, if it wishes to transport three or four tons of stout, to a town like Naas, has the immense advantage of having two of its own men handling its own stuff. They can cover the journey in an hour and a half, and these men are responsible, not alone for the delivery of the stuff, but for the condition of the empties on their return.  The other picture is the forwarding of merchandise on the railway at an immense cost and having to kow-tow to five or six individuals at the railway, taking out the stuff at Naas, and being met by a donkey cart or a car from the publican, to take the stuff away.  It does not require any words of mine to show the hopelessness of the railways competing against the roads in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>A year ago I suggested that the Central Fund should bear the burden of the improvement on the roads.  That was an easy way of shifting it on to the Central Fund.  There are other ways that might be suggested as an adjunct towards defraying the cost of the upkeep of these roads.  In Germany the roads are lined by fruit trees and an annual auction is held, the proceeds of which contribute largely to the upkeep of the roads.  The only reply that came to that suggestion which I foolishly made in a newspaper was from an imbecile in Antrim who said that all the apples were rotting there.  If the waste spaces along the roadside were planted with apple trees the proceeds of the sale of fruit would go towards defraying the cost of the upkeep of the roads.  The apples could be made into cider or some other product.</P>
    <P>The other suggestion I made was more ludicrous, apparently.  I suggested that there should be a national highway with certain highways endowed by rich Americans who might, at different distances, have their statues as a reward.  That is not as <Col N="579" /> ludicrous as it appears even though I make the suggestion.  In Greece there is an Order given by the Government called the Order of National Benefactors, and large public works have been endowed by absentee Greek men of wealth, such as the reconstruction of the Stadium and the reconstruction and maintenance of roads.  If we had four or five trunk roads before the railways disappear, we could maintain them in that way.  We are not begging.  We are inviting men from outside to cooperate with the country from which they say they are proud to come.  The third suggestion I gleaned from Senator Keane, was to get help towards the upkeep of roads by the introduction of tourists, and instead of having a tourist catechised as to whether he could drive a car, when coming from a foreign country, he should be encouraged to come here.  It is hardly to be expected that a motor owner, under present conditions, would bring his car here.  I would scrap all these tests and give a man free entry for his motor car for two months to this country.  Any man who uses a motor car in this country for two months spends at least £100.  I would invite motorists into this country and if each man does not spend £100 in two months, he should be made a citizen of the North of Ireland. The London, Midland and Scottish Railway are in the paradoxical position of inviting tourists to come to this country.  Their stock has fallen from 126 to 77; therefore Ireland has become a desirable place to visit.  I would not go to France if I was provided with a free trip because of the nuisance of the Customs.  You have to wait for your motor car longer there than anywhere else.  Then you have to put down ready money, which you cannot very easily get&mdash;one-third of the cost price.  If the obstruction to the entry of motor cars were taken away and that we were able to give motorists two months free use of a car in this country, it would help revenue.  After that period the motorists would have to account for his car.  It seems to me an amazing thing there should be a motor tax at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel bound to rise on this occasion because of the remarks of previous speakers.  It is time that Government attention should be called in a pointed way to the necessity of taking seriously into account the requirements of modern transport and to regulate the future use, construction and maintenance of roads.  The Government has been, for the past eighteen months, concerned in this particular matter and has brought into existence a body called the Roads Advisory Committee, the personnel of which is composed of representatives of county councils&mdash;that is, the rate-striking bodies&mdash;who are at present responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the roads, representatives of the heavy motor lorry traffic, representatives of private and touring cars, and representatives of Labour.  That is a very big committee and all the interests concerned seem to be represented upon it. That committee was given a certain problem to solve by the Government. The first matter that their attention was directed to was how the present system of licence duties was working out, whether they were equitable or otherwise, and whether the Committee could advise the Government as to any alteration of the present system of taxation which would produce the same amount of revenue or more for the construction <Col N="581" /> of roads.  The Committee sent in their report after deliberating for some two months and having a score of meetings.  The Government then gave them a further problem to elucidate&mdash;the policy which in their opinion should be adopted for the maintenance of the roads, through the medium of the Road Fund, and the means by which the roads could be most economically made and what measures are desirable to provide the cost of such work.</P>
      <P>The obvious thing for us to do and the thing we did do when confronted with that problem, was to make an inquiry from those best qualified to give an answer, that is, the county councils, the county surveyors, and the borough surveyors, as to their views under the various heads incidental to this particular problem.  The questionnaire we sent out was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.  Are you in favour of the present system of road control and administration as amended by the Local Government Act, 1924?  If so, can you suggest in what way, if any, it could be improved?  If not, what alternative system do you suggest?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.  Are you in favour of State control of (a) all roads or (b) certain classes of roads?  If so, give your views as to how such an arrangement would work out in practice under (a) and (b).  State how, in your opinion, the revenue for the purpose should be raised, and in what proportions the expense should be borne as between the local authorities, road users and the State.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.  If you favour State control or control by a central body of certain classes of road, state how, in your opinion, the central body should be composed, by whom elected or selected, and give your views as to how the work on those roads should be carried out; for example:&mdash;by a separate staff controlled and directed by the central body, or by the central body working through the existing administrative machinery and the road staffs of the local authorities.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.  On what principle, in your opinion, should roads of the Saorstát be classified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" />&ldquo;5.  Give your views as to (a) the minimum width of the carriage-ways (not including water tables) for each class of roads, and (b) having regard to the local facilities for obtaining good stone, the standard of construction recommended, and the approximate cost per square yard of surface for each class of road; also the after-cost of upkeep per mile per annum.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;6.  Would you approve or disapprove of setting road improvement work by contract?  Give your reasons.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;7.  What vehicles, in your opinion, do most damage to the road?  Have you any suggestions to offer as to how this damage could be lessened?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;8.  What mileage of trunk roads in your area has never been (a) steam-rolled, or has (b) deteriorated so far as to require re-surfacing?  In the case of (b) state when last steam-rolled. In considering any or all of the above, the question of finance, being of great importance, should be separately dealt with.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that questionnaire covers the whole ground and, after sitting for four months almost continuously, certainly three days a week sometimes, we came to certain conclusions, summarised them, and sent in our report. That report covered every aspect of the matter touched upon here, and, in some cases, one would think our report and recommendations were being quoted from.  They are before the Minister; he has our reports dealing with all the things I have stated, and dealing with the financial aspect of the matter.  I am very glad that this resolution has come up here&mdash;or rather these two resolutions&mdash;because I think they will act as an inducement and an incentive to the Government to do something.  They have all the information that they possibly can have, tabulated and collected for them.  They have all the data necessary to formulate some policy and to bring in some comprehensive scheme upon which the future construction and maintenance of the roads of this country can be carried out and administered.  In that sense I am thoroughly in agreement with the resolution merely because it will act as a filip to the Government to do that which it is necessary to do.</P>
