      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution is sent from the Dáil to suggest that an inquiry should be held as to whether or not the list of exclusions, from membership of the Oireachtas, shall be extended. It is well known that the list of exclusions is small and refers mainly to persons in the employment of the State other than those who, by the terms of their appointment, are not expressly excluded from membership of the Oireachtas.  There are other classes in which some difficulty may arise in the future.  It is possible that an employee of a local authority, becoming a member of the Oireachtas, may be placed in a difficult situation in different circumstances.  That employee of the local authority in one case might not be objected to where an employee in another case might be objected to by his employers.  In the same way there are other classes of persons in respect of whom certain <Col N="407" /> people might object, while practically the same class might not be objected to in other cases.  If, on inquiry, it is recommended that any particular extension of the list should be made the necessary steps can be taken to extend it.  If, on the other hand, it is not thought desirable to extend the list, then I think certain steps must be taken to make it impossible to have an objection in this case.  It would be, of course, rather hard on, say, an official of a local authority in the County Kerry being objected to or not being objected to and an official in the County Cork being in a different position. What I mean is it would be unsatisfactory if, in one case, no objection were taken to an official of the local authority being in the Oireachtas and another decision were taken with respect to another member of a local authority.  The position is one which requires examination.  It is put up for impartial examination and recommendation and when that impartial examination has taken place and the recommendation is made the necessary steps can be taken to put the matter right in the future.</P>

      <P>If we have any assurance to have this confined to the class mentioned I would be glad to let this resolution go, but it is very wide and it might mean the exclusion of some of the most useful members of the Oireachtas.  Is it only to apply to local officers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not customary to set up committees of this kind unless there has been some demand for such committees or unless some abuses have arisen.  The President to-day refuses to give any information as to whether any complaint has been made. In the other House I think he said there was one case of a national teacher and the only demand he could show was a resolution passed by the Association of Catholic Managers of national schools. If there is only one instance in which a resolution has been passed I hardly think the Oireachtas should be stampeded into setting up a committee immediately to inquire into questions which may resolve themselves into very difficult and intricate ones There is no use in burking the object from ourselves. The object is mainly to exclude <Col N="409" /> national teachers.  That will have to be extended to country doctors and a whole host of other people whose cases will be cited before this Committee. There will be included members of the Oireachtas having Government contracts, people acting as directors of State banks, and receiving Government money for so acting, and people of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate there is no demand for this Committee except the one instance cited, and I accept the President's statement.  In that one instance the person selected, offered, to the manager of his school, the whole of his Parliamentary allowance if he would pay an independent teacher to teach specialised subjects within that school.  All he asked was half an hour off on each day the Oireachtas would be sitting.  The manager refused it and called for the resignation of that teacher within three months.  In this particular case no school time was being taken off.  Yet we have a complaint in connection with which it is proposed to move the Oireachtas to set up a special commission to inquire into everybody's capabilities.  I think we should wait for some greater demand or until some abuses arise.</P>
      <P>The President has spoken of the officials on local bodies being involved. We have not heard of a single case although the Government took a rate collector, brought him down to a Western constituency and got him elected at a bye-election.  He seems to have been carrying on his business attending to his parliamentary duties, and I do not think there has been any complaint from that local authority. Article 45 of the Constitution provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Oireachtas may provide for the establishment of functional or vocational councils representing branches of the social and economic life of the <Col N="410" /> nation.&rdquo;  The object for which this Committee is sought to be set up is to disqualify from such a council the very people who are qualified for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the passing of this resolution will affect the Article you read.  That only applies to councils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>It means absenting themselves from their ordinary avocation and that is the only objection made.  It was pointed out in the other House that that is merely a matter of discipline.  It is a matter for the immediate authorities concerned to see that the person elected to the Oireachtas does not attend at the expense of his ordinary duties.</P>
      <P>I see no need for it, and I see nothing that would warrant this House in opening up a whole host of questions that would be bound to create a certain amount of controversy and bitterness. It can effect no good purpose; therefore, I will vote against the motion.</P>

      <P>Would the President say whether it is intended to carry the recommendations of the Committee into effect by legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation may be necessary.  For example, I will take two cases.  I do not like to mention particular councils, but I will take two who are out of commission at present. If an official of the Dublin Corporation were a member of the Oireachtas and if an official of the Cork Corporation were also a member, the Minister for Local Government might be faced on any day with the position that the Cork Corporation decided to dispense with the services of their official because of his absence from his duties by reason of his membership of the Oireachtas, and at the same time the official of the Dublin Corporation would be attending the Oireachtas and no objection would lie from the Dublin Corporation.  That is one particular <Col N="411" /> case.  Senator O'Farrell has mentioned the case of national teachers.  A case might arise in which a national teacher from Limerick who was a member of the Oireachtas might attend here without any objection from his manager and a national teacher who was also a member might attend from Wexford and an objection might be lodged by his manager.  Obviously, anomalies of that kind should have some sort of definite all-round settlement, which would equally affect everybody in the same way.  The Dáil asks that a Committee should be set up to inquire into all these matters and it is for the Committee to say whether these anomalies are to be adjusted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the President if this request would have been made if there had been no complaint from the Catholic Managers' Association?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it would.  Some cases had already occurred. There was one case in which a local government official was mentioned as a candidate for membership of the Oireachtas.  In that case I was approached to know whether or not it would interfere with his position.  I made inquiries&mdash;they were not exhaustive&mdash;and I was informed that it was quite possible that his claim in respect of a pension from that local authority would cease on the day he became a member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because his whole time was not devoted to the duties of his office?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so very long since we passed a Constitution. At that time and since Ministers pledged themselves to preserve the Constitution.  The President said that they wanted the Constitution, the whole Constitution and nothing but the Constitution.  Nevertheless they proceeded to nibble at the Constitution in a series of ways.  Here again is another proposed alteration in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="412" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly it is.  The Constitution lays down the conditions governing eligibility for election to the Dáil.  The Constitution makes it very wide and gives a very extensive liberty as to who shall be eligible and who shall not be eligible.  The President now asks the Oireachtas to limit that eligibility.  He asks them to set up a Committee with that obvious intention. No doubt the Government will use their influence and power to get what they want out of it.  I think on the question of the Constitution alone, this is a very serious matter.  This resolution is introduced here without giving any reasonable reason for doing so.  One reason the President has given is that certain people may be objected to by local authorities under whom they are employed.  He instanced Dublin and Cork.  That may be the case, but once we open this question we will have all sorts of officials involved, and there will be no limit.  It seems to me quite clear that if a person chooses to go forward as a candidate for the Dáil and if he is at the same time getting a salary from a local appointment he will have to face the consequences.  He will say: &ldquo;I am going forward as a candidate. How do I stand in this matter?  If I am elected the local authority may object. Is it worth while to risk this?&rdquo; It is for the candidates themselves to consider this matter and not for the Minister or the Committee to take the responsibility of ruling people out.</P>
      <P>I knew lots of people long ago who went into the Parliament in Great Britain.  They were in doubt as to whether they ought or ought not, but they went there all right.  The British Parliament is so much more liberal than our Parliament that they made no objection to it.  Nobody ever objected no matter what position these men held.  I know lots of cases where people had to devote all their time to their duties in Parliament and to sacrifice their duties outside but nobody ever dreamt of objecting.  I have the strongest objection to this Committee being set up in this indefinite way, inquiring into all cases of these employees, to see who is going to be ruled out or who is not going to be ruled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> Ministers are seeking to get away from the Constitution in that way.  General Joffre said when he was attacking the Germans that he would nibble through the German lines, and the President is going to nibble at the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you are not quite right about that.  I have that Article before me here.  It states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every citizen who has reached the age of 21 years and who is not placed under disability or incapacity by the Constitution or by law shall be eligible to become a member of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether we go into these legal questions or not, there is no doubt that the evident object of the Constitution was to make entrance into the Dáil as wide as possible.  It was only in certain cases where it was practically impossible for people to fulfil the duties of their other offices, that they were ruled out.  For that reason I object to the resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. GOGARTY Dr. GOGARTY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, Senator Colonel Moore, as a military-minded <Col N="414" /> man, thinks that the analogy of General Joffre which he gave us is overwhelming. If we take the hypothesis of Senator O'Farrell, that the aim of the committee's findings is concerned with school teachers only, let me put before you the position of the school-teacher.  He is a whole-time officer, and a member of one of the most responsible bodies, perhaps, in this country.  If he is elected a member of either House he must first of all, in order to find time to attend, appoint a substitute.  The substitute will never know when his term will end. He cannot forecast how long the Government will be in power or how long the man for whom he is acting will be absent from his place.  The results will fall on the children.  This distracted mentality that will ensue will prevent the efficient carrying on of one of the most onerous of the public services, and I think that this committee should not have its findings judged beforehand.</P>
      <P>Even if one looks beyond the national teachers, the examples the President gave us will easily show what friction might arise between two cities if one were anxious to send its council's official forward as a candidate and the other would say &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  If any person holds such an office the least we would expect from him is that he should give his full time to the service.  I do not think the rights of citizens under the Constitution are at all affected, but public officials are expected to give their full time to the duties of their office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the President has said, if this resolution is pressed and if we enforce what we have in mind in regard to its application and prevent certain persons from being eligible for election as members of the Oireachtas, I think the last state will be worse than the first.  I think I understood the President to say that he had not in his mind that any action that would be taken or any legislation that would follow the report of the Joint Committee would be retrospective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for example, the two particular cases mentioned to-day, the employee of a local authority, or a national school teacher; if this Committee decided <Col N="415" /> to recommend and the Legislature agreed that employees of local authorities or national school teachers should not be eligible to sit in either House, then we will have the position that in the Dáil you have an employee of a local authority and a national school teacher, and also in this House you will have an employee of a local authority and a national school teacher. If the Committee recommend that these classes shall not be eligible to sit in either House of the Oireachtas then the position of the people already elected, I think, is affected as regards the Constitution.  They were elected under an Article of the Constitution as you, sir, have mentioned.  I do not think having been elected by the people according to the right they had under the Constitution, that an Act of the Legislature can take away from them rights they already possess.  Having been elected and already in possession I do not think they can be disqualified. That being the case, would it not be a grievance to prevent people of the same type who are anxious to get in from being eligible?</P>

      <P>If a member of any class desires to go forward for election there is no reason why he cannot do so, but if elected he certainly should take his choice of attending to his whole-time employment, or attending meetings of the Legislature.  I think it is reasonable that he might go forward for election as a national school teacher but if elected he should resign the school teachership.  He certainly should not occupy the dual positions.</P>

      <P>We have all great respect for President Cosgrave.  He is not a member of this House but he comes to us and asks us to appoint a Committee which would possibly disqualify certain members of this House from the right to be elected to sit in the Seanad.  I feel we owe it to the honour and dignity of this House not to permit any kind of committee or tribunal calling in question their right to be elected and sit here, unless <Col N="416" /> a very strong case indeed can be made for it.  We had a resolution brought forward at first without the intention of making any case for it whatever. We have to use a great effort to get any sort of statement of facts whatever. I do not think any member of this House understood the first statement made by the President.</P>
      <P>It is most necessary that we should have the assistance in our Legislature of the best technical types.  In the near future, we shall have to consider many things in connection with education, and it is most necessary that the opinions of the teachers should be represented in both Houses.  In the recent debates in the Dáil one man whose knowledge and opinion were of the utmost value to the Dáil was a teacher &mdash;Deputy O'Connell.  No member of either House, as far as I can make out by a careful study of his and other speeches, possesses knowledge comparable to his on the whole question of education in this country.  I do not think that his position will be affected by this Committee, but where a man of such technical knowledge has been found once he can be found again.  We require to have that technical knowledge in this House for the next two or three years.  I hope I am a benevolent man, and I think I am an unsuspicious man, but I find it difficult to separate this resolution from some preceding events.</P>
      <P>Some months ago an organisation of teachers passed a resolution in favour of local control of school buildings, that is to say, that these buildings should be controlled and kept in order by local committees.</P>
      <P>Very considerable opposition arose to that object from the managers, and it is only right I should say not from the managers of one denomination only but a very considerable opposition came also from the Protestant managers, who did not like Protestant schools passing under the control of Catholic committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a sectarian question.  It is a question of the ecclesiastical mind, Protestant and Catholic on the one side and on the other a very great deal of the most intelligent lay opinion in Ireland.  Then two or three weeks ago the Catholic Managerial Association <Col N="417" /> passed a resolution in favour of repairs to schools and claiming that the money for the repairs should be given to the managers for that purpose, and they added to the resolution a rider that the schools in Ireland are in a fairly good condition, which they are not.  They know the arrangements for the maintenance of schools have broken down, and it was admitted that the schools are now in a bad condition. I read in the papers that &ldquo;Certain pressure was brought upon the President.&rdquo; I think that is the diplomatic and journalistic way of putting it, and then we have this resolution.  As I have said, the President, a man for whom we have the utmost respect, has come and asked us to appoint a tribunal to consider the eligibility of certain of our members.  I suggest that behind the President there is a certain pressure asking him to have a tribunal appointed. I think a much stronger case must be made before this House votes for the establishment of any such tribunal.</P>

      <P>I have not heard about that.  I quoted from that resolution of 26th June, 1924, in another place.  What surprises me about the opposition to this motion is that it comes from people who must be entirely satisfied that there is a certain weakness in their case which they do not want to be inquired into.  They do not want anomalies corrected and this matter placed on a solid foundation, so that we would not have one ruling, say, for the city of Cork and another ruling for the city of Dublin in diametrical opposition on the same thing.  Is it right that a person who is elected can have his services dispensed with by a local authority in one case and kept on in another?  Is there not something there that requires consideration and settlement? There has been talk about the <Col N="418" /> effect of this on certain members of the House.  I cannot conceive of any Committee which would deprive existing members of the Oireachtas of the right to sit, vote, and be members of the Oireachtas.  In 1923, when the electoral law was under consideration in the Dáil, there were at that time at least a dozen military officers members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>That very same Dáil of which these Army Teachtai were part passed an Act disentitling members of the Army from membership of the Oireachtas, but that did not determine their own particular membership at that time.  Their membership lasted for the whole of that Parliament.  It is open to us now in this connection, or at least it is open to this committee, to examine this matter in a way that should please even the delicate conscience of Senator Moore, who objects to the Government coming into anything.  Here is a thing which the Government does not want to come into, and the delicate conscience of the Senator is upset, and he is even in a state of excitement and panic.  &ldquo;What does the Government mean by this?&rdquo; The Government will have no influence upon this committee.  It is a committee of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I would like the constitution of Committees of the Oireachtas to get very dignified consideration from members of the Oireachtas.  One unhappy member of the Dáil happened in a weak moment to call a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas a corrupt body.  I think on reflection he was very sorry he said such a thing.  I think the Senator in his sober moments will also be sorry that he would have passed any reflection upon a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>A Joint Committee of the Oireachtas is asked to inquire into this matter.  This is a much more serious matter than appears on the surface, very much more serious.  If this committee find that this list should not be extended, at least it is due to <Col N="419" /> those who have taken the risk, that their position should be put right if it is possible to do it, and I believe it is possible.  If it be considered that an official of a local authority should not be incapacitated from membership of the Oireachtas, let us go a step further and say whether or not a member of the Oireachtas is entitled to become an official of a local authority.  That is a consideration that ought to be borne in <Col N="420" /> mind in a matter of this sort.  We consider that no fairer, no more impartial and no more competent tribunal could examine this than a Joint Committee of both Houses, and that this is a question which lends itself to examination, and a committee of that sort should be able to bring in a report which should command respect and we ought not be afraid of that report when it arrives.</P>

      <P>I beg to move Amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In Section 4 to delete in line 51 the figures &ldquo;£40&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the figures &ldquo;£45.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment would be to raise the figure for the standard rent of houses to be de-controlled in June of next year from £40 to £45.  The Bill as originally introduced had the figure of £52.  In the Committee Stage in the other House it was reduced to £40, and the amendment merely seeks to raise it to £45 now.  Many poor people have been forced through stress of circumstances, namely, shortage of houses, to take houses at very high rents.  I know of one particular case of a man earning £4 5s. a week who is paying £90 a year rent.  He is no doing that from choice or through an anxiety to live in a respectable district, but merely through sheerinability to get a cheaper house anywhere else.  Houses of this kind are in many cases occupied by low paid clerical workers with some regard for where they live, but unable to get a house at a reasonable rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These houses are peopled very often by a very numerous type of person with a small income&mdash;people who are expected to keep up a respectable appearance and generally to subscribe to all sorts of collections and to occupy a certain place in the social life in a very moderate way.  They are people who are generally overlooked in matters of legislation, as they have no recognised body to speak for them and <Col N="421" /> if control is to be taken off the houses occupied by this type of person, a very considerable amount of hardship will ensue.  In recent years, ever since the later years of the war, newly-married couples found it impossible to get houses within reasonable rents in a great majority of cases.  With the optimism of youth and the psychological atmosphere surrounding marriage they have entered into commitments that they had hoped they would be able to realise or discharge, or at all events, that conditions would change to such an extent that they might be able to get houses where the rent would be more commensurate with their income. The position has not appreciably improved.</P>
    <P>In many cases those who got married eight or ten years ago are now in a worse position to pay than they were then.  They may have families to support. Wages and salaries, generally, all round, have decreased and some are out of employment altogether, and it is just at this time that it is proposed to remove that control, after June of next year, and place these people at the tender mercy of the commercial house-owners who can then charge them any rent they like, or evict them if they so desire and sell the houses over their heads.  Surely the proposal in Section 6 to enable the owner to raise the rent by another ten per cent. should be quite sufficient to meet the position without seeking to remove control altogether. I do not think the Government should seek to remove control from any house until they have given the electors an opportunity of expressing their opinions on this question.</P>
    <P>The General Election is due in August next year and the Bill proposes to remove control of this particular type of house in June, 1927, a couple of months before they give the electors an opportunity of expressing their views upon it.  It is the most retrogressive legislation that the present Government have embarked upon; they have never given the electors an opportunity to express their views on it.  They have managed to keep these things in the dark until such time as they were safely implanted. I think that as the proposal is to <Col N="422" /> decontrol them in June, we should limit the number to as small a proportion as possible and the amendment proposes to do that by merely raising the figure from £40 to £45.  It will still be £7 lower than it was before the house-owning interests in the other House were able to reduce it to £40.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest, sir, that these first six amendments fall naturally into three separate lots.  That is taking 1 and 2 the proposal is that with respect to the period commencing 24th June houses in the metropolitan district that will come under decontrol will not be houses at £40 valuation and upwards but houses of £45 valuation and upwards; and elsewhere throughout the State that instead of £30 valuation the Senator seeks to insert £35. Then amendments 3 and 4 move to deal with the next period covered by paragraph (b) of the Section.  Amendments 5 and 6 deal with the period covered by paragraph (c) and in each case the proposal is to raise the valuation figure both with reference to houses within the metropolitan area and with reference to houses elsewhere. Now take this first amendment.  The Senator's proposal is that we ought not <Col N="423" /> to decontrol in June, 1927, houses of £40 valuation and upwards and that we should be content to decontrol houses of £45 valuation.</P>
      <P>I went to some considerable trouble to find out the proportion and, just what effect our proposals on this decontrol would have, and I took certain typical areas in Dublin with a view to examination.  I find in the urban districts of Rathmines and Rathgar you have 4,474 houses of a valuation not exceeding £25, 1,330 exceed £25, but do not exceed £30; 1,098 exceed £30, but do not exceed £40; and 657 exceed £40&mdash;out of a total of 7,559 houses.  In Clontarf East you have 562 of a valuation not exceeding £25; 126 of a valuation exceeding £25, but not exceeding £30; 99 of a valuation exceeding £30, but not exceeding £40, and 51 exceeding £40&mdash;out of a total of 838.  In Clontarf West you have 39 out of 1,748 exceeding a valuation of £40.  That gives some conception of the proportion of our proposals and what the reactions will be.  In fact it seems that none of the very large houses, houses the 1914 rent of which might be safely put at £75 or £80, will be decontrolled after June of next year.</P>
      <P>If I were to move on and consider our figure for other areas outside the metropolitan area it stands at £30 after June, 1927, and the Senator proposes that it should be £35.  Take Cork as a fair test.  Out of a total of 11,827 houses, only 336 exceed a valution of £30; 10,966 are not above £20; 332 lie between £20 and £25; 193 lie between £25 and £30; and only 336 out of a total of 11,827 are upwards of £30 fixed by the Bill for the first period of decontrol commencing on 24th June, 1927.  The Senator may suggest that Cork is a special case and selected because it is suitable to the argument.  In Kilkenny, out of 1,978 houses, 49 are upwards of £30.  In Carlow, 15 are upwards of £30 valuation out of a total of 1,156.  That is the extent of our villainy!</P>

      <P>It will be observed that this is merely one of a series of half a dozen amendments and not by any means the most important <Col N="424" /> because it deals with the top figure. The fact that there are only a small number involved does not affect in the least degree the justice or otherwise of the case.  This is particularly true in view of the fact that we are told one of the justifications for the Bill at all is an encouragement to build more houses. If only a few are involved you are not going to encourage a lot of new building. The Minister has mentioned Cork, and, as someone has remarked, the valuations are low there, and the small number of houses that are above the valuation in question may be due to the fact that all the Corkmen have come to Dublin, and that consequently these houses are uninhabited.  The argument the Minister advanced in reference to this amendment is not applicable to the other amendments which apply to a far wider range of houses and who have far lower incomes than are involved here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment refers to houses that it is proposed to decontrol completely in 1929.  As introduced the Bill removes the control of houses in Dublin whose standard rent or valuation does not exceed £30.  In Committee the figures were reduced to £25, and this amendment proposes to raise the figure again to £30.  A subsequent amendment deals with houses outside Dublin, where it proposes to raise the figures from £20 to £25.  Of course these figures cover a very large proportion of houses occupied by working-class people and by people with very small incomes. If it were reasonable or logical to introduce  <Col N="425" /> control at all because of the house shortage during the period of the war it is equally logical and equally necessary now, as the house shortage has not been relieved to any appreciable extent.  In fact, making allowance for the increase in the population in recent years, the housing shortage is more acute now than when control was first introduced.  It is difficult to understand why it should be considered necessary or desirable to remove control at this particular period, and, in view of the present economic state of affairs, it is difficult to understand the reason. The removal of control from the particular type of house concerned will affect a very large number of people in Dublin and also a very large number outside, and will give an opportunity for all sorts of abuses, exploitations, profiteering and evictions.  I think the Government should take the views of their constituents on this matter before proceeding to embark on this legislation.</P>

      <P>I suggest that this talk about consulting constituents is cant to a great extent.  Elections are not fought on these issues, and do not develop on these lines.  If there was a referendum there might be something in the argument.  At a general election you have political cries and you do not get a clear-cut issue like this.  If the verdict of the election is such as to show that these provisions are not acceptable, a new Government, when in power, can legislate accordingly. Surely that will be satisfactory?  This question was already decided on the Second Reading.  The amendment strikes at the whole principle of the Bill, and although you, sir, have ruled the amendment in order&mdash;a ruling which I accept&mdash;I wish to enter at least an individual protest against having vital amendments revived at this stage. There is no reason at all why they could not have been introduced on the Committee Stage, where the necessity for moving them was just as great.  On the Committee Stage one would have an opportunity of having a first run at the amendments.  The whole question is how the housing shortage is to be solved.  If these restrictions are to continue there is bound to be dislocation. <Col N="426" /> I think the housing question is the only one that is restricted now, and that there is a free market in everything else.  Until you get a free market you will not get private capital to invest in houses.  That will only follow on de-control.  Until then you will have a housing shortage.  It is only dodging the issue to try to continue these restrictions.</P>

      <P>I do not want to say very much on this amendment. The figures set out in Section 4 were very carefully considered, and we thought them reasonable.  I could go into the exact effect of this amendment and show the number of houses in Dublin, Cork, Carlow, and Kilkenny, and so on, that would be affected, one way or another, according to the fate of the amendment.  The number is small.  You get evidence of it when I say that out of 7,559 houses in the urban district of Rathmines and Rathgar the number with a valuation below £25 is 4,474.  That is typical throughout the residential portion of the city.  In Cork the number of houses not above £20 valuation is 10,966 out of a total of 11,827, so that, even our last period, that covered by paragraph (c) and the figures set out for £25 in Dublin and £20 elsewhere, do not achieve any substantial measure of decontrol.  The big question, whether control is or is not to be carried on into the future will have to be decided by the Government of 1929 in the circumstances which they then find facing them.  This Bill, even with its three years' graduation, as set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), achieves no measure of decontrol worth talking of.  So much decontrol as is achieved has been very carefully considered by us, and is considered eminently moderate and reasonable, and I ask the Seanad to share that view.</P>

    <P>Amendment 7, Section 6.  To delete in line 56 the word &ldquo;twenty&rdquo;<Col N="427" /> and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;fifteen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the previous amendments did not affect a great many houses.  This amendment affects everybody who pays rent under control. I apologise to the House for not having put down my previous amendments during the Committee Stage, but I might explain that I was unable to do so because I was absent from Dublin. This present amendment is a modification of an amendment defeated during the Committee Stage of the Bill. The Principal Act of 1923 enabled householders to increase the standard rent by ten per cent. Section 6 of this Bill enables the house owners to increase the rent by a further ten per cent.  My amendment is that this ten per cent. should be reduced to five per cent., and I propose to accomplish this by altering the word &ldquo;twenty&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;fifteen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think this is the most monstrous proposition in the whole Bill, that is to allow another increase of rent at this particular time.  We find an all-round demand for economy.  We are confronted with demands for reductions in wages, for longer hours of work and so forth.  We have a Commission inquiring into the higher prices charged for food.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has fixed the wage at thirty-two shillings a week for workers on the Shannon.  Thousands of railway men have been compelled to accept a heavy reduction in wages ranging over a whole year.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us that there are in the Free State 212,000 workers with a wage of twenty-five shillings a week and under.  We are told that this is a poor country and that we must be prepared to accept a low standard of living for many years to come.  Unemployment is developing to a deplorable extent and there is no immediate prospect of any appreciable improvement.</P>
    <P>It is in the midst of this state of affairs that this Bill is brought along, and the house-owners are told that they may increase the present standard rate by ten per cent.  At a time when employers are cutting down wages and <Col N="428" /> looking for economy everywhere and when people are asked to live on smaller incomes and when the unemployed are left absolutely desolate in the great majority of cases, and when they have to pay rent&mdash;for they must find shelter as well as people who are working&mdash;this is the Government's contribution to the rejuvenation of the country and to the easing of distress. It is the proposal to enable the people who own a particular commodity to exploit one of the most essential needs of the community.  You might as well allow a certain section who are fortunate enough to possess the water supply to exploit a shortage of water and allow people to die for want of it.  Or you might as well allow the exploitation of fresh air, for this housing shortage is as bad as a shortage of fresh air, because housing shortage makes it absolutely impossible for the worker in the tenement to get sufficient fresh air or to develop a strong, healthy frame; and you are going to put a premium upon the shortage by allowing house-owners to increase the rents on these poor people by another ten per cent.</P>
    <P>What has happened since the previous Act that makes this proposal necessary?  It is admitted that where there is a shortage of 22,000 houses only something like 2,800 have been built.  While the population has increased, old houses have tumbled down and yet, because it was necessary during the war to institute control it is proposed now to allow the house-owners to increase rents, to a figure not paid at a time when prices were at the peak and when everybody was employed.</P>
    <P>The Minister justifies this proposition by saying that it only means, in many cases, fifty shillings a year of increase. That means very little to people who have sufficient money to pay it.  It is a very big amount to persons unable to pay the existing rent.  It is a very big amount to the man with only thirty shillings a week with a wife and family to support, where every penny has to be counted.  Putting something on the existing rent in such cases is a terrible proposition.  I never heard anything like the manner in which this <Col N="429" /> argument is advanced that by allowing the house-owners to put this increase upon the rents, and by taking off control you are encouraging people to build houses.  Anything more futile or untenable than this argument was never advanced, seeing that no new houses are controlled at all.  There is no control on houses built since 1919 and the owners of such houses can charge any rent they like, so far as exploiting the public is concerned, and no matter what you do in this particular matter, you are not promoting an effective supply of houses in the future.  Still we have this argument thrown out because it is the only argument that can be adduced to allow this to go on.  Senators may pass these things and be half asleep while these things are under discussion, but they had better consider whether these things are not going to be brought home to them later on.</P>
    <P>I warn the House that when these rent increases are put on a lot of people who are asleep now will wake up and create an uproar.  At this particular period when unemployment is in such a desperate condition that the Government throw up their hands because of their inability to deal with it, when these people find that the landlord is sending them a demand for increased rent you are pretty sure to have some fun.  I never saw anything done so cavalierly as this has been done.  It is time that something would happen that would rouse Senators to a sense of responsibility because of the inability to deal with unemployment and the various economic misfortunes that have fallen upon the country.  But to come along now with an additional burden upon the people would be screamingly funny if it was not so desperately tragic.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has victoriously carried through legislation setting up what might be called slavish conditions, and has robbed railwaymen of their rights under his Bill, and the Minister for Justice has now to keep pace with him. He meets the case of decreased employment, reduced wages and increased responsibility by putting on an increase of rent but only, he says, of ten <Col N="430" /> per cent.  Not a dozen tenants, he adds, will refuse to pay that.</P>
    <P>I am going to vote against this proposal, and I am going to divide the House upon it.  I certainly hope everybody will realise the implication contained in this proposal.  You are not putting this on to the wealthy tenants&mdash;I am not concerned with those people.  Probably they can afford to pay.  But I am concerned with people who are struggling to try to pay the present rent, and the majority of whom are asked by this House and employers throughout the country to give up a substantial part of the incomes that they have at the present time, and on top of that they are now asking them to pay this additional rent of ten per cent.</P>

      <P>The Senator has not told us why one section of the population, owing to increases in prices, should have its reward in increased wages, doubled and trebled, while the other section of the population who, out of its small savings, own one or two houses, should be restricted in the increase of the value of their property by only ten per cent. on pre-war prices. Because something was not done before to remedy that is no reason why it should not be done now.  For all those years, since control was instituted, house owners had to be content, in the interests of the tenant, perhaps in the interests of the public, to get a miserly ten per cent increase, whereas they have had to pay for their commodities, including labour, anything up to double and sometimes two-and-a-half pre-war prices.</P>

      <P>It represents ten per cent. upon probably all they had to live upon.  If the Senator demands that for the future, renters shall not exist in the community&mdash;a doctrine held in certain quarters and exploited in certain countries&mdash;his argument is one, I hope, that will not find favour in this country.  I hope, as a community, <Col N="431" /> we have not gone that far.  You can only increase the prospect of saving and thrift by allowing people to get their reward and taking their share of enhanced values.  I do not blame the Senator for his point of view, because he is trying to put the other side of the case.  But people who invested their savings in house property have suffered very grievously by control and incidentally suffered further by a flaw in the Act, and should at least be entitled to this very small increase on their pre-war rents, which only allows them to participate to the extent of about one-third in the increased values due to high prices.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to regret that the Senator was not here when this matter was being discussed on the Committee Stage and when an amendment substantially similar to that which he has now moved was before the Seanad.  On that stage of the Bill I followed the course of four typical houses, and showed how far in 1914, in 1923-24, in 1924-25, in 1925-26 and 1926-27, they were affected.  I showed that the rent as it will be under the provisions of this Bill, of these houses which are really typical, is, in fact, less than the rent paid by tenants in the years 1923-24 and 1924-25 and will be only very slightly more, almost negligibly more, than the rent paid last year to the landlord.  In fact, previous to the Bill it amounts to no more than this: that they give to the house-owner some of the benefit of the fall in rates.  For the benefit of the Senator let me take a house the valuation of which is £33.  The rates in 1914 were £18 17s. 5¼d. and the rent £60.  The rent of that house under legislation in the year 1923-24 was £81 18s. 10d.  In 1924-25 it was £80 19s. 7d., with the falling rates&mdash; the Senator knows how the standard of rent is arrived at&mdash;and there was the permitted increase in the rent, the increased rates, and then there was those other permitted increases for repairs and so on.  In 1925-26 it was £77 13s. 7d.  In 1926-27 it was £79 17s. 4d.  That is, less than 1923-24, 1924-25, and slightly more than what was paid last year.  When we talk of <Col N="432" /> driving rents back to the peak period let us see what the rent of that house was in 1920-21.  It was £87 5s. 10d., so we are not driving rents back to the peak periods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, out of a reduction in rates that is, from that down from £81 18s. 7d. in 1923-24 to £79 17s. 4d. this year, under this Bill. In fact, it simply gives to the house-owner some little benefit from the fact that the rates are gradually coming down.  Take another example.  A rent of £36 in 1914 was as high as £48 12s. 5d. in 1923-24, as for £48 1s. 11d. in 1924-25, as £46 5s. 11d. in 1925-26, and under the Bill £47 16s. 4d., a rise of about £1 in the year.  Take another example.  Take £32, the 1914 rent.  That would be £42 18s. 10d. in 1923-24, £42 9s. 7d. in 1924-25, and £40 19s. 7d. in 1925-26, and in 1926-27, with the Bill in force, it would be £42 8s. 11d.  That is, at any rate, to be the issue in the social revolution with which the Senator threatens us.  The Senator talks about the 10 per cent. increase in the rent, just to pick out one inaccuracy and correct it.  The Senator's statement was a clever amalgam of inaccuracy. It is not a 10 per cent. increase on the rent.  It is a permitted increase of 10 per cent. on the standard rent but not an increase of 10 per cent. on the actual rent.</P>

      <P>I am very doubtful if the Senator does know.  If he did he would not talk of a permitted increase <Col N="433" /> of 10 per cent. on the standard rent being synonymous with an actual increase of 10 per cent. on the rent payable by the landlord.  It is no such thing.  An amendment, of Senator Farren on the Committee Stage, to delete the permitted 20 per cent. increase on the standard rent, was defeated, and we went very fully into the merits of the matter.  Senator O'Farrell having been absent from the Committee Stage comes along now on Report and moves that the increase allowed be 15 per cent.  Presumably he approves of a permitted increase of 15 per cent., unlike Senator Farren, who approves only of 10 per cent.  I do not feel like treading the ground we travelled very fully on in the Committee Stage.  I think the Senators are conversant with the case for the increase and that it is a very small latitude to people, who after all are the owners of the houses, in dealing with their property.  My own feeling is they are entitled to do a bit of a growl about the fact that it was so small.  It reduces the increase on the actual rent of the average house between 30s. and £2 in the year, and it is simply giving to the owner of the house some benefit from the fact that the rates are gradually but surely coming down and that the rent has been falling steadily for the tenant for the last three or four years.  I stand fully for the proposal in the Bill and I do not consider by doing so that I am inflicting any of the hardship on the general community the Senator speaks about.</P>

      <P>It was suggested to me that the word &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; might be inserted on the ground that a landlord should not be penalised where he bona fide was unable to get a suitable tenant who, having regard to the size of the house and the rent to be paid, would be in a position to occupy it without undue depreciation.  I may add the issue is one which would have to be determined by the courts.  The local authority, if it is not satisfied that the house owner was in fact unable to get a suitable tenant, will not remit the rates and if the owner of the house wishes to appeal against that his only remedy would be to appeal to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The court would then have the onus of determining whether the house was <Col N="436" /> being kept vacant in a bona fide way because of the inability of the house-owner reasonably to secure a suitable tenant or whether he was keeping the house vacant unreasonably in a time of house shortage with a view to not letting it at all, but possibly with a view to selling it.  No local authority would remit the rates unless they were satisfied that there was a valid defence. Any appeal from their decision in the matter would have to be to the courts.</P>

      <P>The effect of this additional sub-section is to enable the court to rectify errors which they are satisfied were unintentional&mdash;to rectify bona fide mistakes.  The Principal Act was rather rigid in that respect and statutory notices were involved, where ordinary clerical mistakes were made.  There is a feeling that the courts should have power of rectification where there is no question whatever of bad faith or a desire to evade the provisions of the Act and so on.  The court will be very easily able to determine that issue.  It might happen that in big offices dealing with many tenancies a purely clerical error would creep into the statutory notice. Hitherto under the legislation that existed even in the case of such an error the whole matter was invalidated, and we think there should be just this much elasticity&mdash;that where the court is satisfied that the mistake is entirely unintentional it should have the power to set it right without any such consequences as prevailed in the past.</P>

It is not reasonable that in every case house-owners should be compelled to seek legal advice.  It is in those cases where there is a bona fide mistake that the courts have the right to review the matter.  There is a feeling voiced in several quarters that all those landlords are wealthy people, with a great deal of office machinery and staffs at their disposal, but there are quite small people in country villages who let a house for £15 or £20, and they deserve some protection in this matter.</P>

The amendment says &ldquo;on such terms and conditions as respect arrears of rent or otherwise as appear to the court to be just and reasonable.&rdquo;  The court is not bound to do it, but if it does it can make such terms and conditions as it thinks reasonable.  The court has complete jurisdiction over it&mdash;to make whatever order it thinks fair and to impose any conditions it thinks fit.  I do not really think it is intended to apply to, nor will it hit, any case that has been concluded or in which there is an agreement.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;50.&mdash;No appointment shall be made to the office of high sheriff after the passing of this Act: provided that the tenure of any existing high sheriff shall in no case be affected.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That amendment covers two High Sheriffs who have been more prominently before the public than any other gentlemen holding these distinguished positions.  They undertook the office of High Sheriff at a time when considerable trouble and danger existed.  Thank goodness things are very different now, a state of affairs which has been largely brought about, we all recognise, by the admirable administration of the present Government. The duties of the sheriffs have been very onerous and have caused no expense whatever to the country.  They have been quite an acquisition, I believe, to the metropolis and to the South of Ireland.  It is very generally admitted that the Commissioners are functioning admirably both in Dublin and in Cork, courteously, efficiently, and in a progressive spirit.  I think it is admitted that they cannot always continue just as they are carrying on these important duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not follow the suggestion that fell from my friend, Senator Dowdall&mdash; perhaps I may be allowed to congratulate him on his new University distinction&mdash;<i>honoris causa</i>&mdash;that these Commissioners might remain in office for another hundred years.  I think it is generally hoped that in the near future the Government will bring about some legislation so as to provide an electoral body to co-operate with the Commissioners. There is a feeling in the provinces amongst a large part of the community that there is an undue tendency to centralise matters too much in this <Col N="441" /> important city of Dublin.  Apropos of that I wish to read an extract from the &ldquo;Irish Tribune&rdquo; of last week, dealing with that question: &ldquo;Now that we have a national capital which absorbs so much of the wealth and brains, it is more than ever necessary to develop civic consciousness in provincial centres if they are not to decay into intellectual and commercial stagnation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Senators must not allow Senator Haughton to confuse them.  He talked at some length about the position of Commissioners for Cork and Dublin.  I want to say all that has no bearing on the matter whatever. It certainly has no relevancy to his amendment.  I explained on the second reading here the position of the High Sheriffs after 1920.  Their duties were two.  They summoned the Grand Juries and they attended on the judge who went down on Assizes.  Since the Court of Justice Act the duties of a High Sheriff are nil.  Grand Juries no longer exist, and the judge does not go down on Assize.  The position of High Sheriff at the moment involves the summoning of a jury which has no existence, and attendance on a judge who does not go out.  The Senator is anxious that the title should remain to the present holder in Cork, and, in an incidental kind of way, in Dublin.  There is absolutely no point or sense in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I simply put it to the Senator that it would be an absurd thing to cater for the sensitiveness of two individuals in our population of 3,500,000, and <Col N="442" /> leave them an empty legal title, with no duties or responsibilities whatever attached.  There is also this, that the present holders, if things had gone in their ordinary course, would have gone out of office long since, as the office changed hands every year.  Why should we go out of our way in legislation to cater for what may be the very harmless vanity of an individual and say, &ldquo;as long as you live you will be High Sheriff of Cork with no duties and no responsibilities&rdquo;?  The thing is really unsound, and I would ask the Seanad not to approve of the amendment.</P>

      <P>To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;Every such order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution is passed by either House of the Oireachtas within the next subsequent twentyone days after the order is laid before it annulling such order, such order shall be annulled accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important amendment, with regard to the probate offices throughout the country, of which there are about eight or nine.  In the most interesting and graphic speech the Minister delivered in the lower House the whole matter was very clearly defined.  The Minister then mentioned the eight districts which have been functioning for about three-quarters of a century, and he gave the profits that have accrued from the <Col N="443" /> different places&mdash;Cork, Limerick, Tuam, Waterford, Cavan, Kilkenny and Ballina&mdash;amounting to over £5,000.  In some cases, I know in the case of Cork, the profit that accrued last year was to some extent larger than what the Minister was aware of, but I know that there were about 1,000 cases granted last year, some of them for very large estates, amounting to possibly over six figures.  The district is a large one, including the East and West Riding of Cork, the city of Cork, and the county of Kerry.  It is obvious that it would be very inconvenient for the legal profession and their clients to have to come up to Dublin in connection with these cases, instead of having them dealt with rapidly in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  It will obviate the necessity of moving the next amendment which stands in my name, and which is practically the same.  These courts are very useful, as they enable small estates to be dealt with quickly and cheaply.  There are competent officers in these district probate courts.  Since the destruction of the Four Courts the usefulness of these courts was proved, and the legal profession who have to go to those places are anxious that they should be retained.  I can quite understand that as time goes on it might be advisable and necessary to allow the Minister to exercise his own discretion, but a case would have to be justified to the Oireachtas if an Order was made.</P>

      <P>When the Senator mentioned casually and personally to me his intention of putting down this amendment I was inclined to accept it. There did not seem to be a very strong case against it.  Looking into the position, and favourably disposed to the proposal, I find that under the law which set up these registries&mdash;the Probate Act&mdash;there was power in the Lord Lieutenant to close a district registry without consultation with anybody, but since the Adaptation of Enactments Act that power is in the Minister for Justice.  The position since the seventy years of their establishment was that the Executive in the <Col N="444" /> name of the Lord Lieutenant could at any time close these district registries. I put it that the Minister for Justice, who has a very direct and immediate responsibility to the Dáil, and through the Dáil to the electorate, can be trusted with that much discretion.  The tendency of bringing an Executive proposal before the Dáil and Seanad by resolution and suspending it pending the sanction of both Houses is I think wrong.</P>
      <P>It makes towards the position of government by resolution of both Houses rather than government by the Executive, with the obvious political consequence if that government is wrong.  But this government by resolution in both Houses simply means if the tendency is needlessly continued that the Tables of both Houses would be snowed under with a drift of resolutions, which probably not one Senator or Deputy in sixty would advert to or read.</P>
      <P>I think it is quite safe to leave that much discretion in the Executive.  There is no intention to do anything hastily or without the fullest examination.  I rather deprecate the idea underlying this amendment, that this administrative Executive step cannot be taken without specific, expressed approval of both Houses via a resolution.  While dissenting from the amendment, I just throw out that word of dissent to the tendency which the amendment represents. I do not believe it is a good or sound tendency.  The Government must and should take responsibility for executive and administrative actions of this kind, and Deputies and Senators should criticise, and criticise loudly, where they disapprove of such actions.</P>

      <P>The Minister's speech has, in my opinion, made it very much more important that this amendment should be pressed.  In effect what the Minister has said is that the bureaucratic tendency which is creating wide-spread unpopularity for the Government throughout the country should be enforced and that the right of the Dáil or of this House to express criticism should be restricted.  The Minister has not said a single word on the merits or the usefulness of these courts.</P>

      <P>All that is asked for in this amendment is that this should be done.  The usefulness of this amendment is, I think, proved by the Minister's statement that it was in the power of the then Executive for seventy years to close those Probate Registries at any time, and that power was vested in the Minister under the Adaptation of Enactments Act, but that was not thought of when this Bill was drafted.  Undoubtedly the Minister was not conscious of the power which he possessed, because a sub-section is put into the Act to enable him to do what he has already power to do.  I did not know that such power was vested in him.  But when it is suggested now to insert this sub-section, so that such an Order may be discussed in the Dáil and Seanad, the Minister resents it.  I will ask the Seanad to pass this amendment.  I do not know how useful probate registries are in other places, but members of the legal profession, men of the very highest standing in Cork, assure me that this office in Cork is very much used, and these legal men are in quite as good a position to know the usefulness of this provision to their clients as anybody here.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of the personnel of a given Government. It is a question of their responsibility for their sins of commission and omission.  It is a question of extending this principle of Government by resolution.  Government and Government Departments every day decide certain matters and take action with much greater reactions than is covered by the section.  I think it is necessary and right that that should be so.  If <Col N="446" /> you move away from that and say that in addition to passing legislation, passing the Estimates and, in addition to passing matters of that kind, the Dáil and Seanad shall be consulted with regard to administrative action, and shall be asked to approve or disapprove of this and that act by resolution, I submit that you are putting on the Dáil and Seanad work that is not proper to the Dáil and Seanad, and you are taking away from the Government work and responsibility which is properly the work and responsibility of the Government, for which it should of course answer politically through the Dáil and Seanad to the people.  The Senator challenged me, or at least invited me to discuss the merits of this. At any rate, he commented on my omission to do so.</P>
      <P>I went into the matter very fully on the Second Reading and if I refrained from doing it again it was because I thought the Senator, and other Senators, remembered the substance of what I did say.  I cannot be expected to discuss these probate registries and their utility now.  I could, I think, bore a considerable hole in what these eminent Cork solicitors have said to the Senator on the matter.  I pointed out on the last occasion that Donegal, for instance, was in the area of the Derry registry.  Then came the Act of 1920 and its consequences, and Donegal was no longer in the area of the Derry registry; yet not a single solicitor in Donegal made representation either directly or indirectly in favour of the establishment of a local registry there in substitution of that from which they had been cut off.  I do not believe there was any advertence in Donegal to the absence of such registry until I myself commented on the matter in the Dáil.  That gives the proportions of the thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The principal probate registry under the existing rule will not issue a grant unless the applicant or his solicitor attends in person at the registry.  I grant that it is more satisfactory for a solicitor in Cork city to attend at the registry there than having to pay a town agent to attend at the principal registry in Dublin. There is that much in it.  Then the district registry is empowered to do business by correspondence, and a solicitor in Tralee can get his grant in Cork or in Limerick without leaving his office or employing an agent, whereas at the principal registry he would have to go to Dublin or pay a solicitor to act for him.  There may be this, too, that the staffs in these district registries stand to gain or lose in their salaries according to the volume of business transacted in the local registry, and they endeavour to attract business, so to speak, arising in their areas and to keep the solicitors from having recourse to the principal registry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But apart from these considerations, which are more or less accidental and do not go to the root of the matter, the district probate registries, in fact, cause delay and confusion rather than speed and certainty, because every application made to the district registry has to go to the principal registry before it is passed, and official work, indexing and calendaring, and so on, is, in fact, doubled.  During the British time there was a probate registry in Derry which extended its area to include County Donegal.  Not a solicitor in Donegal complained that there was any inconvenience in doing business henceforth with the principal registry in Dublin.  Now the cry is economy; it is waning a bit, but it was very strong two months ago.  There was a cry for <Col N="448" /> economy, a cry for pruning unnecessary refinement of administration.</P>
    <P>Surely the case has to be examined whether this matter of the district probate registries, and so on, is not an unnecessary refinement in administration. If it is a fact it means that a particular thing has been done there and just that same thing is to be done in the central probate registry office, it simply means that there is overlapping. In connection with many of these outlying offices the justification for their existence will have to be called in question and will have to be weighed, and administrative decisions will have to be taken accordingly, not merely in the case of this office but in the case of the Land Registry and so on.  It is easy to raise a clamour.  A Senator or Deputy is approached by an officer in an outlying office who says &ldquo;I believe they are going to abolish us, and all here shall suffer for this,&rdquo; It is only by this process that the total of your outgoings will be pruned and brought down to within the limits of what we are told is the people's capacity to pay.</P>

      <P>I do not like to interrupt, but it seems to me that the discussion is altogether apart from the amendment.

      <P>I was invited by Senator Dowdall and his colleague to discuss the merits of these probate registries.  The Seanad concurred in that and I was endeavouring to do so, but Senator O'Farrell mortified himself by cutting in.  Perhaps the amendment is not worth the time spent on it.  I <Col N="449" /> disapprove of the idea underlying the amendment.  It is all right to talk of bureaucracy, but the Senator knows the constitutional position sufficiently.  If the Executive Council does anything of which the majority in the other House disagree, the Executive Council can be fired out.  Our responsibility is through the Dáil to the people, and I deprecate this tendency, which is found from time to time in amendments, to put up legislation that the Government is to be less a matter of particular individuals recognising their responsibilities, facing their responsibilities, and open to criticism, and more and more a matter of deliberation in one or other or both Houses on what is essentially an executive and administrative action.</P>
      <P>The Senator can wax very indignant about bureaucracy but the fact remains that it is the proper apportionment of the functions that the Dáil would legislate, that the Dáil would control finance, and that the Dáil would criticise policy closely and criticise the Estimates closely.  But the Dáil cannot govern and the Seanad cannot govern and the Dáil and the Seanad together cannot govern by resolution and cannot judge by resolution the merits of a particular administrative or executive action which is to be sifted out in departments and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Minister would really despair of being able to come to one or other of these Houses and discuss in all its bearings the case for or against particular executive proposals.  It is putting an <Col N="450" /> undue tax on the members of both Houses to expect that they would take on themselves those responsibilities in addition to their other functions.  I am wholly opposed to the amendment, not merely to the amendment itself, but to the amendment in the tendency it represents and the frame of mind from which it emanates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. DOWDALL Mr. DOWDALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister a question.  I asked him nothing about the volume of business in Donegal. What I had in mind was the business in Cork.  I was not approached by any official as was suggested, but I was approached by members of the legal profession of both branches who had business in this court. I was assured that it was a quick, economical and efficient way of dealing with small estates.  The Minister speaks of administrative action as if it were the merest trifle.  The closing of any court is not the merest trifle.  Obviously the Minister has, as we were told, power without this section of doing what he seeks to do now.  I move the amendment so that if an order was made closing one of these registries, that at least both Houses should have an opportunity of discussing it, and of hearing from any Minister for Justice what were the reasons for his action.  Evidently the Minister does not wish to have such a sifting of his action.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(2) Every whole-time clerk attached to the office of a Clerk of the Crown and Peace who shall at the date of the passing of this Act have served in such employment for a period of ten years and upwards and who shall not be re-employed in the service of the State shall be entitled to a pension to be ascertained according to the principles of the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1919, and the Acts extending or amending the same and such pension shall be charged upon and be payable out of the Central Fund of Saorstát Eireann and any such clerk as aforesaid who shall be re-employed in the service of the State after the passing of this Act shall on resignation or retirement be entitled to a pension to be calculated in manner aforesaid and his period of service in such employment as aforesaid before the passing of this Act shall be added to the period he shall have served after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>(4)  Subject to the provisions of this Act prescribing the qualifications and retiring ages for particular officers, every existing officer and servant other than a Clerk of the Crown and Peace who is not a temporary officer or servant shall be offered employment in a situation under this Act carrying not less salary than the situation held by him as such existing officer or servant at the passing of this Act.</P>

    <P>(a)  the acceptance of such employment shall not prejudice or affect (save as is hereinafter mentioned) his rights arising under Article 10 of the Treaty of 1921 on the abolition of his office,</P>
    <P>(b)  he shall not be entitled to receive any annual allowance under the said Article 10 in respect of any period for which he receives salary in a situation under this Act nor to receive any <Col N="453" /> gratuity or lump sum payment under the said Article 10 while receiving such salary,</P>

    <P>(d)  in lieu of the foregoing paragraphs, the offer of employment under this Act may be made conditional on his waiving all right to compensation under the said Article 10 in respect of abolition of or discharge from office but with the right to withdraw such waiver in the event of his being subsequently discharged from such employment for any reason other than age, misconduct, incapacity or ill-health,</P>

    <P>(i)  in computing the period of his service for the purpose of those Acts he shall be entitled to reckon as continuous service for those purposes whatever period (if any) of service he was or is deemed by virtue of this sub-section to have been entitled immediately before he so ceased to hold office to reckon as service for those purposes and his period <Col N="454" /> of service in a situation under this Act, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the Minister for Finance shall be substituted for the person authorised by those Acts to grant to him a pension or allowance, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  any pension or allowance granted to him shall be paid out of the moneys provided by the Oireachtas;</P>
    <P>(g)  if he was first appointed to his office in a temporary capacity under the Court Officers (Temporary Appointments) Act, 1924 (No. 2 of 1924) and was subsequently appointed to the same office in a pensionable capacity, he shall be entitled and shall be deemed to have been entitled immediately before he ceased by virtue of this section to hold office to reckon as continuous service in a pensionable capacity for the purposes of the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1923, his total period of service in such office from the date of his first appointment thereto in a temporary capacity;</P>
    <P>(h)  he may on the recommendation of the Minister be retained, with his own consent and the sanction of the Minister for Finance, in a situation under this Act until he attains the age of seventy years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was put down to get an assurance from the Minister.  I have it in my mind that &ldquo;salary&rdquo; in line 40 means scale of salary. The way the question arises is this: Every one of the court officers who is not disqualified by age will be offered employment under the new Bill.  The employment under the new Bill is to carry the same salary as the officer has under the present system.  It has occurred to certain nervous people that they might be called in and remain at the same salary.  I think the Minister gave an undertaking to the Dáil, and I think he will be able to give it now, that salary means scale of salary, and that persons taken on in the new employment <Col N="455" /> will get the same increments as they had in the old positions.</P>

      <P>I am quite definite that a person holding a situation carrying a salary of from £700 to £900 by annual increases of £25, that that would be the salary payable to the officer in question within the meaning of this Bill.  I have not the least doubt, and neither have my professional advisers, about that.  If I had I would accept the Senator's amendment right away. It is intended, of course, that persons coming in at a particular scale of salary shall come in on that scale and shall go ahead with their annual increments as hitherto.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I know exactly what attitude the Minister will take on this amendment.  He is afraid of the Judicature Act.  He is afraid that officers of the court who were appointed under the Judicature Act and who have certain rights and a certain measure of compensation under it could claim that they have these rights under Article 10 of the Treaty or that they have them under the Judicature Act in addition to Article 10 of the Treaty.  That is not the case I am making.  The way the Judicature Acts come in is this: Article 10 of the Treaty establishes a certain measure of compensation for a person whose office is abolished or persons discharged from their employment. The measure, I understand, comes under Schedule 8 of the Act of 1920.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> None of the officers in the courts are civil servants in the established sense. They therefore come in under Part 2 of Schedule 8 of the Act of 1920 which gives the measure of compensation of public officers who were discharged but were not in the established civil service. In measuring that compensation the first thing the tribunal or commission or whatever be the body that will decide, will be to ascertain what were the conditions of the appointment to the office.  Now most of the officers whose office is to be abolished in the Four Courts under the present Act hold their positions for life.  It will, in my opinion, be not only competent, but really the duty of whatever tribunal is sitting to ascertain compensation for officers of this kind to take into account the fact that the positions they have lost were offices for life.  Therefore, I think, whether the Ministers like it or not, the Judicature Act must come into whatever measure of compensation these officers will get.  I, therefore, suggest that he should allow the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; to go in.  They cannot do him any harm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, perhaps, not the best case to make for an amendment that it cannot do any harm.  I always posit that an amendment to be accepted should be an improvement of the Bill.  The Senator has not shown me that this amendment is an improvement of the Bill.  He damns it with faint praise.  The utmost he can urge is that it cannot do any harm.  It might do a little harm.  It would do a little harm if it seemed, in any way, to carry the implication that we were of opinion that these officers had rights under Article 10 of the Treaty, and if it was argued that under the Judicature Act, they had rights, other than those conferred under Article 10 of the Treaty; and if it was argued, hereafter, as it might well be, that those words were inserted specifically so as not to bar out rights that the Government, the Dáil and the Seanad, considered these officers had under the Judicature Act.  I am entirely satisfied that they have none, but I am unwilling to accept anything that would give the impression that we had any other view about it.  The relevant paragraph in the Act of 1877 is &ldquo;In case <Col N="458" /> it shall appear to the Lord Chancellor that by reason of consolidation or abolition of office under the provisions of this Act,&rdquo; and so and so.  And throughout you have simply reference to the changes effected by that Act.  I do not see how that can be brought in in the year 1926-1927 to affect officers whose position is altered not by the provisions of that Act but by the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <P>These officers never contended to me that they had any rights under the Judicature Act or any rights other than those conferred by the Treaty.  It is true there is no measure providing for High Court officials, but many other persons who were serving the British administration in this country at the date of the Treaty, are, and were, in that position.  There would be need for a tribunal to assess what their rights are.  There is no definite measure given by the Act of 1920.  Certain officers such, I think, as resident magistrates and Crown Solicitors, and certain others had to appear before a tribunal here in the absence of any measure as to what their compensation for loss of office would be.  I take it that the same would be the case with these court officials.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 61, sub-section (5).  After the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; in line 63 to insert <Col N="460" /> the words &ldquo;to any existing officer of less than fifteen years' service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an amendment the subject of which I dealt with very largely on the Second Reading, but as some of the Senators present to-day may not have been present then, I would like to explain the matter to them in as few words as possible.  It really is to my mind one of the most important amendments to the whole Bill.  The Bill abolishes every office in the courts, but all existing officers except those excluded by age or some disqualification are to be offered as nearly as possible corresponding posts and certainly posts at the same scales of salary.  They are to be offered these new posts on the terms as you will see set out in sub-section (5).  That is on &ldquo;waiving all right to compensation under the said Article 10.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now there is an old principle of equity that if a person is put to his election between two matters of choice he should know the facts as to both of them, so that he would be in a position to make up his mind definitely and fairly to himself between the two.  The difficulty does not arise in the case of officers who are only of very short service. An officer, say, of five or ten or twelve years does not care a pin about his rights under the Treaty.  He knows what his rights will be under this Bill when it is passed, and he is perfectly willing to take his chance of promotion, and is sure of his pension in that way.</P>
    <P>It is the officer of about forty years of age who has had fifteen years' service, is possibly a married man, that has to make up his mind, his office being abolished, and he being offered a post under the new Act, whether he will take that post with a similar salary, it is true, but with only the right of pension which the new Act gives him, or whether he will take his pension under Article 10.  I suggest to the Minister that it is not fair play to put a man of that age to that choice when he does not know one of the two matters which he has to choose.  Such a man does not know what his compensation will be if he goes and accepts his right under Article 10.  I put the <Col N="461" /> age at fifteen years.  The effect of the amendment will be that any officer who has fifteen years' service will not be put to his election.  He can take his new post under the new Act, and if he is discharged from his office he can fall back on his rights under the Treaty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has pounced on the weak chain in our armour when he comes up with this principle of equity that when a man is put to his election he should know what he is choosing.  I am prepared to meet that point by the statement that this provision in the Bill will not be put into operation.  No man will be put to his election until he is in a position to know what he is choosing between.  A certain number of officers go willy nilly when the Bill comes into operation on grounds of age and so on.  Until the principles of assessment are established in their case I undertake that these portions of the Bill will not be used.  I might grant the justice of that case that if a man is being made choose whether he goes to the new system as an official or goes out under Article 10 he has the right to know whether he will have to make a choice that will be based on realities and will be for his welfare in life, but a man will not be asked to judge in the dark, that is to chance his arm under Article 10 of the Treaty as against a definite known thing on the other side.</P>

On the other hand, in this and the other House, when matters are left over, they are left over with the implication that you are going to go very much more in the direction of meeting the mover than you are prepared to go.  I wanted to discuss this thing on its merits.  We are not, in fact, desiring that a man should go on as an official into a new system and at the same time refuse to waive his Article 10 rights or ask that they be kept in suspense for ever or something of that kind.  Men should, at the beginning of this new court system, make up their minds whether they are going to take up their stand definitely with the other officials of the State.

      <P>Our position is that there are people in the court not merely with fifteen but with twenty years' service to whom we propose to apply paragraph (d), believing, as we do that the prospects of promotion opened up by the Bill compensated them sufficiently at any rate, and in general we wish them to consider every case on its merits and exempt from paragraph (d)  only cases where it is undeniable that its operations would be harsh and unfair, but the Senator can take it that paragraph (d) is intended to rule the great majority of the cases and such cases as we exempt from it will be carefully considered.  What we want to say to the majority of the officials is that they have got to make a choice. They either go out under Article 10 or <Col N="463" /> go on, but only in a very limited number of cases can there be this special concession of having the Article 10 terms suspended in their favour.</P>

      <P>The Senator should ask himself what is the basis of the Treaty compensation?  Why was it provided for at all?  It is to protect a man who is discharged from office in an arbitrary manner at the whim of the <Col N="464" /> new Government or who because of one reason or another, or for a dozen reasons, is obnoxious to the new administration, but the proposal of the Senator goes very much beyond that.  Clearly if a man is discharged because he has gone blind, because he is 95 years of age, because he is not able to write or talk, he has no real claim for compensation under the Treaty.  It was not to cover that kind of case that the Treaty compensation was agreed upon.  Whatever claim such a man might have for a pension in the ordinary way or for a gratuity, he is not entitled to a pension on the basis of compensation the provisions for which are inserted in an international document.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a picturesque phrase&mdash;thrown on the scrap-heap&mdash;but it is not a question of throwing him on the scrap-heap.  It is a question of whether he should be entitled to some compensation rights, the provisions for which were embodied in the Treaty to meet an entirely different class of case, because other officials not protected by Article 10 may get ill, may get blind or any one of a dozen other physical afflictions may befall them.  They do not get the rights of Article 10.  This hypothetical individual for whom the Senator has sympathy will get the same treatment that the ordinary officers of the State will get, but not the special compensation provided for in the Treaty which was not agreed upon with any advertence to these cases of illness or physical afflictions at all.  If a man waived the Treaty rights and is thrown out of employment we will only allow these rights to revive if that man is arbitrarily dismissed through no fault or failure of his own, but if he gets ill and cannot do his work we will treat him just as we would treat one of our own civil servants in the same set of circumstances. We will not treat him any better and we will not treat him any worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our position with regard to the Article 10 man is this: If you come in <Col N="465" /> you are one of our men with the ordinary rights of a civil servant.  The only addition to that is that if you are arbitrarily dismissed yon can withdraw your waiver of the Article 10 rights and your Article 10 rights are then revived. They are not revived because of some affliction or some set of circumstances which render an official unable to continue to perform his duties.  They are only revived to meet one case, and that is the one case that we arranged to meet&mdash;the case of arbitrary dismissal&mdash;but if a man goes on a career of intoxication or does not turn up at his office these rights do not apply.  That is taking one aspect of the thing. Taking another, if he becomes stricken so that he cannot continue work&mdash;these are not circumstances calling for the revival of his Article 10 rights because that might happen to other officials who are not guarded by Article 10.  I could not accept the Senator's amendment. It does not appear sound or equitable.</P>

Senator Haughton proposes to leave out the words &ldquo;age,&rdquo;&ldquo;misconduct,&rdquo;&ldquo;incapacity&rdquo; or &ldquo;ill-health,&rdquo; and to substitute the word &ldquo;misconduct,&rdquo; and Senator Brown merely proposes to delete the words &ldquo;incapacity or ill-health,&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;incapacity.&rdquo;</P>

The original Act of 1924 confined the provision for loss of employment very properly to loss of employment sustained as a result of the Act, that is through reason of the amalgamation.

The arbitrator should be allowed to exercise his discretion.  We have deleted this word in Section 4, and it is for that reason that I move that it should be deleted in this section.

    </Speaker>
    <P>An amendment very much wider than this was moved by Senator O'Farrell on the Committee Stage.  I voted for it, but I do feel that that amendment went rather far, and now this amendment is very much more restricted. The underlying principle in the Bill is the question as to whether a man's services have been rendered unnecessary owing to amalgamation.  It is still open to the company to cite any of the reasons as against redundancy, and I think they may be safely left to cite these reasons without their being enumerated as they have been in this section.  For instance, in this section, after going into a number of restrictions, <Col N="469" /> for fear anything would be left out, we have the words, &ldquo;or other economic cause.&rdquo;  That is very wide.  If the company contest a man's claim to compensation they will be represented by counsel and solicitor, who are experts on these matters, and the man should be left some chance of getting compensation, which was the intention of the original Act.  The Minister may think that the Principal Act was too wide, and should be restricted by this Bill.  The section, I think, would be sufficiently tight and stringent if the words that I have moved be deleted are deleted.  The railwaymen feel that they have very little chance of compensation if the claim is decided before the arbitrator.  Anybody who reads this section will see that the deletion of the words I have moved will still leave the railway company in a very strong position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. BAGWELL Mr. BAGWELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak against this amendment.  How I read this clause does not matter very much. How the arbitrator will read it is very important.  If I read this amendment accurately it seems to me that if it is passed the railway company will have to pay compensation to any employees who become redundant for any reason besides amalgamation.  If that is so, I fail to see why this particular industry should be deprived of the rights to dispense with the service of any of its employees.  I do not see that the company can benefit much from the process of amalgamation, and I do not see that it should be singled out for this exceptional treatment, and compelled to do a thing that no other commercial concern would be asked to do.  To do what this amendment would effect would be against economic laws.  I may be wrong in my reading of the amendment, but that is my impression of it. It would obviously retard all developments.</P>

    <P>If part of a duty of a railway porter was to light the lamps of a station at, say, 8 o'clock in the evening, and when the Minister's Shannon scheme was <Col N="470" /> fully working, and the lamps are lighted by turning on a switch from the stationmaster's office, that might be pleaded as a ease of that man's redundancy.</P>

Let us say that instead of the Minister's Shannon scheme some new invention came along which the railways adopted for the switching on of the lights, and then pleaded that was the real reason for this man not being redundant, and availed of the opportunity which, I think, this section gives a railway company, would that be fair? I consider that is not quite fair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Senator chose the illustration he did, and it shows the dangers of accepting the amendment.  What the Senator has said is that something quite apart from amalgamation comes along and it renders less men necessary, and under cover of the Amalgamation of Railways Act the railway companies are going to be made to compensate that man as if he were retired from the service of the company by reason of amalgamation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I must again advert to the Senator's failure to distinguish the difference between pleading and proving.  A company can plead anything, but they have to prove to the satisfaction of the arbitrator that a man's dismissal is due to some of those things mentioned.  Take this vague term &ldquo;other economic causes.&rdquo;  If a railway company can show that a particular individual's dismissal is due to economic causes, then I say it was never the intention when the 1924 Bill was going through to pay compensation to such a man.  The whole idea was you are not going to have the benefit expected to accrue from amalgamation <Col N="471" /> where hardship is due to the amalgamated scheme.  Take the position, of two railways.  Take the Great Northern Railway, where a big number of men have been dismissed from time to time as the economic requirements of the company and traffic necessitated.  Then take the Southern Railways Company, and, say, the company put in electric lights which would deprive a certain number of lamp-lighters of employment, are the Great Northern Railway to be allowed to get rid of their men without compensation while the Great Southern have to pay?  One is the effect of amalgamation, and the other is not.  We want to give compensation to people who have suffered by reason of amalgamation, but for no other reason. The Senator has said if the words be omitted, after the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; in line 33 down to line 39 that the railway company may still bring in any of these arguments as a reason for a man dismissal.  Why does the Senator want these words omitted?</P>

      <P>Section 2, sub-section (3).  To delete the sub-section and to substitute therefor a new sub-section, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) For the purposes of this section any period of service as a trade apprentice with any amalgamating or absorbed company shall be reckoned at the rate of one half of the actual period of the apprenticeship with such amalgamating or absorbed company.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apprentices to a trade after some little time become of some use, and as time goes on they become more and more skilled.  The railway companies recognise that because they pay a small wage, increasing after each year of service as an apprentice.  While I do not think it fair to ask that apprenticeship <Col N="472" /> service should count as full service, still I think that this is a reasonable compromise, and it has been agreed to in the English Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. BAGWELL Mr. BAGWELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against the amendment.  The principle is altogether contrary to the regular practice of apprenticeship.  Apprenticeship does not imply continuity of employment as is well known.  It is a most excellent system for enabling boys to learn a trade.  If the principle in the amendment were admitted, implying continuity of employment, it would be a sure way of killing the apprenticeship system.  When boys have served their time they have to find employment in the market elsewhere.  That is a natural and by no means unsatisfactory position.  I think a most objectionable principle is involved in this amendment.  If it were passed there would be less apprenticeship.  As a result of the way in which this form of compensation would work out there are several men between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-four who would actually be given, compensation for loss of apprenticeship in the form of an annual pension.  I think that that is a most extraordinary theory and most unfair to the employers, and I believe also to the employees discharged for economic reasons, and who would see these apprentices who had no continuity of employment guaranteed by the nature of their apprenticeship treated in this exceptional way.</P>

      <P>In reference to Senator Bagwell's remarks, I said nothing at all about continuity of employment. I do not seek to enforce continuity.  Take the case of a boy who served six years as an apprentice and who continues to work in the railway for eight years after that.  What I seek in this amendment is credit for eight year and for half of six years, in all eleven years.  In every other business, whether in the Civil Service or in a commercial business, it is well known that a boy during the first year is a confounded nuisance.  He sends letters to the wrong people and puts them into the wrong envelopes.  All the same in the Civil Service or in a commercial house a boy's years of <Col N="473" /> apprenticeship count from the time he went in.  Why should there be differtiation in the railways?  I only ask that an apprentice should be allowed half the period of his apprenticeship in calculating his claim.</P>

      <P>Senator Bagwell's contention is the proper contention in this respect.  The Bill sets out to compensate officers and servants. The point that we should consider is: what was the prospect of continuity of employment in the railway service? Senator Bagwell has told the Seanad what it was.  There was no prospect of continuity.  There was hardly even a reasonable expectation of employment in the railway service.  This Bill only seeks to compensate those who were considered officers and servants.  No one could consider apprentices in that category.</P>

      <P>I would like to take the point that you make about apprentices. The apprenticeship period does not entitle him and was never considered to entitle him to a prospect of continuity of employment in the railway service.  Why, because he happens to have got further years of service should he go back to the apprenticeship? We recognise that that is the difficulty.  This is a matter of principle and you cannot have a compromise on it.  If the Senator thinks it right to count the apprenticeship period at all, <Col N="474" /> why not count the whole years?  Why take 50 per cent.?  I put it to the Committee that if it accepts the proposal in regard to the apprenticeship years there is no reason for saying that an apprentice who has gone into the service of the railway company should not count all the years he was in the service of the railway company.  You can only count the period he was a fully fledged officer of the railway company after the apprenticeship.</P>

      <P>New section.  Before Section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;Every officer or servant of the amalgamated company with twelve years' service or upwards whose service is dispensed with for any cause other than misconduct or incapacity, shall be deemed to have lost his employment through amalgamation and shall be entitled to compensation accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Since I put it down I had an interview with the manager of the Great Southern Railways, and he assured me that the object I had in view has already been arranged between the representatives of the railwaymen and the management.  The object I had in view was that men who had been longest in the service would be retained. The manager assured me that the company had accepted the policy that those last in should be first out.  I have been informed also that if this amendment is carried it will upset the whole Bill. Accordingly I ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;Every claim for the payment of a gratuity or of compensation arising under the Third Schedule to the Principal Act shall be determined by the amalgamated company or on appeal by the standing arbitrator or board of arbitrators in accordance with the provisions of the said Third Schedule as amended by Section 2 of this Act if the date of the happening of the event giving rise to the claim occurred before the 26th day of March, 1926, or in accordance with the provisions of the said Third Schedule as amended by this Act if the event giving rise to the claim occurs after the 25th day of March, 1926.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is that the Bill will apply to men with short service who became redundant on the 26th March.  In all other cases the Bill is to apply since the introduction.  At the beginning of the proceedings before the arbitrator the company expressed objection to expediting the hearing of cases.  Answers which should have been delivered within ten days were not delivered until long afterwards.  The company got extensions to three</P>

If the arbitrator had been allowed to proceed a great many cases would have been decided that have been held over.  It is not fair to men who were considered redundant, say, in <Col N="476" /> February last year, whose cases were held over, that they should now come in.  If the arbitrator was allowed to proceed, as he could have done but for the delay of the company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No.  But as to the Minister's quibble about evidence, I have not come here with an enclycopædia of cases tabulated in detail for his information.  He knows, or he ought to know, that I am stating facts. As a matter of fact, the arbitrator heard no cases since the 25th March. Perhaps the Minister would tell us why.  I am asking him for evidence this time.  I think it is not right that owing to the dilatoriness of the railway company in holding up cases, and only consenting to appear before the arbitrator twice a week instead of from day to day, the men should now suffer disability by reason of the company's want of diligence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the case that was made in the Dáil.  It was made on Second Reading; it was made on the Committee Stage, and it was made on the Report Stage.  Every time that it was made I asked for a little evidence.  Beyond the mere statement we got nothing.  I go now to the other extreme.  I can say it was the men's representative that caused the delay.  I have as little evidence for that statement as the Senator has for his statement.  I have asked, over and over <Col N="477" /> again, if there was any evidence that the Company caused delay, or definitely delayed cases, that that evidence should be given.  If the evidence was given the stronger would be the case for some change with regard to the operative date for this measure.  There has been no evidence.  This question has not been asked without notice, and I ask now for the fourth time publicly to have some evidence produced.  I make the statement here now definitely that there was dilatoriness on the part of the men's representatives.  If the Senator brings forward evidence, at a later date, with regard to there being delay on the part of the companies I am prepared to bring forward evidence on the other hand.  I believe I have evidence, but I do not want to bring it out.  I do not believe it is going to be to the credit of certain people.  It is not for me to criticise people in their professional activities.</P>

      <P>I said until there is some evidence which I have to rebut as regards the Railway Company on the one side, I have to retort by making a case on the other.  I prefer to leave the matter there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole question of retrospection was considered with great detail in the Dáil.  The Bill, as it stood, was definitely retrospective, and sought to upset decisions and awards already made by arbitration.  That was very violently objected to in the Dáil.  I promised that the retrospective portion would be knocked out.  I consulted certain people who had been vehement about this particular section, and the result is the clause in the Bill as it now stands.  That was queried by the Labour Deputies in the Dáil, but I think that the representatives of the other parties who talked against the retrospective element admit that the clause, as it now stands, meets their viewpoint.  Their point was that there should not be such retrospection as would upset decisions or interfere with awards already given.  That is the position as it is.  I may simply say this that the effect of passing this amendment would be to render this <Col N="478" /> Bill, as far as any change from the 1924 Act, absolutely useless.  There have been many cases already listed for arbitration&mdash;235 since the 25th of March&mdash;although, of course, some of the dismissals may have taken place some date previous to the 25th March. But eighty or ninety per cent. of the possible cases that will arise are going to have the provisions of the old schedule operating.</P>
