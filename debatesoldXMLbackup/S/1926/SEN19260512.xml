      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Section 13, sub-section (1). (a) To delete in line 19 the words &ldquo;other place of residence&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;tenement of which the debtor is the occupier,&rdquo; and (b) to delete in line 24 the words &ldquo; other place of residence of the debtor&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;tenement of which the debtor is the occupier.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this section was before the House on the last day the Seanad met I proposed an amendment the object of which was to prevent the sheriff from having any protection if he seized the goods of, say, a father, which were in a room in the father's house occupied by the son.  Originally as the section stood he could have done that, and got the protection of the section, and in order for the father to reclaim his goods he would have to lodge their value and adopt the procedure laid down.  The amendment which I proposed was as above.  It has been suggested by the Minister that the word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; is slightly vague, because the person whose goods you want to give the sheriff protection for seizing might be the sole occupier or might hold jointly with others.  Therefore, I propose to add after the word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo;&ldquo;either alone or jointly with another or others.&rdquo;  I am therefore <Col N="64" /> moving my own amendment with those added words.</P>

    <P>(a)  scales of fees and expenses to be charged by and paid to under-sheriffs for their services in or about the execution of execution orders, and</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 14, sub-section (1).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;and may prescribe a period within which the under-sheriff shall be required to make a return.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When this Bill came up for Second Reading I ventured to suggest that the public at large should require a certain amount of protection.  I saw where, in many cases, decrees were placed in the hands of the sheriff and very undue delay had taken place.  I understood the Minister recommended me to put down an amendment dealing with the question, and I think the simplest is the one I have suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is prepared to accept it or not, but I know that it would be a very desirable thing that some powers should be taken to compel the sheriffs to act as they ought.  I have a letter in my pocket which I only received yesterday from a solicitor in the country stating that he had placed in the hands of a sheriff in March, 1925, a certain decree, and that he had no return since, that he had written to the sheriff for a return, and that he had got no answer; that he had placed other decrees in the hands of the sheriff some months later, and that he had no reply in these cases either.  I think it is obvious, and it must be the experience of many Senators, that that state of things frequently arises and <Col N="66" /> that it would be most desirable to provide some period and some regulation leaving it in the hands of the Minister to say that such things would not happen in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not inclined to accept this amendment.  There has been recently, I think, in various cases, undue delay.  But we are just getting out of a period of exceptional difficulties and a period in which there was an accumulation of decrees and various orders in the hands of the sheriff.  I do not think there is likely to be any such delay in the future as in the past. At present the sheriff must make a return within a reasonable period, and if he does not do so the creditor can apply to the court to get an order compelling him.  That remedy should suffice.  Two months have been held to be a reasonable period, but it would be unwise to fix a definite period.  There are some cases in which the delay is to the advantage of the creditors.  In thirty per cent. of the cases the debtor pays by instalment, and the period taken to complete the instalments is often over two months, whereas if the sheriff were required to make a return within a prescribed period he would have to go in and sell the man up, and that would be bad for both the creditor and the debtor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another disadvantage in compelling the sheriff to make a return within a limited period. If he is compelled to make this return of goods within a limited period he may make a return of &ldquo;no goods,&rdquo; but if he is only subject to the existing law he will probably wait until he has an opportunity of realising in a more favourable way and to the advantage of the creditor.</P>

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that under the law as it stands, up to the present, a creditor can, at any time, apply to the court for a rule or order by the court calling on the sheriff to make the return?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>

      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Sections 14 to 20 inclusive stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 21.</P>
      <P>(1)  Proceedings by way of interpleader may be instituted by an under-sheriff before the District Court in any case in which the under-sheriff shall have taken in execution or intended execution any goods, animals, or other chattels under any execution order and such goods, animals, or chattels are claimed by some person other than the debtor, and the value of such goods, animals, or chattels does not exceed twenty-five pounds.</P>
      <P>(2)  On the hearing by the District Court of any interpleader proceedings under this section, the Justice shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine all matters in issue between the parties, including the amount of and liability for costs, and to make such order thereon as justice shall require.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; In Section 21, sub-section (1), after the word &lsquo;under-sheriff&rsquo; in line 36, to insert the words &lsquo;or the owner of any goods seized.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was up for discussion before. The explanation given to the Seanad by, I think, Senator Brown, was that to enable the sheriff to interplead in the courts, as is now proposed, and where the procedure is more simple than in the past, it was necessary to insert this clause.  If that is so in the case of the sheriff, would it not also be necessary in the case of a person whose goods were seized?  I thought it was desirable to call attention to the fact.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion I had an amendment on the supplementary Order Paper to delete all after the word &ldquo;debtor&rdquo; in sub-section (1), line 40, down to the end of the sub-section.

      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>You can move it now.  As I understand it, this jurisdiction at present attaches to the Circuit Court.  The object of the section is, where the amount of value of the goods is under £25, to enable them to go to the District Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because the under-sheriff would have the right to summon both the creditor and the claimant of the property seized before <Col N="69" /> the District Justice, who has power to examine right away into the merits of the claim, declaring the ownership of the goods, and assessing the damages if necessary.  It might be a rough form of justice, but it would be a cheap and a fairly efficient form.  It would save the under-sheriff being in possession for more than three or four days, and it would save both parties expense and would work more satisfactorily than the procedure at present, where the person claiming the goods has to put down a substantial deposit in some cases.  In this case that would not be necessary.  The argument might be advanced that this might give rise to claims that have not a chance of being substantiated.  That might be met by a subsequent amendment where, if it was found that there was perjury or anything approaching it, the papers might be sent to the Attorney-General with a view to a prosecution for perjury. That would put a stop to bogus claims and it would facilitate the administration of the law if there was a quicker procedure instead of holding over the matter for months, involving the payment of a large amount of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>This section does not interfere with existing procedure. An interpleader could be taken, and would be taken, before the Circuit Court with expedition.  The difficulty about your amendment arises in this way: That it is a very big enlargement of the jurisdiction of the District Court, which is limited under the Courts of Justice Act.  If you are going now to give unlimited jurisdiction, then the District Court might be able to entertain cases involving thousands of pounds' worth of property. I am afraid the amendment is very revolutionary in that respect.  As long as you do not interfere with the existing interpleader's jurisdiction, but simply give in some small cases this right, conferred for the first time, to go to the District Justice and limit them to cases of £25, you are going pretty far. I do not think that the difficulty that you anticipate will arise.  It will be as easy to get a big case disposed of in the Circuit Court as in the District Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit it would be revolutionary, but in other sections we are decidedly revolutionary, and are giving extraordinary powers to the under-sheriffs.  I think there should be counter power to check it and keep it within bounds.  Of course, it might be impracticable, but I think it is a most important consideration.  Unfortunately my amendment is not on the Order Paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the view of the Government has been given expression to by the Cathaoirleach.  The ordinary jurisdiction is limited in the District Court to sums not exceeding £25 and we think that that should be the limit of the sum here, too.  It would be undesirable to have before the District Court cases involving large sums of money, perhaps £1,000 or over, and also very complicated questions with regard to ownership. In all cases of substantial amounts the jurisdiction should remain to the Circuit Courts.  If, in an ordinary case, we limit the jurisdiction of the District Justice to £25 these are not cases in which that sum should be increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to explain that.  I entirely sympathise with Senator O'Farrell's anxiety to have cases brought, as quickly as possible, before the court.  It is true that there would be more delay in the Circuit Court and the Higher Court in bringing this issue to trial, but then the Circuit Court sits every month, in every county, and in the High Court you could get an interpleader motion dealt with on any day.</P>

I cannot imagine that any person would be so foolish as to run the risk of prosecution for perjury by making a false declaration.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment for the sake of getting some reply from the Minister.  It seems to me to be a little ineffective in that it gives three days in which a sworn declaration shall be served on the under-sheriff, while the Bill enables him to sell within 48 hours.  The amendment urged by Senator Brown. which has been carried, does not in my opinion materially improve the Bill, and it does not touch the really vital problem with which we are concerned. I am very disappointed with the fact that the Minister has not put down an amendment, because he came to me after the last sitting and showed me words which I was prepared to accept, and which in my opinion were eminently satisfactory and would have saved a good deal of possible abuse in the future.  I expected to see them in the Order Paper to-day, but they do not appear.  We must remember that the Court Officers Bill provides that the court registrars shall in the future, as under-sheriffs retire, become the under-sheriffs.  The court registrar is a man with a multiplicity of duties, and he will not be able to give the personal attention and consideration to matters that the present sub-sheriff does.  He will have to administer the <Col N="73" /> law according to the letter, and not on the strength of circulars such as the Minister has issued to under-sheriffs. The work will be done for him by civil servants, people who are absolutely detached from the community as a rule, and who will not be able to use the same supervision over local affairs as the under-sheriffs do at present. The result will be that the law will be administered ruthlessly, or what one might term, in a mechanical way.  This is a very serious power to place in the hands of people who are not in intimate touch with the community, and are not fairly intimate with the people with whom they are dealing.  For that reason I think the section is still in a very dangerous form.  I am very much disappointed the Minister for Justice has not put down the words to which he was prepared to agree.</P>

      <P>I do not know the words to which Senator O'Farrell refers, but this particular matter has been given a good deal of consideration. There was some consultation with Senator Brown, and it was felt that his amendment as put down was a most satisfactory way of meeting with certain difficulties, which undoubtedly did exist in the section as originally drafted.  It would certainly prevent the sort of cases occurring which were mentioned in the Seanad, of a son running up debts, and having his father's goods seized simply because his son lived in the house.  Senator Brown's amendment would prevent anything like that.  On the other hand, the amendment by Senator Linehan would undoubtedly lead to fraudulent claims, claims which people would not be deterred from making by any fear that the persons who made them would be amenable for perjury.  There might be fraudulent claims which would lead to the release of goods, and which, perhaps, everyone would know were fraudulent, and that the declaration was in the nature of perjury, but it would be a very difficult matter to get evidence to convict for perjury.  I do not know that any person in this <Col N="74" /> country is deterred by fear of a conviction for perjury from making a false declaration.</P>

      <P>If a person has a good claim he will generally be able to put up the money himself, or get the means of putting it up, provided he has a genuine claim.  Now he has twenty-four hours in which to do that, and no sheriff, if the value of the goods or the decree, whichever happens to be the lesser, were lodged, would proceed with the sale, and if the creditor disputed the claim of the person who alleged the goods were his, then the sheriff would be able to resort to proceedings by way of interpleader.  I think that would provide a sufficient remedy, and a better remedy than would be provided by the mere making of a declaration, under which the goods that had been seized would be released and put in a place where the sheriff could not get his hands on them, and that would enable this whole execution of court decrees to be very seriously interfered with.</P>

    <P>19.&mdash;(1)  Any proceedings under Part III. of the Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) Act, 1924 (No. 20 of 1924) which were pending in the District Court immediately before the expiration of that Act, may be continued under this Part of this Act, and all steps lawfully taken and things lawfully done in such proceedings before the passing of this Act shall be deemed to have been done under this Part of this Act as if this Act had been in force at the time when such steps were taken or such things were done.</P>
    <P>(2)  Nothing in this section shall operate to render any person liable to any punishment or penalty for any act (whether of commission or omission) done by him in the period between the expiration of the said Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) Act, 1924, and the passing of this Act which would have been lawful if this section had not been enacted.</P>

      <P>With regard to this Bill I wish to say that it is the first important piece of serious legislation we have so far carried through.  As Senators will see from the document in front of them, the Bill has been amended out of all recognition.  It was originally a Bill, I think, of three clauses, and it is now a comprehensive and important proposal.  Although it is quite within the power of the House, having regard to the Constitutional precedents that exist in the matter, to consider on Report a Bill so drastically changed as that in Committee, I would venture to suggest that, in view of the fact that it is our first piece of legislation, it would be wiser to discharge the Order for the Second Reading of the Bill, and to discharge the Order committing it to a Select Committee, so that the Bill may be introduced in its present shape <i>de novo.</i> That will serve a double and a useful purpose.  It will give the House an opportunity of considering this useful Bill in Committee, which they have not had because it was referred to a Select Committee.  It will also show to the public and the other House that this Bill is the result of careful consideration, and it being, as I said, our first <Col N="78" /> real serious attempt at legislation, I would recommend the House to adopt that course.  I wish to make one other observation in reference to it.  In Committee we had the advantage of the assistance and evidence of Mr. Horgan, representing the Coroners' Association.  On behalf of the Committee I wish to acknowledge the very valuable help he gave us.  It was all the more valuable because it was manifestly given, not with a view to the interests as those he represented so much as the interests of the community as a whole.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the motion.  I was going to raise the matter myself but the statement you have made, a Chathaoirligh, has completely satisfied me that there is no necessity for me to do so.  As you remarked when this Bill passed its Second Reading, it contained only three clauses.  These three clauses are now deleted.  Even the title of the Bill has been deleted, so that really the Bill we gave a Second Reading to is not now <Col N="79" /> before us.  The course you have recommended is, I think, the proper course to adopt&mdash;to have the Bill come before us <i>de novo</i> and receive its Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I think there is no doubt that the course suggested by the Cathaoirleach is the right one but I think it would be better, as has now been proposed by Senator Brown, that we should leave over the Second Stage of the Bill, because that would have to be formally rescinded.  It could not be discharged without the assent of so many Senators.  It is very rarely that I rise to propose that Standing Orders be suspended but I do so now because it occurs to me that if there is no possibility of the House meeting next week it would be for the convenience of the House if Senator Brown were allowed to introduce the new Bill to-day. That would enable him to make an explanatory statement on the Second Stage of the Bill.  That would be what the House generally would desire.  I therefore move that the Standing Orders be suspended for the purpose of enabling leave to be given to introduce this Bill without notice.</P>

      <P>In regard to the business of the House I am anxious to ask Senators to consider what course they would like to take.  As matters stand at present, there are three Bills which would be available for the Second Stage next week.  None of them is, I think, very contentious, except perhaps that there may be a good deal to be said in regard to the Court Officers Bill on the Second Stage.  Consequently, if we meet on Wednesday next, we shall have no business but the consideration of the Second Stage of these three Bills.  It occurred to me that I would be consulting the convenience of Senators if I convened a meeting for Wednesday week.  Then we could sit on Thursday, and if necessary, on Friday, for the purpose of disposing of these Bills or of getting them as far advanced as we possibly could.  I personally think that a continuous sitting of two or three days would be, perhaps, more suitable than a short, brief sitting this day week for one day only.  However, I am entirely in the hands of the Seanad.</P>
