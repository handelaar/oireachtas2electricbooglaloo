      <P>Before we proceed with the business on the Agenda I must take the House into my confidence with regard to the existing state of business and the nature of the business yet to be discharged in this House. Necessity has arisen owing to the fact of a statement made by the President in the other House to the effect that six Bills at present in the other House would, the President hoped and expected, be got through all their stages by Friday next.  It is a rather sanguine estimate, I think, but, however, he is a better judge of that than I am. He, at the same time, wrote to me officially saying that it would be necessary for him, if the Dáil were to rise on Friday next, to be in a position to give some approximate date as to when they would be called back to receive the business which, in the meantime, has passed through this House.  In reply to that communication I have sent a letter to the President in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I have carefully considered the minute dated the 25th instant, sent to the Clerk of the Seanad by the Secretary to the Executive Council in regard to the legislation which the Government are desirous of having completed before the recess; but, in view of the number of Bills which are now, towards the end of the session, being sent to the Seanad, Bills which, in some cases, have been for no inconsiderable time before the other House and which, in some cases, are certain to be regarded as contentious, I find it impossible to give any indication of the length of time which will elapse before the Seanad will have completed its deliberations on them.  Five Bills have <Col N="552" /> reached the Seanad within the last week and I understand from the minute that we may expect to receive six more before Friday next. When the Committee Stage of these Bills is reached and we see how many amendments are tabled to them I shall be in a better position to send you a satisfactory reply.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The state of business is as follows: We have, as you see from that letter, seven Bills at present under consideration. There is the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Bill; that was introduced in the other House on the 7th May and was not passed until the 22nd June.  Then there are the Local Government (Collection of Rates) Bill, the Housing Bill, the Court Officers Bill, the University Education Bill, the Road Fund (Advances) Bill and the Juries (Dublin) Bill.  Those are the seven at present passing through their various stages in this House, but in addition to these seven it is contemplated to send forward in the course of this week six further Bills: the Finance Bill, which is, of course, a Bill of considerable importance though a Money Bill, the Betting Bill, the Tariff Commission Bill, the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Bill, the Local Authorities (Mutual Assurance) Bill and the Appropriation Bill.  In addition to these it is the intention, I believe, of the Minister for Justice, once the Court Officers Bill has been passed through both Houses, to tabulate new rules of procedure and practice which, under the Statute, are required to be approved of by both Houses.  We have not received these yet.  They have not been tabled.  The Minister apparently thinks he is not entitled to table them until the Court Officers Bill has been passed into law. That is a matter for his own view.  I myself cannot see the necessity for holding them up until then.  It is quite true that we cannot pass rules of procedure and practice until we have passed the Court Officers Bill because rules of procedure and practice provide for the duties of at least one new official and, consequently, a Bill authorising the payment of that official has got to be passed before we pass rules of procedure and practice relative <Col N="553" /> to this officer and the other officers. In my opinion there was nothing to prevent the two running concurrently so long as the Court Officers Bill passed into law at least a day before the other.  The whole legal position would be met if the Court Officers Bill were passed to-day and we passed the rules the following day.  However, that is a matter for the Minister in charge of the Bill.</P>
    <P>What I want to call your attention to is this: Of the Bills I mention that are still before us, that have reached up and are at present going through this House there are three, I think, not contentions. One is the Local Government (Collection of Rates) Bill.  Another is the Juries (Dublin) Bill and the Road Fund (Advances) Bill.  So far as I know, these three Bills were not regarded as contentious in the other House and I do not know whether there is any intention to treat them otherwise in this House.  If there were no Senator anxious to put down amendments to these three Bills I should ask the Seanad to take the Committee Stage of these three Bills to-morrow.  If any Senator contemplates putting down amendments to any of these three Bills, then it would not be convenient or proper to ask that they should be rushed to-morrow.  With regard to the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Bill, the Housing Bill, and the University Education Bill, they are to a certain degree contentious and I know there are Senators who intend and desire to put down amendments to them.  Therefore, I think it would not be reasonable to take the Committee Stage of these to-morrow.  I think we ought to give an opportunity to the House to consider what amendments they would table and when they have tabled them to give them time to consider them.</P>
    <P>That leaves us in the position that we cannot expect reasonably to finish even the Bills before us already this week.  We will dispose of one or two of them, I think.  Probably we will be able to dispose of about three out of the six, but I think the concluding stages of three of the Bills will have to be carried out next week.  Therefore, for next week, there would not be <Col N="554" /> merely the concluding stages of three more or less contentious Bills, but also new Bills, including the Finance Bill, which we will receive for the first time next week.  None of those will reach us this week.  They will only be introduced to-day or to-morrow, and cannot reach us by any possibility this week. Therefore, next week we will have the concluding stages of these three Bills, and the consideration and passing of the new Bills.  I am not in a position myself to give any indication to the Minister as to when we are likely to conclude our labours.  I think it is in the interests of the Deputies that they should have some reasonable information as to when they will be called back for the purpose of receiving those Bills from our hands.  I cannot help them in that, and it will be for the House to say how far they will be able to give any promise in the matter. I have, with the assistance of the Clerk, sketched out a time-table for next week, which would involve our meeting on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  I have sketched out an agenda for each of those days, but I can tell the House it will mean hard work if they are to put all this mass of legislation through this week.</P>
    <P>I have only to say that I express my regret that the Executive Council has not seen its way to introduce some of those Bills into this House.  I see no reason why some of those Bills should not have been introduced into this House weeks ago, and by this they would have been passed into law.  I have thrown out that suggestion already to the Executive Council, but evidently this House has been divorced, so far as the Government is concerned, from the initiation of Government Bills. That, of course, may be their policy.  I think, myself, it would be more in the interests of, certainly the efficiency of, this House, and also the dispatch of public business, if many of those not very contentious Bills were originated and passed in their first stages here.  I have nothing more to say in that matter. I do not know whether the House considers itself in a position to consider this matter now.  Perhaps they might think it over amongst themselves, and we might agree on some approximate date to-morrow.  I wish to <Col N="555" /> mention in regard to the Finance Bill that, of course, as the House knows, it being a Money Bill, it is not within the power of this House to amend it, but they have the most ample power of making and passing recommendations, and it is the one opportunity they get for the purpose of discussing questions of finance in regard to various public departments in which any particular Senator may be interested.  If there is any particular Vote in connection with any Department affected by the Finance Bill upon which any Senator would like to speak, I would be very glad if he would intimate to the Clerk of the Seanad, before Monday next if possible, what the particular Vote or what the particular Department may be, that he wishes to discuss or to criticise. That will enable me to give information to the Minister of the particular Department concerned, who may be anxious to be present in the Seanad when the matter is being discussed.</P>

      <P>That is a suggestion, if the House wishes to fall in with it&mdash;that so far as the Finance Bill is concerned Senators should confine themselves to discussing finance as distinct from administration and reserve any matters of administration for discussion on the Appropriation Bill.  That does not, however, get us much further towards solving the question of how long these operations are likely to take us.  It is with that object <Col N="556" /> that I am anxious that Senators should think the matter over and perhaps on to-morrow we could give some approximate date to the President with a view to being able to consult the convenience of Deputies of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I move that the Seanad agree with the Dáil in the following amendment:</P>
      <P>New Section.  Before Section 21 a new section inserted, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Commissioners may, at their discretion, grant to any whole-time officer or servant in their employment who either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  has attained the age of sixty-five years and has at least twenty-five years' continuous service, or</P>
      <P>(b)  becomes incapable of discharging his duties with efficiency by reason of permanent infirmity of mind or body not caused by his own misconduct, or of old age and who has not less than ten years' continuous service,</P>
      <P>upon his resigning or otherwise ceasing to be employed an annual allowance for his life not exceeding in any case two-thirds of his annual remuneration and emoluments, and subject to that over-riding limitation not exceeding an annual sum calculated at the rate of one-sixtieth of his annual remuneration and emoluments for every completed year of service with the Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The Commissioners may, at their discretion, grant to any whole-time officer or servant in their employment who has at least ten years' continuous service and who retires or is removed from his employment in consequence of the abolition of his office or situation, or for the purpose of facilitating improvements in the organisation or working of the undertaking of the Commissioners, by which greater efficiency and economy can be effected, such special <Col N="557" /> annual allowance for his life by way of compensation as on full consideration of the circumstances shall appear to the Commissioners to be reasonable and just compensation for the loss of his office or situation, but not exceeding in any case two-thirds of his annual remuneration and emoluments, and subject to that over-riding limitation not exceeding an annual sum calculated at the rate of one-sixtieth of his annual remuneration and emoluments for every completed year of service with the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Commissioners may, at their discretion, grant to any whole-time officer or servant in their employment, whose service is less than ten years, and who either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  becomes incapable of discharging his duties with efficiency by reason of permanent infirmity of mind or body not caused by his own misconduct, or of old age, or</P>
    <P>(b)  who retires or is removed from his employment in consequence of the abolition of his office or situation, or for the purpose of facilitating improvements in the organisation or working of the undertaking of the Commissioners by which greater efficiency and economy can be effected,</P>
    <P>upon his retiring or ceasing to be employed, a gratuity not greater than one-sixth of his annual remuneration and emoluments for every completed year of service with the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(4)  The payment of any allowances and gratuities authorised to be paid by this section shall be a purpose to which the tolls and other income received by the Commissioners may be applied.</P>
    <P>(5)  The grant of any annual allowance or gratuity made prior to the 1st day of June, 1926, by the Commissioners to any of their former officers or servants is hereby confirmed, and the payment thereof is hereby declared to be a purpose to which the tolls and other income received by the Commissioners would have been <Col N="558" /> and may be applied, notwithstanding that the amount of any such allowance or gratuity exceeds the rate authorised by this section.</P>
    <P>(6)  In this section the expression &ldquo;annual remuneration and emoluments&rdquo; means in relation to an officer or servant who has been employed for not less than three years the average amount of remuneration and emoluments during the three years ending on the day on which he resigns or otherwise ceases to be employed, and in relation to an officer or servant who has been employed for less than three years the average amount of his remuneration and emoluments during each completed year of service.</P>

      <P>New Section.  Before Section 22 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  It shall be the duty of the secretary to the Commissioners on any examination and audit of accounts to attend before the auditor at the appointed time and place, and there to produce and give to the auditor all his books of accounts, vouchers, receipts, and other documents, and all such information in his possession as shall be required by the auditor, and it shall also be the duty of the Commissioners and every officer and servant (other than the secretary) of the Commissioners, if required by the auditor so to do, to attend before the auditor at the time and place appointed for the examination and audit, and there to produce and give to the auditor all such documents and information in their possession, respectively, as shall be required by the auditor.</P>
      <P>(2)  It shall be the duty of the auditor on any examination and audit under this section to examine into the accounts of the Commissioners and to disallow and strike out of such accounts all payments, charges, and allowances made by any person, and charged on the funds of the Commissioners contrary to law, or which he deems to be unfounded, and to charge the same upon the person making or authorising the payment, charge, or allowance so disallowed and struck out, and thereupon to certify the same to be due from such person.</P>
      <P>(3)  The auditor shall, on application made to him in writing within ten days after the completion of any examination and audit made by him under this section by any person aggrieved by any allowance, disallowance, or surcharge made by him on such examination and audit, state in writing his reasons for such allowance, disallowance, or surcharge, and furnish forthwith a copy of such statement to such aggrieved person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Any person aggrieved by any allowance, disallowance, or surcharge <Col N="560" /> may, within twenty-one days after the completion of the audit if a statement of the auditor's reasons for such allowance, disallowance, or surcharge has not been applied for within ten days after the completion of the audit, or within fourteen days from the furnishing of the statement of such reasons if such statement has been applied for within the time aforesaid either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the manner to be prescribed by such Minister, and such Minister shall deal with the matter (including, but subject to the provisions of this section the costs of appeal) as justice may require, and the decision of such Minister on any such appeal shall be final and shall not be subject to appeal to or review by any court, or</P>
    <P>(b)  in lieu of such appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, apply to the High Court for a writ of <i>certiorari</i> to remove into the said Court the said allowance, disallowance, or surcharge in such manner as may be provided by rules of court, and on the removal of such allowance, disallowance, or surcharge, the Court shall make such order thereon (including, but subject to the provisions of this section, an order as to costs) as justice may require.</P>
    <P>(5)  On any proceedings under the foregoing sub-section the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the High Court as the case may be if it appears to such Minister or Court that the decision of the auditor was correct, direct that the costs of the auditor be paid by the person appealing or prosecuting such writ of <i>certiorari</i> as the case may be, or if it appears to such Minister or the High Court that the decision of the auditor was erroneous direct that the costs of the person appealing or prosecuting such writ of <i>certiorari</i> as the case may be, be paid out of the tolls and other income of the Commissioners, but in no case shall any order for payment of the costs of the person appealing or prosecuting <Col N="561" /> such writ of <i>certiorari</i> be made against the auditor.</P>
    <P>(6)  Any costs (including costs between solicitor and client) incurred by the auditor in relation to any proceedings on any appeal or writ of <i>certiorari</i> under this section and which have not been recovered by the auditor, from the person appealing or prosecuting such writ of <i>certiorari</i> shall be paid to the auditor out of the tolls and other income of the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(7)  Any sum certified by the auditor under this section to be due by any person shall (subject to any reversal, cancellation or variation of the certificate by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the High Court) be paid by such person to the auditor within twenty-one days after the completion of the audit or, in case an application has been made for a statement of the auditor's reasons for such allowance, disallowance, or surcharge, within fourteen days from the date of the delivery of such statement, or, in case an appeal has been made to such Minister or proceedings have been taken by way of <i>certiorari</i>, within fourteen days from the date of the decision on such appeal or proceedings, and every allowance made by the auditor which has been disallowed by such Minister or Court shall be a sum due from the person making or authorising the payment which was the subject of such allowance, and shall be paid to the auditor within fourteen days from the date of the decision of such Minister or Court, and any sum payable under this sub-section to the auditor, may, if not so paid in accordance with this sub-section, be recovered as a civil debt by the auditor by action or other proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction, and every sum paid to or recovered by the auditor under this sub-section shall, when received by him, be applied by him in the manner directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and any costs and expenses by the auditor in proceedings for the recovery of any such sum which are not recovered by the auditor from the defendant <Col N="562" /> in any such proceedings shall be paid to the auditor out of the tolls and other income of the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(8)  Every person who being required by or in pursuance of this section to attend before the auditor or to produce any document or give any information to the auditor fails or refuses so to do shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding ten pounds or at the discretion of the court to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has met with a good deal of criticism both inside and outside the Oireachtas, but in the form it has reached this House it commends itself to me, at all events, as a very distinct advance on existing conditions.  It makes a genuine and intelligent attempt to remedy a state of affairs that constituted a great public scandal and that was in some respects as symbolic of Irish life, if not more so, than the wolfhound and the round tower.  There have been complaints that the powers, privileges and patronage of local authorities have been more or less impinged upon as a result of the Bill.  That is true to a certain extent, but I fail to see how the existing state of affairs could be remedied at all without in some way restricting the existing powers of local authorities.  I do not think it would have been practicable to set up a local Civil Service or municipal Civil Service for each authority.  It would be expensive and almost unworkable. The Bill does take away patronage, but I think it is the sort of patronage that very few members of public boards would be sorry to lose.  This patronage was as embarrassing to the holder as if he lived in a cats' home and carried a parcel of bad fish under his arm.</P>
      <P>It made for persistent and undesirable attention from people looking for posts and it constituted a terrible injustice to the efficient, qualified person. Above all, the amount of corruption that existed in regard to the appointment of medical officers was a terrible disgrace and very often an appointment was decided by the amount of money which the successful candidate was able to pay out by way of graft.  The sections that made the Bill somewhat humiliating to local authorities have been deleted in the passage of the Bill through the other House and I do not think, on the whole, that there can be any genuine objection to the Bill as it now stands except to the limited extent&mdash;it is probably a fairly large extent&mdash;that it does take away from a local board the power to make appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill seems somewhat anomalous.  An officer or servant <Col N="564" /> of any local authority may on a charge of misconduct or incapacity be suspended either by the local authority or the Minister, but he can be reinstated by the Minister alone.  I do not know if that is not going to create a certain amount of confusion by giving one authority the right to suspend without the right to reinstate or to remove the suspension.  There is no provision in the Bill providing for the better advertising of existing vacancies.  I take it that it is taken for granted that they will be advertised in a proper, efficient way.  For instance, if there is a vacancy within any local authority it is only right and proper that the existence of that vacancy should be properly and fully advertised within the area of the local authority because candidates from that particular area would say perhaps that they had a special claim to the vacancy.  I cannot see any provision governing the proper advertising of vacancies.  At all events, with that exception, I think on the whole the Bill is an exceedingly good one. To me it is particularly welcome. When the Local Government Act was passing through this House I moved an amendment providing for the filling of all public positions by open competition and withdrew it on a promise from the Minister that he would introduce such a Bill as this.  He has kept his promise.  I think the Bill as a whole is a good one and will enable electors to give more thought to the suitability of candidates for membership of local authorities in the civic sense rather than to their capacity for obtaining posts for people looking for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to vote against the Second Reading of this Bill.  Still I think it requires a certain amount of thought and consideration and I should like to express some views of my own as regards its general tenor.  If you take into consideration the fact that existing local authorities have only been in office for 8 or 9 months, I think a considered judgment as to whether they are or are not capable of carrying out their functions in a proper manner is not possible at this stage.  I do not think such a judgment can possibly be arrived at <Col N="565" /> and for that reason I think the Bill, in the first place, is a bit premature.  You will remember that the local bodies took office about 8 months ago, after a time of tremendous stress and strain in the country when all local ideas were set on one side and national interests were the only things to engage the attention of these bodies.  The members of these bodies were then not at all fitted for the positions which they occupied.  We all know that they were put into these positions because they were members of certain organisations. All that has been changed.  It may not be within the knowledge of the Seanad &mdash;though I am sure it is&mdash;that at the last election a great amount of thought and care was exercised by various local bodies to put men into these positions who they thought would fulfil their office with satisfaction to the country as a whole&mdash;that I think everybody knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Farrell that the system of appointment to positions by competitive examination is desirable. Without being egotistical, I might say that in the County Limerick, nearly twenty years ago, I got a resolution passed that all clerical appointments under the County Council should be filled by competitive examination. So far as I know, that was adhered to absolutely until, perhaps, eighteen months ago.  Within the last two or three months the Limerick County Council had to appoint an accountant. They immediately proceeded to advertise for a competent accountant and they filled the vacancy by means of a competitive examination. Their only complaint was that in the allocation of marks by the body appointed to conduct the examination they gave as few marks to Irish as to other things which were not essential in the appointment.  I think local authorities are entitled to some consideration, and their views ought to be considered.  When we are going through this Bill in Committee, and certain amendments are proposed, I hope sympathetic consideration will be given to the fact that new men have arisen to do new work, which the people of the country think they are competent to do, and which they have <Col N="566" /> been appointed to do.  This Bill has been introduced without the judgment of the people being taken on it, and it is being hurried through with other measures at a rate which is not conducive to the public good.  I regret that we are asked to hurry this Bill through now at the last moment.</P>
    <P>Section 7 prevents the local authorities from giving expression to their opinions as to qualifications for appointment. Sub-section 3 says that associations of people, and, mind you, not local authorities, may be consulted as to qualifications that they might consider necessary.  In other words, all through the Bill the idea of centralisation is carried to an extraordinary length.  Centralisation seems to be a mania with those in power.  Section 9 gives power to the Commissioners to dispense with the competitive examination in certain cases when they so wish.  They do not ask the local authorities is it wise to dispense with the competitive examination. No, the Commissioners say to themselves: &ldquo;We will dispense in a particular case with a competitive examination,&rdquo; and it is dispensed with.  That is the position.  When we are discussing this measure in the Committee Stage I daresay I shall have something to say on that and other matters.  Section 11 gives to local authorities the power of suspending an officer.  I think that is a valuable provision.  It is a provision making clear what was very obscure in local administration in the past. The local authorities had no idea of what their powers were with regard to suspension, but now Section 11 arranges clearly for that.  As I said in the beginning, I do not think the public have had sufficient opportunity of discussing this Bill in all its implications. The question of patronage was mentioned by Senator O'Farrell. Patronage may be a low ground on which to attack the Bill, but we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that Parliament can exercise patronage under the Bill.</P>
    <P>We are told our Ministers have exercised less patronage than any Government in the world, and that is possibly true, but still I do not think we should overlook the fact that local authorities <Col N="567" /> should not be altogether deprived of patronage, a patronage which is not against the public interest, a patronage which will ensure a certain amount of efficiency, and a patronage which will admit of no corruption.  This Bill goes a long way in the right direction. I hope the Minister in considering it will, so to speak, let the public bodies down as lightly as he can.  In my opinion the Minister for Local Government has already administered a sharp rebuke to the members of public services who have given their time for nothing to the community in serving on the rural district councils, and county councils.  When he passed his Local Government Act two years ago he did indeed make provision for local administration.  He embodied in that Act a provision that members of local authorities should be put to no expense in the conduct of the affairs of those bodies a very desirable provision indeed.  We know that some men have to travel anything from twenty to thirty-five miles to attend to the business of local bodies.  The Minister for Local Government provided that they should get 4d. a mile. If a man had to go thirty-five miles&mdash;</P>

I do not think anybody would maintain that it was financial justice to offer these representatives on public bodies scanty sums which would not pay for the shoeing of horses in bringing some of them on their long journeys to attend meetings, having no regard to the other expenses which they must incur. While I think the Bill should get a Second Reading I am of opinion that it <Col N="568" /> should get very careful consideration on the Committee Stage and I hope that any amendments that will be submitted will receive careful consideration.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this matter, but a point has been raised by Senator Bennett regarding the short time the new authorities have been functioning, which, I think, does not affect the Bill at all, for after all this question of appointment by competitive examination has been before the country a long time.  It was one of the recommendations of the Viceregal Commission which reported in 1906.  It was discussed then, and it received the approval of local authorities.  It has been discussed by various bodies and officials, and it has received nothing but approval.  I think it is a big step in advance and the Government are to be congratulated on introducing the Bill, which I hope will pass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wholeheartedly in support of this Bill because of the principles contained in it.  I think Senators will remember that we from those benches urged that there should be a competitive examination for all positions under local authorities.  An amendment to that effect was put down by Senator O'Farrell when the Local Government Act was under consideration here, and the Minister gave a definite promise that a Bill would be introduced dealing with that question. I have been a member of public boards, and I know the evil of canvassing.  I know canvassing was made a science, and when I hear people talking of the privileges of members of public boards, and that sort of thing, I say that in my opinion this Bill is for the protection <Col N="569" /> of members of public boards, if I know anything about it.  If the members of this House had the experience of those who have unfortunately been members of public boards with regard to canvassing, I feel sure every one of them who desires to work for the interest of his community in his locality would welcome this Bill which will relieve members of public boards of an undue and unfair pressure being brought to bear upon them on every occasion when an appointment has to be made.  I have had experience of the value of competitive examinations in the recruitment of staffs for public authorities.  I was a member of that much-maligned body, the Dublin Corporation, which twenty-five years ago on its own volition instituted competitive examinations for the clerical staff.</P>
      <P>I say without hesitation or fear of contradiction that as a result of the competitive system of examination the clerical staff of the Dublin Corporation will compare favourably with any branch of the Civil Service.  I think anybody who has had any experience of the staff will admit that.  We wholeheartedly support this Bill, and we believe in the principle that people should be appointed to positions on merit alone, and that political, religious or any other influence should not be brought to bear in connection with these appointments on people who have to do the work of the community as a whole.  A private employer when filling an appointment selects the most capable person for it, and, similarly, the public representatives who are handling the ratepayers' money are bound to see that they get the best service on behalf of the ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one anomaly regarding the Bill to which I would like to call attention. I am a whole-hogger, and I believe in going the whole way and seeing that the public boards will be bound to accept the person who secures the highest number of marks in the examinations.  I also think it is reasonable to expect that the people who are appointed to hold these competitive examinations should be subject to competitive examinations themselves. Senator Sir John Keane shakes his head, but a principle is a <Col N="570" /> principle, and if you are afraid of patronage for a clerk of a county council, or some other official of the council, surely there is also the danger of patronage regarding the Commissioners who have to hold the examinations. Of course, they may be recruited from the Civil Service, and have passed a competitive examination. I think under Section 3 of this Bill the Executive Council has power to appoint any persons it likes without any examination whatever to be commissioners.</P>
    <P>I simply call attention to that fact, and I do hope that on the Committee Stage of this Bill this House will teach the other House a lesson and teach them that we are whole-hoggers in this matter of competitive examinations, and if the principle is to be introduced, the principle should go the whole way. I make that suggestion, and I hope that between this and the Committee Stage the Minister will look into that point, and if he looks into it fairly and squarely he must admit that if it is introduced at all the principle of open competition must be carried the whole way.</P>

      <P>As far as this Bill goes towards providing that appointments should be made by competitive examinations, I am entirely in favour of it.  In reading over that section of the Bill I do not see that the competitive examination is to be an open one.  From the experience we have had up to the present in the filling of appointments, we are not satisfied on that point.  We very often see a condition put into the advertisement that such and such a class will get preference. I do not think it is fair to the bulk of the ordinary citizens of the Saorstát that when they enter for an examination of that sort they should be handicapped by such a condition as that.  I do hope that in the future when the Minister is dealing with this subject no such unfair conditions will be put in when inviting candidates to sit for a competitive examination for those appointments. I really think that up to the present we have had no appointments filled by local competitive examinations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few brief remarks as to the general character appropriate to this discussion.  Senator Bennett has pointed out that this Bill represents an increasing tendency towards the centralisation of administrative functions of a local character in the central Government.  I admit that in taking a short view that is probably right; that you will get increased efficiency by centralisation and by what is called bureaucracy, but you are departing altogether in doing so from the original intentions of the Local Government Act.  The spirit&mdash;the intention&mdash;of that Act was that these local bodies <Col N="572" /> were to be what might be considered a nursery for the training of our public administrators.  We are departing more and more from that aspect of the problem every day.  I would not mind doing so if we were tackling it at the right end, if we were limiting the powers of democracy; but while we are getting rid of democratic principles in our local service we are leaving them to stand intact in our central service and I think that is inconsistent.  I myself do not think it wise to lessen, as we are doing every day, the responsibilities for local administration and local administrators.  I happen to be a member of a local authority and on every single question, if we are in any way likely to depart from the normal practice, we are held up by the Local Government Department.  I know that the Department had great provocation, seeing that local bodies were getting off the rails, and consequently there is great temptation for an official with an orderly mind tied down to official rules and regulations, with principles and formula to check any such tendency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But you cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs and you cannot train people without allowing them to make mistakes.  I am prepared to say that with regard to the Bill our present local administration has in it very little training for the members of those public bodies.  In local administration you can do things of a routine character but if those bodies show the least imagination or the least initiative they are held up.  The effect of that will be to prevent men of the right type coming in to local government.  I speak with a certain amount of knowledge and experience.  Discouragements have been received and controls have been wrongly imposed on the local authorities and, although this Bill in itself may be acceptable, it represents to my mind a dangerous tendency.  The question is whether having gone so far as we have gone, it would not be better to go the whole hog and practically govern the country for a number of years by Commissioners or a central administration. I know that you could get better results by that method but the question is, would you sacrifice these local bodies <Col N="573" /> as schools of training?  From the very little value they are now as schools of training you might perhaps sacrifice them altogether and go more and more towards centralisation.  I cannot agree with Senator O'Farrell or his colleague in their veneration for competitive examinations.  You may get an extremely good book product from competitive examinations, but not the best for the purpose.  If you have to seek the ideal system you would want to give at least as many marks for the human qualities as you do for book learning, and if you are to arrive at a good system you would give half marks for competitive examination and set up a good standard and allow the Civil Service Commissioners to select them at the interview.  It has been proved in several other walks of life that an interview gives you the most valuable indication of a man's qualifications. What about the medical examination? I do not see any provision for the medical examination.</P>

      <P>I had a fairly lengthy experience in connection with public boards and I am very glad to see this Bill brought into the Seanad. The canvassing&mdash;I would not exactly call it corruption&mdash;that occurs in connection with almost every appointment has been carried on to an alarming extent.  I think those who have had experience of these things in the past will look upon this Bill with great relief. <Col N="574" /> There will, no doubt, be a cry raised about the patronage being taken away from local bodies but we will be bound to see a much better type of official in the future.  I hope that Senator Sir John Keane's proposal regarding competitive examinations will be taken into account.  I do not suppose the Commissioners will appoint the man who is able to pass a written examination without requiring other qualifications.  I would like to emphasise Senator O'Farrell's suggestion that there ought be the widest publicity given when any appointments have to be made in a locality so that those in the district may have time to prepare themselves.  I think that we would all be delighted to see as far as possible those local positions held by men belonging to the local districts and I think every facility should be given to the local candidates so as to give them a fair chance of competing for the local appointments.  It will encourage these men to take more pains and to educate themselves better. I would not like to see appointments drifting away from the district and strangers brought in.  I am certain that the country generally will be greatly relieved at getting rid of the system of canvassing.  Senator Sir John Keane has referred to local government.  We have had twenty-five years' experience of it and I think nobody can honestly contend that the system has been a success.  In the matter of appointments it was not the best man who was elected, but the man who had the most support behind him or who belonged to the strongest clan in the district.</P>

      <P>I think that this Bill is assured of a fairly easy passage through the Seanad.  The Seanad, I take it, is generally in favour of the provisions of this measure.  I may say at once that personally I am strongly in favour of it. I have been in favour of the system of competitive examinations for a considerable number of years.  And I wish the Minister well in his efforts to meet the situation that has grown up amongst us.  Senator Sir John Keane has raised a point of some importance <Col N="575" /> in connection with the examination. He suggests that it might be very well in connection with this examination if part and parcel of it consisted of a personal interview.  Certainly I am rather in favour of an interview and I do not think it is ruled out by the Bill.  In the drawing-up of the curriculum for these examinations the matter might be borne in mind and I hope the Minister will bear it in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Farren touched very lightly upon a point on which the Bill may turn&mdash;that is, the questions of the examiners.  The question of the examiners seems to be one of some little obscurity. I was under the impression, from reading the newspapers and the discussion in the Dáil on this Bill, that the examinations were to be conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.  I see from Section 3 of the Bill that the Government may appoint local appointments committees to do that work.  I presume the members of these committees would be selected from the panel of the Civil Service Commissioners.  I see also that the Bill says that a Civil Service Commissioner shall not be ineligible for appointment as a commissioner to the local appointments committees. I hope that means that these examinations will really be conducted by our Civil Service Commissioners. Section 8 states that anyone who wants to get an appointment is eligible to compete at these examinations.  I think that is perfectly fair.  Anyone, I take it, who wants an appointment, whether it be that of a deputy surveyor or a rate collector, may sit for one of these examinations.  I do not know whether it is proposed to include rate-collectors, but possibly they could be roped in, and conceivably it might be advantageous to do so.  At any rate, I think this Bill is a step in the right direction, and that the Minister is to be congratulated on tackling this question which unmistakably is one of the drawbacks in our system of local administration.  We want the very best men appointed to positions under these local bodies.  Incidentally, the Bill will be a great measure of relief to <Col N="576" /> members of local bodies.  I think there can be no doubt about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points on which perhaps it might be well that I should say something.  At the outset I might say that, to a great extent, this Bill was an agreed measure in the Dáil.  There was one small section that seemed to be opposed to it and hoped to delay its passing in any form.  Only in that way was there a certain amount of opposition to it. As the divisions showed there was a very large volume of support in the Dáil for the Bill.  As the same elements are to some extent represented in the two Houses of the Oireachtas, I anticipated that there would not be very much opposition to the measure here, and for that reason I did not think it necessary to make a long opening statement, particularly as there was a good deal of publicity given to the Bill when it was going through the Dáil.  It is not a very long Bill. There are only thirteen sections in it altogether.  Senator O'Farrell dealt with Section 11 and thought there was a certain anomaly in allowing the local authority as well as the Minister to have the power to suspend officers under various circumstances whereas the Minister alone has the power to reinstate. That is the position at the present time as regards reinstatement. I considered it well to give this power of suspension to the local authorities so that in cases of emergency, if an official made away with funds or did anything like that, the local authority would have the power to take from him any authority he possessed as an official.  As regards reinstating an official, I consider it would probably be inadvisable to give power in that matter to the local authority.  It would mean creating a precedent and I do not think that would be wise. With regard to another point raised, I do not think it would be advisable to insert anything in the Bill limiting the time during which the vacant positions should be advertised.  Unimportant positions need only be advertised for a couple of weeks, whereas in the case of very important positions it might be well to leave them open for several months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> Senator Bennett harped on a point that was discussed at very great length in the Dáil.  He took up the point of view of the opposition party in the Dáil, namely that the present local authorities have only been in office for a very short time and that we should not curtail their powers until we saw how they were going to make use of them.  As I reiterated again and again in the Dáil, it is not a question of the personnel of the local authorities at all.  When the Local Government Bill was going through the Seanad I promised Senator O'Farrell that I would introduce a Bill such as this, and it has been introduced irrespective of the personnel of these bodies altogether.  In taking away the power of patronage from the local authorities I am not casting any slur on them.  We are only doing as regards them what exactly has been done in the case of Ministers, and in the case of the Dáil and Seanad. Senators need only try to visualise the state of affairs that would exist for themselves if appointments in the Civil Service could only be made as the result of their vote.  That is the position at the present time as regards local authorities.  It is the position that the best type of local representative resents, and that I believe Senators and members of the Dáil would also resent if a similar situation existed here.  I do not think Senator Farren's proposal of having an examination for the Commissioners would be practicable, and I do not know what kind of test you could apply in order to secure the best possible material for the position.  Those Commissioners will be civil servants.  The personnel of the present Civil Service Commissioners will be availed of and I do not think there will be any extra remuneration for them.  I re-echo what Senator Farren said about the staff of the Dublin Corporation which has been recruited by this system.  If it were not for them we certainly would have had very great difficulty in carrying on the administration of the city during the last few years.  At this stage I do not think it is necessary for me to say anything more on the Bill.</P>

It is very serious indeed that statements of this kind should be made without any proof being given to support them.  I think this is a point that the Minister should deal with.  I suggest that if he were to take up the matter, he would be able to justify the very good work that, in my opinion, has been done by these local councils under extremely difficult circumstances during the last five or six years.

As regards that county, the collection of rates at the present time costs 6d. in the pound.  That is a very substantial sum.  I do not know what the costs would be through the Post Office.  I think the Minister should go further in this matter, and should not merely leave all the initiative to the local authorities, but should use a certain amount of persuasion with them to adopt this method.  At the outset, there might be difficulty in collecting rates through the Post Office as the people would not be used to it, but this difficulty would be got over, and the result would be a very substantial saving.  I suppose the question of pensions for the rate collectors would then <Col N="580" /> arise.  That, of course, would be inevitable but I do not think we should allow that question to stand in the way of adopting an improved method for the collection of rates.</P>

      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the point of view expressed by Senator Sir John Keane. The only question is, what is the best method of arriving at that objective? There are certain difficulties in the way of getting this scheme accepted by the various county councils because it is very difficult to get in arrears of rates without a rate collector.  We are not quite satisfied yet as to whether the Post Office is the best method for collecting rates.  At the present time it costs the Post Office something like 3d. in the pound, but that does not cover all the charges.  We are proceeding in this matter by means of an experiment, something in the same way as Senator Sir John Keane advised as regards our accounting methods some time ago when there was a debate in the Seanad.  If we were to insist upon this system of collection throughout the country it would mean decreasing the number of rate collectors, and that would add to our pension list which is already sufficiently inflated.  There is no immediate prospect of having this system adopted very widely throughout the country, but I might say that dealing with the matter <i>in vacuo</i>, as it were, I am very much in favour of the principle.</P>

      <P>This University Education (Agriculture and Dairy Science) Bill is really a Bill for the transfer of the College of Science to University College although not mentioned in the Title.  However, if Senators read the Bill they at once meet with that proposal.  This Bill, which comes up to the Seanad at the close of our session, is one which, in my opinion, is of very great importance in the interest of technical education in Ireland.  To me it is a most disappointing Bill for I believe it is a retrograde step.  The College of Science was built at immense cost and under the guidance of some of the most experienced technical instructors.  It was open to all classes of students, whether University or otherwise and it was intended to be the corner stone of technical instruction in Ireland.  The Bill, as far as I understand it, provides no certainty for the continuation of this course.  Rather more than three years ago this subject was before the Seanad. The College of Science had been closed at the instigation of the military authorities and the air was full of rumours as to the future of the college. Under these circumstances the Seanad passed a resolution which I take the liberty of reading:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad urges the Government to restore to its legitimate use the College of Science, with its unique and splendidly equipped laboratories and workshops, at the earliest possible moment, consistently with the exigencies of the Government service, and to maintain it at its highest efficiency for technical education and the scientific requirements of the Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In support of that Resolution I used these words: &ldquo;The principal ground upon which I plead for the efficient maintenance of the College of Science is that it is specially suited to form the centre or nucleus of an Irish Department for Scientific and Industrial Research.  The Great War proved of what advantage such an establishment was to Germany.  It was not until the war had begun that England wakened up to the need for such an organisation. This led to the formation of the Committee of the Privy Council for <Col N="582" /> scientific and industrial research.  It has carried out its work by giving assistance to industrial research associations by work done at the National Physical Laboratory at Teddington and by Boards and Committees under its own organisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Bill, as I understand it, makes no provision to ensure those recommendations of the Seanad being carried out.  Speakers in support of the Bill in the Dáil only expressed pious hopes that University College will carry out all the hopes of the well-wishers of the institution.  I disapprove of the Bill and I should have been equally opposed to it if the transfer had been to Trinity College.  I think it should have been preserved as the State Laboratory for testing purposes just as the National Physical Laboratory is free from University control.  I think the Bill is ill-considered and is, simply, the work of a draftsman to transfer property.  My great wish would be that we should have time to consider this Bill.  We really have not had an opportunity yet of measuring what the Bill is and I would urge the Government, if possible, to postpone proceeding with it until the autumn so that Senators may have full opportunities for considering it on its merits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister for Education, who is in charge of the Bill, when he comes to reply, will take the opportunity of saying whether the proposal that Galway University should be endowed with a faculty of agriculture, is one that presents any very insuperable obstacles and to say whether endowing that University College with a faculty of agriculture would mean the big fianancial consideration mentioned by the Minister for Agriculture.  It is true that Galway University College is slowly dying and that, unless there is some improvement in the position, it will follow, in a slow way, the rather violent death of the College of Science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, I think, too great a tendency to concentrate all national institutions in Dublin to the detriment of other towns and cities throughout the State.  One can sympathise with the popular tendency of the Corkman <Col N="583" /> to come to Dublin, and also people from elsewhere because certainly in the Civil Service and in everything pertaining to national institutions there is very little to be had outside the city of Dublin.  If Galway College could be kept alive, and endowed with this faculty of agriculture, it would be well worth the effort and some financial sacrifice.  If the university is allowed to die or. to close down, it will strike a very severe blow at a city and a province already weakened.  It would take away a considerable amount of prestige and provincial pride desirable in this respect as in others.  I earnestly urge on the Government to consider whether it is not practicable to make better financial provision for Galway and whether it may not be possible to introduce into the Bill proposals to endow Galway College by giving it the faculty of agriculture instead of conferring that faculty upon University College, Dublin.  I ask the Minister, if he is in a position to do so, to make a statement in regard to that matter so as to clear the air.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. JAMESON Mr. JAMESON">

      <P>I think this Bill should not be brought in at the end of a session such as this and dealt with among a lot of Bills, which we will do everything we can to facilitate, in order to enable the Government to carry on the business of the country. This is a Bill of a totally different calibre.  It deals, as Senator Sir John Griffith has said, with the College of Science.  Before the troublesome times this college was in an extremely high state of efficiency.  Whether when it has been taken over by the National University, it will retain that efficiency, is a problem on which there is much doubt amongst university authorities. My own opinion is that an institution that is independent, whose merits are shown by its own individual action and whose professors by their work give it a certain standing, will do far better independently than if mixed up with a university which has a large number of other sections to attend to.  The matters mentioned by Senator O'Farrell in connection with Galway University require time and should not be hurried through the <Col N="584" /> Senate in the way they will have to be if this Bill is pushed forward now.  I do not see what public damage is going to be done if the Bill is postponed until the autumn session.  There are several matters dealt with in the Bill such as the grant to Cork in payment of debts that have already been incurred and payment for land that has been purchased, which might require immediate attention.  I do not think they do, but if they do, I think it would be the duty of the Minister to point out such parts of the Bill as would justify him in asking us to deal with this question of the College of Science and the question Senator O'Farrell raised about Galway in such a hurried way.  I believe we would be far better able to deal with the matter if we got more time to look into it.  The greatest mistake that could be made when dealing with higher education would be to do anything without taking the fullest time for considering every aspect of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Sir John Griffith and Senator Jameson in regretting that this Bill has been introduced so late in the Session.  I would very earnestly urge on the Minister, if he intends this Bill to go through this Session, that he should leave out all the provisions with reference to the College of Science.  I am in sympathy with the provision made in this Bill for the creation of a new Faculty of Agriculture in University College, Dublin.  I am in entire sympathy with the Bill so far as it provides for the establishment of a new faculty of dairy science in the University of Cork.  But I most strongly protest against a subject of this magnitude, with the implication that it carries&mdash;abolition and absorption in another body of the old College of Science&mdash;being introduced so late in the Session.  It has a more far-reaching effect than probably most Senators think.  It abolishes an old educational establishment which has done extremely useful work in this country for fifty years.  It must not be lost sight of, in connection with this Bill, that the College of Science provided for many other than mere University students.  When the College <Col N="585" /> of Science was broken up some three years ago the average attendance was something like 200 students, and out of that 200 the majority were non-University students.  They were students who had not the time, nor the means, to enter a University but who were getting scientific education in this College.  So far as that interest in this country is concerned, the transfer of this old institution to University College will destroy the opportunities which these students had of getting the necessary scientific education in their own country.  They will have to become members of the National University in order that they may get what they previously could get without the necessity of a University education.</P>
      <P>There is another very serious objection to this Bill.  Prior to its ceasing to operate, some three years ago, it was used by the engineering graduates of both universities as a kind of post-University school.  Neither of the Universities had the means of giving the practical and technical education that this College gave and, accordingly, the students that obtained their degrees in Dublin University and the National University, in civil engineering, if they wanted to complete their education, as civil engineers, frequently went to the College of Science because it was the one place in this country where they could get that practical and technical training required to complete their education. Under this Bill this institution is transferred to and absorbed by one University.  That is not fair play.  I would have been just as much opposed, as Senator Sir John Griffith said he would be, to the transfer of the old College of Science to Trinity.  Under this Bill it goes to one of the two Universities, but both of the Universities were making the greatest possible use of it before that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another very serious aspect of this Bill.  As long as the College of Science was in existence the public had an opportunity of getting scientific testing done under Government control. That is of great importance in any country.  The public will not go to universities to get scientific testing done.  I see a provision in this Bill <Col N="586" /> which says that the buildings are to be opened to the Government Departments for testing by Government officials, or by professors, officials in the University, or in the college, but there is no provision for scientific testing on behalf of the public under Government control.  Having regard to the fact that this Bill deals with a subject so important to this country I seriously urge on the Minister that he should, if he wishes the Bill to go through, and I have great sympathy with the Bill going through, take out from the Bill all the provisions relating to the College of Science.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose any delay in dealing with the matters in this Bill. No doubt the College of Science is an extremely good institution and trained a number of remarkably good men, but the utility of those men to this country was somewhat problematical.  Most of the men trained in engineering went abroad.  The other faculties of agriculture and creamery management are affected and will be continued immediately in a higher degree of efficiency than they were continued in the College of Science.  It rather surprises me that complaints should be made with regard to the necessity for delay in this Bill. I am rather forced to ask the question: where was the clamour of students to avail of the opportunities given by the College of Science during the last three years when it was derelict?  Now when a Bill is brought forward to continue its usefulness there is a plea for delay.  With regard to the faculty of agriculture and dairying, which should be carried forward immediately, I say that this country, in its own interests, cannot afford any such delay.</P>

      <P>I believe sufficient will come out in my statement to satisfy the Seanad in connection with the history of this matter. It can hardly be stated that this is a secret arrangement.  I think that was alleged.  An arrangement that was an open arrangement in fact for the last two years, can hardly be held to be secret.  Not only that, but the whole matter was fully debated in the Dáil two years ago.  The Government policy was then, as regards the College of Science and also as regards the Department of Agriculture, definitely enunciated by three Ministers.  I do not think it can be said from that point of view that the Seanad, or the public, were kept in ignorance.  The whole thing was not only well debated but was well reported in the papers at the time.  I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Finance who was in charge of the Bill then.  That was the situation as it existed before the change that has taken place and that is being dealt with in this Bill.  I am surprised at the opposition to this Bill here.  It passed as a non-controversial measure in the other House.  There was only one amendment in the Dáil put down expressly, as stated by the mover, for the purpose of getting a statement from the Government on one point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government had to face two things.  One was what they considered and what I also considered the anomalous position of the College of Science, a kind of fraction of a university without being a university or having the standing of one.  In addition to that there was the other question, namely, the confessedly grossly inadequate endowment given to the <Col N="589" /> National University.  I say &ldquo;confessedly&rdquo; because it was confessed and admitted by Mr. Birrell when providing the endowment for the National University and its constituent colleges. The financial provision for the National University was inadequate not merely as regards the yearly sum provided which did not allow them to have the full faculties a modern university should have, but also in the way that sufficient money was not provided to supply University College, Dublin, with adequate buildings.  £150,000 in all was voted to supply buildings to University College, Dublin, and the National University.  It was contemplated that buildings would be set up for the National University as well. That sum was divided by the Commission set up by the British Government into £40,000 for the National University and only £110,000 for University College, Dublin.  That was to provide buildings for a college that catered for the university needs of the greater portion of the people of this country. Anyone, if they consider what building costs are, will see how grossly inadequate such a sum was.  It was made still more inadequate by the outbreak of the war, which meant that not merely was the original building unsatisfactory and incomplete, but it had to be still more incomplete owing to the outbreak of the war when the clause which permitted contracts to be broken allowed most of the scheme to be scrapped.  We had to find provision for the country's biggest medical school in a slum.  Can money be easily found?  Can the Government provide over a quarter of a million when they have a building at their doors which will, to a large extent, meet that situation? I will refer again to the position of the College of Science.  There was that need to be satisfied without involving the taxpayer in a heavy sum. They could, by this transfer, meet to a great extent the needs of University College, Dublin, so far as buildings were concerned.</P>
    <P>The College of Science has struck this position: when it was being set up it was endowed with a large amount of money at a time when the university question was being strongly agitated in <Col N="590" /> this country.  As a result of the setting up of the College of Science, that was used as an excuse for the unsatisfactory endowment of University College, Dublin.  I do not say that that was the purpose of the people who set up the College of Science, but that was the effect.  That is the position as regards University College, Dublin. There was, therefore, presented to the Government an opportunity of doing two things, each of which they considered desirable&mdash;one the satisfaction of the economic needs of the National University and University College, Dublin, and the other, what they considered to be the need for a proper basis for the College of Science itself. It has been objected&mdash;and it was objected when this was being debated in the Dáil&mdash;that there was no justification for the separation of applied science from ordinary university work. It was considered damaging both to applied science on the one side, and damaging to the whole conception of the university on the other.</P>
    <P>There was a definite refusal here to advance the position that the university should be a modern institution in every sense of the word, catering not merely for the Humanities and the ordinary conception of Science, but that it should also cater for the technological and economic needs of the nation.  Duplication was objected to. There is, as I have already indicated, duplication in Universities in Dublin. That is unavoidable; that is necessary. It is the general view of the country, and it is a view that I personally share, but why should they be triplicated? You would have one institution under the control of the Minister for Education and a Government Department and another institution with a semi-university status.  Then you would have not merely duplication but triplication.  There is no fear that there will be any curtailment under the Bill or any cutting down of the useful work performed by the College of Science.  Why that should be feared I am not quite clear.  Personally, I am convinced that not only should the opposite follow, but that it will follow.  You will have the same equipment for a number of years.  You <Col N="591" /> will have exactly the same professors conducting that particular work, but I suggest you will have something more than that.</P>
    <P>Senator Brown referred to a number of non-associate students.  There was, during a period, recently, owing to the British ex-Servicemen, a comparatively large proportion of non-associate students, but as a rule the bulk of the College of Science students were associate students&mdash;that is, students going for the Associateship. What is the position, then?  You had, roughly speaking, in the neighbourhood of 200 students in the College of Science.  Taking the Secondary schools in the old days of the tests, where did the best student go to?  I think you may say that examinations are not the best test for students, but they were the only tests we had and they were successful, in so far as a matter of this kind may be regarded as satisfactory.  Did they go to the College of Science?  No; they were attracted by the Universities, with the result that there was a tendency on the part of students to neglect the practical side of the work which would be most useful for the country.  Very few of the best boys, the exhibitioners from the intermediate schools, went to the College of Science.  Naturally, they were attracted by the glamour, the wider scope and the bigger life of the Universities.</P>
    <P>Then there were arrangements between the College of Science and the two University Colleges in Dublin. There is no reason, so far as Trinity College is concerned, why that arrangement should not continue.  The same arrangement could be easily made and I am certain will be made, if Trinity College so desires, with University College, Dublin, for the future. As a matter of fact, the College of Science is not used by many Trinity students.  When the debate was on, two years ago, in the Dáil, the allegation was made by one of the Ministers that there was only one student.  The most that could be given in the debate at that time was two students.  The bulk of the engineering students, those who attended the engineering classes, came <Col N="592" /> from University College, Dublin. Why?  Because, owing to the truncated provision for University College, Dublin, they could not continue their education in the University they started in.  They did two years in University College, Dublin, and for their mechanical engineering course they went to the College of Science. I doubt if there were half-a-dozen students from Trinity College there at any time.  I do not think it is proper that what is and what should be University education should be kept apart from University life.  The matter comes on late in the Session of the Seanad, but that does not, as I gathered from the opening statement of the Cathaoirleach, prevent full consideration. It has certainly been before the public.  The Government's opinion and policy on the matter have been before the public for quite a long time.</P>
    <P>I cannot consider this a retrograde step.  I think it is a necessary step. It is a step that gets us in line with most of the advancing countries in Europe.  I am aware that Germany has separated technological work from ordinary university education, but I am also aware that many Germans regret that such a course or development was ever entered upon.  A Commission was set up in London in 1910 about this whole project of separating technological work from university work. In America and in various continental centres&mdash;Belgium, Louvain, Liege&mdash;the general practice is for universities to be fully equipped not merely for the humanities and the theoretical side but also for applied science.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Griffith read the resolution of the Seanad.  I suggest that there is nothing in harmony with what you are asking us to do to-day in that particular resolution.  That resolution asked that the College of Science should be restored to its legitimate use.  It is being restored to its legitimate use.  It is no longer a Government Department occupied by Government officials.  It will again carry on educational work.  The resolution also asks that the efficiency of the college be maintained.  I hold that the efficiency will be increased.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> Research undoubtedly was portion of the work of the College of Science in the past.  I always held the opposite, that research was one of the most important functions of the university. The thing has not been hastily considered or ill-considered.  It has been before the Government and before the educational authorities for the last three years.  That shows that we cannot be accused of haste.  I admit that much more rightly we can be accused of undue delay in the matter.  I apologise for the lateness with which this Bill is introduced in the Seanad, but it is entirely due to the stress of ordinary Government work and was unavoidable.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Griffith, who seconded the motion for the postponement of the Bill, in his introductory statement said that the main purpose of the Bill was the transfer of the College of Science.  Therefore, I admit that, in supporting the postponement of the Bill altogether, he is quite consistent. The most important part of the Bill undoubtedly is the question of the College of Science.  I prefer that the Bill should not go through and that the Seanad should hold it up rather than that we should be asked to delete that particular section, but holding up the whole Bill involves very serious complications not merely as regards other portions of the Bill but as regards the College of Science.  The Budget was drawn this year on the basis of this Bill passing.  What is to happen to the College of Science after the 30th September, which is the date up to which we have budgeted for the college, if this Bill is not passed, is not very clear to me.  This Bill was regarded as a non-contentious Bill in the other House and I did not consider that it would meet with any objection on principle in this House.</P>
    <P>As regards one or two questions that were put to me, I think Senator O'Farrell suggested that the Faculty of Agriculture should be transferred from Dublin to Galway.  That is a matter to which I could not give favourable consideration.  I do not think any case of that kind was made out.  There was, I know, considerable agitation in Galway about the status <Col N="594" /> of the University College.  It was alleged that the Government had the intention of doing away with the Galway College.  There was no such intention on the part of the Government.  The Government was anxious and expressed the desire that Galway College might fulfil its functions better if it were in some respects altered.  Galway was under the impression that it would not function better.  There was no intention to do away with Galway College.  It is not our policy.  I might refer to the Report of the Commission which came in towards the end of April and which dealt with the position of Galway College.  Subsequently, it was considered that the matter could not be dealt with this year. Hence these other promises were postponed, but even already it was intimated that in certain respects some of the Galway claims could be met, but not so far as the Faculty of Agriculture was concerned.  I am convinced that, as a result of this measure, we will increase the efficiency of the College of Science as a scientific institution. I think it will be of much more service to the country under the proposed reconstruction than it has been in the past.  I doubt if there are any students actually in the College of Science that were not told exactly what the situation was.  However, that is a matter that can be looked into to see if there are any such students.</P>

      <P>It is with some diffidence I rise to make any remarks which may be considered a criticism of what the Minister for Education has said, but in the interests of my own profession and in the interests of the country at large I venture to say that the Minister is proceeding to view this question from a totally wrong standpoint.  He is looking at it from the point of view of a university, but the College of Science was not a university. It was open to all sorts of young men.  I know many of them, and I have had some in my own employment, who were not able for financial or other reasons to go to the university, but they were able to go to the College of Science and get technical knowledge which was very useful in <Col N="595" /> their business.  These young men would be deterred from going to the university.  We are only following a system which has been found to be necessary in every other civilised country in having such a college.  We know what is done abroad through technical institutions of the nature of the College of Science, which young men could attend without going to the expense or necessity of acquiring other education which they might consider quite unnecessary in the furtherance of their careers, but that a university would consider absolutely necessary for them in order to obtain a degree.  Instead of going to a university students could go for a very small sum to the College of Science and obtain the necessary knowledge. The Minister seems to think that by absorbing this College of Science into the National University the college will be more useful than ever.  As far as my experience goes, he will destroy the objects of the College of Science. I do not think it is fair, because the National University, and I regret to say it, is not sufficiently provided for financially, to appropriate the revenues of the College of Science, which were intended for a different purpose, to bolster up the funds of the National University.  I am quite sure, if the College of Science is treated in the way suggested in this Bill, that irreparable harm will be done.  Senator Dowdall made a very extraordinary remark when he asked where were the protests from the students in the College of Science for the last three years. Most of us, and I personally, have been inundated with protests.  When the college was first closed and the young men found they were deprived of getting the technical knowledge they could get there, they were very indignant, and we were all inundated with protests on their behalf.  Personally I cannot help thinking that this is a retrograde policy, and one which in the interests of the country we would be very foolish to adopt.</P>

    <P>Question proposed&mdash;&ldquo;That this Bill be now read a second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I must support the Second Reading of this Bill, but I do so with regret.  I support it because it proposes to extend the Act of 1925, and to continue the arrangements that were made with regard to providing subsidies for the building of houses. My regret is this, that the Bill does not go as far as I would like it to go.  On former occasions I think I said that if this housing question is to be dealt with in a satisfactory manner it should not be dealt with by Bills being introduced year after year, such as this, but that this question, which is a burning one, will have to be dealt with on a national basis.  From the little experience I have had in dealing with this question of housing, and I have taken quite an interest in it, I think it is a question which will not be solved until such time as a national housing authority is set up by the State to deal with the whole problem regarding the provision of houses.  I must say that the President, to his credit, from my knowledge of him for a number of years, is sincerely anxious to settle this question of housing, and he has done a man's part in that direction.  I pay him that tribute whole-heartedly, for I have personal knowledge of what he has done to help in the provision of houses in the city.  During the debate on the Second Reading the President made statements with regard to the whole question of housing, and the number of houses erected under the previous Housing Acts.  I respectfully suggest that the number of houses that have been erected are not nearly sufficient to meet the requirements.  The President told us that under the 1924 and 1925 Acts 1,361 houses were erected or under consideration in Dublin City area.  I think it is admitted that the population of Dublin has been growing for a number of years, but, apart from that, to <Col N="597" /> meet the normal demand for new houses by young people setting up homes the number of houses built is altogether insufficient, much less to meet the tremendous need there is for the housing of people who are living in insanitary slums.  I do not think, much as has been done under previous Acts, in addition to what is proposed under this Bill, that it is grappling with the situation in the proper way.</P>
      <P>From my knowledge, and I think I know the city of Dublin as well as most people, I have come to the definite conclusion that the whole of the social evils which we suffer from in the city are due to the bad housing conditions.  It is the experience of any person who has had knowledge of people living in the slums, that when you provide them with decent houses their whole outlook is changed.  People brought from the dirtiest of slums and given decent houses turn out to be good citizens.  I think that statement will bear examination, and that investigation will prove that if people living in insanitary slums, through no fault of their own, are given a chance they will become good citizens.  That has been proved on many occasions.  They have made every sacrifice in their power to get themselves and their families out of the slums.  I regret the Bill does not go further to meet the needs of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with other aspects of the question.  During the Second Reading debate in the Dáil the President made statements with regard to building costs.  He stated that the cost of building houses in Dublin has been coming down, and that we have arrived at the stage that five roomed houses are costing anything from £500 to £535 to erect.  There is one particular matter in connection with that type of house to which I will call attention.  The cost of building a five roomed house has been brought down to a figure between £500 and £535&mdash;I am speaking now altogether in connection with the houses that have been built by the local authorities, because these are the houses that will be inhabited by the people I represent, the working classes.  The houses that are being built by speculators and private <Col N="598" /> people will not in the main be inhabited by working-class people.</P>
    <P>The houses that are being erected in Dublin are being let on a sale purchase scheme, at rents that are beyond the means of the ordinary working man. At Croydon Park area the ordinary working-class family are asked to pay a rent of 17/1 per week for these houses.  I say with all respect that with the wages that are being paid, and with the continual demand for a reduction of the wages of the working-class people, you are by this high rent putting a tax on them that they are not able to bear.  We have Commissioners in charge of the Corporation affairs at present demanding that the lowest paid workers shall make a further sacrifice of 6/- per week.  They have already sacrificed 13/- a week of their wages, and it is now demanded of them to make a further sacrifice of 6/- a week.  At the same time these people who are demanding a reduction in the wages of these men are insisting on their paying a rent for their houses of 17/1 a week.  Fixing rents is one thing, but getting payment is another, and I am afraid rents are being asked in this case that cannot be paid.  A man can do no more than his best.  I know from personal knowledge that large numbers of people inhabiting houses built by the Dublin municipal authorities in recent years are making tremendous sacrifices in order to keep decent homes for their families.  These people have no say in the type of house that is being erected.</P>
    <P>There are differences of opinion with regard to the type of houses to be erected amongst the operatives in the building trade, and I speak with authority on their behalf.  I am a building operative myself&mdash; a building operative in the building trade in Dublin.  I say that the type of houses put up now and which the working people are forced by circumstances to enter into a sale purchase scheme to buy, is not the type of houses that these people should be asked to go in for.  We are putting our opinions against the opinions of other people.  We are entitled to offer an opinion, and that opinion is, that the cost of maintenance of these <Col N="599" /> houses will be altogether out of keeping with what the tenants can afford to pay.  It is a notorious fact that on the first section of the Marino houses, that is, houses that have been only inhabited within the last twelve months, the cost of maintenance has been altogether extremely high, and it bears out what I have been saying with regard to the type of houses that are being built.  Further than that, I want to say that the large amount of money that has been spent in the erection of these houses of the new type of construction has meant practically the elimination of the skilled trades from the building of houses.  The saving has not meant a very great difference in the cost of erection.  But it has meant a most important difference from the point of view of the country as a whole.  That is, that practically 60 per cent. of the amount of money that is being spent on the erection of these houses is being sent out of the country for the purpose of purchasing foreign material.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, when the old type of brick house was being constructed, we used to estimate that on the average the cost of material and labour used to run to about 50 per cent. for each.  It varied with the different type of house, but on the average it worked out at 50 per cent. for wages and 50 per cent. for materials.  Now in the new type of house, where the skilled trades are being practically eliminated, and where the houses are built mostly of mass concrete, most of the money spent on these houses is being spent on material, and I regret to say most of the money is being spent on foreign material.  I think that that is a very mistaken policy from the point of view of economics.  I do not understand anything about finance.  The President is well up in finance.  I am satisfied that if he examines the whole question he will agree that it is false economy to be sending all this money out of the country.  The new house costs a few pounds less.  You have the materials for the old type of houses on hands.  It is manufactured in the country and gives employment in the country and produces a better type of house. <Col N="600" /> I have yet to meet the man who could afford to build a house for himself without the subsidy who would build a house of concrete.  I have yet to meet the man who had a free choice who would not prefer to build himself a house on the old style, built of brick or stone and roofed with slate, than to adopt the new ideas.  I pay considerable regard to this, particularly because of the tremendous amount of money that is being sent out of the country.  I tried to estimate the cost of the 1,361 houses constructed or under construction by the Dublin Commissioners under the 1924 and the 1925 Acts.  Taking it at between £500 and £535 and putting the figure at, say, £520 per house, the cost of materials used in those houses comes close to half a million of money.  The great bulk of that money is at present being sent out of the country.  I think that is a great mistake, and I take this opportunity of referring to it and calling attention to it.</P>
    <P>The President in dealing with this question in the Dáil referred to the failure to take advantage of the section in the Bill with regard to the establishment of public utility societies.  It is regrettable that the people did not take advantage of the section.  But there are reasons why they did not. I was in some way connected with the starting of one public utility society.  That society entered into arrangements with the Dublin Commissioners for the erection of a number of houses.  We found that the great difficulty with regard to the establishment of these public utility societies was the fact that any person who joins a public utility society for the purpose of erecting a house, joins it for the purpose of getting a house erected for himself.  When we come down to the actual people who require houses, we will see that the number of people who have sufficient cash to enable them to do that is very small. That in itself is the real cause of the failure of the people to take advantage of public utility societies.  The main difficulty is with regard to raising money.  The number of working class families in Dublin who can afford to put down a large amount of money for the erection of houses is extremely <Col N="601" /> limited.  They cannot get accommodation in any way.  I interested myself with regard to a few people who were anxious to do the right thing, and to take advantage of the Housing Act to build houses for themselves&mdash;men in the building trade.  I went on one occasion to the bank and two people who had leases of their own houses offered to go security for £200 for a man in constant employment who was prepared to build a house for himself. The bank would not do any business and I think that is the experience of anybody who has approached a bank with such a proposal.  They have been turned down.  The banks will not touch them. I think it is a regrettable state of affairs that the banks will not come to the assistance of people anxious to build houses.  Because we want to get houses built, and every little would help.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity there is not more public spirit amongst the people in regard to building houses.  The failure with regard to the housing problem in this city has been the failure of the large employers of labour to give their contributions to the solving of the question.  It is unfair when everybody else has been contributing that the employers would not contribute.  The ratepayers of Dublin are all contributing to the providing of houses at 17/1 a week for tenants, the economic rent of which would be nearer 37/1 a week.  That really means that the ratepayers have to subsidise the employers of Dublin, because if the economic rent of these houses were paid, the wages would have to be considerably increased.  I do feel called on to direct attention to this failure on the part of the large employers of labour in Dublin to provide houses for their employees.  An example was set by an English company who came over to this country to erect a factory, twelve months ago. Immediately after they came here they found that they could not get decent houses not of concrete for their workers.  They built 70 or 80 houses just a little above where I live.  These houses are a credit to the firm that erected them.  They are in every way fit to be happy homes for the people who live in them.  I wish Irish employers <Col N="602" /> would take a leaf out of the book of this firm, take their example and thus help to provide decent houses for their working people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather anxious to appeal to the President on one small point in connection with the housing question, in which I know he has a very deep interest.  The point that I want to put to him is: would it be possible to give with these houses a little more land?  I recently had occasion to pass by two or three of the colonies of houses that have been built around Dublin.  To me it looks very like repeating Dublin a half mile outside the city boundary.  There I saw streets adjoining one another instead of being, as I take it they are supposed to be, model suburbs.  When all is said and done a little more land would not cost so much more.  There is plenty of land around Dublin, and a half an acre extra would not add much to the expenditure, divided amongst a number of houses.  The expenditure would be well repaid not alone from the point of view of comfort, but from the hygienic point of view.  I would appeal to the President, who I know has very strong views on this matter, and who I know is anxious to forward the work of better housing, to see if something cannot be done to give the tenants of the new houses that are to be built under this Bill a little more room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first point raised by Senator Farren, that the housing question was a burning question, I have only to say that the burning of houses is a thing that I hope has departed from the country permanently and for ever. With regard to the second point he mentioned, that 1,361 houses had been built under the 1924 and 1925 Acts, that is the number of houses that has been built by the City Commissioners.  In addition to that, something like 350 are being provided by private individuals, public utility societies, and by the speculative builder.  I had hoped that the Senator would give us some information regarding the material from which the speculative builder has constructed his houses, whether it is from homemade <Col N="603" /> materials or otherwise.  That question is bound up very much with the same question that Senator Guinness has raised about providing extra land with the houses.  The housing problem may be summed up in a single word&mdash;finance.  It is a question of money, because the land around the suburbs in Dublin varies in price from £200 to £300 per acre.  Within the city it is much dearer.  In one important borough in the country I understand that something like £400 has been paid per acre recently.  Twenty years ago it was not considered bad policy to put 30 houses to the acre. Forty or fifty years ago, in the City of Dublin, as many as 56 houses to the acre were constructed in the City of Dublin.  It went down to 40, and there was considerable criticism of the Corporation of Dublin in connection with the housing scheme some twelve years ago, when they proposed to put 40 houses to the acre.  At the present moment very few schemes are in course of construction with a larger number than 20 houses to the acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be seen at once that the smaller the number the higher the cost.  The costs after all are, as I have said, the main consideration for anybody who is trying to do something in connection with this question.  I think that Senator Farren, when he was making a case against the employers in Dublin, ought to have done justice at least to some of those who have made a very big contribution towards the housing question.  He realises, I think, that the Guinness firm have certainly made a very considerable contribution towards it.  I think that the condition of housing in Dublin would be almost indescribable if it were not for the efforts of that firm and quite a number of other concerns. I have not got a list of all of them at hand, but they are all set out in detail in the Local Government Housing Committee's Departmental Report of 1913.  Speaking from memory I should say that something like three or four thousand dwellings were provided by those firms.  There is a difficulty in the case of the Guinness firm because they disposed of quite a number of their houses to the Artisans' Dwellings <Col N="604" /> Company.  Lord Iveagh carried out a very big improvement scheme down in Bride's Alley, and in addition Lord Iveagh and Lord Ardilaun were very large subscribers towards the foundation of the Artisans' Dwellings Company. With regard to what Senator Farren said about the use of foreign materials, that, too, is a question of costs.  I would much prefer to see Irish materials used in the construction of houses.  I do not know that it would be impossible for a good many of the trade unions concerned with the building trade to endeavour to form a public utility society.  If they have a better method of construction, a better and more suitable lay-out of house, there is no earthly reason why they should not give us the benefit of their experience.  They have very considerable experience in the matter, and the Dublin building trade operatives have a very good tradition in building.  Our public buildings in Dublin are a testimony to their handicraft, but I am not satisfied that economy in house construction is yet in sight.  Senator Farren himself would admit at once that it is unlikely that a five-roomed house&mdash;a house which he would recommend himself to be constructed, a house built with brick and mortar and using as far as possible native material and constructed by expert operatives &mdash;would be produced at much under £560.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Having got that figure, you then have the costs incidental to such a house, such as rates, cost of collection of rents and so on, all of which go to make an uneconomic rental.  The Senator, I think, will admit at any rate that the operatives have been paid their price, and that is really what they are being called upon to pay in rent&mdash;what they have been paid themselves.  In other words, having produced an article, they are themselves asked for its price and they say it is beyond them.  The Senator did the Commissioners justice in one part of his statement by saying that it was a purchase scheme, but then on two occasions during his statement he said that the rent charged was 17/1.  There is something more than rent in that.  The <Col N="605" /> houses will be their own after a period of 40 years.  Therefore, taking into consideration all the circumstances, (1) the great increase in the cost of materials, (2) the great increase in labour costs, (3) the great increase in the interest charged on money, which has taken place since the war&mdash;when all those costs are piled on to that particular instalment charge we must admit that a housing solution, if it be reached, must be expensive, and that the costs which are inseparable from the making up of that considerable amount of 17/1 must be met by somebody.  We have endeavoured in this Bill, and in the preceding Bills, to share the cost and to spread the burden over quite a number. If we have not reached a solution of the question, at any rate the contribution which has been made towards the provision of houses has been very considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Farren mentioned the banks and said that they were unwilling to advance money.  The banks, as I understand them, are unwilling to advance money on anything that will not lend itself to being cashed, because after all the banks are only trustees for whatever money they have.  If there is a hesitancy on the part of the banks in respect to advancing money for housing, there must be some reason for it.  What are the reasons?  We can quite understand the difficulty a bank would be in in the case of a family in occupation of a small house not meeting its engagements in respect to the sum advanced for its construction.  You might in addition have interest on arrears.  In a case like that how is the bank going &ldquo;to cash in&rdquo; that house for the money that it had advanced, money that it held in trust for somebody else and which it must get back?  That is the real problem with regard to the banks. If it were easier to get possession of houses and to get buyers for them when put up for sale, then, I think, the banks would lend money more readily.  We must all admit that the trend is rather towards legislation to secure a person in his house, to make it difficult to have him evicted and to make it difficult for any person to get into the house in spite of him.  So long as those <Col N="606" /> difficulties are there, and I presume people ask for these things in good faith, believing that they are necessary, we cannot expect the banks to lend money on something which they cannot get at, and which they cannot command. The housing problem requires the co-operation and assistance of every person.  Every single person who puts up a house in this country during the next twenty years, or who has put up a house during the last forty years, is a public benefactor.</P>

It <Col N="613" /> did not provide for the fixing of days and hours at which District Courts should be held, and consequently it did not provide for the fixing of different court areas for civil and summary cases.  In fact it was our intention to have two kinds of court areas, a smaller area for criminal and summary cases and a larger area for civil work.  We feel that it would be anomalous to exercise the full civil jurisdiction of the court in every little village in which the courts would be held.  Solicitors, for instance, would not be able to attend without getting larger fees than their clients might care to pay.

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to read a letter which I sent to Senator Barrington on the 19th June and which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to the recent discussion in the Seanad on Section 49 of the Court Officers Bill (disposal of fines) and, in particular, to your suggestion that fines inflicted in the city of Limerick should continue to be paid to the local authority there, pursuant to the terms of certain Charters granted to that city, I write to say that I am now advised that the section, as it is at present worded, would not be held to nullify <Col N="614" /> the terms of a Charter, and that, consequently, the city would continue, despite the passing of the Act, to be entitled to any fines to which it is at present entitled by reason of any Charter.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is proper to add, however, that I am further advised that very few fines&mdash;in all probability no fines&mdash; are at present paid to Limerick City by virtue of any Charter, the destination of all fines being settled by Acts of Parliament passed during the last century.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The matter, therefore, stands as follows, viz.:</P>
    <P>(1)  I will oppose any alteration of the existing text of Section 49.</P>
    <P>(2)  If that text is enacted as it stands, it would appear that it will not have the effect of depriving Limerick City of any fines now claimable by that city under the Charter, but it may be taken that such fines are rare, if not unknown.</P>
    <P>(3)  If the city can show that any considerable proportion of the fines is recovered by reason of the exertion of the city's officials (rather than by the exertions of the Gárda Síochána) I will request the Minister for Finance to join with me in making a suitable order under sub-section (4) of the section in question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now what I mean by that last paragraph is this: In the year 1925 in Limerick the total sum of £96 3s. 9d. was recovered on foot of fines inflicted for drunkenness and breach of the licensing law, and a sum of £40 in respect of breaches of the betting Acts. Now the municipality had nothing whatever to do with the detection and punishment of these offences, and there is no particular reason why the municipality should profit from the frequency with which these offences are committed in Limerick, if I may put it in that way.  The detections were made by State-paid police; the cases were tried before State-paid Justices with the assistance of State-paid clerks, and there is no case for any apportionment of these fines going to the municipality itself.  Take a somewhat different cases.  In the same year <Col N="615" /> the sum of £59 18s. was recovered in respect of breaches of the Public Health and Food and Drugs Acts, and it might well be argued that the city authorities were responsible, in whole or in part, for the prosecution of the offenders.  If that is so, that is a case we will meet by making an order which we seek power to make under sub-section (4).  I want to put it generally that the case should be made for the apportionment of fines, and where no case can be made for any such apportionment, then there is no hardship in the abolition of such apportionment, which is what the Bill does.</P>
    <P>Simply to say that a thing shall be so, because it was so two hundred years ago, is scarcely a sound attitude in legislation.  I am not prepared to accept these old statutes, passed in an entirely different set of circumstances, circumstances which then possibly justified the apportionment of fines in this matter as between the local body and the central Government, and to take it that these statutes should stand immutable now that circumstances have entirely altered.  As to the Charter about which the Senator and Senator Gogarty enthused on the last day, we discussed that matter.  In so far as there are any fines derived from the Charter of the municipality in Limerick, the Bill does not touch them.  My own view is that there are no such fines, but if the Senator thinks there are and bases a poetic and sentimental case on and around his Charter, it is not touched by the Bill.  The Bill simply alters statutes and does not purport to alter anything more.  On the general proposition, where a case can be shown for apportionment, it will be made by order, but where no case can be shown, no apportionment will be made.  I tried to give the Senator a picture when I distinguished between drunkenness and betting fines and Food and Drugs Act fines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister, in making that statement, is entirely overlooking one clause of the Charter in question.  It says: &ldquo;All fines, forfeitures, perquisites, and profits, whateosver, happening, assessed, imposed or taxed, or to be so&rdquo; are granted to the citizens for &ldquo;their own proper use and to the better support of the city,&rdquo; so that any fines, etc., that in future arise are still included in the Charter of the City of Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a legal point, I admit.  The Minister has read his letter to me, but he has not read my reply to him.  I stated in reply:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If you will be good enough to refer to the amendment moved by me to Section 49 of the Court Officers Bill you will notice that it referred not only to the fines granted to the city by the Charter but also covered those arising under any Act of Parliament. I have since had an opportunity of discussing the whole question with the Limerick people, who feel very strongly on the matter, and who have requested me to continue pressing their case, as they regard the proposals in Section 49 as unduly unfair to the city.  However, as I read your letter, no financial questions are now at issue, as you are advised the section would not be held to nullify the terms of a Charter and that consequently the city would continue to be entitled to any fines by reason of any Charter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill was passed a short time ago called the Adaptation of Charters <Col N="617" /> Bill.  I am not at all sure, if the Minister found that under Section 1 the Charters carried fines inflicted under subsequent Acts of Parliament, he could adapt the Charters and deprive us of the fines.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards fines arising under Act of Parliament you go on to say in head 3 that subject to certain conditions&mdash;which I understand the city can easily establish&mdash;&lsquo;I will request the Minister for Finance to join with me in making a suitable order under sub-sec. (4) of the section in question.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It therefore follows that if the municipality approach you and substantiate their case they will receive the fines arising under Act of Parliament.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The above two paragraphs in your letter concede practically all the financial considerations involved, and all that remains is a question of &lsquo;amour-propre&rsquo; about which communities are apt to feel strongly, and having regard to the historical record of Limerick and the part the city has played time after time for the benefit of the whole of Ireland, we in Limerick feel and feel strongly that it would be only a slight recognition of the sacrifices the citizens have frequently made for the common good of the country if exceptional treatment was granted to their city by name.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Limerick occupies a strategic position, and its inhabitants frequently, even within the last few years, have &lsquo;sustained intolerable wasting and spoiling of their goods, and, what is worse, the cruel shedding of their blood,&lsquo; as King James (the man &lsquo;who never said a foolish thing&rsquo;) puts it into his Charter.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The proposal as it now stands in the light of your letter seems to resolve itself into a question as to whether Limerick is to continue to enjoy the privileges which have been its own from time immemorial, free and unfettered, or whether, in order to obtain what has hitherto been its own by right, the municipality must in future annually come before whoever may be the Minister for Justice <Col N="618" /> and make a case for the retention of its ancient privileges.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, it will be put in the position of the person who was</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Compelled, a needy suppliant, to wait</P>
    <P>While ladies intercede and slaves debate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have, therefore, been urged to press for an amendment exempting Limerick from the provisions of Section 49, which, having regard to the city's special services and sacrifices in the past, would seem to be simply a gracious gesture of recognition on the part of the Government no greater than the city has already frequently obtained from Kings of England.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I shall be very glad to hear that you can see your way to make this small concession which I feel sure will have a most desirable effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In all that has been said on this question the Minister has completely overlooked and never replied to the question I raised the last day.  I assume the reason he said nothing in reply is because nothing can be said in reply.  Taxation, to be fair and just, should be equally applied.  If those fines are taken from Limerick it will mean that the people there will have to strike a rate of a penny in the £.  I regard that as unfair unless the rest of the country contribute a penny in the £ also.  The Minister has overlooked that, and the only conclusion I can come to is that there is nothing to be said in favour of it.  On the last day this was up the Minister made use of what I regard as a somewhat unfortunate remark.  He said the claim of Limerick was a compound of greed and romance.  I deny that it is greed on the part of any community to defend what they have enjoyed as their own for a thousand years.  I think the word &ldquo;greed&rdquo; might be more properly applied to the people who tried to take it from them.  Whether the amount is large or small does not enter into the question.  We are asked to contribute what, in our case, amounts to a penny in the £, and I do not see why our demand should be described as &ldquo;greed&rdquo; because we are trying to <Col N="619" /> retain what we have had from time immemorial.  He says if we come before him, ask for a remission of these fines under sub-section 4, and prove our case, he will concede it.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendment of Senator Barrington. I know Limerick feels strongly in the matter and the people there are convinced that certain rights which they have had for years and years are being filched from them.  I think that that ought not be allowed in the Bill without very serious consideration. <Col N="620" /> The Minister has assured us that the words &ldquo;notwithstanding any enactments to the contrary&rdquo; make the thing secure.  To me they make it absolutely insecure to Limerick as regards its charter.  Even though they may have a charter still, the enjoyment under that charter may be taken away.  At any rate the fact remains that the people of Limerick believe implicitly that they have a right to collect the fines.  There is no reason that legislation should take from them this small concession which they have for such a long time.  Romance is there, sentiment is there, and the present need of the City of Limerick is there.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Where any fines, amerciaments, penalties and forfeited recognisances have pursuant to an Act of Parliament, Ancient Charter or Patent been granted to, and for upwards of twenty years paid to the credit of any of the funds of any public body, corporation or council, they shall continue to be appropriated as heretofore.&rdquo;</P>

If a reverence of twenty years can be claimed for the particular apportionment of a particular fine, it has to stand although no modern cause <Col N="621" /> can be pleaded for it.  That is absurd. You might as well plead for the sanitary arrangements of the Firbolgs on the grounds of antiquity.  There is no case for this peculiar tangle of fine apportionment that exists, and that I am quite determined to get clear from. Wherever a case can be shown we have power to meet it, and have every intention of meeting it.</P>
    <P>As I suggested, it might be shown in connection with fines under the Foods and Drugs Act where there is any energy or any activity on the part of the municipality or any officer of the municipality, and then we can meet that.  Where there is none what is the case?  The Senator talks about justice and fair play.  They are the two most abused words in the vocabulary except I might add the word &ldquo;filched,&rdquo; which Senator Bennett used.  Justice and fair play and the rights of the city! What are the rights?  We are told we are imposing a tax of a penny in the £. Would it ever occur to the Senator to look at it in this way, that ever since a good sound case for the apportionment ceased to exist, he owes us all the pennies in the £ that he had by way of a windfall from that day on.  This Charter of 1600 is not affected by the Bill.  I myself do not believe that any apportionments derive at present from the charter.  I think every single apportionment of fines derives to-day from some statute, but it is open to the municipality of Limerick to argue their charter before any court.  I am not going further.  I am not going to say that fines derived from statutes whether in Limerick or any place else <Col N="622" /> are to stand, nor am I going to write any express exception in this Bill in favour of Limerick and bring the other municipalities in the country about my ears.</P>
    <P>Really the choice is to let this absurd entanglement of fines stand with all the question of costs which it entails, and with all the insoluble doubts that now hang around it or to do the thing which we are now doing in the Bill. You can bring this charter into court and argue whether you are entitled to something under this apportionment of fines arising out of it, and if the court says you are you will get that, but the statutes are different things.  The statutes have a general application as distinct from the local application of this charter for what it is worth, and I think it is worth precious little.  I am not going to take the view that where there is a statute twenty years old, even if there is a case for it, it cannot be amended by the Dáil and the Seanad.  Drogheda, Galway and the not inconsiderable and not unhistoric city of Dublin would have the right to resent an express exception in favour of Senator Barrington's constituency and birthplace, presumably.</P>

      <P>We thought we had done a great service in Limerick when we got rid of the Danes long ago and the Danes' impositions.  The Danes were the greatest masters of exaction. I am sorry to say that there are some Danes left in the country or people who are prepared to put the principles of the Danes into operation.</P>

      <P>I should mention in connection with this amendment, that I have received from the Minister three other amendments of a similar nature which come in immediately after this amendment.  These amendments are amendments that he is inserting at the request of and for the protection of the official staff upon representation made to him and to which he has acceded.  I may say for myself that the amendments are not only exceedingly fair but very generous. I do not know whether the Senators have them, but they were only handed in this afternoon.  That was not through any fault on the part of the Minister, but they were handed in after <Col N="624" /> the interview with the staff.  They could not be handed in sooner.  This amendment to delete the sub-section and to substitute therefor a new sub-section (6) is in conformity with the promise the Minister gave on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Government amendment:&mdash;</P>

      <P>The next amendment is 23a, and it reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 61, sub-section (5), paragraph (d).  To delete lines 66 to 69 and to substitute therefor the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;office, but every such waiver shall be subject to the condition that in the event of his subsequently retiring from such employment because of his having reached an age limit or being discharged from such employment for any reason other than misconduct, incapacity or ill health, his allowance or other compensation under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1923, or other Acts authorising the grant to him of a pension or other allowance as modified for and applied to him by this sub-section shall not be less than the compensation he would have been entitled to under the said Article 10.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I might mention to the House that in view of what we have done and also in consequence of an intimation I have received from Senator Yeats, that he is not proceeding with the motion which stands in his name for to-morrow, I am afraid that the business for to-morrow will be very short.  All that will be left will be the Committee Stage of three non-contentious Bills.  The Appropriation Bill and the Finance Bill have passed the other House to-day and, I presume, will be received here this evening.  That would make it possible, if the House wishes, to consider them on Tuesday.  In addition we would be able to take some of the contentious Bills on Friday.  I would suggest to the House that it <Col N="627" /> would be more convenient if, instead of meeting to-morrow for a brief sitting, we might meet on Friday and take the Committee Stage of the non-contentious Bills with the Committee Stage of the contentious Bills as far as we could get through them.</P>
