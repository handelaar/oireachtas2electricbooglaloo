      <P>I very deeply regret to announce to the House the death, on the 6th September last, of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator P.J. Hooper.  To me his death has been a very great loss.  He was a man of very sound judgment, of great earnestness and of great assiduity.  On many occasions he was to me, by reason of his counsel, a tower of strength.  As a friend I miss him sincerely and as a colleague his loss is very, very great indeed.  I can say nothing which would in any way add to your feelings of sorrow in the great loss that we all have suffered.  I would like to say from my heart that I miss him.</P>

      <P>It will be necessary, in accordance with sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Seanad Bye-Elections Act, 1930, for an order to be made directing the Clerk to inform the Minister for Local Government and Public Health of the vacancy in the Seanad caused by the death of Senator Hooper, in order to cause such vacancy to be filled.</P>

      <P>It is also necessary, under Standing Order No. 10, for an order to be made fixing a date for the election to fill the vacancy in the office of Leas-Chathaoirleach.  In view of the fact that the current triennial period is nearly at an end, I take it that there will be general agreement among Senators that this vacancy should not be filled.  Accordingly, I suggest to the House that they should make an order fixing Wednesday, 9th December.  In this way, the Standing Order will be fulfilled, but the vacancy will not in fact be filled until the beginning of the new triennial period.</P>

      <P>Whereas Stephen Heller, of 10 Camomile Street, London, E.C.3, was born at Vienna, in Austria, on 16th day of May, 1895, and is a national of Czecho-Slovakia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we proceed with public business I want to draw the attention of the Seanad to a matter concerning the procedure of the House and, to some extent, the privileges of Senators.  Senators received this morning typed copies of a notice which opens in the following manner:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The following notice of motion has to-day been handed in by Senators Wilson and O'Rourke and, by direction of the Cathaoirleach, will appear on the Order Paper for Friday next, the 16th October, 1931:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That, in the case of the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Bill, 1931, the stages shall be proceeded with as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then follow practically a series of closure motions.  In the normal course of affairs under our Standing Orders five days' notice would be required. Motions that are to be placed on the Order Paper must reach the Clerk not <Col N="1844" /> later than 3 p.m. on the fifth preceding day.  This particular notice refers to a matter which is to be brought up for discussion on Friday, which is only the fourth day.  True it is that, with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, motions or amendments may be moved on shorter notice.  One has to assume by the language of this notice that the Cathaoirleach did give permission that the notice should be sent out.  This notice deals with a Bill of which no Senator, other than those Senators who are moving the notice, has any formal knowledge.  It appears to me to be a gross breach of the machinery which governs the procedure in this House that such a motion should be put forward in this manner.  We are given notice of certain procedure in connection with a Bill of which the Seanad, with the exception of perhaps two Senators, knows nothing.  We have not been presented with copies of the Bill, and nobody knows what is in the Bill. The whole procedure is informal and I suggest that this notice should not be for one moment considered by the House.  I ask whether, having regard to all the circumstances, you have consented to receive this notice as a valid notice in accordance with the Standing Orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is not before the Seanad for discussion to-day. Nevertheless I would like to assure Senator Johnson that I have given my permission to have this matter put on the Order Paper for Friday, and it will appear on the Order Paper that day. All the Senator's objections will be met on that day.  When this motion appears on the Order Paper I take it that copies of the Bill will then have been circulated, and Senators will be aware of its contents.  So far as that portion of the objection is concerned, it goes by the board.  As regards the Senator's criticism of my action in accepting this motion, I may assure him that I had no other course open to me.</P>

      <P>I beg to propose the motion which appears under my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>WHEREAS it is provided by sub-section (2) of Section 5 of the Seanad Electoral Act, 1928, that on or before a date therein, specified preceding a Seanad Election as many qualified persons as there are members to be elected at such election shall be nominated by Seanad Eireann voting on principles of proportional representation for inclusion in the panel of candidates for such election:</P>
      <P>AND WHEREAS it is provided by sub-section (3) of the said Section 5 that the method of proposal and selection of persons for such nomination by Seanad Eireann shall be decided by Seanad Eireann:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NOW THEREFORE Seanad Eireann doth hereby resolve and <Col N="1846" /> decide that the proposal and selection for such nomination by Seanad Eireann shall be conducted in accordance with the following rules:&mdash;</P>
    <P>RULES FOR THE SELECTION OF THE SEANAD PORTION OF THE PANEL FOR THE TRIENNIAL ELECTION TO SEANAD EIREANN, 1931.</P>
    <P>1.  The Cathaoirleach, or, in his absence, a Senator to be nominated by the Seanad at the time of the appointing of the day for voting, shall be the Returning Officer for the purposes of the selection.</P>
    <P>2.  A voting paper shall be prepared by the Returning Officer in the form set out in the Schedule hereto (Form III), and the names of candidates appearing thereon shall be arranged alphabetically in the order of their surnames and, in the case of identity of surnames, of their other names.</P>
    <P>3.  All outgoing Senators shall be entitled to have their names placed on the voting paper on furnishing to the Returning Officer a requisition to that effect duly completed in the form set out in the Schedule hereto (Form I).</P>
    <P>4.  All other candidates must be proposed and seconded by a Senator. No Senator may propose or second more than one candidate, but a Senator may propose one candidate and second another.  In the proposing and seconding of candidates due regard shall be had to Article 33 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>5.  Every candidate, other than an outgoing Senator, shall be proposed on a separate form, which shall be in the terms set out in the Schedule hereto and shall contain the particulars required thereby (Form II).</P>
    <P>6.  The Returning Officer shall cause a proposal paper to be supplied to any Senator requiring the same during the period commencing twenty-one clear days prior to the date appointed by the Seanad for the voting to take place and ending at 12 o'clock noon seven clear days prior to such date, which period is herein referred to as the &ldquo;time for selection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>7.  Forms I and II, duly completed, <Col N="1847" /> must reach the Returning Officer or such other person as he may appoint for the purpose during such hours, and at such places, as the Returning Officer may fix, but not after the expiration of the time for selection.</P>
    <P>8.  Every candidate, or a member of Seanad Eireann who has taken his seat therein on behalf of such candidate, shall furnish to the Clerk of the Seanad before the expiration of the time for selection an affidavit duly completed under the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1927, in the form set out in the Schedule to that Act.  Failure to comply with this rule shall be deemed by the Returning Officer to render invalid the proposal paper on which such candidate was proposed.</P>
    <P>9.  The Returning Officer may reject as invalid any proposal paper which does not comply with the requirements of these rules, or which purports to propose a person who is not qualified to be elected as a Senator or is placed under disability or incapacity by the Constitution or by law, and the decision of the Returning Officer that a proposal paper is valid or is invalid shall be final for all purposes.</P>
    <P>10.  As soon as practicable after receiving a valid proposal paper, but not later than one day after the expiration of the time for selection, the Returning Officer shall cause a notice of such proposal to be issued to each Senator, and such notice shall contain the name in full of the person proposed, his address, profession or occupation, and a statement of such person's useful public service or special qualifications or attainments in reference to important aspects of the nation's life.</P>
    <P>11.  Any candidate duly proposed may by notice in writing, signed by him and delivered to the Returning Officer, withdraw his proposal at any time before the expiration of the time for selection, and in any such case the Returning Officer shall as soon as practicable cause notice of the withdrawal to be issued to each Senator.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1848" /> 12.  The voting shall be by secret ballot.</P>
    <P>13.  The voting shall take place at the sitting of Seanad Eireann on such date and during such hours as shall be fixed by Seanad Eireann, and no other business shall be transacted by Seanad Eireann during those hours on that date.</P>
    <P>14.  Standing Orders 16, 17 and 18 (relating to the presence of a quorum) shall be deemed to be suspended during the time for voting.</P>
    <P>15.  The Returning Officer shall cause one voting paper to be handed to each Senator who is present at such sitting.</P>
    <P>16.  The Returning Officer shall cause another voting paper to be handed to any Senator who may inadvertently spoil a voting paper in exchange for the spoilt voting paper.</P>
    <P>17.  During the hours and on the day appointed by Seanad Eireann for the voting to take place each Senator shall place his voting paper in a ballot box to be provided by the Returning Officer.</P>
    <P>18.  A Senator in giving his vote must place on his ballot paper the figure 1 opposite the name of the candidate for whom he votes, and may in addition place on his ballot paper the figures 2 and 3, or 2, 3, and 4 and so on opposite the names of other candidates in the order of his preference.</P>
    <P>Any ballot paper&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on which the figure 1 standing alone indicating a first preference for some candidate is not placed, or</P>
    <P>(b)  on which the figure 1 standing alone indicating a first preference is set opposite the name of more than one candidate, or</P>
    <P>(c)  on which the figure 1 standing alone indicating a first preference and some other number is set opposite the name of the same candidate, or</P>
    <P>(d)  on which anything is written or marked by which the voter can be identified,</P>
    <P>shall be invalid and not counted.</P>
    <P>19.  The Returning Officer shall <Col N="1849" /> cause the voting papers to be counted and the result of the selection to be determined in accordance with the rules set out in the Second Schedule to the Seanad Electoral Act, 1928, and all references to the Seanad Returning Officer in the said Second Schedule shall be taken to be references to the Returning Officer under these rules.</P>
    <P>20.  The Returning Officer shall declare the result of the selection by causing to be displayed in some convenient place a statement giving the particulars required by Rule 22 of the First Schedule to the Seanad Electoral Act, 1928.</P>
    <P>21.  In the event of the death or disqualification of any person so selected between the date of proposal and the date of formation of the panel, the continuing candidate credited with the greatest value at the last count, or, where at such count there were no continuing candidates not selected, the candidate last excluded shall be deemed to have been selected in his stead.</P>
    <P>22.  Save in the case of the signature of Senators proposing the candidates and of the candidates consenting to such proposal, which signatures must be in the handwriting of the persons concerned, expressions in these Rules referring to writing shall include printing, typewriting and other modes of representing or reproducing words in visible form.</P>
    <P>23.  This Resolution may be cited as the Seanad Election Resolution, 1931.</P>
    <P>This motion is purely a formal one and it is pursuant to statute.  Its terms are substantially the same as the terms of a motion submitted to the House on the occasion of the last Seanad Triennial Election.  It brings into operation the machinery which worked satisfactorily on the last occasion and it is just as likely to work as satisfactorily on this occasion.</P>

      <P>That, in view of the recent decision of the British Government to abandon the gold basis of currency and the reactions resulting from that decision on the currency and finances of the Saorstát, it is a matter of urgent public importance that a Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas be set up&mdash;</P>

      <P>(d)  to make recommendations for the protection of the economic stability of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt when I was putting down this motion that it would draw attention to the real problem that is facing the country.  Whatever the Minister for Finance, his financial advisers and other people may think to the contrary, I feel that here in this House to-day we are likely to discuss the real problem and that the red herring will be discussed in the other House.  I have attempted to make the motion as comprehensive as possible.  I think it will be generally conceded by all the intelligent members of the Seanad that the critical situation that has arisen will at least demand the attention of the Seanad and of the country.  We are faced with a crisis no less than that which confronts the people on the other side.  The crisis with which we are <Col N="1852" /> faced is the result of being tied almost completely to an economic outlook, a banking outlook, and a financial outlook that is entirely Imperial and that has ignored the potentialities of internal development in this country.  We know that when the Currency Commission reported, certain recommendations were made and, as a result of these recommendations, we became attached to what was known as the pound sterling. When the Banking Commission, or what I preferred at the time to call a commission of bankers, sat, similar recommendations were made, and the result of all this was that we were tied to the basis of the British pound sterling. We know that to-day we are suffering from the devaluation of the pound and we know that that is inevitable as a result of the policy that has been pursued.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that the position was difficult; it may be argued that there were certain economic reasons why we should be attached to the pound sterling.  At various times criticism was offered regarding the line of policy that was being pursued.  This criticism was in the main ridiculed, sneered at, treated with contempt; in any event it was ignored in actual practice.  I am not going to try to argue that the world-wide financial crisis could have been entirely avoided in Ireland.  I do argue, and I have argued, that many of its worst reactions could have been avoided if we had a definite line of Irish policy as distinct from the Imperial financial policy.  At times in this House we have heard a good deal about the inferiority complex and the slave mind.  If ever there was anything that exhibited our lack of courage in facing up to vital problems in this country it has been exhibited by the Department of Finance and by the Minister for Finance by reason of the slavish allegiance that has been paid to the system that has prevailed over there when we could have protected ourselves to a great extent.  We know that responsible Ministers dealing with practically every phase of economic life have stressed the importance of our dependence upon the people on the other side.  They seem to have been entirely unconscious, deliberately or otherwise, <Col N="1853" /> of what were the obvious trends, even to the elementary study of economics, that were inherent in the position on the other side.</P>
    <P>For some years the economic stability of nearly every country has been under review.  Criticisms in every country in the world have been applied to bankers' organisations, to the basis of credit, to the question of the gold basis and to all sorts of problems that are now finding expression in world conditions.  We in this country who had difficult problems no doubt, but problems that could have been faced, tackled and solved, have been ignored completely and we have been allowed to pursue a policy of absolute drift. In England there were various factors which would show, even to the elementary student, the possible drift.  We had a serious shrinkage of trade, a rapid increase of the adverse trading balance as far as Britain itself was concerned, even allowing for the invisible imports; we had steadily growing unemployment, increased taxation, and there was very serious criticism within Britain itself as regards the policy that was being pursued.  To-day we find the same Britain absolutely rent asunder with regard to her internal problem, and we find this country approaching a period when it will be rent asunder with the same problem&mdash;an outcropping of the system which we have so slavishly adopted.</P>
    <P>It cannot be argued that members of the Executive and others responsible have not been warned that the situation at least demanded close watching, careful analysis, and that there should be adequate provision made for what was coming.  It is repugnant to me to have to refer to various analyses that have been made in this House on other occasions. But the situation is of such importance that I hope the Seanad will bear with me while I refer to several statements made in this House, some by myself and some by other Senators, which may explain how negligent the financial administration of this country has been during the past few years.  As far back as April, 1929, the issue of the banks was discussed here. <Col N="1854" /> A discussion arose on the Bank of Ireland Bill.  Speaking on that Bill on 10th April, 1929, I said:</P>
    <P>Paragraph (p) deals with bullion. Bullion of course, and the freedom to operate in bullion, are essential to the banks, but it is a privilege or a power that should be carefully watched.  At the moment I do not know how we stand as regards bullion and reserves of bullion.  If, as I presume, our reserves, including bullion, are in the hands of English bankers in the Bank of England or elsewhere, I submit that the matter requires very grave consideration. After all, a crisis might develop in England, and the only security we have is to have reserves of bullion under our own control.  That may be the case, but I do not think it is, I think that any powers that are granted to bankers in Ireland in regard to the control of bullion ought to be exercised under the direct guidance of the Minister for Finance of the time, and that the country ought to concentrate upon having control of its own reserves in that form.</P>
    <P>That was submitted on the accepted basis of the time and since that we were operating on a gold basis.  I would like to refer the House to the issue which was raised in the debate on the Irish bank rates.  That matter was discussed here on 28th May, 1930, and the following is portion of a statement made on that day: &ldquo;Even those who only take a layman's interest in questions of finance and trade know that at the moment bankers' systems are very much under suspicion, not only in Ireland but all over the world&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The quotation continues: &ldquo;I venture to say that in this country we are not going to have anything like economic, industrial or agricultural development, or anything tending towards the progress and prosperity of the ordinary people, of the ordinary business and producing community, until we get right down to what is the fundamental economic evil at the present time, namely, the stranglehold that bankers have got on industry and production.&rdquo;  Now certain distinguished Senators, who are also bankers, disputed that statement, but if Senators will remember Dr. Addison, speaking with regard to the downfall of the Labour Government recently in England, accused the bankers of holding a pistol at the head of the Government.  I think it is generally admitted by all people who are not wilfully blind to the situation that Governments are ceasing to have real power and that the financial interests are controlling Governments.  At the same period we raised another issue here.  I said then: &ldquo;I think we ought to know what money is to the credit of the depositors and what is done with it&mdash;how much is operating here, and that we ought to have the fullest possible details.  We do not want the bankers to disclose anything secret as regards individual transactions.  We want a segregation of the accounts in such form that they will be an intelligent guide for the Minister for Finance and people generally as to where that money is and how it is being used.&rdquo; I quote that statement for a deliberate purpose, because later on I shall be raising a question as to the reserves and deposits held by the banks, what they have done with them and how they stand to-day in relative world values.  Later, on the 26th November, 1930, we discussed here the Currency Amendment Bill.  The discussion to some extent centred around the question of the gold basis.  I think it will be illuminating if I give the views expressed from these benches and the <Col N="1856" /> views that were expressed on behalf of the Ministry.  I said:</P>
      <P>I should like to be advised, since the Minister is here, as to the real position as regards our security. Are we on a gold basis, or are we not?  If we are on a gold basis, is there any security unless we have gold bullion or gold coin available within our own reserves?  What security have we that the Note Issue will always be what it is, as far as currency in Great Britain is concerned, any more than we have as regards the position of the dollar standard?  But if we are on a gold basis, what is the purpose of being on that basis when, as a matter of fact, we have no gold bullion or gold reserves in this country?  I am not in favour of working on a gold basis. My belief is that the gold basis has outlived its usefulness.  We are only pretending we have any gold security as regards note value if we have not a gold reserve within our own territory. Let us make no mistake about that.  I should like to know, now that the Minister is here, why we have no gold reserve; why we are dependent entirely on the gold reserves kept by the Bank of England. That is the position that the Currency Commission occupies at present. I do not see any objection to going to the United States for our reserve of credit any more than going to Great Britain.  I think they are both in exactly the same position. That position is reasonably good to-day, in spite of all the adverse factors that are working out in what one might call the higher economic thought.  But that position may not be all right for an indefinite period.  Another point arises on that; it is an economic point. There seems to be an instinctive dislike to trusting to your own securities within your own country, though these securities might, in the last analysis, be quite as good as British Government or United States securities.</P>
      <P>Later on I stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister where exactly we stand. Are we on a gold basis or are we <Col N="1857" /> not?  If we are working on a gold basis, I hold that we should have a gold reserve here and the word or bond of no other Government should have effect on our operation.  A crisis may arise.  Financial crises will arise.</P>
    <P>What will the Minister for Finance say to that to-day?  What did he say then?  I am interested to know what he will say to-day.  On that occasion the Minister for Finance, in reply, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Personally, I think it would be most uneconomic for us to have gold in cellars here.  There is nothing at all to be said for that, especially in the case of smaller countries which can get sufficient interest bearing Government securities of larger and financially stable countries.  One of the great countries could not get the amount of securities that it would require, but a country like the Saorstát can get the required securities.  They are as good for every purpose as gold, and interest is being earned on them. Gold would be lying idle in the cellars, and money would be spent keeping and guarding it.  Generally I think that&mdash;I do not want to go into the larger question of the gold standard&mdash;as long as we have a gold exchange standard for all practical purposes in our circumstances, it is the same thing as a gold standard. It would be quite easy to get a great quantity of gold back here, gold value for about ten millions, or as much as we had before, but it would be a useless proceeding.  Anybody with British securities can sell them and get gold.  The gold could be kept here, but soldiers would have to be employed to guard it and it would not be of much use.</P>
    <P>Now, that is an unpleasant job over, but I think we owe it to ourselves to remember the attitude of this House and of the Minister for Finance when certain suggestions, such as I have quoted, were made here.  I want to know if the Seanad is now satisfied that the all-wise Minister knew what he was talking about then and if he knows what he is going to do to-day to meet the situation created by the policy then deliberately adopted.  At the present time we read a lot in <Col N="1858" /> various economic journals.  It is wearisome to read the stuff that very often is published by responsible people in this country.  We are told that we have gone off the gold standard.  I would like the Minister for Finance once and for all to tell us where we have gone, and what we have gone on to.  We, on these benches, have been sneered at in this House&mdash;for constantly talking rubbish about banks and things that we knew nothing about. We only know a little about them, but what we do know is that the best minds and the best brains in the country ought to have been working on this for the last three years.</P>
    <P>I am not going to say that we can solve the problem.  What I do say is that no attention has been paid to it, and that the country is as it is to-day because of that.  As I said earlier, we are dealing here in this House with the real problem that concerns the country while at the moment the smoke screen is being carried on in the other House. I do not want to labour that side of the question more than is necessary. The problem now is that we are in the soup.  No matter what Party we belong to the thing for all of us is to try and see how we can face up to this.  First of all, the question is: Can we get out of it?  I do not think that we can. We can nurse a sick subject out of a delicate dilemma.  That, I think, is the most we can do at present.  That is why I have deliberately asked the House to recommend that a Joint Committee be set up, a Committee that will honestly try, from the Irish point of view, to face up to our difficulties and see how we can get out of them, how we can meet the problems that face us with as little loss as possible and adjust our position to our needs.</P>
    <P>There is one thing in all fairness to the Minister I would like to mention. The last quotation that I gave on the question of the gold basis arose in the debate on the Currency Amendment Bill.  That Bill, whilst somewhat belated, did give power to the Government and to the Currency Commission to alter its basis of investment. I would certainly welcome a statement from the Minister that the powers granted under that amending Bill were availed of, and that a considerable proportion of the securities <Col N="1859" /> are non-British and are not attached to the pound sterling.  I hope the Minister will have that news for us because the amending Act did give the Government power to do what I have stated.  These matters, in so far as they affect the Minister and the Currency Commission, are a mere detail in the whole economy of the country.  There is a far more important phase of the issue, and that is the position as regards the investments made on behalf of Irish depositors&mdash;the investments made with the reserved savings, securities and deposits in the Irish banks.  It has been raised by the chief Treasury official here in regard to the lack of information that is given in the bank balance-sheets.</P>
    <P>In view of the crisis that is upon us, and in view of the terrible losses in which Irish creditors may be involved, I think it is absolutely essential that the Committee should have power to investigate what these investments are, what the depreciation has been and how the depositors are going to be safeguarded, if it is possible to safeguard them at all.  We know that the operations of bankers in this country are carried on entirely on the basis of the Bank of England pound sterling and that they have no idea of other investments.  In other words, they are hide-bound in the tradition of carrying on on the old orthodox basis.  Now, I am not accusing any of the bankers of personal bad faith, but I do accuse them of this: that they have got into the rut of this tradition and have refused to budge out of it, even when it was in their own interests and the interests of their clients to do so.  I submit that their attitude and their methods of carrying out their functions have left us subject to the effects of what I may call the new Norman Conquest of England, and that we are going to suffer severely as a result of that.</P>
    <P>There is a question that I want to ask banker Senators here, or perhaps it would be more properly addressed to the Minister for Finance.  Shortly after the crisis occurred in England it was published in the Press that the bank rate in this country would be left unchanged. <Col N="1860" /> That decision was altered a few days later.  Apparently the decision was come to after a considerable consultation between the bankers and the Minister, or the Minister's Department. But then it appears as if some other influence got to work.  That arrangement was upset and the bank rate was increased.  At the time that the Bank of Ireland Bill was under discussion in this House I referred to the fact that it was outside alien influences that operated our banking machine here.</P>
    <P>We have an example&mdash;at least I believe we have&mdash;of that in this matter. I have reasonably good authority for stating that the bankers of the Free State had willingly agreed to keep the bank rate at what it was, but that an external bank, that is, a bank outside the Twenty-six Counties, intervened and dictated what the bank rate here should be and what line of policy should be pursued.  I believe it was a bank with its headquarters in Belfast as a branch institution of one of the big five that did that.  Its action is symptomatic of what we pay for our loyalty, affection and allegiance in the matter of external association to the internal operations of the British financial machine in this country.  That action justifies the fear that we have expressed consistently in this House with regard to the control of our financial machine.  From what has occurred, it is quite obvious that bankers here, even the biggest of them, or even the Minister for Finance, were not able to withstand the attitude of this external bank, and it is the attitude of that bank that prevails in this country to-day.  In it we have another example of the new Norman Conquest.</P>
    <P>One may be pardoned for feeling a certain amount of despair when one reads some of the statements made throughout this country.  I have here a statement made by a member of the Executive Council at Cong.  The Minister for Justice, Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney, speaking there, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>He would ask them to bear in mind when talking about the deflation of the pound that that meant that the pound had two values, one outside the country and another inside the country.  Inside the country there <Col N="1861" /> was no need for retail prices to rise, and for some time at any rate there was no reason to anticipate that there would be any real advance in the retail prices of any commodities which they had to buy.  On the other hand, this alteration in the value of the pound would be of very considerable service to them in selling their produce in the English market.  It would be an advantage to them against all countries that were now on the gold standard.</P>
    <P>That must be the newest economics yet.  I do not know whether Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney ever heard of such a thing as purchasing power.  Does he think that it is only commodities that are sold from Ireland to England that are going to go up in price?  Does he think that the de-valuated pound is going to buy as much English produce in Ireland as it did before?  He cannot have it both ways.  He overlooks the important factor that we have an adverse trade balance in our trading with England, and to the extent of that adverse trade balance just so much do we lose in the de-valuated pound.  It is another example of the mentality that we get from the Minister for Justice.  He also said on that occasion:</P>
    <P>It was said that instead of having securities for something close on seven million pounds for their currency that they should have put it in gold.  To his mind such a suggestion was very, very foolish indeed. If they had put seven million pounds in gold and had it lying idle earning no interest they would have lost 5 per cent. on close on seven million pounds for nearly four years.</P>
    <P>I doubt if these securities earn 5 per cent.  If we take the position that the pound is at 15s. 9d. to-day we find that we will lose £1,487,500, but what is far more important is that the securities held by the banks on that basis are not to-day negotiable at anything like that price.  There is a risk of further deflation.  Unquestionably a movement of any such amount of securities would influence the pound sterling very severely.  I leave the Minister for Justice at that.  Whatever he may know about public safety <Col N="1862" /> he certainly knows very little about public security in financial matters.</P>
    <P>To come back to the question of the banks' investments and the pound sterling.  If we assume that these banks have exported capital by in vestment or otherwise, cash in hands to the Bank of England and so on, and that we have upwards of £150,000,000 &mdash;I do not know what the figure is&mdash; with the pound hovering about 16s. to-day, we must reckon that our depositors have lost already about £30,000,000.  If the pound goes to 15s. then they will have lost 37½ millions. We have no security that the pound will be stabilised at any figure.  It may be stabilised at 10s.  I do not know, but certainly from all the visible signs that reflect the economic position the situation does not look good.</P>
    <P>There is only one satisfactory thing about this and it is that at least it may awaken members of the Seanad and of the public to the realities of the situation: that they may get busy and take an interest in such things.  So far I have only dealt with the problem on the accepted orthodox theory.  I do not propose to do much else to-day. I have my own views with regard to various aspects of it, but I prefer to ask the Seanad to agree that a representative committee of both Houses should be set up to go into the problem and see how it should be handled.  My own personal conviction is that the whole basis of credit is wrong.  The bankers' system has created anomalies that have had disastrous results for Governments and peoples.  Governments and peoples are very much at its mercy.  The factors underlying it have resulted in a complete lack of harmony between credit, production and consumption.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that none of the members of this or of the other House are competent to deal with this.  I do not know, but what I do know is that the situation is not going to be solved simply by sitting down and folding your arms, accepting the thing as if it were immutable and saying that it could not be helped.  I say that we are going to have to face more difficulties than we know at the present time. These difficulties are going to be economic <Col N="1863" /> and will have their reactions in politics and in political activity.  On many occasions in this House I have pleaded that we here should try and face this problem from the point of view of Christian humanity.  Our problems are difficult.  Each country has its own particular problems, but I hold that we in this country have a reasonable chance of solving the problems within our own country.  I could give various reasons in support of that, but one is the undeveloped state of the country.  More than two years ago I stated that paradoxical as it may seem our poverty is our greatest asset.  Anyone who looks at the position in the world to-day, the financial and commercial position and the methods of production and distribution, will realise that we have a chance of creating something like a decent Christian organism within the country and that very little will need to be destroyed to bring that about. That is the great advantage that we possess over other peoples.  We have a certain amount of unemployment, much more than was admitted until the last census returns were published. I hold that even the figures given in these latest returns do not represent the total of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The question for the Seanad and for the Oireachtas is whether we are going to face up to the problem that is before us or whether we are going to sit down and blindly let things drag on until other forces that some will condemn and others approve of will take steps to set up decent ordered Government.  Senators come here and have to listen to abuse and attacks of all sorts.  Are they responsible representatives of the people or are they not?  Are they going to take steps to find out what the situation is and how it can be met before it is too late? I say that the social problem begins and ends with the economic problem here and that it will have its political reactions irrespective of what any one may say unless we deal with it. For that reason I make this appeal to the Seanad to vote for this motion, to have a joint Committee of the Oireachtas set up which will investigate the whole problem.  If we are <Col N="1864" /> not competent to set up a Committee to deal with that then we are not competent to sit here as governors of the country.</P>

      <P>As a layman in financial matters, I should like to ask Senator Connolly a question.  The banks may or may not be as black as they are painted, but suppose we had our own gold standard here, when the crash came in England, what would Senator Connolly do, realising that the Argentine had no gold standard and that at the moment of the crash Denmark went off the gold standard?  Would the Senator insist on England sending us £1 for every sixteen shillings' worth of beef or bacon that we sent over, while they could get twenty shillings' worth of beef from the Argentine for their £1, or twenty shillings' worth of bacon, eggs or butter from Denmark for their £1?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to what Senator Connolly said, because I agree with him that this constitutes a very vital, a very serious and a very far-reaching issue.  One thing disappointed me very much &mdash; the absence of any suggestion or line of thought from Senator Connolly which would lead to a better or sounder system than that which at present prevails. He asks that a Committee of both Houses should be set up while, in his speech, nothing was so obvious as his utter disbelief in the capacity of the two Houses to arrive at a sane and reliable judgment on this subject.  I do not urge this criticism from a Party point of view.  I am completely non-Party in this matter.  I do not know what the attitude of the Government is on this motion.  I have not discussed it with any of my colleagues here or with a single member of the Government. As I looked for some intelligent direction from the proposer of the motion, so I look to the Minister for some intelligent direction when he comes to deal with this motion.  There is no question of the seriousness of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connolly brings before us a specific motion, his object being to construct a Committee to deal with <Col N="1865" /> this problem.  Our duty is to consider whether the construction of that Committee will lead us anywhere. If Senator Connolly is to be regarded as a guide in the matter, the setting up of this Committee is going to lead us nowhere.  In the opening portion of his speech, he seemed to suggest that the other House was only capable of discussing red herrings, and he seemed to have a very poor idea of anything that might emanate from members of this House.  That is the situation.  If that is the material that is to comprise the Senator's tribunal, what is the use of proceeding further with the motion? I shall be much disinclined to support Senator Connolly unless some of those who will probably speak in favour of this motion adduce much sounder reasons for this proposal and bring forward much more cogent evidence to convince me that the members of the Oireachtas are more competent to handle questions such as this than Senator Connolly thinks they are.  If I were to follow Senator Connolly's arguments and arrive at a conclusion based upon them, I should have to say that it would be absolutely useless to set up such a Committee as is proposed, because the members who would constitute it would be incompetent to deal with the matter.  However, that is not my own opinion as to the capacity of the members of the Oireachtas.  There are in this House members competent to deal with the weightiest matters that affect the nation.  Some of those who, from their vocations in life, should stand out as portion of the personnel of this Committee, would be the very persons whose presence on the Committee would be objected to by Senator Connolly.</P>

I am glad that he thinks that there are representative citizens in this Assembly &mdash;citizens whose function in ordinary life is to deal with matters of this <Col N="1866" /> kind&mdash;who are competent to give a wise and sound judgment on the issue he has raised.  I am glad to have that opinion recorded by Senator Connolly. But what is the object of this motion? Is it not an attempt to create an atmosphere of panic in the country and to suggest that we are up against a crisis which will mean imminent destruction if we do not grasp at any kind of solution?  The whole tenor of the Senator's speech gave that impression. He said, I think, that the only thing we could do was to nurse a sickly subject out of a dangerous dilemma.  That gives a very melancholy impression of the situation.</P>

      <P>I beg to differ from Senator Connolly.  I think the situation is not one that calls for panic solution.  I think there are no grounds whatever for an iota of panic.  That is my opinion, despite our difficulties, and they are many.  These difficulties have not been diminished by the Party to which Senator Connolly is attached. I do not want to say anything of those difficulties lest I should give a tinge of Party politics to this discussion. Senators may smile if they like, but in spite of the difficulties we have had to face, the economic position of this State is outstandingly sound. Outside the country, the Free State is regarded as a sound field of investment. It is surprisingly so when compared with many other countries. Were it not for these persistent, periodic disturbances that scare credit, I venture to say that in a very short time this field of investment would be regarded as the soundest in the world. I am not under any great obligations to the banking system.  My bank balance has never been very great.  I only wish it were.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the relevancy of Senator Colonel Moore's remarks.  If we are to face this question of national finance with a desire to evolve a better system and to secure the co-operation of those institutions responsible for the present <Col N="1867" /> system, I think it is a fatal mistake to approach those institutions in a spirit of hostility or to regard them as something that must be brushed aside before we can hope to make any progress. One would imagine that this banking system had been planted in the State by alien and hostile forces instead of being, as it is, the outgrowth of tradition, varied to meet the requirements of generations; it is more the outcome of circumstances than the direct creation of any set of individuals.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the banking system, as we know it, is not confined to Britain or to the Free State, that it is a world-wide system.  Due to our geographical association and our long, historic connection with Britain, the British banking influence has been a powerful influence here, but I am speaking not of banking influence but of the banking system, which has grown up and adapted itself to the changing needs of generations in every country.  It may be&mdash;I think it is the case&mdash;that the present basis of that system will have to be changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am singularly ignorant on that point, but I think that before you discard one system you should have another prepared to take its place.  The fundamental difficulty was not dealt with by Senator Connolly. It is not so much a question of a gold or sterling basis but the more vital question of the volume of currency in circulation and the grounds on which its circulation is regulated. That is not the same as the question of the gold standard, although Senator Connolly seems to think it is.  I should like to indicate by way of simile what I mean.  Take a community of ten persons. They produce all that is necessary for their requirements.  The tokens that they exchange amongst themselves amount, say, to £5 per head per week. There would be, on that basis, £50 in circulation per week amongst that little community.  The amount of that currency <Col N="1868" /> is regulated simply by the requirements of the community and not by something lying in a cellar.  If that amount of currency is increased or decreased according to population, then that community will be able to purchase and consume its produce, but let us suppose that that community appoints one of its members to regulate the amount of the currency which will be circulated.  This person gets a brain-wave and decides that the currency should be regulated not by what the community requires but by the amount of a peculiar metal.  He lays down that in buying from and selling to some other community the amount of currency in this little community should be in accordance with the amount of this particular metal in stock.  If that amount allows only a circulation of, say, £40, instead of the £50 previously in circulation, what is going to happen?  There will be a surplus of some commodity on one side and on the other a certain section of that community will starve or, at all events, will not be able to keep up the former standard of living.</P>
      <P>It is not the gold standard that is the factor, though it is a sort of complexity. It has ceased to be the factor, in form at all events, in Great Britain, and still the question of the amount of currency in circulation remains.  No new criterion has been brought forward here upon which to establish the amount of currency in circulation.  If you are going to arrive at the system at which Senator Connolly hopes to arrive&mdash;a system which will be influenced by the Christian view&mdash;some plan will have to be devised by which the amount of currency in circulation will be adequate to the requirements of the community.</P>
      <P>I listened very carefully to ascertain whether Senator Connolly would bring any view of that nature to bear upon the subject.  He gave certain lines of reference, but he made no attempt to deal with the matter to which I have drawn attention.  I am sorry he made such a poor case for his resolution, because I looked forward with real interest to his statement.  I have great respect for Senator Connolly's judgment in these matters, and I am sorry that he was such a disappointment in this case.</P>

      <P>The speech of Senator Milroy was a very good argument in favour of Senator Connolly's motion, about which I feel very strongly and which I am going to support. I belong to a profession which is proverbially ignorant of financial matters.  The fog of finance is much greater at times than the fog of war. It is not the pound or the position of the pound that we have to examine. It is the whole financial situation of the world.  I feel that a strong Joint Committee, which would inquire into this question, would result in a feeling of security and confidence throughout the country.</P>

      <P>After Senator Milroy's speech, I think it is necessary to ask Senators to read the motion on the Paper.  They will note that it does not purport to provide a policy; it suggests inquiry into the desirability of a change of policy.  In this connection, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the report of the Banking Commission.  Senator Jameson, I am sure, will confirm what I am going to say.  There was, I think, never any intention on the part of the Banking Commission that what they recommended should continue as the permanent state of affairs.  Right through the report of the Commission the inviolability of sterling is assumed. Sterling was the immovable rock and, because of its immobility, the Commission recommended that Irish currency should be attached to sterling.  Every paragraph of the report of the Banking Commission indicates that &ldquo;for the present&rdquo; a certain thing should happen and that &ldquo;for the present&rdquo; another thing should not happen.  It is indicated, time and again in the report, that the recommendations made, which were ultimately adopted, were tentative and temporary and subject to re-examination within a reasonably short period. In fact, one of the members of the Commission, in a minority report, pointed out that, after a period of five years of smooth working, further inquiries should be made on the question of setting up a central bank.  Five years have not yet elapsed, but surely the circumstances of the last two or <Col N="1870" /> three months make it reasonable that we should not wait for five years before further inquiry is made in accorddance with that particular member's recommendation.  Take the majority report of the Commission (paragraph 5).  It states: &ldquo;To put our first and fundamental conclusion into plainer language, we may say that, in our opinion, whatever is done here should be done in such a way as to avoid, for the present, any serious breach with the currency, banking and trading system of Great Britain.&rdquo;  Senators will notice the words &ldquo;for the present.&rdquo;  Paragraph 22, headed &ldquo;The Irish Pound,&rdquo; states: &ldquo;Ultimately, when the time is propitious and when the gold standard has been definitely restored in Great Britain, the actual coinage of an Irish pound sterling... is to be desired.&rdquo; Of course, the gold standard may have been restored in a kind of way in Great Britain, but it is now off.  The indication there was that at some time in the near future Irish currency should be convertible into gold.  Paragraph 39 states: &ldquo;The question may, therefore, be asked whether the Saorstát ought not, in the reorganisation of its banking and currency system, to provide for the creation of a strong central banking institution....  The Commission has decided against recommending the establishment of any such organisation at the present moment, and for a variety of reasons.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quote those extracts simply to show that the system that was adopted, following the recommendations of the Banking Commission, was not, in the minds of the Commission, intended to be permanent and inviolable.  The Government indicated the possibility that at some date in the near future these recommendations would be re-reconsidered. It seems to me that Senator Connolly, in asking the House to approve this resolution, is making a request which is in conformity with the generally tentative note struck by the Banking Commission.  Surely there is justification for saying that circumstances have so changed as to justify a re-inquiry as to whether any alteration in the system that was adopted is desirable?  To do that would be quite in accord with the <Col N="1871" /> report of the Banking Commission. Senator Connolly may have his own views about banking and currency, but it seems to me that he deliberately and carefully avoided giving voice to those views because he wanted not to prejudice the decisions of the Committee which he proposes and to wait until information was gathered.  I think that that is a perfectly sound and reasonable view for the Senator to take.</P>
    <P>I, like Senator Milroy, confess to immense ignorance on this class of subject.  I know enough about it to realise how little I do know.  I have been reading some of the official documents published in recent times in regard to British banking, and also the Irish Banking Commission reports, and it seems to me that the people of the country ought to know more than is commonly known about the basis and practice of banking here.  How far the present system should be altered, if it can be altered, is a matter which ought to be considered not from the point of view of the banker so much as from the point of view of the public&mdash;the working class public, the trading public and the agricultural public.</P>
    <P>In my reading, for instance, I have been led to question the position of the banks in this country, which are fairly comparable with the position of the banks in England.  There has been a good deal of talk, and I suppose there will be a good deal more talk about profiteering, and from my reading I have come to wonder whether the greatest profiteers of all are not the bankers.  It seems to me that there is a greater public grievance against the banking system on the score of profiteering than there is against the private traders or any ordinary commercial institutions.  Perhaps those who can speak with knowledge of the practice of banking will disillusion me on the matter, but I am led to this conclusion, if I may call it so, although it is very tentative, by reading the Banking Commission's Report and the report on the practice of banking that is made in the Macmillan Report on Finance and Industry. One need not quote them in full because the Irish Banking Commission's <Col N="1872" /> Report fairly well confirms the report of the Macmillan Commission on this point.</P>
    <P>They explain for instance that the depositors in the banks, that is the actual customers who deposit their own money, actually new cash, may deposit, say, £1,000, and on the strength of long practice and long experience the banks are confident that not more than 10 or 11 per cent. of that will be called for at the same time.  Therefore they can play with 90 per cent., that is to say they can hand out by way of loans, advances, overdrafts, etc., nine times that which they have of other people's money to keep in reserve.  In other words they will pay, say 3 per cent. to the trader or farmer or householder who may deposit money, say £100, and they can let out nine or ten times that at 5 or 6 or 7 per cent.  Of course there are drawbacks, there are risks and all the rest of it, but that is the banker's side of the case.  So far as the public are concerned there is a pretty considerable margin for profiteering in the practice as I see it outlined and described in these Official Reports.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 34 of the Banking Commission Report describes the function of deposits.  It explains how the borrower &ldquo;goes to the bank with a request for accommodation and succeeds in discounting his own note there. This note may be secured or unsecured &mdash;whether the one or the other is not now in question.  It is, at all events, the vehicle upon which the bank moves to extend credit.  Suppose that the note is for £1,000 sterling advanced at ninety days, subject to an interest charge of 6 per cent. per annum. What is known as the proceeds of this loan will be £1,000 sterling, less the discount, or about £985 sterling, and that sum will usually be placed to the credit of the borrower subject to drawings by cheque.  This is a deposit of the modern variety.  It does not represent anything deposited or left with the bank, unless the customer's own discounted note, which serves as the basis of the loan, is to be so regarded. An &lsquo;overdraft&rsquo; would have given rise to the &lsquo;deposit&rsquo; in precisely the same way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1873" /> The Macmillan Report describes the same process with a further conclusion (par. 74) that &ldquo;the banks can carry on the process of lending, or purchasing investments, until such time as the credits created or investments purchased represent nine times the amount of the original deposit of £1,000 in cash.&rdquo;  Here the exact proportion differs from what I believe is English banking practice.  Even on that particular point there is a very good reason for an inquiry of such a nature as would go to illuminate these things for the public information, particularly these deposits which are merely book-keeping items representing money that has already been spent on the securities which are held against the deposits, also how far those have relation to the amount of currency in circulation.  I confess that I have no very definite opinions or views upon these questions but I am satisfied that there is very good reason for inquiry, for the public examination of witnesses and for a report of a body of people who are not acting solely as bankers dealing with the technicalities of banking.</P>
    <P>I think a commission which has only to deal with currency and banking from the point of view of the technique of the science is one thing, but some body is also required to give information to the public as to these banking institutions.  If it was only to reassure the public that they are getting a fair deal from the banking system it would be very well worth while.  I am not entirely satisfied that a Committee of both Houses is enough.  I think a commission of the kind indicated would probably be better if it were open to have included in it other members of the House, but that is a minor matter.  I think the report of the Banking Commission itself and the development of affairs in recent times make it very reasonable that there should be a new inquiry into the questions that are indicated in the motion of Senator Connolly, and that the House ought to support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Milroy in welcoming the motion at this particular time when so many <Col N="1874" /> other subjects are being discussed with heat, and will say that Senator Connolly has brought forward a motion of the greatest importance to-day.  I welcome his motion and his statement on behalf of the Party of which he is an adornment, that this country is fiscally absolutely independent, that it can of its own free will decide the best financial policy for itself.  That I believe to be absolutely true in so far as it is politically possible, and I am glad to have it emphasised in this House.  Having stated that I regard that we are absolutely independent politically, I am going to state that financially I do not believe we are independent, and the reason, to my mind, is, not as was stated by Senator Connolly, because of the decision of the Currency Commission to tie the Irish pound to the pound sterling, but because of the fact that 90 per cent. of our customers are in Great Britain. The real reason I rose to-day is not because I do not want to go into many of the issues involved.  I do not want to show my ignorance; I do not want to show my mind is not fully informed on many things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I want to point out that one of the greatest and most important factors, and one which we cannot ignore, is that our trade is over 90 per cent. with Great Britain, and so long as that is a fact, I suggest that no particular policy that would be adopted&mdash;that no Party in power could adopt a policy which would leave us high and dry of the financial crisis in the sister country. Although politically we have absolute power, in the financial sense we do not have it because of the close commercial associations.  If this state of things is to be changed at all it can only be changed after a long period when our trade can be built up in Europe and elsewhere, but I see no immediate prospect of that eventuality.  Reference was made to Denmark, and the fact that that country went off the gold standard.  I happened to be on a Dutch ship and was talking to a Dane.  I was on that ship when England went off the gold standard and it was very interesting, listening to the views of people of different nations.  I was interested in my Danish friend, and he stated quite frankly that the volume <Col N="1875" /> of trade done by his country with Great Britain was so great that they were not financially independent of England. Senator Johnson said that the Banking Commission did not make a report for all time, and I am sure we will agree. He stated that the Irish pound was tied to sterling because of their absolute belief in it.  I was not a member of that Commission, but Senator Jameson is here and he was.</P>
    <P>I have not read the Commission's Report for some years, but my recollection is that there is an emphasis on the trade between the two countries and the great inconvenience that would be caused by a difference in the two currencies.  I think Senator Staines really touched the real difficulty in this matter.  Supposing, for instance, that it had been possible that our policy had been different; supposing we had been on a different gold basis, on our own gold here, how long could we have retained it?  I do not know the answer to that question, but I do suggest that it would have been found that our trade was almost entirely with Great Britain.  No matter what our political views may be, and no matter how we express them, it would be absolutely foolish to ignore that fact.  The reason I do not propose to vote for the motion is not because I want to suggest that this is not an important question. I have no idea what the mind of the Minister is in the matter, nor have I any idea as to the mind of the bankers, but I think it is obvious that this question is giving them considerable concern, and will for some time be a matter of continuous inquiry and concern. The Senator's proposal is that we should in fact substitute for the present Currency Commission a Committee of the two Houses.  I honestly believe that this is not the best and wisest course.  Ultimately such policy must be decided by these Houses as to what the effect of a change in currency would amount to.  First of all, you have got to get a Committee or Commission&mdash;on the one hand, a certain number of experts, bankers or businessmen who have given their attention to this problem, and who would consider it apart from any Party issues.  It <Col N="1876" /> might be a splendid thing, and no one would welcome it more than I would if we reached a stage when a Committee of the two Houses could discuss a problem like this with no regard to party issues or prejudices, but I doubt if anyone thinks we can get a committee of members with individual views.</P>

      <P>The question at issue has occupied the minds of a great many people and has occupied the minds of the Senators since this motion was tabled.  I am against the motion and not in favour of it.  It is entirely unuseful, and I will give my reasons why the motion is not acceptable to me.  It is a motion amounting to lack of confidence in the ability of the Minister for Finance and the Currency Commission to protect the economic stability of the State.  Senator Connolly has disclaimed any deep knowledge of high finance; nevertheless, he makes it quite clear that he considers the Minister for Finance and the Currency Commissioners and the bankers as a class to be on the wrong road and likely to lead the country over the cliff or, at all events, he alleges that they are not taking the steps which they ought to take&mdash;in short, that he has no confidence in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For my part I do know, or at all events I assume, that the Minister for Finance and the Currency Commissioners have got a very great deal of knowledge, and I also know that they do their work in the limelight. Now a Committee of the two Houses would first have to educate themselves to deal with a subject of this kind. <Col N="1877" /> If you had a Committee representative of both Houses in the general sense of the word, it would involve people who would not be experts at all.  They would first have to educate themselves before they would be able to deal with the problem.  At the end of the time the question would be: Would the Committee be better than the Minister for Finance and the Currency Commission? I therefore think that the Senator has no reason to exhibit such a lack of confidence in those persons. If the Seanad passes this motion, I think it would look as if this House had grave doubts that the national interests were not being adequately looked after.  It would tend to create a general lack of confidence, and I would personally consider it a great waste of time.  It would tend to do harm rather than good.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I ought to say anything at all because I was on the Banking Commission and I happen to belong to the profession of banking which Senator Connolly considers disgracefully managed at the present time.  Listening to the whole debate, I have been trying hard to see what the difficulties of this motion had behind it.  Senator Connolly rather bothered me because I could not make out whether he wanted the Free State to be on the gold standard or not.  He mentioned that he believed we would be better if we had never got on the gold standard. Now when he tells us that the Free State should have gold in its coffers to be able to say that we were going to remain on the gold standard for our pound when Great Britain went off it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I do think that when we claimed to be on the gold standard there was only one way of having it, and that was to have gold.  Let me set the mind of the Senator at rest at once.  I stated here that I was not a believer in the gold standard, and everything I have seen since has justified this belief.  You had no gold when you pretended to be on a gold basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's view is that we are off the gold standard because we have no gold.  If we are following Great Britain by going off the gold standard, he says we are doing right.  The question of whether we are to remain on the gold standard is really not what the Currency Commission said at all.  What they did say was that the countries were so tied together that we should be tied to sterling, and that we dare not have a rate of exchange between Great Britain and the Free State.  At present we are having many difficulties with every country that is staying on the gold standard.  If the Free State were on the gold standard to-day, and Great Britain had left the gold standard, the trade between the two countries would be in such a position that we would lose an immense amount of money.  If anyone wanted at the present moment to send money to America or Canada they would have to find what the rate of exchange was in either country, and if that applied to the whole of the trade between Great Britain and Ireland anyone could see that if we had not a parity of exchange between Great Britain and Ireland our business transactions could hardly be carried out at all, and it would mean a tax on the country that would be perfectly unbearable. That is the real reason why we said it is necessary that our pound should be based on the pound sterling. As regards a lot of remarks that Senator Connolly made, it showed undoubtedly he had no confidence in our Currency Commission, our Finance Minister, or our bankers.  You know it is quite easy to get up and abuse people and things, but I doubt very much if the ordinary population of the Free State entertain these views.  I have been banking in this country for over forty years, and moving about amongst the people, and have never found that they consider we are a rapacious lot of people or profiteers, as one Senator thinks we are.  We attend to our customers' requirements and generally try to meet them.  I think the ordinary belief is that we are ordinary Irishmen who manage our affairs <Col N="1879" /> to the best of our ability and do the best we can.  As to the appointment of committees recommended under this resolution, and that they should be brought into being at the present time, when the whole financial system of the world is in a state of liquidity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I assure you that the people who are connected with finance at the present moment are studying and watching the problem and have the most difficult situations to solve day by day, and to think any committee of our would consider what is the best thing to be done at the moment seems to be absolutely impossible. Another thing is that part of the resolution deals with the question of depositors. Suppose a Committee of both Houses make a pronouncement that, in the opinion of a majority of the House, there is such a condition of affairs in the banking world that the depositors are not safe and that it is necessary for a Committee of the two Houses to look into the securities behind them, and they are going to protect the interests of the depositors of Ireland.  If you once get that proposition put before the country, and if the depositors really think there is no assurance that their money is safe you will have no difficulty in disposing of the banking problem.</P>

Further, at the present moment, there is such a state of affairs in the financial world that no set of men can work on any sound conclusion as to what is right to be done.  It would not be judicious at the moment and would serve no very great purpose to appoint a Committee of both Houses.</P>

      <P>The Senator believes that we are in a bad condition, but he does not produce any arguments to show that we are in a bad condition. He does not say what sort of soup we are in either.  Even if we are in the <Col N="1881" /> soup, Senator Connolly has offered no suggestion as to how we are to get out of it.  Without some useful suggestion as to how we can better our position, I think the Seanad would be very wrong to adopt a resolution like this. As Senator Bagwell has put it, the motion amounts to an expression of no faith in our Minister for Finance who has conducted our financial affairs for several years in a manner that has brought the credit of the Free State, so to speak, up to the top of the tree. As far as the Currency Commission is concerned, I may say that I have never met a more sensible body of men.  I know they are working day by day and they are watching affairs very closely.  Of course they could not control the condition of things in England.</P>

      <P>If in this country we had attempted to do anything other than what we did do we would have been wrong and we would have done a great injury to the Free State.

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">

      <P>Ever since I came into the Seanad Senator Jameson has always considered it inopportune to do anything at all other than exactly what the Minister likes us to do.  He always tells us that the time is inopportune and we should wait for some other time.  The reason I would like to have this motion adopted is because I disagree with the Minister's policy of keeping everything in the dark and doing things behind people's backs.  I disagree with the policy of handing over money to Britain without telling anybody; keeping the whole thing secret for months, and then coming forward to tell us that it has been done and that we can do no more.  I think all these things ought to be made known to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable to have some Committee set up.  The public knows nothing about what is going on, and it is only right that they should be informed.  It is only right that they should be told what remedies can be introduced, if any.  Senator Jameson objects to the <Col N="1882" /> remark about being in the soup.  The Senator must admit that everybody in England and America admits that they, too, are in the soup.  He says we are not in the soup at all.  I do not know how he can say that, because the fact is that we are bound up with other countries that are in the soup, and if we are bound up with them and they are in the soup, well, it stands to reason that we also are in the soup. All these matters should be made public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Connolly must be very highly complimented by the discussion that has taken place, because I do not think his motion merited being taken so seriously as it has been taken.  The vagueness and the indefiniteness of his remarks were not due to any lack of power to express himself; they were due simply to the fact that he has not really a definite idea in his head about this matter.  His only hope is to have a committee set up, of which, presumably, he would be a member and on which he would have further opportunities of talking in a pompous and vague way about matters that he does not understand.  For the purposes of any inquiry that might be necessary, I do not think you could get a worse body than a committee composed of members of the two Houses of the Oireachtas. Such a committee would have to be formed, and would be inevitably formed, on a political basis. You might have one or two members who would have special qualifications for considering the matter, but you might not find such members appointed; they might be ousted by the Senator Connollys, who would wish to get on the committee so as to have an opportunity of a little advertisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might easily happen, if a Committee of members of the two Houses were appointed, that the few people who had special qualifications for dealing with the question would not be selected.  Even if they were put on the Committee they would be completely swamped by members who would not have any ideas, who would not have given any thought and who could not find time to give the necessary thought to the matter.  I am quite satisfied <Col N="1883" /> that some of the terms of reference could not be carried out even if you had such a committee as has been suggested. I am quite certain that numbers of people would refuse, and would rightly refuse, to give evidence before what would be, to some extent, a committee of busybodies.  You will always find that the people who volunteer for such committees will be busybodies who have no qualifications and who will not be prepared to put any solid work into the matters that are placed before them for consideration. In any case, such a committee could not possibly conduct a satisfactory or a useful examination.  Such a committee would spend hours, and perhaps weeks, according to circumstances, on desultory and useless deliberation and nothing would emerge from their sittings.</P>
    <P>All the problems affecting currency and the financial position of the State in general are, as some Senators have stated, being reviewed from week to week by the Currency Commission.  It seems to me, if we are to have only our own citizens considering the matter, that it would be impossible to get a better constituted body than the Currency Commission.  It consists of an independent whole-time chairman, a very capable and well-qualified man, who is giving his constant attention to matters of this kind; he has, in fact, for years been devoting his attention to such matters.  In addition to the chairman, we have the secretary of the Department of Finance, who has many sources of information at his disposal and whose work brings him daily in contact with these problems.  Next we have two business men from the City of Dublin, one in ordinary commercial business and the other in a business which has a close relation to our great fundamental industry, agriculture. Along with these, we have three representatives of the Irish banks.  If we wanted a committee to consider financial matters I do not think it would be possible to get a committee more soundly constituted, and I do not think it would be possible to strengthen such a committee in any way other than by bringing in outsiders. <Col N="1884" /> If the Currency Commission desires at any time to have outside advice it can get it.  If there is any question of expense involved no difficulty will be placed in the way of the Commission getting any additional assistance it requires.</P>
    <P>This discussion seems to me to have gone a little outside the scope of the motion set down by Senator Connolly, because the motion does not seem to me to relate practically to the question of the gold standard.  The Senator dwelt upon the decision of the British Government to abandon the gold basis, and he spent a good deal of his time talking about the gold standard. Some of the matters in regard to which he took a wrong view have been set right by other Senators.  It was made quite clear that the decision to tie the pound to sterling was made because of the close trade and other relations between the two countries, and not because sterling was based on gold. The Senator quoted certain remarks of mine.  I see no reason to modify those remarks.  I think there would have been no sense in our getting gold.  It was evident for a week or two before the British came off gold that they were very likely to come off it, and the Currency Commission considered whether or not they would purchase gold.  They could easily have done so, but they decided, and rightly decided, not to have it.  If we had large quantities of gold we would have been forced off it, as Senator Staines and others have pointed out.</P>
    <P>The trading relations between this country and Great Britain would have made it impossible for us, if we were to have any regard for the economic interests of the country, to remain on a gold standard if Britain went off it. We would have had our gold stored in a bank, or somewhere else with soldiers guarding it, and it would be really of no use to us.  There are very evident reasons why in a country like this, and trading conditions being as they are, we should remain on a parity with the pound in Britain.  If, when the British went off gold, we arranged to remain on a gold basis, we would immediately raise a tariff against ourselves in the British market.  The Danes were <Col N="1885" /> forced to go off gold.  If we remained on a gold basis we would have great difficulty in maintaining our place in the British market.  We could not possibly maintain our position there if we raised what would be in effect a tariff against ourselves.  You also have to consider the position of people living here who receive incomes from England.  People who get £100 a year would be getting less because of the exchange in this country.  You would have these people, who receive incomes from outside and spend them here, leaving the country, just as you had English people returning from France when the exchange went against them there.  The fact is that considerable loss would be sustained.</P>
    <P>You would also have to consider the position of bank investments.  The banks have no option in present circumstances&mdash;whatever may happen in ten, fifteen, or twenty years&mdash;but to place a very large proportion of their resources in British securities; there are no other securities available for them.  They must, in order to earn income so as to keep going and to have a sufficient proportion of their assets in a reasonably liquid form, invest in British securities.  If we clung to the gold standard the greatest confusion would be created in the banking system, and you would have, I think, panics resulting.  At any time, when, for instance, the pound was becoming steadily more valuable during the period of the price fall, if we attempted to stabilise prices, and if we decided to go off the gold standard when the British were on the gold standard, great losses would have ensued.  Undoubtedly any suggestion that we would go off the gold standard, and that we were going on to an arbitrary paper currency when the British were on the gold standard, would have meant a flight of the deposits in our banks; it would have meant a flight of capital from the country that would not be recovered for a very long time indeed.  You would not have an influx of people to live here because of cheapness.</P>
    <P>In a new State, and particularly in a State with all the difficulties that surround us here, nobody would believe <Col N="1886" /> that a proper currency could remain at any stable level.  I believe it would be impossible for a State like ours, with all the difficulties that surround us and with the inexperience of our people in the responsibility of government, to maintain and work an arbitrary paper currency.  I do not know whether any Government can do it for long.  Most people say that the only advantage of the gold standard is that it does not put the strain on Governments that a purely paper currency would put on them; that there are few Governments that could withstand the temptation to get out of their difficulties by putting the printing presses to work.  It is fairly clear to anybody that there would be great difficulties arising for the country if we detached from the British pound; it is clear that great losses would follow.  If we had reason to believe that the British pound was going to follow the mark, there would then be a situation which would have to be met, however difficult it might be.</P>

      <P>I do not think I need deal with the great variety of points that have been raised.  The whole position of the currency and the finances of the country are under constant review.  They are under review by a body which is, I think, the strongest body that could be established here.  It is the most representative and the most competent body that could be established.  No good could follow the appointment of a joint committee such as is suggested by Senator Connolly.  It is not the business of the Oireachtas to appoint a committee to write an elementary treatise on banking&mdash;something such as Senator Johnson might desire.  It is not their business to explain some of these matters that trouble Senators. The people who will explain these matters are economists.  The Senator can buy lots of books on banking and, if he will study them, he will get as much enlightenment as he would get if he were <i>vis-a-vis</i> Senator Connolly <Col N="1887" /> arguing for weeks about the currency position in this country.</P>
      <P>I do not want to say that the banks here are perfect or that the banking system is perfect.  I would like to say that in the criticism of the banking system here that there is a great deal of humbug.  Senator Jameson pointed out that the banks work with the money of their customers.  They lend out the money of their customers and are under an obligation to return the money to them on demand or after specified notice.  They cannot deal with that money as if it were some spare money of their own that they could throw around any way they liked, that it would not matter whether they lost it or not.  A great many people who complain about the banks are really incompetent business men whose difficulties are due frequently to their own faults.  Any one who is in politics must have had some experience of that.  Frequently I have had people coming to me complaining that the banks would not give them credit, and on occasion I have the case of a young man beginning something to whom it did seem to me the banks might have been a little bit more generous, a young man who had not yet established himself but who seemed likely to make good. Occasionally I have thought that the banks could have stretched a point for him, but in the main the complaints I have heard were from people who had let their business go to rack and ruin through incompetence or want of brains, through betting on horses or through drink or playing too much golf or doing anything but what they ought to have done.  Then they get terribly annoyed because the banks will not give them the money of decent hard-working people to throw it into the abyss after what they have already lost themselves.</P>

      <P>Following up on the note on which the Minister has just finished, I would like to segregate in the minds of Senators the difference between the system that I am attacking and the bankers.  I happen to be one of the unfortunate people that the banks were too kind to, and I have <Col N="1888" /> been suffering ever since for that. That is a matter of individual experience and has got nothing whatever to do with the fundamental principle that we are discussing.  I am surprised at a man of the Minister's experience bringing in such a trivial point.</P>
      <P>I propose to deal with the points that were raised in the order in which they came up.  Senator Staines asked what we would have done if we had the gold standard.  It will be remembered, as was explained by Senator Johnson, that what I argued for was a Committee. I have very definite views on a number of problems that arise in connection with finance, banking, the gold basis and the rest.  I think there is ample justification in asking for this Joint Committee.  There is one thing that might have been possible arising out of the various speeches that we have had on these economic issues in connection with finance and banking, namely, that there would have been a wider distribution of the assets of the country both by the Currency Commission and the bankers themselves.  If we assume that we had a purchasing power and credit on U.S.A. exchange, in the French market and in Amsterdam, is anyone going to tell me that both the Currency Commission and the bankers would not be in a much better position than they are in to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know one distinguished banker in this city who holds the view that the only hope for this country is to get out of British securities and into something else.  The Minister for Finance has not attempted to answer the question that I put to him as to what the Currency Commission had done under the amending Act that was passed last November. Why was that Act passed, and was any use made of it?  Was the introduction of that measure symptomatic of the fact that the Currency Commission was uneasy in its mind that British securities were not as good as they thought they would have been? The Minister talked about approaching this in a pompous way.  I did not approach it in a pompous way.  I put all my cards on the table, and I now state my belief that the Minister who made the statement last November that I have quoted is not fit to be <Col N="1889" /> Minister for Finance.  Senator Milroy gave a simple analysis of the Douglas theory of social credit.  I am not going to enter into that.  I will leave it to Senator Jameson to study calmly the Douglas theory.  There are all sorts of problems involved in this issue.  I am not going to be dogmatic.  It is only a fool who would be dogmatic on it.  I leave all the pomposities to the Minister and his colleagues.  I am not going to be pompous, but one can surely approach the question from the broad, human, national point of view.  The pomposities belong to the Minister and his friends.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see Senator Sir William Hickie, like a lot of other lay intelligent people, had apparently woken up to some of the realities of the situation. The only people who are hardboiled and tough in the hide in the environment into which they have got are, as we know, the people operating the machine and getting the benefit out of it.  They are afraid to think in new terms, but they are going to have to think in new terms.  They will be forced to do it because of the play of external circumstances, even if they will not do it in this House.  Senator Douglas referred to the fact that we are physically independent.  No member of our Party ever disputed that. What we do complain about is that our physical independence was not availed of.  Our people have the power to be economically independent as regards the financial basis of credit and the creation of credit in foreign countries, but that has not been availed of.  What happened here was that those in authority carried on slavishly in the old routine, and to-day we are in exactly the position we were in in 1910, 1912, and 1914 from the economic and financial point of view.</P>
    <P>I defy the Minister for Finance to say that there is any fundamental difference between the machine as it exists to-day and as it was when it was administered by the British Government. We have been told about our export trade with England, that we were sending to her produce to the value of thirty millions per annum. That is simply one side of the story, as if we were buying nothing in return. What about the eleven and a half millions of an import balance against us? <Col N="1890" /> Senators should waken up to that. They talk as if this export trade were a benefit to us.  What about the balance of trade that is against us? The pound has gone down to sixteen shillings so that we have lost four shillings on every pound on the adverse balance that operates against this country.  The Minister for Finance may try to throw a smoke-screen over that, but the facts are there.</P>
    <P>A good deal of criticism has been offered as regards the possibility of a Joint Committee of both Houses doing anything useful in connection with this.  From what I have seen of the Seanad, I have not any higher appreciation of its capacity or competence than anybody else, but it is only when it suits their purpose that this argument is put forward by Ministers.  The argument is then advanced that members of the House are not fit to make up their minds on a question like this. We have had experts on this question. The Minister's advice is to have more experts.  We have shown that the experts were all wrong.  They have been wrong not only as regards this country but other countries, yet the Minister's advice is to have more experts.  What about the Macmillan Report and the Report of our own Currency Commission that were prepared by experts, as well as statements by Ministers in this House made on the advice of experts? I say that no case has been made nor could a case be made against the motion that I have moved.  I do not say that in any pompous way.  I say it from my heart.  I am really tired of listening to all that kind of tripe.</P>
    <P>Senator Bagwell talked about this motion being a vote of no confidence in the Minister.  Of course it is.  If the advice that we had been given in this House had been acted on, and if an intelligent interest had been taken in the position of this country, instead of the present position we would have had something in this ratio to-day: 25 per cent. of our money in British securities, 25 per cent. in U.S.A. securities, and 25 per cent. in Parisian or other securities.  We would not have had all our eggs in the one basket as we have to-day.  In the Agricultural Credit Corporation that had to be floated in this country there was an <Col N="1891" /> available place in which to put some of our money.  It is hard to understand the psychology of the banking system here, whereby we invest seven millions of our money outside the country instead of putting it into one of our own organisations.  All that is due, I believe, to the tradition of playing the bankers' game.  When I speak of the bankers' game I mean the bankers' unconscious game, because there are only about three of these men in this country who understand the machine they are operating.  If they did understand it the institutions with which they are connected would have made a huge pot of money out of this, because if they had operated it properly we could now be an importing medium for goods from America and Great Britain.  We had the power to be that, but instead we are sinking to the extent of four or five shillings in the pound.  Whether Senators believe it or not, in my opinion the pound will be stabilised at a lower rate than it is to-day.</P>
    <P>Senator Jameson referred to my attitude about the gold standard.  I have tried to keep him right on that.  I am not a believer in the gold standard. When the Currency (Amendment) Bill was before the House what I did object to was the Minister for Finance trying to put over on us&mdash;he did it successfully&mdash;that we were on the gold basis when we were really on nothing of the sort.  Even to-day he will not admit that we are not on a gold basis.  His statement then was not true.  Even in November, 1930, we were not on the gold basis, and the result is that our currency to-day has suffered to the extent of four shillings per nominal pound.  If the Minister had £3,500,000 of that money bought into dollars at that time it would not have depreciated to the extent that it has.  Is that a fact, or is it not?</P>

Senator Jameson thinks that this is the worst time that you could select to make any changes, <Col N="1892" /> and that members of both Houses are not the people to do it.  Well, I am willing to admit that.  Will Senator Jameson tell us who are the people who are going to guide us?  What is responsible government?  Is it a dictator, a Soviet, or what?  Will the Senator tell us what form of government he wants, and what the functions of government are?  We will be less happy in this country if sterling goes any lower.  Senator Jameson may be able to suggest some Heaven-sent Moses who will take us out of the wilderness that he and his friends have put us in.  The Minister stated that there was no alternative to British securities.  That means, I take it, that there was no alternative to the system of working through British finance and the orthodox method.  If that is the case, and that there is no real alternative, what is the sense in having the Currency Commission, what is the sense in having a note issue, and what is the sense in trying to deceive people that there is some purpose in currency and in notes?</P>

I submit that we have put our argument before the House and that we have a perfectly good case for an investigation by a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas.  I am willing to hear any alternative suggestion as regards a Committee or a Commission, but I submit the position is such that it demands immediate attention.  I see no alternative, except the one I have pointed out, in this alleged democratic country with its elected representatives. I feel it is their responsibility and their duty, and I ask the House to consider the motion from that point of view with the object of ensuring that the very most that can be made out of the circumstances will be made, and <Col N="1893" /> that the very minimum of loss may ensue.</P>

      <P>There has been introduced in the Dáil to-day a Constitution (Amendment) Bill, which will be passed on Friday next.  I would urge the Seanad to meet without delay to consider that Bill. Senators are aware that there was grave disorder&mdash;in fact, a state of war &mdash;in this country in 1922 and early in 1923.  Afterwards, the situation gradually settled down.  There were many dumps of arms in the country, and there was kept going a sort of military organisation calling itself the I.R.A. That organisation was gradually becoming weaker, and finally, about 1926, the old I.R.A. organisation broke up and there was formed a much smaller organisation about which it was more difficult to obtain information.  That smaller organisation was responsible for the murder of the late Kevin O'Higgins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>After the murder, a Bill giving very strong powers to the Government was introduced.  The effect of that Bill was to keep the new organisation quiescent or in check.  About the year 1928, or perhaps 1929, the Government, because there was no overt action, no great appearance of danger, and as a result of political pressure in the Dáil, agreed to the repeal of the Public Safety Act.  The Public Safety Act was repealed and, within a month or two months of the repeal, we had attacks on jurors and on witnesses.</P>

      <P>We had these attacks on jurors and witnesses.  Previous to that, attempts had been made to intimidate jurors.  They were circularised and attacked.  Attempts were made to hold them up to obloquy for doing their duty.  In spite of this, jurors, generally speaking, did their duty.  There were miscarriages of justice but, generally speaking, when evidence was brought before jurors, they acted upon it and did their duty. But after these attacks&mdash;after the murder of one man and the wounding of another&mdash;the position became different.  We introduced the Juries Protection Act, and it had a certain effect, but, broadly speaking, it became impossible in any case of what was roughly termed a political character, in any case which affected the armed conspiracy against the representatives of the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

All the matters which are being raised by the Minister can be discussed on Friday.  The Cathaoirleach has decided to call the House together on Friday.  He says he has no option but to do that.  If he has no option in the matter, then we have no option but to attend.  Let us attend.  Let the Minister, or whoever represents the Executive Council, speak on Friday and give the reasons for requiring the Cathaoirleach to call the meeting for that day.  We can discuss it then.

If the House does not desire to hear him, then he should not be heard.  If the House desires to hear the Minister, any Senators who, not desiring to hear him, interrupt, are guilty of disorder.  I have powers to deal with disorder, and I shall exercise them.  Let me make the position perfectly clear.  The Vice-President is here to give an explanation.

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to make a statement showing why the Government consider it urgent.  The Juries Protection Bill was designed to secure a measure of immunity so as to enable a juror to do his duty without being molested, but that Bill could not be made sufficiently far-reaching to protect jurors.  Jurors have been unable to do their duty and many citizens who were on the jury list have approached the Government on the matter and have said that it was grossly unfair that cases of this sort, involving armed conspiracy, should be dealt with by the ordinary jury system. The jury system is all right for dealing with ordinary crimes such as murder or robbery.  That means a single individual who has only one or two associates, and when justice is meted out to him they are in no danger of revenge being taken upon them.  In dealing with armed conspiracy, a juryman was liable to be shot; he was liable to have pickets outside his house and attacks on his property, and they pointed out that it was impossible to expect a single civilian to stand up against an armed conspiracy. We hoped for a long time that we might be able to deal with this movement of conspiracy by means of the ordinary law.  Recently, within the last eight or nine months, it is quite impossible to maintain order in this country without taking the special powers we propose to take in that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last eight or nine months there has been a recrudescence of activity and an increase in the numbers of those connected with the conspiracy.  In the present year three murders as well as crimes of intimidation and attempted murder have <Col N="1900" /> been carried out.  Witnesses would be afraid to go into Court because the midnight visitor would come to them with a pistol in his hand.  Juries have been afraid or unable to convict because of the same reason.  While you have that conspiracy manifesting its character in the crimes committed you have youths in increasing numbers engaging in drilling parties and similar activities.  We know that drilling is only the prelude to violence of various kinds.  There are parts of the country at the present time where conditions are serious and we are quite satisfied from all the information we gather from police and other sources that if special powers are not taken by the Government, if those who are taking part in these movements are to have their immunity continued, we would, within a few months, have arrived at the condition in which we were in 1922 when there were armed individuals here and there throughout the country, and when there was no respect for the rights of the ordinary citizen, and when the only solution for the situation would be civil war.  In one way it is not serious because the numbers engaged are not very large.  It is not serious yet because they are a cowardly crew who can be dealt with and all that is wanted is for the hands of the ordinary peaceful citizen to be untied. We have means for bringing these people before a court that cannot be intimidated.</P>
    <P>If we give our police the powers which they have not got of stopping and questioning and requiring information it will help to solve the matter.  As it is at present if a crime is committed in Tipperary and a policeman meets any civilian and asks him a question as to his whereabouts and what he heard, he tells the policeman to go to the devil, and he has no remedy of any kind.  If he seize that man because of the terrorism that prevails he will himself be mulcted in damages for wrongful arrest.</P>
    <P>The position is that a handful of thugs, supported by a number of dupes and a number of rogues, have gradually built up an organisation which has become a public menace, and an organisation <Col N="1901" /> which cannot be dealt with by the ordinary machinery, because the ordinary machinery, so far as the civilian citizen who has to go to his lonely residence in the country is concerned, has fallen down.  The same thing applies to the juryman who has to go to his residence or business house.  We would require the powers to deal with it.  It is all very well to have Habeas Corpus and to have trial by jury if we insist upon maintaining those, but when we have to deal with a violent conspiracy then we have something which is contrary to the interests of the whole community.</P>
    <P>The real rise of this movement is due to the fact that during the last year or two a new element has come into the situation.  The new movement is definitely, I will not say Communist, but it is Communistic, and Communistic doctrines are being preached.  Many of the men at the head of the movement are men who have been in Russia and who, when they were there, received training in revolutionary methods.  We have these men with the new gospel coming in amongst the remnants of the old I.R.A., amongst remnants of people who are discontented because of misfortune or some other unhappy circumstances, and trying to link them all by the belief that they have only to apply the rule of the gun and that they can seize power in this country and dominate it.  This thing has been steadily getting worse, and the Government contemplated calling the Houses of the Oireachtas together to deal with it.  There were great difficulties in devising legislation that would meet the situation, and the legislation that has been devised has had to be of a drastic character to prevent it breaking in our hands.  The fact that we did not call the Oireachtas is no indication of our views of the matter. It is a situation easily dealt with if the powers are given&mdash;a situation that can easily get out of hand if they are withheld.</P>
    <P>There is nothing so gripping as terrorism.  The man who is terrorised is too proud to admit it, and human nature being weak, they begin to think that they might share in the spoils of some revolution that could be carried out.  We have had a revolution in this <Col N="1902" /> country, and there are lots of people in it who do not see why one revolution should not be followed by another. The Government believe it would be tragedy on the part of citizens if they did not give the Oireachtas the drastic powers by which the movement can be crushed.  There is one other manifestation of the new movement.  I have already told you that the attack on jurors began with letters and visits and ended up with bullets.  Visits to members of the Oireachtas began some time ago.  Since 1922 there was no interference with members of the Oireachtas. Now we have the thin end of the wedge and the beginning of this new attack on the liberties of the people, and it is because of that and in order to prevent any crime of violence being done, that we want to get the powers quickly, and we ask the Seanad to deal with this matter as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have all been rather mystified by the Minister's speech, the substance of which is peculiar and very unusual.  We are asked now to meet on Friday to pass a Bill the contents of which we do not know, but which, I understand, is to repeal four or five sections of the Constitution which were supposed to be sacred.  The first reason given for it is that when the I.R.A. organisation was dissolved in 1926 a similar organisation was then established, and that that similar organisation was responsible for the murder of Mr. Kevin O'Higgins.  This is the first time we have heard that piece of information. Of course it has been stated by the Minister without any proof.  I ask Senators to remember that in 1926, 1927, 1928 and 1929 a Public Safety Act was in operation and that Public Safety Act was allowed to lapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regrettable, the deplorable <Col N="1903" /> murder of Mr. Kevin O'Higgins several years ago is no reason for this drastic piece of panic legislation.  The Minister says that there is a conspiracy, a small, violent conspiracy.  It must be small, because until Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney started talking about it during the Summer Recess as a sort of holiday recreation, people seemed to know very little about that organisation. People know very little about it yet. I was in Ennis the other day, and I met two or three people.  The first asked me what was this about, and the second asked what it was about.  We do not know what it is all about except that a very violent Bill of this kind, if passed into law, would probably prevent a free, open, fair, constitutional contest in which the present Government would be defeated at the polls. The Minister intends to repress the people whom he has described.  Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney has raised a bogey. He means to crush the bogey.  What I regret is that there was not a word in the Minister's speech other than the word of repression and coercion.</P>
    <P>I am free to tell you in this House some of the conclusions that I have formed in the last three or four months. In this country there has been an increase in the population.  There are numbers of young men and young women growing up, twenty or thirty thousand of them.  They have no employment. There are a good many people in the country who have no food. There is undoubtedly discontent in the country&mdash;discontent at the want of employment. It is a discontent which will manifest itself, perhaps, in disturbance of one kind or another.  Instead of drawing the sword to cut down these men, your own countrymen, instead of using words of repression and instead of using measures of repression, it is the duty of the Ministers of the Executive Council&mdash;and this is a matter that should receive the serious consideration of the Seanad&mdash;to devise means whereby the discontent shall be allayed.  Before you introduce any measure of repression you should first introduce some measure whereby the young boys and girls of this country will get employment.  If they get employment <Col N="1904" /> there will be no room for the new theories that the Minister tells us are being so assiduously cultivated.</P>
    <P>We are not a Communistic people; we are an individualistic people; we are a Catholic people, and although there is great discontent, and although the hunger of the people may form a fertile soil for agitation, of this I am confident, that Communism will take no root in Ireland.  You will have to solve the problems of the poor, the problems of the people, on Irish lines and according to Irish ideas.  Instead of passing your coercion legislation you should vote three, four or five millions for the employment of the people during the coming winter months.  If you do that I think you will have very little danger of agitation, and you will have very little need for repressive measures.  Instead of putting boys to goal, instead of employing young lads to watch over other young lads and to shoot young fellows in this country, you should endeavour to give the people employment.  Be considerate towards the people&mdash;the agricultural workers and the town workers.  See that they get proper treatment, and reduce the extravagant expenditure of your Government.  If the expenses of this Government continue in the same way as they have continued for the last five or six years, you will have nothing in this country but discontent, hostility, opposition, repression, blood, murder. That is what you will have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move, as an amendment, that instead of Friday we meet on Monday.  The Minister gave some reasons why a Bill of this kind is necessary. I think we are not justified in discussing the merits of the Bill or the reasons for it.  The sole question we should consider is the necessity for urgency.  I think that if the Dáil passes a Bill which it deems to be urgent, this House is bound to take heed of what the Dáil sends to it; but let the House bear in mind that this is a Bill to amend the Constitution.  Let us assume it passes the Dáil on the Minister's assurance, the Dáil being obedient.  Let us assume that it passes the Dáil, as desired by the Minister, on Friday.  This House is then expected to receive a Constitution <Col N="1905" /> Amending Bill, consider it immediately and pass it into law by Saturday, in accordance with the motion that has been put into the hands of Senators O'Rourke and Wilson, presumably by the Minister.  If this House has any respect at all for its past constitutional acts, surely it is not going to be browbeaten into amending the Constitution in that fashion.  What urgency has been suggested?  The Minister speaks of things that have been developing during the last nine months.  He said that the conspiracy at this moment is not very great; there is nothing to fear.</P>

      <P>It is the severest possible condemnation.  This House, we are told, must pass a Constitution Amending Bill by Saturday afternoon. If it does not the Gárda Síochána and the Minister for Justice will not be able to maintain order for, say, three or four days longer.  That is the implication in the Minister's statement.  My suggestion is that the House should have at least time to consider what is in the Bill that will, it is assumed, have passed the Dáil, and from Friday evening until Monday is not a very long time to consider a Bill of such importance. It meets any reasonable demand there may be for urgency.  I say that if the House agrees to make an amendment of the Constitution of so radical a nature as is suggested, then you may as well say good-bye to Constitutions.  Constitutions are utterly useless if they can be played about with in that fashion.  It is desirable that we should be allowed some reasonable time to consider this important amendment of the Constitution, and I think in the circumstances my <Col N="1906" /> proposal to meet on Monday instead of on Friday should receive the sanction of the House.</P>

      <P>I wish to emphasise that in my opinion the Minister did commit himself to the statement that the position at the moment is not serious.  I do not believe it is serious. In his heart, apparently, the Minister does not believe it is serious.  There is absolutely no necessity for calling us together to discuss this measure next Friday.  What is the existing situation?  A Bill is introduced into the Dáil and nobody knows at the moment what will be the fate of that Bill in the Dáil.  The Executive Council apparently claim to be prophets as well as everything else, because they tell us that the Bill will be passed by the Dáil on Friday. We do not know what the Bill contains. Two Senators came here to-day contrary to the Standing Orders and they ask that the various stages of a Constitution Amending Bill be taken on Friday.  We do not know even yet whether or not they saw the Bill.  The Cathaoirleach has announced that in accordance with the pressure that was brought to bear upon him by the President of the Executive Council he had no alternative but to call the Seanad together on Friday.  The Minister attends the Seanad to make a <Col N="1907" /> statement here as to the urgency of the matter, but instead of stressing the question of urgency his statement is really in support of the Bill.  This proposal to leave the matter over until Monday is a perfectly reasonable one.  We have been placed in a ridiculous position by the Executive Council and we should hesitate to consider this Bill in a hasty manner.</P>
      <P>To put it in a nutshell, the main reason for the introduction of this measure is that some extra window-dressing is necessary for the coming election.  There must be dust thrown in the eyes of the people.  The smoke screen to which Senator Connolly has referred must be raised and the eyes of the populace must be taken off the failure of the existing Government to improve economic conditions. The threat of war which has prevailed in this country since 1921 must again be revived in order that the present Executive will be put back into power.  That is the position in a nutshell.  We are sending delegates to Geneva and, in fact, all over the world, professedly for the purpose of engendering an atmosphere of peace amongst the nations.  Here in our own small country with a population of a little over three millions our Executive Council is engaged in formulating measures affecting seriously the liberty of the subject and practically putting out of existence sections of the people at present disfranchised.  I will never endorse action of that sort and I ask the House to refuse to endorse it. Certain members of the Seanad are seldom here, but I will ask those who remain to express their contempt for the action of the present Executive. When this Bill comes before us, if it ever does, let us discuss it on its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnson seems to think&mdash;I gather this from one or two sentences I heard him utter&mdash;that the Executive Council and those who support them have a flair for tearing the Constitution to tatters because they have nothing else to do.  That is a very mistaken idea.  Senators have been asked to-day why there should be so much urgency over this Bill.  There is <Col N="1908" /> reason for urgency.  In this country there are certain people who defy the Constitution.  They have no regard for the rights and liberties of the people, a matter about which Senator O'Doherty is so much concerned, and their actions render the lives of the ordinary citizens in danger.  Senator Johnson asks why there should be any urgency and what would three or four days matter.  Possibly three or four days' expedition in matters of this sort may help to save some home from tragedy; it may help to save some lives that would be valuable to this State. All this discussion we have had to-day is simply an attempt to anticipate the debate which will take place next Friday. As far as I can judge, it does not emanate from any desire to maintain a peaceful and a calm atmosphere in the country.  The peace of the country is being seriously menaced, and it is necessary for the Government to take some action to safeguard lives and property.</P>
      <P>There are some people to whom the safety of the country is of little interest; there are people who appear to think that the best thing that could happen is for this State to go down in disaster.  We who stand for the State and who believe that the State is worth standing by are of the opinion that measures necessary for the safety of the State and of the citizens should be expedited.  Why should we defer this matter until Monday?  Every day in a serious crisis of this sort is a day gained in the interest not only of the present generation but of generations to come. A certain small section of this Assembly, is trying to degrade it and make it cheap.  Certain Senators are endeavouring to lessen the tone and the spirit that should animate the discussions in this Chamber.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to Senator Milroy, but really after hearing him I am not much wiser than I was before.  He talked about degrading this Assembly.  I think the whole procedure to-day has degraded this Assembly to a level that it had never reached before.  He also talked about anticipating information in Friday's debate.  I would remind him that that anticipation was precipitated <Col N="1909" /> by the Minister having to make an explanation which nobody wanted to hear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know what the explanation is.  I could make certain surmises why the thing is going to be rushed through on Friday, but I do not propose to do that.  There is one thing evident in this House, and it is that the Government, amongst the majority in this House, can claim a very considerable amount of blind voting&mdash;men who do not vote either by their consciences or anything else. At the opening of our proceedings we say a prayer, or at least the Clerk reads a prayer in which we speak of Peace, Justice, Truth, Religion and Piety.  Was there ever such a travesty where men vote blindly for anything and support what they know in their hearts is not true?  That is our experience of the damned hypocrisy of standing here and talking about peace, religion and piety.  The thing is nauseating. It is Assemblies like this and people acting like this that are causing trouble outside the country.  Senator Comyn referred to the economic position of the country in which the national position is involved.  Let them remove the Oath of Allegiance to the British Government, remove the representative of the King, and take away all those menaces that certain kinds of people will not conscientiously bow the knee to in this country. Let the free vote of a so-called free people establish their Parliaments and elect their representatives without these barriers and there will then be no danger of Communism. These barriers are being deliberately kept up to keep a certain junta in power.  There are certain malicious influences at work in this country that keep the present Executive where it is, and the sheep here come in to vote blindly for something that they do not know and have not seen.  That is the position, and no man in his heart in this House can deny it&mdash;not one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke to-day on a very important issue, an issue that I consider important <Col N="1910" /> and one that has been shirked by the Executive of this country.  This Bill is now offered as a smoke screen to cover over the failures of the Electricity Supply Board, of the Drumm battery, and of every other economic failure that they have made.  But the day of reckoning is coming.  Are we going to have it in a constitutional parliamentary way or deliberately to go out as <i>agents provocateurs</i> to provoke the people of the country into revolt? We stand for law and order, and we want disciplined Government.  We believe in majority rule.  The Ministry want to go to the country and they have got this smoke screen for electioneering propaganda.  They want to create in the country an atmosphere to return them to power for another five years.  In my judgment they have miscalculated this time.  No one in the country believes that the country is in the danger they say, and anything the Minister said to-day has not been backed up by any evidence.  Loose statements will not carry anywhere. They do not want members of the Seanad or the Dáil to have time to analyse or criticise the statements that will be made.  Does anyone think that between now and next Friday we will be able to challenge the statements that were sprung in the House to-day? The thing is a travesty on decency. This is government by a junta and a dictatorship.  They and they only are the possessors of truth.  I want to say that truth is at a very low ebb in this country, due to the lack of moral leadership and the example of lies given here and in the other House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>My memory goes back a good deal further than that of most people here.  The things that have been said by the Minister for Finance and by other Minister were said long ago in the British Parliament by the people over there who were dominating this country.  Every argument that was put up by Buckshot Forster and all those other people has been raked up now.  It is all the same story, but the answer always came from the Irish side then, just as it is coming from the Irish side now, that the first thing you must do is to put the people in a proper condition.  You must not starve them or turn them out of their houses on the roadside.  Then you will have peace in the country. That turned out to be true after years and years of discussion on these matters.  The same thing has arisen now.  This Government has reduced this country to a state of poverty by sending all our money out of the country and by mismanagement of every sort.  Even the railways are going to be torn up.  We were told the other day that the Drumm battery was going to settle that question, but no one believes that now because the railways, which would have been useful, are going to be torn up.  All these things are due to the mismanagement of the present Ministers.  Then you have the very bad behaviour of the Guards, the division of the Guards who are detectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone in the State knows perfectly well that this is all bluff and that the object of it is to intimidate and frighten the people of the country to get them votes.  We know how that was done before.  I happened to be in Tralee some years ago.  I was not a member of Fianna Fáil at the time.  I was asked to go there.  One of the Guards, an agent of the Government, came down and beat one of the people who was electioneering in <Col N="1912" /> such a way that the ground was all covered with blood.  It was all over his bed.  I went there to see him. That is what they are going to do now. They are going to do worse because they are going to appoint Military Courts with the power of life and death over the people and nobody is to be allowed to speak about that. The Press will not be allowed to publish the evidence.  What is going to happen is that you will have secret courts and secret punishments including death.  Does the Minister suppose that these things, trying men secretly and all the rest is going to reconcile the country to his Government?  Very far from it.  Every person who is tried in that way and shot in that way will become a hero in the country because everyone will say that he was unjustly tried and shot.  When we came in here to-day we found the whole place, around Kildare Street and inside, filled with policemen and soldiers. Such humbug and nonsense, all intended to frighten the people and to make a hullabaloo and good business for an election!  Senators and others who had no wish to be protected have found themselves with police, who are ordered to protect them against their own will.  All that, too, is for the same purpose of making a hullabaloo in the country.</P>
    <P>People who live in the country came to me in the last few days and said to me, &ldquo;Is it safe for us to go down the country?&rdquo;  I said of course it was, that this was only political propaganda. I said it was done before whenever there was an election to be held. There is no danger in this country.  In England and in America and in almost every other country there are hundreds of murders compared to the one in this country.  I believe it is stated that there were three political murders in the last three years and on the strength of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, it is suggested that for political purposes there were three, and I know of no others.  They may say that it was for <Col N="1913" /> political purposes people were shot, but as far as it is generally known and believed there were about three political murders in the last three years.  Military courts are to be set up with the power of life and death over the people because of these three murders compared to hundreds in England. No one is going to break up the Constitution in England because of a few murders here and there, ten and twenty times more than in this country.  The whole thing is bunkum from beginning to end.  In the whole of my life neither the British Government nor any other Government ever dared to have military courts with the power of life and death over the people.  The proposal that is now made by this Government was never made by any other people, not even by the most coercionist Government in England.  I do not believe that the people of the country are going to be humbugged.  The Minister gave one instance of the late Minister, Mr. O'Higgins, and on a supposition he made a statement as to how and by whom he had been shot.  This is the first time that any Minister or any Parliamentarian or any judge or anybody else ever made that suggestion. Very different suggestions have been made even as to what side had murdered him.  It is not by any means clear as to who did it or which side did it.  Many people think it was done by the other side.</P>

It is a shame and a sham from beginning to end, an attempt to bully and to frighten the country into voting for them at some election.  People come to me and ask that very question, and I tell them that it is only humbug. The Minister for Justice actually went so far as to go to the representative of an English paper and to make political statements to him accusing his fellow countrymen of being blackguards, liars, murderers and so on. All that was published in England to the detriment of this country, and all on the strength of three supposed murders.  Everything that we can do to stop this thing will be done.  Some time ago, when the Minister for Justice came to this House with a Bill not so strong as this one, I told him that it was going to do more harm than good.  He said that when the Bill was passed he would be able to settle up the whole country and make it all right.  He has not done so.  On the contrary, exactly what we told him has happened. According to the Ministers, the country is in a worse state now than it was at that time, and the same thing will happen now.</P>
