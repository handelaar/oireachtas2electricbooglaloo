      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 11, sub-section (1).  To delete all after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; in line 66 down to the end of paragraph (k) and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;owing to the number of existing licensed premises in the district in which the premises to which the application relates are situate an addition to the number of such licensed premises would unduly increase the number thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section to which this is a proposed amendment is that which specifies the grounds for refusing to give a certificate to premises in which betting business is to be carried on. Amongst other grounds, are the grounds set out under paragraph (k) of sub-section (1).  That provides that one ground of objection to granting a certificate to premises is that there are already enough of what I might call &ldquo;gambling shops&rdquo; in the immediate neighbourhood.  It is similar to the rule laid down in the case of a surplus of publichouses under the Licensing Acts.  Paragraph (k), as it at present stands in the Bill, reads: &ldquo;If the application is in respect of premises which are not registered premises at the time the application is made, that there are already an excessive number of registered premises in the district in which the premises to which the application relates are situate.&rdquo;  Before that objection can operate, there must be already an excess of registered premises. That ought not to be the case. <Col N="1384" /> It ought to be a good ground of objection that although there may not be an actual excess at present, if you add another you will have too many. My amendment provides for that.  It is really only a drafting amendment, because I take it the Minister would agree that a valid objection should lie if there were already enough registered premises, although there might not be an excessive number.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment, and I strongly support Senator Brown's proposal.  A tremendous amount of evil is being done in the country by the multiplicity of these betting shops.  I know dozens of cases in which respectable men hand over their wages to their wives, who are bitten with this betting craze, and who go down to the nearest betting-shop and spend both their time and their money there.  Anything which would limit the facilities for carrying on in this manner would be extremely beneficial, and I support the amendment strongly.  The only thing that can be said in favour of the multiplicity of these betting-shops&mdash;if it can be said in their favour&mdash;is that the Revenue derives a certain amount of profit from them.  That is a consideration which ought not to weigh with us. I think it is very detrimental that the Revenue should derive profit from demoralising the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The view we took in drafting this Bill was that this power which resides in the Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána, and ultimately in the court, should be used only in extreme cases.  Our view was&mdash;this point was indicated before the Joint Committee also&mdash;that numbers should be kept down, not by making it difficult to get licences, but by some graduated scheme of taxation.  We <Col N="1385" /> have been making inquiries with a view to amending the present flat rate of £20 per premises, and having&mdash;I do not want these figures to be taken as indicating considered amounts&mdash;£40 in Dublin, £30 in other centres and, perhaps, £20 in very small towns, as at present.  It was not possible to have these inquiries completed or to make any provision in regard to this matter in the present Finance Bill.  The view we have taken is that the desirable way of keeping the numbers of betting premises within bounds is by making taxation high enough to effect that. The reason we do not favour other means&mdash;except in extreme cases, where the numbers might become a positive nuisance&mdash;is that we do not want the property value of premises to be increased because of the licence.  We do not want a position to exist at all analogous to the position in relation to houses licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you conferred very rigid powers upon the police in regard to the refusal of licences, you might get a certain amount of sympathy with an offender who owned a house to which a licence attached.  It might be urged that there was a valuable property in the house because of the licence and of the difficulty that would be experienced in obtaining a new licence.  We do not want that position.  Our view on the original Bill was that premises should be licensed except there was some objection to the actual state of the premises.  At first we thought that the operation of competition and the need for making a livelihood would keep down numbers.  We have since come to the conclusion that while that operates to a certain extent it will not be sufficient, and that what ought to be done is to make the tax fairly high, so that unless there is plenty of business for a house no person will be anxious to have it licensed or to pay the licence fee.  We think that this is generally a better way than having some privileged person, who has got his premises licensed, enjoying a sort of monopoly and attaching to the licence a property value.  I think there is very little in the amendment, because it is my opinion that <Col N="1386" /> even if we adopted Senator Brown's wording it would be difficult, except in extreme cases, for the Gárda Síochána to refuse a licence.  It would be equally difficult for the District Justice to do other than support the Gárda Síochána.  If you take a small country town with one registered premises, it would be extremely difficult for the police, even though one house was sufficient for the area, to say that the person actually in business should enjoy a monopoly of that business in that particular town.  I am sure that the justice would be reluctant to come to that decision too.  There will not be, in practice, a lot of difference whether we adopt the wording of Senator Brown or the wording of the Bill as regards the granting or refusal of licences.  I prefer the form in the Bill, so that we shall not be giving the impression that it is a case of first come first served and that nobody else will get in.  To keep numbers down I would prefer to carry into operation the suggestion which was before the Joint Committee of having graduated scales of fees in different areas, the scales being sufficiently high to limit the number of houses which it would be possible to open and maintain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very valuable that we should get this statement from the Minister, not merely because it illuminates his mind on this amendment, but because it illuminates our mind in regard to his whole approach to this question.  Most Senators will have some knowledge of the position in regard to the licensing of publichouses for the sale of intoxicating liquor.  What is the explanation of the excessive number of places licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquor?  It is that the policy which the Minister has indicated as his policy in regard to betting shops was adopted for a period in this country in regard to licences for sale of intoxicants&mdash;the policy of giving licences to whomsoever applied, the idea being that, owing to competition, only the good houses would survive.  The effect of that policy in regard to the licensing of liquor shops was to establish a vested interest in <Col N="1387" /> the licence.  In fact, many of the evils of unlimited licences are fixed upon the country because of the carrying out of the policy which the Minister has indicated as determining his line of action on this Bill.  While there will be some restriction by way of graduated licensing fees, the Minister contemplates giving a licence to whomsoever applies.  Under other sections of the Bill, it is proposed to give freedom for publicity and advertising and advocacy of the practice of betting in those licensed shops.  What the result will be in a few years' time we can imagine.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider his whole attitude in the light of the possible results.  If the view is to be that applicants shall receive licences freely, and that the limit will be only that imposed by licensing fees, and if under other sections we allow freedom of advertising, I think the end is going to be a very terrible one for this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have wished that the Minister had accepted the amendment moved by Senator Brown. It is only necessary to read the sub-section which the Minister proposes to retain to see how reasonable is the proposal made by Senator Brown.  According to the Bill, the ground for refusal of a certificate of suitability of premises in paragraph (k) is as follows: &ldquo;If the application is in respect of premises which are not registered premises at the time the application is made, that there are already an excessive number of registered premises in the district in which the premises to which the application relates are situate.&rdquo; The ground there is that there are already too many licensed premises. Senator Brown wants to give the objector&mdash;the police officer&mdash;power to say that if another application is granted there will be too many.  In simple language, that is the meaning of the Senator's amendment.  There may be two betting shops in a particular area.  These two are enough, but they are not too many.  If a third licence is granted there will be too many.  In that state of affairs the <Col N="1388" /> Superintendent of police would not have a legal ground of objection under the Bill as it stands, but under Senator Brown's amendment he would.  He would be able to say: &ldquo;There are not too many licensed premises at present, but if another application is granted there will be too many.&rdquo;  Senator Brown's amendment is in accordance with legislative precedent.  It is in line with all the statutes that I know of in relation to the licensing of premises. The present section of the Bill runs counter to that idea.  I understand what is in the Minister's mind.  He thinks that these licences will be ephemeral things and that he will have power to destroy them.  He does not want to create a property in licences. He said that on Second Reading. Whatever the Minister may think, force of circumstances will create a property in the licences.  He cannot avoid that.  If I could agree that it would be possible to prevent the creation of a property in a licence, I would follow the Minister, but it is quite impossible.  We know something about the position in relation to other licences throughout the country, and I am satisfied that once you give a licence it is quite impossible to prevent the creation of a property in it.  The Minister says: &ldquo;I can withdraw a licence; there is no property in it; and I can grant a new licence.&rdquo;  It will be quite impossible to do that.  On the merits this amendment is justified and the opposition to it has no foundation in good sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion has strengthened the uneasiness I have always felt with regard to this betting shop policy.  We have listened to the legislative point of view as against the historical point of view, as explained by Senator Johnson, and we seem to have got into deeper and more difficult waters.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether he should not make a clean cut with this general betting-shop policy.  While admitting that betting has come to stay, I would ask him to look at the matter from another angle, and see whether he could not establish the &ldquo;tote&rdquo; in various centres, and cut out these betting shops altogether.  I <Col N="1389" /> suggest that he should consider whether he should not have a totalisator under proper control in these cities and cover betting on all races and all events which are now covered by the betting-shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will reconsider his attitude towards this amendment.  I am not at all certain that it is going to bring about what most of us would like but I think the wording is better than the wording in the Bill and will give increased discretion.  I find that amongst all sections of the community in Dublin&mdash;I do not know about the country districts&mdash;there is a very strong feeling that already there is an excessive number of betting shops.  It is not very long since the present Government had to bring in a Bill for the purpose of reducing the number of licensed premises for the sale of intoxicants, and I firmly believe that unless some steps are taken within the next year or two we shall have a demand for the reduction of the number of betting licences.  By that time, there will almost inevitably be a demand for compensation.  Although, theoretically, those of us who sit here to-day may be able to say that these people have no right to compensation because they were warned, by that time there will be an opinion formed which will lead to a demand for compensation which it will be impossible to resist completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Minister's point of view but what he is driving at, I think, will not be achieved by increased licences.  Increased licence fees for the City of Dublin will only, in the end, increase the amount of compensation to be claimed for that particular area if you have to have reductions.  A double licence fee in Dublin represents really only the same payment from the point of view of profits made as half a licence or possibly a quarter licence in a country town, so that, in relation to the amount of profit made, the increased licence fee, while probably desirable, will leave you where you were so far as the different areas are concerned. I am not sure that the amendment <Col N="1390" /> will bring about what we want.  There is a strong feeling&mdash;I do not mean amongst people who are opposed to betting but amongst people who recognise that betting exists and cannot be got rid of&mdash;that this opportunity should not be lost of finding some rough and ready method whereby a certain number of shops per head of the population in a district would be recognised as sufficient and that licences would not be sanctioned in addition to that number.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the figures but I should like to say that there has been no appreciable increase in the number of licences issued recently. There is not that great and progressive increase in the number that some people feared under the present system. I am satisfied, moreover, that if the present licence fees were, say, doubled&mdash;premises are always ceasing to be licensed premises and new premises are being opened&mdash;in Dublin we would substantially decrease the number. I do not oppose the amendment very strenuously because I do not think that in practice it would differ much from the wording of the Bill, but if Senator Brown's idea were adopted and there were a real limitation on the issue of licences, it would become more difficult, not only forcibly to close houses, but to increase the charges on houses. It would be alleged that there was a property in these houses and that we were trying to destroy the value of that property.  We have never heard, as people have heard in the case of licences for the sale of intoxicants, a plea made in betting cases for mercy on the ground that if there was a conviction it would reduce the value of the property from say, £1,200 to a considerably smaller figure.  A limitation along the lines that have been mentioned would make the whole question much more difficult.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 21 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;21.&mdash;Any person who writes, <Col N="1391" /> prints or publishes any advertisement or circular whereby it shall be made to appear that any registered proprietors of registered premises is willing to take bets relating to any race, contest, game or sport and circulates or permits to be circulated any such advertisement or circular outside of any registered premises shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this amendment is hardly in order on this Stage of the Bill.  To begin with it proposes more than a verbal change, and I think it is well outside the subject-matters that were left over for ocnsideration on the Report Stage. The Senator's amendment seems to me to go right through the whole Bill.  We discussed on Committee the schedule which included the Ready Money Football Betting Act in so far as it relates to advertising and circularising on football matches, but this amendment deals with advertising and circularising in regard to horse racing and every other kind of racing.  It does not even mention football betting.  As a matter of fact the amendment applies to the whole Bill, and, therefore, I submit it is not in order.</P>

      <P>Your point, Senator, seems to be that certain specified things were left over for the Report Stage.  That is not so.  The whole subject-matter of the Bill is open for discussion on the Report Stage, and Senator Johnson is quite in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that I think it would be desirable, for the purpose of discussing these amendments, if the House were to recommit the Bill?  It is almost essential, I think, that it should be discussed in a Committee rather than in a Report Stage manner.  I think that course ought to be agreeable to the House.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the motion for the recommittal of the Bill and for this reason: I do not quite understand the meaning of this new section.  I would like to know from Senator Johnson whether the proposed new section amounts to a general prohibition of advertising of betting houses.  I would also like to know, on the construction of the section, whether it would prevent the betting-man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>My intention was that the Bill should be recommitted only in regard to the proposed amendments, but for fear something might arise out of the discussion that would require perhaps some slight amendment in another section I think it would be better if the Bill as a whole were recommitted.  I do not intend to raise any questions other than those of which I have given notice.</P>
      <P>Question: &ldquo;That the Bill be recommitted&rdquo;&mdash;put and declared lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed new section is really intended to place the position of the betting houses in the position they would have been in were we only simply licensing places and persons instead of allowing them illegally to conduct their business on the streets.  The clearly expressed intention of the Minister, and I think of the Oireachtas, was that the change to be made was a change from street betting, where the practice could not be controlled, to the licensing of betting <Col N="1393" /> in houses where the practice could be controlled.  It was not designed to increase the number of bets with a view to assisting the Exchequer. I do not know whether the Minister intended that the change from unlicensed illegal betting to betting in a licensed house was intended to give freedom to advertise the fact that bets could be taken in a particular house.  I think I am right in saying that there was no such expressed intention when the original Act was going through. But what will happen if the Bill passes in its present form is that all restrictions upon advertising which were contained in the previous Betting Acts will be removed in respect to licensed houses.</P>
      <P>A combination of the provisions in the 1853 Act and the 1874 Act is embodied in this new section.  Section 7 of the Act of 1853 provided that &ldquo;any person exhibiting or publishing or causing to be exhibited or published any placard, handbill, card, writing, sign, or advertisement whereby it shall be made to appear that any house, office or room or place is kept open or used for the purposes of making bets or wagers,&rdquo; and so on, would on conviction be liable to the penalties set out in the section.  That was extended in the 1874 Act to a person advertising that he was willing to give information regarding bets or to act as a commission agent in regard to bets or that he was prepared to invite any person to make or take a share in a bet or wager.  The law then was that it was illegal for a man to advertise that he had a place at which to take bets. We altered that and attempted to transfer betting on the street to betting in houses, the houses to be licensed as well as the persons taking bets.  I submit that we did not deliberately intend to leave it open to the bookmaker to advertise the fact that he was prepared to lay odds on or against in a house.  There was no suggestion that there should be an advertising or publicity campaign in respect to betting houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though that was not the intention, at any rate it is a fact that it is no longer an offence for a licensed bookmaker to <Col N="1394" /> advertise the fact that he is prepared to bet at his particular premises.  It is no longer an offence for him to issue circulars and send out advertisements, in the way that shopkeepers send out advertisements for sales, saying that he is prepared to make bets at a particular place on a particular race. That is no longer illegal because we have enacted that the Betting Houses Acts shall not apply to registered premises, and it is in those Acts that the prohibition as to the advertising and circularising of betting houses is contained. If we do not put in a provision such as this then that will no longer be an illegal thing.  Since the 1930 Act it is not an offence for a bookmaker to advertise widely and in any manner he wishes the fact that he is prepared to make bets in particular premises.</P>
    <P>The object of the new section is to make it an offence for a betting-man to advertise the fact that he is prepared to make bets in particular premises. If we only intended, and I think that is what the House understood, to transfer the practice of betting from the street to licensed premises, then we should insert some such clause as this in the Bill.  If we now desire to go further and say that not only shall a man be free to bet, but that he shall be free to advertise in any way he wishes, through the newspapers, the post, by circular, or with a placard on a hoarding, that he in his particular premises which are licensed is prepared to take bets, and that he is free to do it, and if we go further and extend, as the Minister suggests, the licensing charges, by that means reducing the number of licensed premises, the corollary is and will be that the better off and richer bookmakers will use these advertising facilities not merely to attract such bets to come to their premises, but to stimulate the practice of betting.  The idea of this prohibition that I am seeking to insert is to limit the stimulus to bet, to restrict, as far as possible, advertising or publicity methods in connection with betting-houses.</P>

I would like to have a full discussion of this section.  If other Senators wish to assist in the discussion I shall be very much relieved, because it seems to me that the construction of the section as it stands is this: a licensed bookmaker can advertise in the newspapers and in other ways, but he cannot advertise immediately outside his own premises.

      <P>As I read the amendment, in order to constitute an offence you must have two factors.  You must first &ldquo;write, print or publish.&rdquo;  That is one factor.  The second factor is &ldquo;and circulate or permit to be circulated any such advertisement or circular outside of any registered premises.&rdquo; What I would submit for the consideration of Senators is this: that in order to secure a conviction under Senator Johnson's amendment, if it is made law, you should prove two things. You should prove that he writes, prints or publishes, and, secondly, that he circulates or permits to be circulated any such advertisement or circular outside any registered premises. I direct the attention of Senators, and particularly my friend Senator Brown, to the section in view of what I have said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;outside&rdquo; presents another difficulty.  I do not suppose that any judge would say that &ldquo;outside&rdquo; is used there in contradistinction to &ldquo;inside.&rdquo;  Outside the premises may be any place all over the world, but a reasonable view to take of it would be immediately outside.  That could be easily amended.  Certainly the point raised by Senator Fanning raises another objection to the section. I think this section does not carry out the intention that Senator Johnson has in mind.  On the contrary, I think it negatives the whole purpose he has in view.  For that reason I was in favour of recommitting the Bill.  If the Bill cannot be recommitted, and if the amendment cannot be altered, I am opposed to it.</P>

      <P>I think this amendment does go too far.  As far as I know, before the Betting Act of 1926 was passed, a betting-man carrying on a credit business could advertise.  He could advertise the fact that he carried on a betting business, but not that people would come to bet with him on the premises.  Now we have brought credit betting and cash betting into the one premises, and I do not see that there is any reason why we should refuse to allow a man to advertise.  As far as I know, there has been no suggestion that any ill-effects have followed from advertising.  I do not think that Irish bookmakers advertise to any great extent at all. There may be an occasional advertisement, and you may have the sending out of price lists to regular customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as young people are concerned the Betting and Loans (Infants) Act, 1892 is fairly prohibitive.  People are prohibited under that Act from &ldquo;sending or causing to be sent to infants any circular, notice, letter, telegram or other document which invites, or may reasonably be implied to invite, the person receiving it to make any bet or wager, or enter into or take any share or interest in any betting or wagering transaction.&rdquo;  I <Col N="1397" /> think that is really all that is required.  Everyone knows that the betting shops are there.  Everyone knows that they will accept bets, and I do not see that there is any good reason for going the length of saying that they are not to advertise.  If there had been some abuse in connection with it during the period the Act has been in operation there might be some support for the amendment, but I have not heard that there has been any.</P>

      <P>I put this amendment down because I thought there was a clear departure from the intentions of the original Act in favour of advertising and circularising.  I am very conscious of the fact that the drafting of amendments of this kind is an art and science, and that the ordinary layman is not competent to express his meaning in legal terms.  That was one of the reasons why I thought it was desirable to have the Bill recommitted for the consideration of these amendments. I think it is a pity that in the last Act we have extended the liberty to advertise, even though up to the moment it may not have been taken undue advantage of.  One never knows how soon someone will rise to the importance of publicity.  We have Ministers attending publicity conferences, and we have great advocacy on the value and virtue of publicity.  Some of these days some of our bookmakers may take the hint and start a campaign of advertising, which they will be perfectly free to do.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 27 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>27.&mdash;(1) It shall not be lawful for the registered proprietor to employ or use the services of any member of his family or other person under the age of eighteen years as clerk or assistant in the business carried on in the registered premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  A registered proprietor who employs or uses the services of any member of his family or other person under the age of eighteen years as <Col N="1398" /> clerk or assistant in the business carried on in the registered premises shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding twenty-five pounds or at the discretion of the court to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months.</P>
    <P>I suppose we are all agreed that the atmosphere of the betting shop is not a wholesome one for the young.  That is recognised by the original Act, Section 23 of which makes it an offence to make a bet with any person under 18, while Section 28 implies that it is unlawful to employ a clerk or an assistant who is under 18.  Section 28 does not make the employment of the clerk or assistant who is under 18 an offence.  It simply implies that it is not lawful to do it.  We lawyers know that you cannot create an offence by implication, so that it is perfectly lawful at present under the existing Act to employ a clerk or an assistant under 18.  The present Bill does not create any penalty for that, and therefore it is not an offence which you can put down by a penalty.  It is implied by Section 28 and ought to be made an offence.  It ought also to be an offence to employ in a betting shop, even without paying wages to them, members of the licensed person's family who are under 18.  The exclusion of the young from the atmosphere of the betting shop is a thing we ought to do our best to bring about.  That is the object of the amendment.</P>

The father need not have any more than one room to live in and carry on his betting business. The children can be there according to the terms of the Betting Bill, as I understand it.  He is not entitled to ask his grown up son to help him until he becomes 18 years of age.  I think the thing is a little unreasonable.

      <P>I do not know whether the purpose of Senator Brown's amendment is not met in the Bill as far as it can reasonably be met.  Section 23 provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>No registered proprietor of registered premises shall permit any person under the age of eighteen years (other than persons ordinarily resident on such premises and officers of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs entering such premises in the course of their duty as such officers) to enter or be on such premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later it is permitted that certain people may be employed as assistants even though they are under 18.  The position, therefore, I think, is sufficiently covered by the Bill except as regards the members of the bookmaker's family.  No person except those ordinarily resident on the premises can enter them.  In fact, only his own family can be there if he is a bookmaker in a small way in a country town and lives in the house in which the betting business is carried on.  The ordinary bookmaker in Dublin has a shop somewhere.  A great number of them do not actually live in or over the premises, and, therefore, their children could not come on to the premises at all.  They are excluded in the same way as all other children.  We have only to deal with cases where <Col N="1400" /> children live on and are about the premises. It is doubtful whether there would be any particular advantage in saying that they are not actually to be employed in the business.  They are running about where the business is going on, and I do not know that it will make any difference to them.  I think that is the only point.</P>
    <P>It might be difficult to prevent employment after hours.  There might be an anxiety on the part of employees to do tots or, as some one might suggest, alter the dockets for the purpose of the revenue returns.</P>

      <P>The Minister has spoken of the small bookmakers' premises in the country, and he indicated that it would be unjust and unfair to license a man's house in which his family lived or prevent his employing his sons or daughters in the premises. The Minister indicates the difficulty by suggesting the size of the house. There is a limit as to suitability. It must be a house, and, if it is in the country, it must have a valuation of not less than £10.  In the county borough of Dublin it must have a valuation of not less than £15.  In the case of premises situated in any other county borough or the borough of Dun Laoghaire it must have a valuation of not less than £10, and premises situated elsewhere must have a valuation of not less than £5.  I take it that it is not a tenement that the Minister has in mind.  If one can conceive a one-room tenement with a valuation <Col N="1402" /> of not less than £5, then there is no power in the hands of the authorities to object on the grounds of suitability. No matter how small or unsatisfactory the apartment may be as a betting premises, if it is valued at £5 in the country there is no right to object.  There seems to be good reason for supporting Senator Brown's contention that in such premises where a family must live and carry on business as well the prohibition against employing any member of the family should be substantiated by a penalty.</P>

      <P>Amendment 5 is a Government amendment.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 32 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>32.&mdash;(1) Save as is otherwise provided by this section, it shall not be lawful for any person to write, print, publish or knowingly circulate any advertisement, circular or coupon advocating or inviting or otherwise relating to betting on football games or knowingly to cause or procure, or attempt to cause or procure, any such advertisement, circular or coupon to be written, printed, published or circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Nothing in this section shall render it unlawful for the registered <Col N="1403" /> proprietor of registered premises to have and distribute in such premises any advertisement, circular, or coupon relating to the business of bookmaking carried on in such premises (whether in respect of football games or any other event) or for any person to write or print any such advertisement, circular, or coupon for such registered proprietor.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every person who does any act which is a contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof, in the case of a first offence, to a fine not exceeding twenty-five pounds or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding one month and, in the case of a second or any subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months.</P>
    <P>I got this section prepared in an attempt to meet certain views expressed in the House on a previous stage in relation to football betting. It enables the bookmaker to have coupons printed, if he so wishes, to hand to those who may want to use that particular system of betting.  It does not mean that people must mark the coupons on the premises.  It prevents the wholesale sending out of them, and it prevents anything that could be regarded as damaging to sport of this nature.  A certain amount of this betting goes on, and I do not think that anything can stop it.  There will be, perhaps, a tendency to have it done with firms across the water, if it is not allowed to be done here.  Of course, a great deal of the betting is on teams that actually play across the water.</P>

It forces persons anxious to bet to go to the betting shops in order to get coupons. That is a thing we should try to avoid. <Col N="1404" /> I think the effect of the amendment would be, that in order to prevent himself breaking the law by having his premises overcrowded, the bookmaker will risk sending out the coupons through the medium of individuals. I suggest that it may turn out to be a case of the law being honoured more in the breach than in the observance. There is also this point, that our own bookmakers will be handicapped.  The British bookmakers will continue to circularise our people.  If an individual wants to have a bet, and if he has the slightest fear that there may be some trouble in the case of his local bookmaker, he will get in touch with British bookmakers.  I think this Bill is already pretty well amended, and this amendment that has now been suggested will not do much good.  I suggest the Minister should allow the Bill to go through as it stands.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to move it, but I would like to explain the position as it appears to me.  The question arises as to what is the value of the word &ldquo;distribute&rdquo; on the second line of sub-section (2).  If I could be assured that there is no risk of using that word as a cover for distributing in large numbers, I would feel satisfied.  It may happen that a person is able to take out 100 coupons and use them in the place in which he works.  If the word &ldquo;distribute&rdquo; will allow that, then I think Senator Hooper's amendment should be inserted. If I could feel assured that the word &ldquo;distribute&rdquo; implies only distributing to an individual a single coupon, I think that the Minister's proposal would cover most of what is needed.  I feel that the essence of this whole amendment and also of Senator Hooper's amendment, depends on the value of the word &ldquo;distribute.&rdquo;</P>

I think in all probability&mdash;I am not sure that I would go further than that&mdash;that any court would hold that if a registered proprietor gave 50 of these coupons or advertisements, or whatever you like to call them, to a man and let him go out of his house, that would be regarded as distributing them elsewhere than on his premises.  It is a somewhat doubtful question.  I think the section as it stands will probably do what the Minister wants, but perhaps it is no harm to make it certain.</P>

      <P>As to the word &ldquo;distribute,&rdquo; I think it is a little doubtful, but I do not think it could be held to confine the bookmaker to giving out only single coupons to any individual. It is one of the things nobody could be sure about until it is tested in court.  The consensus of opinion that I was able to get from the legal point of view is that if a man gave small numbers of coupons to various people he would still be within the word &ldquo;distribute.&rdquo; On the other hand, if he gave a great quantity to an individual he would not be distributing.</P>

      <P>That is what I would desire the position to be.  I recognise there is a good deal of force in what Senator Robinson said.  If you could prevent wholesale circularising, then you would have done all that we want to do.  On the other hand, if you enable <Col N="1406" /> someone who wants coupons to go and get them for himself and his pals, I think that is all right; it is the best way to have the thing.  If you confine a man to giving out single copies to individuals you are undoubtedly going to have this difficulty of overcrowding of premises and loitering, and perhaps you will do more harm than good.  You may have coupons dealing with English bookmakers and this prevents the evils anticipated by Senators on the last day. I was not so very keen on making the provision at all, but I found it urged from various quarters of the House. I think a good deal of this discussion in the House was with reference to another sort of coupon altogether, a coupon which is bought for sixpence and which is at present illegal, although I have no doubt it is being utilised.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of the Minister's amendment and I am opposed to Senator Hooper's amendment simply because it is unworkable. Anybody who knows anything about football coupon betting is aware that men do not go individually into bookmakers' offices to get these coupons. One man collects a number of coupons and distributes them amongst his colleagues in the workshop.  In most of the large industries in Dublin those coupons obtained from the bookmakers are given round regularly every week, or else large numbers of private coupons organised by the work people themselves&mdash;and, of course, that altogether is illegal&mdash;are circulated. If Senator Hooper's amendment is accepted it will be unworkable. There is no use in making a statute that you cannot carry out. Under Senator Hooper's amendment each individual who wants to have a coupon bet on a football match will have to go to the bookmaker's office and collect his single coupon.  The amendment would prevent one man collecting 50 or 60 coupons and distributing them amongst his colleagues. I say that amendment is unworkable, and it is unwise to pass an Act of Parliament that we cannot carry out.</P>

      <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister that the case is met by sub-section (1) of the amendment. I think we should do everything possible to prevent any attempt to sabotage the possible development of athletics in this country.  I know of no more destructive element than betting on games.  I have reason to know that the failure of athletics in the past was due largely to the betting influence on various games.  The effort to drive that influence away was followed by a great development in the Gaelic Athletic Association.  Through determined action on their part they <Col N="1408" /> have prevented as far as they could do so any gambling on athletic events under the G.A.A. rules.  In that way they have managed to keep the games clean and healthy.</P>
      <P>There are large numbers of people very keenly interested in the development of athletics in this country, and already we see the fruits of their efforts in the athletic field.  If we do not use our influence and power to prevent gambling on athletic events, then the efforts of these people will not bear fruit.  I believe every possible obstacle should be put in the way of gambling on athletic events.</P>

A man comes along and gives so many guesses as to the probable winners.  How that can affect athletics in Ireland I cannot see.  The bookmaker has not the faintest knowledge of how his book will balance until the very last minute.  It certainly could not be much use to him to send over a fiver to make a team lose a game.</P>

      <P>I submitted this amendment to meet the views of the House. The Bill went through the Dáil simply repealing the Ready Money Football Betting Act, and placing no restrictions on coupons.  One or two members in the Dáil said there should be some restrictions on coupons, but no amendment <Col N="1409" /> was moved.  There was a stronger feeling expressed in the Seanad, and, in an attempt to meet it, I put down this amendment, which limits the thing to some extent.  Personally I have no very strong feeling on the necessity for limiting it, and I think most Senators who spoke strongly against coupons were thinking of a different sort of coupon which is already illegal. To some extent the debate was carried on under a misapprehension.  I do not believe this particular kind of betting on football can do any harm.  I think it is a most innocuous form of betting.</P>

The secretary of the Football Association and some of the leaders of the G.A.A. have spoken to me since the last discussion here, and they urged that we should not, if possible, allow what has hitherto been confined to British games in the main, but what has now begun to be applied to Irish games.  They are anxious that we should prevent as far as we possibly can any chance of this habit extending.  I think the Minister's amendment will do something in that direction, and I will support it.</P>

      <P>I have always held that the introduction of betting on football games was one of the most mischievous things that ever occurred in the athletic world.  Betting on racing is quite an old and legitimate practice, but betting on football matches is viewed by a good deal of our country clubs and players as a most mischievous element to introduce into the realm of sport.  Betting on football and hurling matches should be debarred as far as possible.  I have a son who is an all-Ireland football champion, and he and I, and I am sure many others, would like to see the game carried on without anything in the nature of betting being allowed.  I think there are very many people who disapprove of betting on football and hurling matches.  As regards other games, people may bet to their heart's content.  I strongly support the suggestion that no betting <Col N="1410" /> should be allowed on football or hurling matches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment 1 stands in the name of Senator O'Rourke and is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 46.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows: &ldquo;(2) Nothing in this section shall render it unlawful for any farmer or other person who habitually keeps animals for profit or the servant of any such person to perform on or administer to an animal of any class (whether owned or not owned by such person) any operation or medicine the performing or administering of which is incidental to the usual care and management of animals of that class: Provided that such person or servant does not hold himself out as a registered veterinary surgeon.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator O'Rourke is not able to be here to-day and he asked me to move the amendment.  In view of the amendment adopted by the House on the Committee Stage of this Bill, deleting Section 46, I think it is ridiculous to move this amendment.  I propose, therefore, that the Bill be re-committed to Committee.  Section 46 was the most important section of this Bill and it has been eliminated by the House in Committee.  That will leave the Bill practically useless so far as the veterinary surgeons are concerned.  Let us consider the effect of the elimination of that clause from the Bill as introduced to this House. Every veterinary surgeon practically in the Free State was bound to register in the Free State&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to the recommittal of this Bill.  I consider that Senator Johnson's amendment, whereby Section 46 was struck out of the Bill, was the most important service which this Seanad has rendered to the country for many a day.  I have been in the Seanad for over two years.  In that time I have seen various groups seeking and getting special privileges and special monopolies.  I do not object to that, but a great deal done in this Parliament has been to the detriment of the farming community, and the sooner they watch their interests the better.  Senator Johnson's amendment was an amendment in ease of the farming community, and the result of it was to allow the ordinary processes of agriculture to go on without interruption.  I am not at all opposed to veterinary surgeons being protected or being formed into a close corporation or a close profession.  I am not at all opposed to their getting all the public offices connected with veterinary science, but I am certainly opposed to any infringement of the rights of farmers or to anything that would damage farmers in the carrying on of their ordinary business.  It seems to me that Section 46 was an invasion of their rights, and I was gratified when Senator Johnson's amendment was carried.  I think that this Bill ought not to be re-committed for the purpose of defeating Senator Johnson's amendment.  That amendment was carried almost unanimously by this House.  It was not even put to a division.  The matter was, if I may say so, very well and sensibly debated by those who spoke, and nearly twenty Senators took part in the discussion.  The only object in recommitting the Bill is for the purpose of brigading people to defeat the amendment.  That has been done several times by Ministers.  I do not want to be unjust to the present Minister&mdash;</P>

That has been done by Ministers again and again, but it is the first time that it has been done in relation to any Bill of which the Minister now in the Seanad had charge.  It is the first time that it has been done by him, but if this practice continues, all I can say is that the Seanad is prevented from exercising any useful function in the State even as a revising body.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I move the amendment in Senator O'Rourke's name.  We want some protection for the veterinary profession.  I have a great regard for the cow doctor, but the cow doctor has his limits.  If we want to have a proficient and proper veterinary service, sufficiently numerous for the needs of the country, the profession must be protected in some way.  In several fairs it was the custom for parties to come around and announce: &ldquo;Murphy and Toomey are here to-day, and will be here tomorrow, and anybody who wants his colt castrated should send him to them.&rdquo;  As the Bill stands at present, any sort of quack can come along and do the work of a veterinary surgeon. There are others who go in for this class of work, such as the Dublin bookseller, who was sent to jail.  If these people do not hold themselves out as veterinary surgeons, they can practise veterinary work, no matter how unfitted they may be for the job.  As we need a number of qualified veterinary surgeons in the country, I think we should give them some protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 2:</P>
      <P>Section 47.  To delete the section and to substitute the following new section therefor:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;47.&mdash;(1) Any act or thing that would be an offence under this Act if committed by an individual shall be an offence if committed by a body corporate.</P>
      <P>(2)  If a body corporate commits an offence under this Act, such body corporate shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine in respect of each such offence not exceeding fifty pounds and the manager and every director of such body corporate shall also be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine in respect of each such offence not exceeding fifty pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is really complementary to the amendment inserted on the Committee Stage to Section 46, though it is not formally complementary to it.  It seeks to provide that an act which is an offence if committed by an individual will be an offence if committed by a company and that on conviction the manager and every director of the company shall be liable to a penalty.  The section in the Bill might well have greater effect, dependent on the judgment of the summary court, than Senators would desire.  A good deal would depend upon the interpretation placed by the magistrate on the words &ldquo;practising veterinary medicine.&rdquo; I think there is a real risk that a company might be convicted <Col N="1415" /> of practising veterinary medicine if it offered for sale, through an ordinary shop or otherwise, medicines which were advertised as being cures or remedies for certain sicknesses. That might be decided by a magistrate as &ldquo;practising veterinary medicine.&rdquo;  I looked up certain works to ascertain the meaning of the words &ldquo;practising medicine.&rdquo;  I find very great difficulty at arriving at any conclusion as to what the Courts have decided.  They have decided in different ways, everything depending upon the immediate facts&mdash;the facts surrounding the particular case.</P>
    <P>There have been prosecutions at different times under the Apothecaries Act and Acts relating to chemists and druggists and the question of what &ldquo;practising&rdquo; meant led to different decisions, depending upon the immediate circumstances.  There is a danger that people advertising well-known articles as remedies for certain diseases and complaints of animals might be charged with practising medicine. We should not take a risk of that kind. On the other hand, the proposal in the amendment is to make it an offence for any company to do anything which an individual is prohibited from doing &mdash;to make the penalty applicable not only to the person operating or doing the job or announcing himself as a veterinary surgeon but to every person in the company.</P>

      <P>I do not like to have the course of my speech in the Seanad dictated by anybody, even a Minister. There are other offences under this Bill, as the Minister will see.  Take, for instance, Section 43, which provides:</P>
      <P>(1)  Every person who, for the purpose of being registered in the register, makes or procures or causes to be made or procured or aids or abets the making or procuring of any representation or declaration which to the knowledge of such person is false or fraudulent shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to imprisonment for any term not exceeding twelve months.</P>
      <P>That is one of the most serious offences under the Bill and it comes under the Minister's &ldquo;such as.&rdquo;  Notwithstanding what the Minister has said, I am opposed to Senator Johnson's amendment.  I prefer the Bill as it stands.  I think Senator Johnson's amendment is too copious altogether.</P>

      <P>After hearing Senator Comyn I am very glad I am not a lawyer.  The Minister suggested that no public company would think of attempting to practice, or would offer <Col N="1419" /> itself out as a registered Veterinary Surgeon and that that was how the Bill stood at present.  He said it was a foolish thing to add this new section which purposes to meet the offence of a company offering itself as a registered veterinary surgeon.  The Minister's own clause made it an offence as being prepared to practise veterinary surgery.  If it is folly in one case it surely is folly in the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has two clauses, 46 and 47, and logically they must be read together.  The Seanad on the Committee Stage took out Section 46, which provided that it should not be lawful for any person to practise, or to represent, or to hold themselves out as practising or being prepared to practise veterinary surgery or veterinary medicine unless he was for the time being on the register here.  The Seanad refused to accept that and instead adopted a new section which provides that any person who falsely represents himself as being a registered veterinary surgeon or as being a veterinary surgeon or by the use of any colourable imitation of either of these terms represents himself as being a qualified veterinary surgeon&mdash;the word &ldquo;falsely&rdquo; governs all this&mdash;then he should be guilty of an offence.  The Seanad decided that the penalty provided in that new section is to be the only penalty with regard to an individual. I suggest that it is completely illogical for the Seanad, having said that with regard to the individual, to say that nevertheless a company shall be allowed to represent or hold itself out or be prepared to practise veterinary surgery. If the Seanad is going to be logical, following the amendment passed on the last day, it must pass Senator Johnson's amendment.  When it has done that I ask what is the whole position with regard to veterinary surgery to be in the future?  The only offence under the new Section 46 is &ldquo;falsely&rdquo; representing oneself as being registered; I ask why should anyone for the future put himself on the register here?</P>

      <P>Qualified men will always get positions.  The only offence under the Bill as it stands will be for falsely representing oneself as being registered.  Why should a man who is an M.R.C.V.S. go on the Register here and pay £2 2s. a year for going on?  Why, for instance, should he submit himself to the supervision of the Council with regard to professional misconduct?  He becomes a M.R.C.V.S. and he comes into this country.  He cannot be said to be falsely representing himself as a qualified man simply because he will not go on the register here.  He puts up a plate which states &ldquo;M.R.C.V.S., unregistered on Irish register.&rdquo;  Why should he pay £2 2s. when by putting up that plate he can be quite free from the supervision of the Council and to do anything he pleases?  If that is the position people envisage with regard to the future, how do they think that the Veterinary Council is going to get fees from people to register here? There will be no funds to enable the Veterinary College to meet the expenses of examining here.  The result of the last day's amendment will be that the system will break down and that people who want to get degrees to practise must go to England for them.</P>

I submit that in the future, as in the past, veterinary surgeons will find it advisable to come on the register here.  Senator Johnson's amendment has done nothing more than to leave the law as it was before this Bill was introduced.  I suggest that if the Minister is against Senator Johnson's amendment he ought to say so.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed that we have not had a statement in support of the motion as to what is meant, and what is involved.  I think the occasion is one on which we might have had a statement expressive of a feeling of gratification that we have arrived at a stage in international affairs in regard to the promotion of peace and of arbitration between nations by which it is possible to accede to an international document of this nature. We have participated in certain movements beginning with our entry into the League which links us up as a Free State with the progressive nations of the world, and some unprogressive ones, in a great international effort for co-operation to prevent war.  This General Act marks one very important phase of that general movement, and as I said last night, it would be a pity if this motion were to be passed in a perfunctory way.  I am sorry now that the motion was not taken last night, because then we might have had a larger attendance than we have to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a very long agitation and a great deal of international diplomacy in regard to the question which culminates in this General Act. When one looks into the problem and the discussions surrounding it, one finds that a great step forward has been made, when it is possible for a number of countries to commit themselves <Col N="1422" /> to submission to the decision of an international court of law or arbitration in any dispute in which they may be involved.  We entered into the Covenant of the League, which committed us to certain action in the direction of peace and international co-operation.  We entered into the Kellogg Pact, which takes us a little further on that road.  We signed what is known as the Optional Clause, by which we undertook to submit juridical problems and questions in dispute to a court outside this country.  We are now going further. We are not confining our undertaking merely to these disputes which might be dealt with in law courts under conditions which govern international law, but we are committing ourselves to submit to an outside international authority any dispute of any kind, political or otherwise, in which we may find ourselves involved. That is the important feature of it.  We are renouncing our national sovereignty to that extent in the sense that it is frequently used: the right to impose our views by force of arms on other countries.  We are saying that we are prepared to submit our disputes to an international authority, that we will argue our case, and accept the decision given, even though we may be convinced in our hearts and conscience that the decision is a wrong one.  We agree to accept the decision, and other countries are agreeing in the same way.  I think that is a great step forward in the direction of co-operation and collaboration.</P>
    <P>Before we pass the motion I would like to hear what the views of the Ministry are in regard to accession to this General Act.  Is it proposed to accede to all the provisions of the Act as defined in Article 38, that is, to chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4 or to make reservations of any kind?  The serious nature of this motion depends to some extent on the reservations, if any, that we contemplate.  There is nothing in the motion which indicates the intention of the Ministry in that respect. I do not profess for a moment to be competent to discuss the merits of this <Col N="1423" /> motion and this General Act in the way that it ought to be discussed in this House.  It would seem to me to be a very great pity if the motion were to be allowed to pass the two Houses without any indication being given by the Ministry with regard to possible reservations and without some testimony to the work of those great advocates and practitioners in the art of peacemaking that has been going on for at least a hundred years, which finds its culmination in this General Act for the International Settlement of Disputes. I hope that we may get from the Minister a general statement of the views of the Government on the matter and some indication as to how many States have subscribed up to date to this General Act, what reservations have been made to it by Great Britain and the Dominions particularly, and what reservations have been made by other countries which have acceded to it.</P>

      <P>Senator Johnson, speaking on this subject, has asked what the Government's intentions are with regard to accession to the General Act; whether there are only particular sections to which we may accede, or whether the accession is to be complete and comprehensive.  We intend it to be comprehensive.  We want to accede to the whole Act.  There is no need for any expression as to a time limit.  This runs in periods of five years, and, if it is not intended to be recognised further, notice may be given within six months before the expiration of the five years' period.  We are going to accede <i>simpliciter.</i>  The accession to the Act as a whole is in complete accord with what Irish delegations have from time to time said at the Assembly of the League and elsewhere. We have adopted the policy in general of all-round conciliation and all-round pacificatory settlement of disputes. It has been a hard task to get the various nations to band themselves together in a type of agreement bearing on the pacific settlement of disputes and completely free from flaws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> Senator Johnson has outlined some of the ways in which we have incurred obligations.  We have incurred obligations arising out of the Covenant, the Kellogg Pact, as a signatory to the Optional Clause, and under a variety of Treaties which we have signed from time to time.  If disputes arise on specific points set out in these Treaties, recourse must be had to arbitration or to other proceedings of a particular type.  Under Articles of the Covenant nations are obliged to bring forward for judicial settlement, arbitration or inquiry by the Council, any disputes which may seem likely to lead to a rupture or provoke war.  If it is felt that a particular dispute is not one which is proper for submission to judicial settlement or arbitration, nations are obliged to submit it to the Council. In these obligations there are certain little imperfections.  For instance, a flaw exists in the sense that there is a subjective test by the nations implicated. There may be, for example, a dispute which is likely to lead to rupture. The question could be asked: What disputes are there that would be likely to lead to rupture?  Nations could avoid their responsibility under that clause by declaring that a particular dispute, in their opinion, is not such as would pass the subjective test. A great deal would depend on the view of the nations concerned.  If they do not consider a dispute suitable for submission, then that particular type of pacific settlement has to be set aside.</P>
    <P>Under one Article of the Covenant, if there are disputes which nations consider are not suitable for judicial settlement or arbitration, they may be referred to the Council for inquiry. Here there is another flaw.  If the Council are unanimous, then there is a definite result to look forward to; but if the Council are not unanimous, the whole method of pacific settlement again falls through.  By reason of these gaps, these imperfections, the different nations moved on to the Kellogg Pact, which embodies a general renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy in the settlement of disputes.  Under that Pact nations bound themselves to resort <Col N="1425" /> only to pacific means.  It is a comprehensive document, but it, too, has a flaw inasmuch as there is no procedure of a distinct type established for the purpose of bringing disputes forward. Under the Optional Clause there is machinery arranged, but it is limited to legal disputes or disputes of a juridical character.</P>
    <P>The General Act was finally thought of.  This General Act applies to all classes of disputes.  We propose to accept it, not merely in the chapter relating to conciliation, but also in the chapters relating to judicial settlement and arbitration.  In the different chapters there is laid down a certain procedure and certain schemes for the pacific settlement of international disputes. Under the General Act the method is that a dispute must come forward for settlement by conciliation, judicial settlement or arbitration. Legal disputes will go forward for judicial settlement if the parties have not as an alternative agreed to have resort to an arbitral tribunal.  Nonlegal disputes will go eventually for arbitration if not previously settled through conciliatory methods.  The ordinary distinction between conciliation and other methods holds here. The conciliatory method is to try to get the different parties together and endeavour to get the points in dispute pacifically settled.  If a settlement be not effected, then in the case of the non-legal dispute there has to be recourse to arbitration.  The legal type of dispute will go for judicial settlement, as I have already indicated, in cases where arbitration proceedings have not been arranged by the parties.</P>
    <P>We consider this method of binding ourselves to all the nations in the world&mdash;and, of course, they also will bind themselves to us&mdash;to be a much better substitute for the old method of using the pause between wars for the purpose of forming alliances amongst individual nations, alliances which, as history has too often shown, only lead to further groupings for fresh wars.  We prefer this system of holding out the hand of peace to every country disposed to accept this general pacific obligation in the same spirit <Col N="1426" /> as that in which we accept it.  The whole Act has been accepted by France, Spain, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, India, Norway and Belgium. Italy has announced its intention to accede, but it has not yet done so.  Holland and Sweden have acceeded to Chapters 1, 2 and 4.</P>
    <P>Reservations would require to be dealt with in much more detail than I am, at the moment, able to deal with them.  Some countries have put in, as if by way of reservation, what is really not a reservation at all, to my mind. Some of the attempted reservations amount to little more than an underlining of what is already in the Act. Article 29 has been almost written in again in acceptance by one country. Article 29 is an important Article for the Seanad to notice.  It occurs in Part IV, dealing with the General Provisions, and it establishes that:</P>
    <P>1.  Disputes for the settlement of which a special procedure is laid down in other conventions in force between the Parties to the dispute shall be settled in conformity with the provisions of those conventions.</P>
    <P>2.  The present General Act shall not affect any agreements in force by which conciliation procedure is established between the Parties or they are bound by obligations to resort to arbitration or judicial settlement which ensure the settlement of the dispute....</P>
    <P>In other words, it keeps alive existing undertakings.  Certain countries have thought fit to direct special attention to the fact that they are keeping alive previously established conventions. I do not think that amounts to a reservation.  We intend to make no reservations with regard to our acceptance of the General Act.  As I have said, we intend to accept it <i>simpliciter.</i> The British Government made their declaration dependent upon reservations definitely of the same type as those previously declared in regard to the Optional Clause.  The Article dealing with allowed reservations is Article 39, which says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> 1.  In addition to the power given in the preceding article, a Party, in acceding to the present General Act, may make his acceptance conditional upon the reservations exhaustively enumerated in the following paragraph.  These reservations must be indicated at the time of accession.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 is an important one.  It sets out:</P>
    <P>2.  These reservations may be such as to exclude from the procedure described in the present Act:</P>
    <P>(a)  Disputes arising out of facts prior to the accession either of the Party making the reservation or of any other Party with whom the said Party may have a dispute;</P>
    <P>(b)  Disputes concerning questions which by international law are solely within the domestic jurisdiction of States.</P>
    <P>(c)  Disputes concerning particular cases or clearly specified subject-matters, such as territorial status, or disputes falling within clearly defined categories.</P>
    <P>Those are the allowed types of reservation. The British Government have made the same reservations as those which they made to the Optional Clause.  The important one, from our point of view, is the following.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Disputes between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of any other member of the League which is a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, all of which disputes shall be settled in such a manner as the Parties have agreed or shall agree;</P>
    <P>Previously, I made the point here on the Optional Clause that such a reservation as that was quite clearly <i>ultra vires</i> when looked at in conjunction <Col N="1428" /> with the Optional Clause permission in relation to reservations. The permitted types of reservation are somewhat wider under the General Act.  I am still of opinion, however, that a reservation of that type, which proceeds by way of advertence to Parties and not to types of disputes, is clearly without the terms of Article 39.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it suggested that it comes under paragraph (b)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has never been precisely declared.  On that point, I am in the region of conjecture.  I have never heard it so declared and I gather that the paragraph under which this is attempted to be brought is (c) (2) of 39.  Again, as in the Optional Clause, there is an article which provides for settlement of disputes as to interpretation. Article 41 states:</P>
      <P>Disputes relating to the interpretation or application of the present General Act, including those concerning the classification of disputes and the scope of reservations, shall be submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice.</P>
      <P>There is still the procedure of going to that Court, if we want to establish our rights, or in the event of any dispute arising which seems to be blocked by these reservations.  I think I have dealt with most of the points which have been raised.</P>
      <P>We consider this to be the proper method of trying to get an approach to harmonious methods in the world and we consider that it is far better than the old method of alliances with individual countries.  It is in that spirit that we offer this Act for acceptance.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
