      <P>On the Schedule I want to ask whoever is able to answer when the Workmen's Compensation Bill, which is referred to in the memorandum issued in connection with the measure we are now discussing, is likely to be introduced.  The Workmen's Compensation (War Addition) Act of 1917 is being continued from year to year, and the memorandum says that &ldquo;it is necessary to continue this measure until the proposed Workmen's Compensation Bill is passed into law.&rdquo;  It is known that there was a committee dealing with this question and it reported about three years ago. Promises of permanent legislation have been made time and time again, but we have no knowledge yet when this particular Bill will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, in regard to the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, it is purely a temporary measure.  Of course it was a most revolutionary piece of legislation.  The powers given to the Ministry in that Act to act by order were very great indeed, and many of those powers have been exercised.  We have been promised a permanent Bill dealing with the consolidation of Local Government procedure and regulations. In respect of that particular Bill also it would be valuable and <Col N="2412" /> certainly very interesting if we could get some information from the responsible Minister, or whoever can answer for the Minister in this House, as to what the intentions are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 16, sub-section (5).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;but a tenant shall not be entitled to compensation in respect of such work unless such tenant has served on his landlord a sanitary work notice in respect of such work and has become entitled under this Act to execute such work as an improvement.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment really follows upon an amendment which I moved last night, inserting a new section before Section 13.  It is necessary in this particular sub-section to add the words set out in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>When this amendment was reached last night I felt it could not be passed simply as an automatic result of a preceding amendment which was adopted.  It seemed to me then that we were giving the tenant in these circumstances certain rights and at the same time <Col N="2413" /> we were taking away some of those very rights that we were giving him. I thought last night that the three days' notice required by the section passed was entirely unfair to the tenant, but looking at the Bill again I notice that in Section 59 it is sufficient for the tenant who has to serve a notice on his landlord if he sends it by prepaid post addressed to the person to whom such tenant pays the rent.  That meets my objection on that score.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw attention to what I still think is a defect in the section that was passed, in the hope that it may be remedied in the other House, if not here.  The tenant is required to serve the notice on the landlord in the prescribed form, a form to be prescribed by the Minister under regulations.  It may be that a particular tenant knows the exact form; he may know what the prescribed form is, but it appears to me that the very fact that you require the tenant to serve a notice on a landlord in the prescribed form is imposing upon the tenant an obligation, a purely formal obligation perhaps, but if he fails to comply with it you may be depriving him of the benefits of the Act.  If the material facts are presented to the landlord by the notice, it should not be necessary that these should be presented in the prescribed form, because the tenant will very likely not know the prescribed form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is absolute condition precedent to its being effective.  If he got notice that an order was being served on him and was given an indication substantially of what he was ordered to do I think it would satisfy the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Then why introduce the words &ldquo;in the prescribed form&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>I do not know if we could leave them out now, but perhaps we can suggest to the other House that they should be taken out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we might almost authorise the Minister to say in the <Col N="2414" /> other House that we are agreeable to taking those words out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot do anything now with the amendment carried last evening.  Senator Johnson's suggestion and Senator Brown's acquiescence are, of course, very valuable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment provides that in case the tenant does not serve notice within three days he shall not be entitled to compensation. I will remind the House that during the discussion on the amendment to which this is consequential the Minister made a very valuable suggestion to the effect that any notice to be served by the local authority on the tenant ought to contain an endorsement in the terms of this amendment.  That would be a very good thing, but Senator Mrs. Wyse Power, who has great experience in this matter of town tenants, indicated that there might be some difficulty, as in order to carry that through it might be necessary to make some amendment in the public health code.  That seemed to weigh with the Minister and certainly it had a great effect upon my mind, because I realised at once the justice of what the Senator said.</P>
      <P>There is a difficulty presented. Before you deprive the tenant of the right of compensation you must, I submit, safeguard the tenant in every possible way.  Senator Johnson now seems to be satisfied with Section 59, which has reference to the notice.  To go back to the amendment, the tenant shall not be entitled to compensation unless he has served on his landlord a sanitary work notice.  Senator Johnson, who has gone very carefully through the Bill, seems to be satisfied with Section 59, which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any notice or other document required or authorised by this Act to be served by a tenant on his landlord may be so served by sending the same by prepaid post addressed to the person to whom such tenant pays the rent of the tenement to which such notice or document relates....</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (1) concludes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>at the place at or to which he pays or sends such rent.</P>
      <P>The Senator appears to be satisfied that Section 59 is sufficient.  He thinks it is sufficient to send the notice addressed to the landlord at the place where the tenant pays the rent.  I will ask the Seanad to consider the case. Rents are paid to an agent and a man may be an agent for several estates. Is a notice addressed to a landlord at the agent's office by prepaid post a sufficient notice?  The point which I made last evening is one which I think is deserving of consideration.  I happen to know a house in one of the principal streets of this city in respect of which the name of the landlord was unknown for a great number of years. There was a tenant in possession.  He did not know who his landlord was. For 10 or 15 years he lodged the rent to a separate account in the bank. That house became insanitary.  Does this Bill give sufficient protection to the tenant in regard to sanitary work or in regard to the service of notice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be necessary to pass a special Act for that tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I contend that it does not.  I would like the House to consider that there are many cases in which the name of the landlord is not known.  There was one case in Parliament Street.  As Falstaff said about the battle at Bosworth Field, the clock is there still&mdash;the clock by which he fought.  Well, the house in this instance is there still, although it is derelict and insanitary.  That is a concrete example, and when I put this amendment to the test of that case it does not satisfy the test.  If the landlord is not available or is not known, there ought to be some arrangement for service in some other way&mdash;service on the agent or service by publication. This is a matter which, I think, Senator Brown ought to provide for in his amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that the tenant executes the improvement on notice from the sanitary officer, why should he be under any obligation to <Col N="2416" /> give notice to anybody?  The tenant spends his money carrying out improvements which the public health authorities decide he should carry out. Why should he be under any obligation to notify anybody else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Seanad thought he should be, and they passed an amendment to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the case of a man who executes an improvement. The landlord may be dead.  The man who is in occupation gets notice that he must carry out this improvement within ten days.  He does not need to waste the six days that Senator Brown suggests, and he puts his money into the improvement right away.  Senator Brown mentions three days' notice to the landlord and then three additional days until it comes back to the tenant.  He does not waste these six days.  He considers that the work is necessary, and he does it.  Perhaps it may be lavatory accommodation that is required.  Why should that man be asked to notify anybody?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can allow that question to be reopened. This amendment, to my mind, is purely consequential on the amendment adopted last night.  If this amendment is not passed the two sections will not be in agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to convince the House that this amendment is not necessary.  When a tenant carries out an improvement he should be under no obligation to notify anybody, and he should get the compensation following upon the improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question raised by Senator Comyn on Section 59 (1), I think the Senator must not have read the section very carefully. It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any notice or other document required or authorised by this Act to be served by a tenant on his landlord may be so served by sending the same by prepaid post addressed to the person to whom such tenant pays the rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he pays the rent to the agent he sends it to the agent's office, <Col N="2417" /> addressed to the agent and not addressed to the landlord.  I think that is perfectly clear and obvious.  If there is a person in the fortunate position that he has been twelve years in possession of a house&mdash;the Senator said fifteen years&mdash;in connection with which there was neither an agent nor a landlord, in all human probability at the end of twelve years there would be no landlord, because the Statute of Limitations would be operative, unless there happened to be a minority or something of that kind intervening. Otherwise he would become his own landlord.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was it is strange that there was not some agent appointed to look after the property.  If there does happen to be one case in a thousand years of that nature I do not think I would feel inclined to agree with Senator Johnson that it is necessary to legislate for it.  As regards the point raised by Senator Wilson, all through the Bill when the tenant wishes to make an improvement he has to serve notice on the landlord in order to give the landlord an opportunity of carrying out the repairs himself.  Last night I pointed out that in a great number of cases it is desirable that the landlord should carry out the improvements.  I instanced a row of houses where it would be undesirable that each tenant should carry out his own individual improvements.  The work should really be done by the landlord for the benefit of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should the man who does the work lose his rights because he has not posted a letter? Is not that what it amounts to?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>The notice is directed to the owner and occupier, but it is served on the occupier, and unless the occupier passes it on to the owner he never gets it at all.  Might I suggest to Senator Comyn that his advice to this fortunate tenant who has not a landlord should be that his best course is not to take notice of the sanitary order and let the sanitary authority carry out the work, whereupon they will create a charge on the landlord's interest in the house?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very thankful to Senator Brown for advising me to do what I myself advised to be done.  But what is the result?  The sanitary authority has not made the improvement and the house has become derelict.  It is a public nuisance at the present time.</P>

      <P>There may be some difficulty with regard to the space of time given by the sanitary authorities to have repairs carried out. In some cases the period is only three days; it may be longer.

      <P>This deals with the right to a new tenancy.  As the Bill stands a new tenancy may be granted to a tenant on condition that during the whole of the period of forty years next preceding the termination of such tenancy the premises are continuously in the occupation of the person who was the tenant thereof immediately before such termination or of his predecessors in title.  Any such person might be entitled, under conditions to be fixed by the court or by agreement, to a new tenancy.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of forty years has been very widely condemned. It is generally felt that if the Act is to be of any use to the ordinary tenant of a house there should be a much shorter period; the period of forty years is entirely too long.</P>
      <P>I argued on the last occasion for reducing that period of forty years to twenty years.  The case was made that there was something in the nature of a saleable right.  It was pointed out, for instance, in respect to the forty years that the present tenant at the end of forty years may have been only in occupation for one, two or three years, but that if the tenancy had existed for forty years he was entitled to a continuation of the tenancy on terms to be fixed.  I pleaded for a reduction in the number of years which would entitle a tenant to a new tenancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I argued in favour of that because of the importance of giving a person who had been in a house for twenty years and who, during that period, had reared his family in that house, the right to a new tenancy on terms to be fixed.  I was not prepared to argue that there was something saleable, that there was anything like a dual ownership or anything like that, but that the man or the woman's personality had become associated with the house and that as it was described there was a sentimental attachment to it.  I think the fact that a person has been in a house for twenty years, that he has kept the house in the order required by the contract of tenancy and is prepared to continue the tenancy on terms to be fixed by the court, should give him the right I am proposing in the amendment.  As a concession <Col N="2421" /> to those who thought that the period should be of actual occupation I put forward the second amendment which, in fact, restricts the right that I am now seeking to confer on the twenty years' occupancy to a man or his wife, to the widower if the woman dies, and to the widow if the husband dies; that it would be purely in connection with a man or his wife.</P>
    <P>That is a matter for discussion afterwards. If this amendment is accepted I am prepared to back the later amendment.  If there is no acceptance of this amendment with that condition, then I will ask the House to divide on the issue as between twenty years and forty years irrespective of the later amendment.  I would be quite prepared to see that this condition of twenty years should be attached to the man and wife occupation.  I think it is a reasonable proposition.  It will meet most of the objections that have been raised against any reduction in this period of forty years.  I think, too, it would meet the great majority of cases where there is a just claim on the part of a tenant by virtue of the fact that his family has been reared in that house.

      <P>I second the amendment and for this reason, that the period of forty years is of course more than a generation.  In large cities it is nearly two generations.  I stated on the last occasion that a forty years' occupation did not exist in more than five per cent. of the tenancies.  That statement was challenged at the time.  I have taken occasion since to verify it, and I find that five per cent., so far as cities are concerned, is rather above than below the mark.  Of course, in the rural areas and in small towns throughout the country families remain in possession generation after generation, but in large cities residences are not occupied by the same family for more than forty years in five per cent. of the cases.  That is a fact.  However, I think forty years' occupation is a wholly illusory matter, and that really its effect would be this: to give people in the occupation of a residential <Col N="2422" /> house the idea that they are getting benefits under this Act, while in reality giving them no benefit at all. If I can form any estimate of the mind of the Seanad, I think Senators will all agree that when this Bill was before the House on the last occasion Senator Johnson made a very good case for the twenty years.  I am sure the House will accept that amendment.  But in order to get the amendment carried Senator Johnson said that if it were carried he would move the limiting amendment which appears on the Order Paper immediately after this.</P>
      <P>If Senators turn to the Bill they will find that sub-section (1) of Section 18 provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>On the termination within the meaning of this section of a tenancy in a tenement, this Part of this Act shall apply to such tenement if such tenement complies with any one of the following conditions, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b) such tenement was during the whole of the period of forty years next preceding the termination of such tenancy continuously in the occupation of the person who was the tenant thereof immediately before such termination or of his predecessors in title.</P>
      <P>In order to show how reasonable the Senator is he tells the House that he will consent to have the meaning of that phrase &ldquo;predecessors in title&rdquo; limited to husband or wife.  If the House accepts his limit of twenty years he will accept a limitation on that: that &ldquo;predecessors in title&rdquo; shall not include any person except the husband or wife.  I would not be fair to the Seanad if I did not tell members beforehand that in case they pass this amendment, reducing the time to twenty years, and in case Senator Johnson moves his limitation on the meaning of &ldquo;predecessors in title,&rdquo; I for one will be inclined to oppose the other amendment.  I tell the House that because I do not want to get their vote on a misrepresentation.  Of course I will be defeated, but I think Senator Johnson is giving away too much.</P>

      <P>I hope the House will refresh its recollection as to what happened on the Committee Stage in connection with this matter.  If there is anything in the nature of an agreement about this amendment, then the two amendments in the name of Senator Johnson must be taken together.  It was an understood thing that there was an opportunity for accommodation in the reduction of the terms if the occupation was limited to the husband or wife.  I would not say for a moment that Senator Comyn would deliberately mislead the House, but surely there is a far larger number of cases than five per cent. where there is continuity of title?</P>

      <P>I am not sure that there was anything in the nature of an agreement except agreement that this matter was to come forward again. The view I take of it is that there is a difficulty because there are two amendments.  It is unfortunate in my mind that Senator Johnson did not move to delete Section 18 and move <Col N="2424" /> to put in a new section with these two amendments together.  If that had been done it would be comparatively easy for one to vote.  If one is to vote in favour of this amendment it would have to be clearly on the understanding that the next amendment was really part and parcel of it and was accepted with it.  If there could be an honourable understanding with regard to that amongst the various sections of the House, I am perfectly certain it would not be departed from.  Senator Comyn said, speaking of the cities, that there were only five per cent. of the people in continuous residence.  I do not know.  It is quite possible he may be right so far as continuous residence is concerned.  But when you come to cases of continuous title, I am quite convinced that the percentage is very much larger than five.  The difficulty that I feel with the Bill as it stands, apart from the argument used by Senator Johnson, with which I have a great deal of sympathy, is that if you leave forty years' continuous residence, or of their predecessors in title, you are giving to some people who may only be in a house for a couple of years, but who have been lucky enough to have predecessors in title for forty years, the right to a new tenancy, while in the case of other people who may have thirty years' residence, but have not been lucky enough to have had predecessors in title during the preceding ten years, you are going to refuse them that right.  It seems to me, as the Bill stands, that you are going to have a certain amount of injustice and a considerable amount of inequity.  Assuming that the wording of the amendment is correct, I for my part would be prepared to support it provided the two are taken together.  Their incorporation would leave the Bill better than it is, and I hope the Minister will seriously consider accepting both.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the House is now discussing the two amendments, I wish to draw attention to a very sad case that occurred at Irishtown, in Dublin, in the past three months.  The father and mother died. The family had been in the house for thirty-three years.  The eldest girl, <Col N="2425" /> who was about twenty-five years of age, remained on in charge of the other members of the family.  Some time after the father and mother died this girl and the remaining members of the family got notice to quit.  They had to clear out of the house which the family had occupied for thirty-three years.  I want to know what protection under either of these amendments or in the Bill itself a family left in such circumstances will get?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">

      <P>Senator Byrne stated that the family was in possession for thirty-three years.  That is less than forty years.  I think it is a reasonable compromise to have the two amendments taken together.  That would prevent the position that has been postulated of a person having a right to a renewal of the lease although only actually in possession of the house for a few years.  The amendments are more reasonable than the existing provision.  The amendments propose to take something from one side and to give back a comparable amount.  Forty years is an extraordinarily long term considering the normal life of man as well as the normal life of a modern house.  Twenty years is a reasonable compromise in view of the restriction contained in the subsequent amendment. I hope neither Senator Comyn nor any other member of the House will oppose the subsequent amendment if the first amendment is accepted.  I think that on the Committee Stage Senator Comyn himself suggested something in the nature of the second amendment.</P>

I hope all sections of the House will find it possible to support both amendments. No opposition really has been put up to them, so that in the circumstances I hope they will be carried unanimously.  The Bill will be none the worse if these amendments are inserted.  Their acceptance will prevent what might be termed injustice and unreasonable reactions from the operation of the Bill as it now stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the House to adhere to the term of 40 years which is contained in the Bill. I would like to draw the attention of the House to the report of the Commission which went into and investigated this matter.  That Commission came to the conclusion that, as a general principle, mere occupancy of a house did not give the right to have a fair rent fixed.  I refer solely to dwelling houses.  The Commission did come to the conclusion that in the case of a house in which persons had been there for a period of 40 years it had got a certain sentimental value and because of that a special exception is to be brought in.  Forty years does not necessarily mean the same individual, it means where a man or his descendants have been in a house for 40 years, where a son or a daughter has succeeded the father, where a family has been in occupation of the house, where a person has grown up and possibly been born in a house and it has always been that person's home. The term of 20 years did not appear to be a sufficiently long period.  I would ask the House to adhere to the term recommended by the Commission. An exception for sentimental reasons is being made upon the recommendation of the Commission, but if that is to be reduced to 20 years then you are simply cutting away the very basis upon which the Commission's recommendation was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Comyn says that 40 years is, for all practical purposes, nugatory in cities.  It seems to me that if <Col N="2427" /> Senator Comyn is right he is proving rather too much, because if people do not remain in houses for 40 years how long do they remain?  If his opinion is that people do not remain for 40 years, except very few, then I take it that a great number must drop off at 20 or before 20 years.  In consequence, if he has argued correctly it must be that a very large number of persons who have been 20 years in possession of houses do not want a renewal at all.  My view is that there are a very large number of persons to whom houses come from father to son, sometimes from grandfather to grandson.  It is that sentimental reason which the Commission suggested should be embodied in this statute.  I suggest to the House that they should not cut away that foundation and reduce it to a mere period of 20 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of these two amendments if they are properly worked together.  My objection to 40 years based on title, that is 40 years including predecessors in title, is this: Very often, towards the end of a tenancy, where the predecessors have been there for 36 or 37 years, somebody comes along and buys up the butt end of that lease for a few pounds.  He is only in the place for three or four years.  He has only paid a small sum for it, and he is to get a new continuing tenancy.  That is not fair.  The Minister says the amendment is based on sentiment.  With great respect&mdash;it is not based on sentiment.  There is sentiment in it, but there is more than sentiment in it.  If I have taken a place and lived in it for more than 20 years I have got more than a sentimental property in it.  I have got a real personal interest in it which is not sentiment.  I have made it, and there is a kind of property in it that ought to be respected.  I am entirely in favour of the two amendments, provided they are worked together so that the 20 years will only apply to the person himself who is there at the end of the tenancy, to the wife or the husband as the case may be.</P>

It would affect a very considerable number of persons.  Take the case I gave a moment ago of a man who has actually been born in a house and has lived there for fifty years.  His father died ten years ago. He has got absolutely no rights under Senator Johnson's amendment if he inherited from his father.</P>

A large number of persons who are meant to benefit under this section will lose the benefit of it if Senator Johnson's second amendment is carried.  If an amendment of that kind is carried I would agree to an amendment to the effect that such tenement was not acquired by a man or by his predecessors in title by purchase.  That is to say, that during the period of forty years, if none of his predecessors in title had been purchasers for a valuable consideration, I would agree to such amendment.</P>

      <P>I ask the House to bear in mind this fact in reference to what the Minister said about the report of the Commission.  That report contained a reference to forty years in regard to the right to a renewal of a tenancy.  It also contained a recommendation regarding the establishment of a fair rent court.  Let me put the case that a person has been in a house for twenty years and has no right to the renewal of the tenancy.  A young man married at twenty-five.  He has brought up his family there.  At the age of forty-five he has no right to a renewal of the tenancy.  He has to go out to a new house.  There is no fair rent fixed for the new house.  If the amendment is carried he is entitled to secure that there shall be a fair rent for the house that he is requiring the new tenancy for.  The landlord will also have the right to plead his case before the court if no agreement is arrived at.  So that when the Minister quotes the recommendations of the Commission he has also a right to take note of the fact that one of the recommendations which the Commission made in relation to this whole question has not been embodied in this Bill.  Now I am by no means in agreement with Senator Comyn that the Minister's suggestion is of value.  No doubt it would be of value of a kind.</P>

      <P>The kind of case that Senator Byrne referred to undoubtedly is not treated either in the Bill or in the amendment.  If I were to have my way I would like the twenty years to cover cases such as that quoted by Senator Byrne.  I would like it to cover all tenancies and even predecessors in title&mdash;at least successors in title of the original tenant who happened to be a son or a daughter.  I would like that, but that is not in the Bill.  Senator Byrne did not bring forward any amendment to that effect nor those he is associated with, so that the responsibility for not having that in the Bill lies with Senator Byrne, who has now left the Chamber.  I would like the twenty years to cover all these cases.  I am hoping to get agreement in the Seanad: that it shall only apply to the case where the father or mother, husband or wife, have got a house between them for twenty years so that they shall have the right to a renewal of the tenancy not on their own terms&mdash;I ask the House to bear that in mind&mdash;but to continue in the house on terms to be fixed by the court if the landlord and tenant cannot agree.  There is no hardship on the landlord.  I hope the Seanad will take up this reasonable plea and meet one of the most serious objections that have been levelled against this Bill not only in the Dail, but throughout the country: the feeling that this forty years is practically nullifying any value in the Bill for the residential holding. The charge has been made that the Bill may be very useful to the shopkeeper type, but that it is of no value at all to the tenant of a dwelling-house. This amendment will give it some value.  It will give some value to the house, and I hope the Seanad will support the proposal.</P>

    <P>(1)  A right of re-entry or forfeiture under any proviso or stipulation in a lease, for a breach of any covenant or condition in the lease, shall not be enforceable, by action or otherwise, unless and until the lessor serves on the lessee a notice specifying the particular breach complained of and the breach is capable of remedy, requiring the lessee to remedy the breach, and, in any case, requiring the lessee to make compensation in money for the breach, and the lessee fails, within a reasonable <Col N="2433" /> time thereafter, to remedy the breach, if it is capable of remedy, and to make reasonable compensation in money, to the satisfaction of the lessor, for the breach....</P>
    <P>(6)  This section does not extend:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(ii)  To a covenant or condition against the assigning, underletting, parting with the possession, or disposing of the land leased; or to a condition for forfeiture on the bankruptcy of the lease, or on the taking in execution of the lessee's interest.</P>
    <P>(8)  This section shall not affect the law relating to re-entry or forfeiture or release in case of non-payment of rent.</P>
    <P>Of course in the case of non-payment of rent, there was always six months. Therefore before a tenant can be put out it is necessary that an opportunity shall be given to him to remedy the breach.  He can go to the court and have the matter decided.  I should also point out that of course in this Bill we go rather far in saying that the landlord can never withhold reasonable consent to the breach of the covenant like sub-letting or anything of that kind.</P>

Having had an opportunity of considering it in the interval between the debate on the Committee Stage and this further consideration of the Bill, if he is now satisfied that under the provisions of his section, as it is drafted, the tenant who is holding is ejected for non-payment of rent has the right of renewal within the six months' period for redemption allowed by the Act of '60 I am quite satisfied.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to protect sub-tenants in case the tenancy of their immediate landlord is terminated.  It is in line with the section which was inserted in the Land Acts and was regarded as a very beneficial section. I took some pride in this amendment because I thought there was a certain finish about it.  However, it does not seem to satisfy the Minister.  He accepts the meaning of the amendment, but he will not have my words at any price.  So he puts down amendment No. 21, which reads:&mdash;</P>

To delete in lines 61-63 the words &ldquo;fifteen times the yearly amount of the rent or the greatest rent reserved by such lease&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;five times the poor law valuation of the premises comprised in such lease.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment which stood over for the considerationn of the Minister.  It is a very complicated and <Col N="2437" /> difficult amendment.  If the Minister has considered it and will not accept it I do not suppose the House will.  It relates to special provisions in relation to building leases.  Section 44 reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  In this Part of this Act the expression &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; means a lease in respect of which all the following conditions are complied with, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the land demised by such lease is situate wholly in an urban area;</P>
    <P>(b)  there are permanent buildings on such land and the portion of such land not covered by such buildings is subsidiary and ancillary to such buildings;</P>
    <P>(c)  such permanent buildings are not an improvement within the meaning of this Act;</P>
    <P>(d)  such permanent buildings were erected by the person who, at the time of such erection, was entitled to the lessee's interest under such lease;...</P>
    <P>If you look at sub-section (2) you will see that the expression &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo; means a lease complying with all the following conditions&mdash;there are a great number of conditions.  If you come down to (e) you will see&mdash;</P>
    <P>the said sum of money so paid or expended or the total of the said sums of money so respectively paid and expended (as the case may be) was not less than fifteen times the yearly amount of the rent or the greatest rent reserved by such lease.</P>
    <P>That is if a tenant spent in improvements more than fifteen times the yearly rent that tenant shall be entitled to the benefits of this section in regard to a proprietary lease.  I have been informed and, having gone into the matter, I have satisfied myself that that amount, &ldquo;fifteen times the yearly amount of the rent or the greatest rent reserved by such lease,&rdquo; is too much and that a tenant who spends something less, but still a substantial sum, should be entitled to the benefit of the Act.  What I want to substitute is &ldquo;five times the poor law valuation of the premises comprised in such lease.&rdquo;  Take a house in the suburbs of Dublin with a £40 valuation. <Col N="2438" /> If the tenant has expended £200 on that house my submission is that that tenant should be entitled to the benefits of this Act, and that &ldquo;fifteen times the yearly amount of the rent or the greatest rent reserved by such lease&rdquo; has two fatal defects.  In the first place, in the generality of cases it is too much; in the second place, it happens to be most variable in its character.  Cases have been pointed out to me where the manifest intention of the legislature would not be carried out if there was a strict adherence to the actual words of this section.  As I say, it is a difficult matter to explain clearly in a brief space of time, because it would be necessary to go very fully into the law in relation to these leases. The Minister, in the interval between the Second Reading of this Bill and the Report Stage which we have at present, I am sure has had an opportunity of considering the matter.  If he still adheres to the fifteen times the yearly rent I do not see that I am called upon to press this amendment very strenuously, but I certainly do make the suggestion that my amendment would be a considerable improvement in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the tenant who has spent a certain sum of money on the premises will have all the rights which are conferred upon him by the earlier portions of the Bill. If it is a business premises he will be entitled to have a fair rent fixed.  If he is twenty years in occupation as the Bill stands at the moment or has been fifteen years in occupation and has a short reversion he will he entitled to a new tenancy at a fair rent against his predecessor in title.  What this section is designed to meet is where there is a renewal of a building lease the person who owns the house, so to speak the owner of the bricks and mortar, has to get a renewal.  It is very difficult to say that any person who chances to be for the time being in occupation is the owner of the bricks and mortar.  Someone might pay £1,000 fine for a house and still for the purpose of keeping the covenants alive he might only pay a pound a year rent. <Col N="2439" /> In that case the person who paid the large fine was the real substantial owner.  Sometimes it becomes very difficult to say as to whether the owner of the building lease has parted with the possession or not.  That will depend on whether the tenant in occupation has paid the building lessee a very substantial fine or not.  As I say, sometimes it is difficult to decide as to whether he has parted with or retained the major interest.  It was originally in the Bill &ldquo;twenty-five times.&rdquo;  In the Dáil it was reduced to &ldquo;fifteen times the amount of the rent.&rdquo;  If the tenant has paid in fine or improvements &ldquo;fifteen times the amount of the annual rent,&rdquo; then he has acquired in the house a greater interest than the building lessee has got, and he ought to get not merely his rights under the early parts of this Bill but he ought to be made the tenant of the ground landlord.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, of course, has very skilfully informed you that there are other provisions in this Bill favourable to tenants, but his arguments all apply to the case of future improvements.  I am talking of the case of tenants of houses who have spent on permanent works in the house five times the poor law valuation. I do submit to the House that such a person is the tenant who is entitled to the relief intended.  The Minister for Justice said no, he is not entitled to the relief intended by this Act unless he has expended in the house fifteen times the greatest annual rent that has been paid.  It is a question admitting of easy determination now.  If Senators think that an expenditure of fifteen times the highest rent that has been paid is necessary in order to give one of these lessees the benefit of this Act, then of course they will have to support the Minister's contention.  I submit that an improving tenant, a tenant who has expended five times the poor law valuation in the case, say, of an ordinary house in Rathmines, Pembroke or Blackrock&mdash;a sum altogether of about £200 or £300&mdash;is entitled to consideration and should receive the benefits intended by this measure.</P>

      <P>I would like some light upon this matter.  As far as I can understand the argument, if the house is a considerable house and the poor law valuation is high, then the Bill is very much better for the tenant without the amendment being inserted in it because the poor law valuation is not merely the valuation of the land but also of the premises.  I would like some instances in terms of cash.  It seems to me the Bill is better than the amendment from the point of view of the tenant.</P>

      <P>It would really mean that five times the poor law valuation of a house would be worth more than half the house.  If I were to take particular instances I would be inclined to say that that is not so.  A house would then be worth only ten times the poor law valuation.  I do not know any house in Dublin City where that would be the case.  You would be giving a man a proprietary lease over and above the man who really owned the property.  Take a small house in Drumcondra the poor law valuation of which is £19 and the rent of which is probably £36.  Under Senator Comyn's amendment the expenditure of £95 would give a man a proprietary lease in that house which would probably be worth £400 or £500. The equities would not be met there at all.  Under the Bill the amount would be fifteen times the rental and certainly that man would be entitled to the house.</P>

      <P>The rights which are conferred by this Part of the Bill, Part V. Let the Minister not interrupt me if he possibly can restrain himself. The Minister very plausibly said: &ldquo;If a tenant has spent as much on the house as is equal to the value of the landlord's interest, then give the tenant the rights under Part V of this Act.&rdquo;  Where does the Minister get his arbitrary 50 per cent.?  Under the common law the tenant has no right at all, so you are giving the tenant rights which he previously did not possess.  I say you should give these rights to the tenant who has spent on the house five times the poor law valuation.  The Minister says &ldquo;No; do not give these rights unless he has spent a sum equal to 15 times the highest rent that has ever been paid under the lease.&rdquo;  My figure is arbitrary and the Minister's figure is arbitrary.  The Minister, in order to capture your attention, says &ldquo;fifty-fifty.&rdquo;  There is no fundamental <Col N="2442" /> rule, there is no rule of law which makes sacred the 50 per cent.  Which the Minister has talked about so freely both now and on the last occasion.  It is a difficult matter to deal with.  He puts the arbitrary figure of 15 times the highest rent that has ever been paid in respect of the house.  That has two defects.  In the first place, it is too high, and in the second place, it is not a certain measure.  My measure, at all events, is a certain measure.  It is based on the poor law valuation, which is or ought to be uniform.</P>

The ground rent in each case is £8.  Fifteen times the rent would be £120.  The valuation is £26, and five times the valuation would be £130.  If the amendment were carried into effect the tenants in this block of 20 houses would be worse off than they would be if the Bill is left as it is.

      <P>I beg to move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 8, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;wages&rdquo; in line 19 to insert the words &ldquo;for normal hours of work (exclusive of overtime).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I pointed out on the Committee Stage that there was a risk that under paragraph (d), which fixes the maximum hours of work, exclusive of overtime, it is possible for an employer in a designated trade to employ his apprentices the maximum hours of work fixed by the regulations, to employ them continuously several days a week, and they would be unentitled to overtime. It was said that the work of apprentices would be regulated by the practices of journeymen in the business, but that is a mistake.  It is, unfortunately, true that many establishments are manned by apprentices and such businesses could carry on with apprentices only, letting the journeymen or journeywomen, as these workers are called, clear away.  In fact, it is quite possible within this section, under paragraph (d), for apprentices to be kept daily one or two hours over the maximum that would be fixed.  The amendment is intended to be a kind of check upon that practice, if it were ever adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment seeks to achieve a minimum rate of wages per hour worked, so that if the wages to be <Col N="2447" /> fixed are for the normal hours of work there would be additional pay if the apprentices are working overtime.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is an additional rate of pay for overtime work would act as a check upon the possibility of evasion of the regulations by calling the excessive hours overtime.  If this amendment is carried I probably will not move amendment 2, notwithstanding my belief that it would be better that the words &ldquo;exclusive of overtime&rdquo; in paragraph (d) were deleted. If they are to be retained in paragraph (d) they ought to be inserted in paragraph (c), so that we could be sure there would be some kind of check upon a possible evasion of the regulations and, therefore, of the Act by calling working hours overtime if they exceed the maximum fixed by the regulations.  It is an attempt to make the section watertight.  I think it is subject to a very great leakage as it stands at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to think the amendment really defeats its own object.  Under the Bill, the Apprenticeship Committee has power to fix rates of wages and it can make special arrangements for overtime.  As regards the Senator's two amendments, the first one provides for normal hours of work.  That would exclude any provision for certain rates for overtime. Looking at the second amendment, if we are to take out the words &ldquo;exclusive of overtime&rdquo; we will also preclude the Committee from having any rates for overtime.  This is, of course, very largely a voluntary Bill, and there are certain trades where overtime is more or less usual and where the Committee dealing with this thing will have to make provision for overtime. When you have the Committee you have both sides represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the words set out in these amendments rather limit the powers of the Committee under this Bill.  There are certain trades where overtime is not usual, but where any specific provisions for overtime would be undesirable and would work against the apprentices.  There are certain trades I know something about where <Col N="2448" /> it is necessary for a small amount of extra time to be worked at Christmas, and where reasonable employers&mdash;and they still exist&mdash;are enabled to give a very considerable concession here and there to their assistants in the way of hours, which they will be paid for. Facilities can be given them at times when there is not the same large volume of business.  There are many trades in which a fixed rate for overtime would militate against the employee, not necessarily against the employer.</P>

      <P>I would be inclined to agree with Senator Douglas's construction of the amendment.  I think the mover of the amendment might reconsider the position in the light of what has been said.  No doubt he has thought out the amendment and has formed some opinion as to what its effect will be.  To a person not very fully acquainted with the matter, and looking at it with a perfectly unbiassed mind, I am of the opinion that the proper construction of the amendment is the construction which has been put upon it by Senator Douglas.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the effect of the amendment is going to be.  I did gather from the Senator on the Committee Stage that he was apprehensive that there might be overtime in excess worked.  I do not think that he is going to stop that by this amendment unless his aim is that by the use of the words &ldquo;normal hours of work (exclusive of overtime)&rdquo; overtime rates can only be struck on some basis other than hours test.  If that is the case, then his amendment is completely unacceptable.  To avoid such a construction I think the amendment had better be considered as phrased &ldquo;over a normal working week, exclusive of overtime.&rdquo;  I do not know that the fears the Senators gave expression to in Committee are very real.  The only point that can be dealt with in this Bill is overtime hours worked at certain rates by apprentices.  It is inconceivable to me that any factory owner is going to keep apprentices working excessive <Col N="2449" /> overtime hours if the main bulk of the workers in the factory are not also to be kept working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>By the extension of the term &ldquo;learners,&rdquo; that might apply in some factories, but they would be very few.  But surely that is going to be a matter for the general body of employees who will be apprentices to meet that situation?  I do not think there is such a danger as the Senator seems to apprehend.  I rather think, on the other consideration, that paragraph (c) is very clearly open to the interpretation that has been put upon it by Senator Douglas and Senator Comyn.  There is no prohibition of these minimum rates being split up into minimum rates for normal hours and rates for overtime hours.  That would be a matter for the Committee to decide on.  The Minister would have to consider afterwards whether in circumstances in each case he would confirm the decision of the Committee.  I do not think the apprehensions expressed have been put before us in a sufficiently strong way to have the scheme of the Act interrupted at this moment.  An amendment may slip through here which would have the effect of ruling out overtime.  If it does it is going to mean that a certain number of trades that might otherwise come inside the apprenticeship code will not come in.  By doing that you will be limiting the number of trades brought under the scope of an otherwise good Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>From the beginning I have never been satisfied with the method of treatment that I have followed in this amendment; that it was going to do the work I wanted to be done.  My trouble is that there is a real danger of the purpose of this section <Col N="2450" /> being defeated in regard to maximum hours of work.  The object of the amendment is to try to minimise that danger.  The Minister has hinted, I cannot say that he has done more than that, that it would be within the power of the Committee to make minimum rates of wages for apprentices over the normal working week and to make another rate of wages so as to indicate that there shall be wages paid for every hour worked as overtime.  If there was any assurance that that was likely to be done, that there was to be a wage standard and we had the rules before us, that would meet the purpose I am seeking in this amendment.  The next paragraph which has to be thought of in reference to this is likely to be evaded.  I put this to the Minister: that you have in a particular trade a body of employers and a body of workers who are agreed upon certain rates of wages and maximum hours.  In the Apprenticeship Committee they agree upon a certain scale which the Minister confirms.  In that particular trade these rules become law.  But even in that trade there are some employers who want to stretch their liberties as far as possible.  I had an instance related to me last night of a particular trade in respect of which I would expect an Apprenticeship Committee to be set up.  In that trade there are two journeymen and fourteen apprentices.  The business is run by apprentices.  The maximum hours may be fixed.  These may be the maximum hours fixed and worked by the factory, but the apprentices work overtime.  In that way they defeat the Bill the apprentices working overtime at the minimum rate of wages fixed by the rules.  That is the kind of case that I wish to see met.  I cannot see that it is met by the Bill as it stands, and I am not so sure that my own amendment meets it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 2. Section 8 (1).  To delete in line 23 the words &ldquo;(exclusive of overtime).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was put down because of the fear that the previous amendment would not meet the case and would not be accepted.  Having regard to what I have said, I feel that the insertion of these words in the Bill &ldquo;exclusive of overtime&rdquo; is going to make it possible for a firm such as I have just mentioned to defeat the intentions of the Act and the rules that will be made.  This is the paragraph of the rules that deals with the maximum number of hours of work &ldquo;exclusive of overtime.&rdquo;  By the deletion of these three words we would have the rules fixing the maximum number of hours which may be worked in any week.  That would allow apprentices to be worked five days in the week with five days overtime, provided they were allowed off-time for the sixth day.  It would not destroy the intention regarding seasonal trades or cases in which there was a special rush of work so long as the maximum number of hours in the week did not prevail for the apprentices.  In respect to the kind of establishment that Senator Douglas referred to, it is not run by apprentices, and will not be run by apprentices.  The absence of the apprentices for these few hours would not militate against the activities of the business.  But if these three words, &ldquo;exclusive of overtime,&rdquo; are retained it would be within the power of any dissentient employer to work his apprentices any number of hours he wishes so far as this Act affects him, because he can call those hours overtime.  I think it is quite a mistake for the Minister to feel sheltered by what he calls the practice of the business as a whole: that the number of hours worked by the regular workers will determine the number of hours to be worked by the apprentices. It is, unfortunately, true in a number of trades which one would expect to see coming within the provisions of this Bill&mdash;it is true of many establishments in these trades&mdash;that the majority of the workers are apprentices within the definitions in the Bill. <Col N="2452" /> Consequently, the section itself and the rules relating to the maximum number of hours worked will be defeated simply by calling the extra hours overtime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. It would seem to me as if the position which Senator Johnson postulates might be met, perhaps, in another way by adjourning the Report Stage of this Bill and inserting words to this effect: &ldquo;and also the maximum number of hours of overtime.&rdquo;  I suggest that these words might be inserted before the words &ldquo;which may be worked.&rdquo;  I think if the paragraph were amended to read in that way it would be more expressive and give greater protection.</P>
      <P>The paragraph, I presume, has been drawn by a draftsman who is not familiar with ordinary trade union agreements.  As is well known, rates of pay, rates for overtime, the maximum number of hours and so on are all important factors in the case of trade union agreements.  It is the present wording of the paragraph that is worrying Senator Johnson.  I think that as it is worded there is cause for anxiety. If the amendment to the paragraph I have suggested were made, it would, I think, meet the position.  I wonder would the Minister favourably consider my suggestion to have the Report Stage postponed so that an amendment on the lines I have indicated might be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to think that the paragraph would be better without the words &ldquo;exclusive of overtime.&rdquo; I am not certain, however, that that is going to meet possible difficulties. In the case of a Bill of this kind you cannot meet by way of legislation all the difficulties that are likely to arise.  The wisest thing, in my opinion, would be to give the Committee the maximum amount of discretion. If the Minister were prepared to accept an amendment on the lines suggested by Senator O'Farrell I would not offer any objection to it.  If he is not prepared to do that I just wish to put this point to him, that on the whole I think the words &ldquo;exclusive of overtime,&rdquo; will in a sense be restrictive on <Col N="2453" /> the Committee.  I think it would be better if you were to say that the Committee will have power to make rules in relation to the maximum number of hours and leave it there.  It is not a great stretch of interpretation to say that the Committee can divide these hours into certain types of work.  There is the danger that if you say &ldquo;exclusive of overtime&rdquo; that where you have a joint committee you will never be able to get agreement.  Therefore, you may have considerably longer hours than are necessary because of the fact that there may be certain rush periods which will have to be met.  If you say &ldquo;exclusive of overtime&rdquo; the result may be that you will have hours fixed which will include all hours, including what would be normal overtime.  The words &ldquo;exclusive of overtime&rdquo; might have a restrictive effect on the Committee, and, so far as I can see, the more discretion you give the Committee the better.</P>

      <P>The concluding words of paragraph (d) of Section 8 are: &ldquo;but not so as to increase the maximum numbers of such hours appointed by or under any other enactment.&rdquo;  That phrase throws the mind back to other enactments that have been passed dealing with the hours of labour both for ordinary work and overtime.  I think the sub-section as it stands is really better than it would appear if the words in brackets, &ldquo;exclusive of overtime,&rdquo; were struck out.  I do not profess to be an authority on the question, and of course I would have the greatest possible respect for any views expressed from the Labour Benches.  If they press the amendment I would be inclined to support them.  I do not say that they ought to press it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I would like to narrow the discussion to the danger that might seriously be considered as being ahead of trades in connection with the operations of the Bill.  Senator Johnson gave an example of a trade or trades.  I think he said the majority of trades.  He indicated that the conditions to which I am going to refer did hold for a big number of trades, where the apprentices <Col N="2454" /> were in a majority amongst the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Senator's point was that in the majority of establishments in the case of some trades apprentices are in a majority. The proportion in the one case he gave was fourteen apprentices to two workers.  I did not gather from the Senator that he thought that should not be the proportion.  If that should not be the proportion it would have to be met hereafter in sub-section (2) of Section 8.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is optional.  I am taking it that the condition to which the Senator referred holds in some establishments in certain trades. The position is that we are either to get these trades to come in under the Bill or they will remain out.  If we get them in and if the majority in the trades are against that big disproportion as between apprentices and workers it can be met.  The difficulty that the Senator sees might be met by the Committee exercising its option under sub-section (2).  The Senator is here proposing to leave out the words &ldquo;exclusive of overtime.&rdquo;  Arising out of what Senator Douglas said, if you leave out the words &ldquo;exclusive of overtime&rdquo; you may throw the Committee back on this rule which must be made, and it may be that they must apply it by thinking of all hours, including overtime. To my mind, that will drive them to arrange such an enormous number of hours that it is going to have embarrassments and difficulties of its own.  Senator Douglas made the point that by analogy with what is said under paragraph (c) (1), if you leave out the words &ldquo;exclusive of overtime&rdquo; it may be that the Committee will have power to split up and appoint maximum hours normal, and maximum hours overtime.  I would have to consider that.</P>

The normal practice with regard to paragraph (c) and with regard to paragraph (d), so far as the trade unions are concerned, differs.  For instance, under paragraph (c) the situation is differently treated with regard to wages and hours.  The usual practice at the moment is that you fix rates of wages for a normal working week, and you then fix overtime rates, but you do not fix a maximum number of overtime hours. You get after the overtime hours by making it too dear for the employer to keep workers at work for any lengthy period on overtime.  If paragraph (c) could be read as we have discussed it here previously, that there must be rules made with regard to the minimum rates for the normal hours and minimum rates for overtime, I think there is a considerable lever in the hands of the Committee for dealing with this question of the prevention of excessive overtime in the case of apprentices.  I think we have that position at present. If we are to go any further, and if it is possible to introduce an amendment of substance on the Report Stage&mdash;I am not sufficiently, familiar with the Standing Orders of the House to be able to say whether that is possible or not&mdash;then I suggest we adopt the proposal of Senator Douglas to leave in the words &ldquo;exclusive of overtime&rdquo; where they occur in paragraph (d) and put in the optional section that the Committee may make rules with regard to the maximum number of hours of overtime, but not imposing that on them as an obligation.  A point of procedure arises there.  I am not able to say whether it would be possible to do that on this stage.</P>

Senator Farren, even if he only got amendment No. 12, would be re-establishing the position that he tried to establish on the Committee Stage, because the position taken up there is that unless rules are made regarding the taking of premiums, then premiums are not allowable.  In amendment 4 my proposal is that the Committee may make rules either prohibiting premiums or permitting the taking of premiums after fixing the amount.  In amendment 8 I say that where premiums are prohibited then it is unlawful to take premiums, and where they are permitted it is only lawful to take them within the amount that has been allowed.  That was what I promised to consider on the last stage.  I am speaking now of amendments 4 and 8 in opposition to 3 and 12.</P>

      <P>Section 12.  To delete the words &ldquo;with the consent in writing of the apprentice or his guardian&rdquo; inserted in Committee after the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; in line 48 and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;with the consent in writing of the apprentice or, if a minor, of his parent or guardian (if any).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was discussed on the last occasion.  The Minister has submitted an alternative reading to my amendment. The spirit is the same, but I am not quite satisfied that the ages that the Minister has put down could meet the case.  I have referred in my amendment to &ldquo;the consent in writing of the apprentice or, if a minor, of his parent or guardian (if any).&rdquo; I suppose a minor is less than twenty-one.  I agree that perhaps a young man of eighteen is as competent to deal with this kind of a thing as a young man of twenty-one, <Col N="2459" /> but I am not prepared to say that the young man of sixteen is sufficiently conversant with the ways of the world and the liabilities he is entering on with a new employer.  The Minister's amendment, where it refers to &ldquo;the consent of, in case the apprentice has attained the age of sixteen years,&rdquo; states that in such case the assent of the apprentice is all that is required, and if he has not attained that age the parent must give his consent.  I think the age of sixteen is too low to allow an apprentice to give his consent to be transferred from one employer to another.  It seems to me that we ought to establish a higher age of consent for an apprentice in this matter.  I would ask the Minister if he would be prepared to modify his amendment and put eighteen instead of sixteen.  If he would do so I would be quite prepared to meet him on that point and move his amendment instead of my own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>While on that point, may I draw the attention of the Minister to a question which arises on <Col N="2460" /> this section with a view to getting his view upon it?  Earlier in the evening, in dealing with another amendment, the Minister said that in the case of an employer, the majority of whose employees were apprentices, the matter was in the hands of the apprentices.  I would like to have the Minister's reading of this section, which says that any apprentice entering employment by way of apprenticeship shall be deemed after the passing of the Act to be employed under an agreement signed by such person and his employer whereby such employer agrees to employ such person and such person agrees to serve such employer for the period of apprenticeship specified in such rules.</P>
      <P>This is really a very important provision. The answer that the Minister gives will, undoubtedly, affect the working of this Act.  Do I understand from the Minister that when an apprentice is taken on in a designated trade he will be deemed to have signed an agreement to serve a period and does that mean that the apprentice would be breaking the law if he leaves that employer or takes such steps as would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the employer to evade the provisions of that maximum hours' fear that I have?  Is it under this section an obligation upon the employer, once he has taken into employment an apprentice, that there shall be continuous employment for the period that is fixed by the committee?  Would the practice that prevails at present in certain industries be disallowed, that when times are slack learners are paid off for the slack period and re-employed when business gets busy, or are we to take it that under this section once an apprentice is taken on in a factory the obligation on either side is to remain in employment continuously for the period of the apprenticeship?  It raises a very important point, and I would like to have the Minister's view upon the construction of the section.</P>

      <P>Do I take the Senator to mean that he wants to have construed that part of Section 12 which states: &ldquo;Whereby such employer <Col N="2461" /> agrees to employ such person and such person agrees to serve such employer for the period of apprenticeship specified in such rules&rdquo;?  If that is what he wants to have construed it is as plain as daylight that it does not mean that there must be continuous employment. The man's contract of apprenticeship would last through that period, but there may be breaks.  There may be Sundays and periods of strikes.  There may be periods when there would be no work done, but still the agreement goes on.  The thing is as plain as daylight.</P>

      <P>Before Section 22 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>22.&mdash;(1)  Where rules regulating apprenticeship premiums made by an Apprenticeship Committee are for the time being in force the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  if such rules prohibit the taking of an apprenticeship premium in respect of the employment of a person by way of apprenticeship in the designated trade for which such Committee is established in the district of such Committee, then it shall not be lawful for any person (in this section referred to as an employer) carrying on in such district such trade to take or receive in respect of such employment an apprenticeship premium, and</P>

      <P>I move amendment 9:</P>
      <P>Section 22.  To delete the section.</P>
      <P>From our point of view, this is the crucial clause in the Bill.  As I said on the earlier stages, if this section is allowed to remain in it will be very difficult indeed for the trades unions to co-operate in the working of the Act.  It obviously is directed&mdash;in fact it was openly stated in the Dáil that it was directed&mdash;against the possibility that the trades unions may, in the course of a trade dispute, interfere with the employer's right to employ an apprentice under the Act.  That is to say, if a dispute occurs between trade unions and employers in a case, let us say, of a rule fixing the number of apprentices in a particular establishment, and if in the course of that trade dispute it were found desirable by the trade unions to urge that the apprentices should come out on strike and not assist the employer to defeat the workmen, they would be immediately amenable under this section, and every person who sought to influence the apprentice in that way would be liable to the penalty indicated in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One who is familiar with trade union employment can visualise many occasions which might arise in the course of trade disputes whereby the provision within this section could be invoked to help to defeat the unions in the course of a dispute.  I will just <Col N="2463" /> give one instance, a kind of thing that might well happen.  You have provided in the Bill for district committees. In a particular occupation, let us say, in a particular district which is very badly organised from the trade union point of view, a committee is set up and certain rules are made. Probably some specific number of apprentices is allowed in respect of a particular establishment.  That number of apprentices in that particular establishment is far in excess of the number under the rules in practice in other districts in that particular trade. As time passes the trade is better organised from the trade union's point of view and the employers are immediately approached in regard to the number of apprentices, or a strike may occur on quite different counts not affecting the number of apprentices at all.  But in the course of the conduct of that strike the apprentices are invoked by the employer for the purpose of defeating the strike.  The probability of this section being called into play where trade disputes arise is very great, and though I have no doubt the Minister will indicate difficulties or improbabilities of that kind we have very good reason to know that whatever the intentions of Acts of Parliament may be, the law courts can be induced to give decisions which were never contemplated by the framers of Acts of Parliament.  We on these benches, speaking for the trade unions, whether local trade unions, craft unions, or the general unions of men and women workers, who are not craftsmen, and speaking for the unions not only in Dublin but throughout the country, can say that there is very great fear that this particular section has a certain deliberate purpose of making it difficult for a strike to be conducted by a trade union, and to make it easy for employers to use the apprentices for the purpose of defeating the trade unionists on strike.  The fact that that fear prevails, I personally fear, will mean that the trade unions will not co-operate in the working of this Act or the setting up of apprenticeship committees.</P>
    <P>From the beginning the unions, and particularly the craft unions, have been rather anxious that there should be as <Col N="2464" /> much co-operation as possible for the purpose of making the experiment&mdash; the Minister undoubtedly has designated this whole scheme experimental &mdash;and of giving it a fair trial.  They feel very resentful that on the Report Stage of the Bill in the Dáil this particular section was introduced with the speech that was made in introducing it by Deputy Good.  The whole argument clearly aimed at the possibility of a dispute with the trade unions, and the consequences are that the unions are very unlikely to co-operate in the working of the Act.  I therefore ask the House to agree to the deletion of the section.  I may point out that there can be no prosecution of the employer for failing to carry out any rule unless with the sanction of the Minister. Equally, of course, there can be no prosecution of the workman for breaches of the Act without the sanction of the Minister.  I am not sure whether that particular provision regarding prosecutions would apply to a breach of this section, but I see by Section 32 &ldquo;Proceedings for an offence under this Act shall not be instituted except by or with the consent of the Minister or an authorised officer.&rdquo;  I say for the reassurance of those who might be affected by the arguments of Deputy Good, in introducing this section, that there is no likelihood of any prosecution of an employer for failing to carry out any of the rules under the Act, without the consent of the Minister and, therefore, there is no necessity to retain in the Bill this particular section, which is clearly directed against trade union action in the conduct of trade disputes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I stated on the Second Reading Stage that, in my opinion, if this section was retained, trade unions, particularly craft unions, would refuse to co-operate under that section of the Bill.  The Minister, on more than one occasion, stressed the point that this Bill asks for voluntary co-operation between employers and the workers in the designated trades for the purpose of carrying into effect the terms of this Bill.  This Bill is the result of a Special Committee which was set up to consider and advise on this whole question of apprentices.  The Committee that made the report never made any such <Col N="2465" /> recommendation as is contained in this particular section.  The Bill as drafted did not contain this particular section. It was only on the Report Stage in the Dáil that an amendment was moved to put this new section into the Bill.  I want to say frankly that we are well aware of the source from which it emanated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We understand what it is intended to do.  There is no misunderstanding about it.  I say deliberately here that I have got into consultation with the representatives of most of the trades in the crafts since this Bill was first brought before the Seanad.  I stated on my own authority on that occasion that if this section remained in the Bill I thought the trade unions concerned would not co-operate under it. I took the opportunity of consulting the representatives of the various trades in the craft industry, and I have their authority for saying that if this section remains in the Bill they will refuse to co-operate under it.  I am making that statement definitely. This section means exactly this: In the old craft unions, particularly in the building industry, the members of the craft union had control of the apprentices. The apprentices became boy members of the trade unions and in most cases were indentured to the trade unions.  An attempt is made in this section to give complete control of the apprentices to the employers. We are sufficiently wise, from our experience of many employers, to know that if they are allowed to get in apprentices in the proportion that would be allowed to them in this Bill, they would be used to the detriment of the workmen themselves, when trade disputes would take place.  For that reason, I am stating definitely that if this section remains in the Bill the trade unions will not co-operate.  I want to go further and say that this is the point of view of the trade unions.  I have only got to say that the only member of the Government Party in the Dáil who carries a trade union card saw the danger signal and voted against his own Party on this particular amendment.  That is a statement of fact.  I think that ought clearly to bring home to the members of this House that the point of view of the trade unions is this: That it caused a <Col N="2466" /> man to vote against his own Party on a section like this.  He saw the danger of it.  They are perfectly satisfied that if this section remains in the Bill, so far as the craft unions are concerned the Bill will be a dead letter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrington</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to oppose this amendment.  I do so for a great many reasons, one of them being the reason that has been put forward both by the proposer and the seconder of the amendment, the threat that they put forward that if this section is allowed to remain in the Bill the trade unions will refuse to co-operate in the working of it.  As far as I can see, and I have been discussing this question with a number of members&mdash;it would be more correct to say that several members interested in trades through the country have been discussing it with me&mdash;I do not think, and they did not think that the country need have any fear if that threat was carried into effect.  A great many of us do not believe that this Bill is going to be any help in creating what is badly wanted in this country, extra employment or extra industries.  I have known a great many cases in which industries of every sort have been injured, hampered, and in some cases destroyed, by trade union action.  I could name many cases.  Knowing that, putting extra powers in the hands of trade unions to foment strikes and to injure the business of the country is a thing that I, for one, will always vote against, and I hope that this Seanad will not agree to the deletion of this section.</P>

      <P>I am also opposed to this amendment, but not for the reason given by Senator Barrington, with which I have no sympathy whatever. I do not think that you ought to pass any amendment for the purpose of making this Act a failure.  I am led to believe that the attitude taken by the two Labour Senators is rather unworthy of the attitude they have taken to this Bill as a whole.  They have told us emphatically that the section means a certain thing, and that the trade unions will not work the Bill which, I think, is a rather unfortunate method of approaching the matter.  I have tried to read this amendment as carefully as I could, and I have read it with reference to the improved wording which the Minister <Col N="2467" /> suggests in the following amendment and, frankly, I cannot see in this section anything like what has been suggested by either of the two Labour Senators who have spoken.  I think they are so much afraid of the source from which it emanated in the Dáil that they are not able to take this thing purely and solely on its own merits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason why this should not be examined entirely on its merits.  I am quite satisfied that there is no desire on the part of employers of trade unionists, who are interested in this Bill, to see a provision of this Bill used on either side of a strike.  It is just as important that it should not be used for the purpose of injuring a trade union in a <i>bona fide</i> strike, as that it should not be used for the purpose of injuring or hampering an employer in the case of a <i>bona fide</i> strike.  If this be used in either way there is a danger that it will defeat its own purpose.  There is, in the Bill, provision by which an employer may be prosecuted subject, I know, to the consent of the Minister, and you have provisions by which an employee will be prosecuted if he breaks the rules made by the Committee.  In this section you are providing if certain other persons do certain actions&mdash;I am taking the improved wording in the amendment&mdash;&ldquo;for the purpose either of preventing or obstructing or impeding&rdquo; they shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that any ordinary legal action that may be taken in connection with the strike is not for the purpose of preventing the employer carrying out this Act and could not be so held.  If it should turn out in practice that the court did so hold&mdash;I do not believe that would be the case&mdash;I think it would be a matter for further Government action.  To take the position that certain trade unions are afraid that the court may so rule is not, I think, a reasonable attitude.  The amendment seeks to delete this section, which provides that it shall not be lawful for any person to do any act or thing which would prevent an employer carrying on <Col N="2468" /> a designated trade from complying with the rules of the Committee.  I do not believe that the section could be used for the purpose of preventing any legal action in accordance with the law of the land.  I agree entirely with Labour Senators that it is highly undesirable that it should be so used.  I do not believe that that is the intention underlying the section, and I am perfectly certain the Government had not that intention.</P>
    <P>If Senators will read the section in conjunction with subsequent amendments that are proposed to it, and which are the result of careful consideration following upon various points raised by Senators, I am sure they will agree with me.  I urge those who speak on behalf of trade unions not to take an impossible attitude towards the Bill, not to adopt the attitude they are adopting until it has been so held.</P>

      <P>I am greatly surprised that a Senator of the experience and skill of Senator Farren should use here as an argument why we should vote in a particular way that organisations outside this Assembly will do a certain thing if we do not vote according as they desire.  That sort of thing is inclined to prejudice judgment where judgment should be unprejudiced and where we should try to do the best thing in the interest of the country generally.  A threat like that will not have the slightest influence upon me, and I hope it will not have any influence one way or the other upon any other Senator.  Neither am I influenced by being told the source from which this Section 22 comes.  We are considering this question, I hope, on its merits, without having any regard whatever to the source from which the section comes or to what any organisation outside this House may do in case we arrive at a certain conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am dealing with Section 22 on its merits.  I am of the opinion that it is an unnecessary section, and I urge the House to hold that it is an unnecessary and a provocative section, and, consequently, it ought to be rejected.  I am voting for Senator Johnson's amendment, <Col N="2469" /> notwithstanding Senator Farren's advocacy of it.  The section sets out: &ldquo;Where any rules made by an Apprenticeship Committee under this Act are for the time being in force it shall not be lawful for any person to do any act or thing whereby an employer carrying on in the district of such Committee the designated trade for which such Committee is established is prevented from or obstructed or impeded in complying with such rules.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The general law is strong enough to secure, and is perfectly fitted to secure, that the employer is not to be interfered with in dealing with his apprentices and in carrying out the rules which govern apprenticeship.  If the general law is strong enough, why is this section introduced?  The source of the section has been mentioned&mdash; a most distinguished member of the Dáil.  I deprecate any reference to its source.  I say that the section is unnecessary and it has provoked Senator Farren into an indiscretion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to argue against and not in favour of the section that is in the Bill.  Rather will I argue in favour of the section with the amendments that will in due course be proposed.  In order to make it quite clear what the section, with the amendments, will represent, I propose to read it in its amended form:&mdash;&ldquo;Where any rules made by an apprenticeship committee under this Act are for the time being in force it shall not be lawful for any person to do any act or thing for the purpose either of preventing or obstructing or impeding an employer carrying on in the district of such committee the designated trade for which such committee is established from complying with such rules.&rdquo;  May I segregate from it the important words: &ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person to do any act or <Col N="2470" /> thing for the purpose either of preventing or obstructing or impeding an employer from complying with such rules&rdquo;?  What rules?  The rules that have been made by apprenticeship committees.</P>
      <P>Let us see the framework of the Bill once more.  How are these rules to be made?  Only when the employers and employees in certain trades have agreed to have these trades designated, the rules will be made by bodies where employers and employees will be represented in equal numbers, with possibly three people from outside, and these rules have to be confirmed by the Minister. We propose, under these circumstances, to have a section setting out that it shall not be lawful for anybody to do any act or thing which will result in preventing an employer carrying out the rules.</P>
      <P>There was a lot of talk about the source of emanation of this section. Senator Johnson has spoken of it as being directed against trade union action.  If it can be proved that it is against legitimate trade union action, except in regard to apprenticeship conditions, then I will get the section wiped out.  I would like, in passing, to say that I do not think the text of the speech of the mover of the resolution bears out that contention.  I think he did say that it was to prevent trade union activity by way of a strike operating against the apprenticeship rules, operating directly and only for the purpose of preventing the apprenticeship rules.  I think that is perfectly sound.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnson gave examples, and I think there crept into his speech the idea that trade union activity of the strike type might have to be resorted to in order to get these rules changed.  But the rules are subject to modification by the Committee.  They may be repealed, amended or modified and there is the same representation on the Committee to get the rules further and better considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not in that form, but there is provision made for the representation of people who are representative of the workers in a particular business.  Ordinarily speaking, we would apply to the trade union where there is such in existence and where they would be clearly the representative people.  The Senator mentioned that he could see two types of cases in which this section would be an impediment.  He spoke of the possibility of a strike happening and, in the course of that strike, people being called out, with the result that an employer would not be able to go on teaching the apprentices.  That is ruled out by the terms of the amended section.</P>
      <P>The Senator said that there might be cases in districts in the country where the number of apprentices allowed would be larger than the number allowed elsewhere and that that would happen in districts where trade unions were not organised.  The implication of the speech was that the trade unions might in that district become better organised and might want to restrict the number of apprentices. They proposed to do it, not by getting the rules amended for the district, but by having a strike on that point. I consider in these circumstances only it is necessary to have the same sort of prohibition of impeding the employer in carrying out the rules as we have in the series of sections against the employer, from Section 13 to Section 20, including both.  We have there a series of prohibitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 13, where any rules regulating the minimum rates of wages made by the Committee are in force, it is unlawful to pay other rates, and any employer who fails to comply with the section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to prosecution and fine. That is repeated in Section 14 with regard to the keeping of records relating to wages paid to apprentices; in Section 15 with regard to the employment of people above the maximum number of hours; in Section 16 with regard to the keeping of records of hours of work; in Section 17 with regard to the prohibition of people not possessing the prescribed educational qualifications, and so on.  It is there provided that it is unlawful for the employer to do certain things, and there is a <Col N="2472" /> penalty involved if he should do them.</P>
    <P>This section is clearly and definitely limited to trade union activity directed against the employer carrying out the regulations.  I think that is right in the circumstances.  The people represening the workers can look to the Committee to get the rules amended or modified.  If they do not take that course and decide to take the course of trade union activity, then they ought to be penalised.  On that point we have a threat that there is going to be no trade union co-operation.  This Bill, it must be remembered, is based on a voluntary principle, and, of course, it is quite right for Senators with a trade union outlook to give us warning that there is less likelihood of trade union co-operation under certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>What are the circumstances?  Senators may argue that the section, as amended, is not clear and that you may have trade union activity with regard to wages.  At the moment the section as it reads only prevents activity taken for the purpose of preventing an employer complying with the rules.  I hold that that particular section should be there.  Alternatively, and I think this reduces the Bill to an absurdity, let the Committee have power to make rules and cut out all these sections from 13 onwards which state that it shall not be lawful for an employer to do certain things; do not impose any penalties on employers, and then where is the Bill? It will really be nothing but a series of pious resolutions, and will have no force.  You will have people on the Committee carrying out their work, but the moment a contract is made the whole thing can be discarded.  That reduces the Bill to an absurdity.</P>
    <P>A lot of people complain that there is no compulsion in this Bill.  It is compulsory in the sense that people should keep their agreements.  If you adopt the other course which I have outlined you reduce the Bill entirely to a farce. Senator O'Farrell said that under this Bill an employer would enter into complete control of the apprentice.  He may under certain conditions which have been agreed to as between the employer and the employee.  There is better provision for the apprentice in the matter of teaching and training than ever there was before.  To say that the employer enters into complete <Col N="2473" /> control of the apprentice is really a misreading of the whole scheme.  Section 22 means only that an employer will not be prevented from carrying out his obligations towards apprentices by reason of trade union activity directed definitely and clearly against that point.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Douglas that there may be apprehension on two points.  The Minister has to approve of prosecutions before they are taken.  The implication in Senator Johnson's speech was that you could rely on the Minister holding up a prosecution against an employer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest any thing in the way the Minister now relates. I pointed out that where an employer was obviously prevented from carrying out the provisions of the Act by virtue of strike action, the Minister's consent to a prosecution in such a case might be withheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator also mentioned that the Minister can preclude prosecution where he is not satisfied that the trade union activity is directed against the employer so as to prevent him from carrying out his obligations under the apprenticeship scheme.  The Minister has a discretion with regard to both.  If the employer is protected from unjust action, surely the employee is protected under this section where the Minister is put in as a barrier?  The other point that Senator Douglas mentioned remains.  This House has shown that it is anxious to amend legislation where it is clear the legislation is warped by court judgment away from the original intention. It is not a difficult matter to get an amending Bill put through.  If it did <Col N="2474" /> happen that a prosecution passing the Minister did distort the obvious intention of the Oireachtas, there would be clearly a call for Government action by way of amendment.  I hold there is no case made that this section should not be passed and there is no serious case made that the apprehensions of the two Senators are real.  It is but right that we should have a prohibition in the other case just as we have against the employer in many sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the last remarks of the Minister, I would like to remind him and the House of the probabilities. All the signs are that the point of view expressed by Senator Barrington here to-day and a Deputy in the Dáil yesterday are likely to dominate the legislature of this country at some future time.  To rely, as the Minister asks us, upon the good-will, the sense of justice, of a legislature dominated by the spirit which was given expression to by Senator Barrington is not a very good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator say by Senator Barrington alone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Barrington to-day and Deputy McDonogh yesterday. That was an expression of a growing reaction throughout this country, a general growing reactionary spirit, and I think it is going to find expression in legislation. Whether that is so or not, I am not prepared to rely upon Parliaments elected by a majority of farmers to safeguard the interest of trade unionists.  It may be argued that there is a certain appearance of logic and equity in this section, because it says on the one hand you have penalties prescribed for employers and on the other hand you ought to have penalties prescribed for trade unions.  We have been forced to look upon these things as they actually have occurred, the way legislation of this kind has occurred in relation to trade disputes and combinations of workmen, and there has been a very gradual and steady process towards the amount of freedom for combination and strike action that has been secured to-day.  There has been, too, a fairly persistent attempt to obstruct and impede trade unions in that work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will draw attention to this kind of case.  You have the proposition that <Col N="2475" /> apprenticeship committees shall make rules relating to the number of apprentices employed by a particular establishment.  That is an optional provision.  Committees may make such rules and they may not.  If they do not make such rules you will have an establishment, as I instanced earlier, employing 14 apprentices and 2 journeymen, more apprentices than adult workers.  In one or two establishments in an industry that kind of thing may happen.  There is a strike, let us say, in that industry, and in order to make the strike action appear to be directed fairly against all the employers who are in that industry it may be necessary to impede the employment of those apprentices.  The apprentice has agreed under Section 12 to work for that employer for the period of the apprenticeship.  Let us say the firm has three times the number of apprentices that the unions think should reasonably be employed in that industry.  They take action by way of a strike.  Because they know that the apprentices are being used to defeat the strike, as the employers in the industry are using that particular establishment to turn out goods against which the workers are fighting, the members of the union take action to try to break the contract, if you like, of apprenticeship.  Every man engaged in that operation is liable to the penalty of £20 or £10 as the case may be.</P>
    <P>That is the real danger, and the unions realise it to be a real danger.  It is because they do so realise it that they feel it is a blot upon the Bill and vitiates its hopeful prospect.  There are quite a number of things in this Bill that the unions are very dubious about, but they are hopeful that on the whole the Bill will be valuable and helpful in the general working of the apprenticeship system to meet modern conditions. What has been said here may have been described as a threat, but I do not think it is fair so to describe it.  It is an indication that the co-operation sought, hoped for and expected is not likely to be available while this vital but obnoxious clause, vital to the trade unions, is retained in the Bill.  The Minister is insisting upon it in its amended form.  We have merely indicated the feeling of the trade unions in regard to it, and we say that if it had <Col N="2476" /> been put in in the early stages of the Bill there would have been fierce opposition from the very beginning.</P>
