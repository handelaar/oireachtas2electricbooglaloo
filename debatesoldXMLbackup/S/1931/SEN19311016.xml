    <Title>Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Bill, 1931&mdash;Allocation of Time Motion.</Title>
    <P>The following motion stood in the name of Senator Wilson:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That, in the case of the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Bill, 1931, the Stages shall be proceeded with as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The Second Stage of the Bill shall be set down for consideration at 4.15 p.m. on Friday, 16th October, 1931, and the proceedings on that Stage, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.45 p.m. on that day by putting from the Chair forthwith the Question, &lsquo;That the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Bill, 1931, be now read a second time,&rsquo; and after the said time on the said day no question shall be put from the Chair on any amendment set down to the motion for the Second Stage.</P>
    <P>(b)  Immediately on the conclusion of the proceedings on the Second Stage of the Bill, the sitting shall be suspended until 8 p.m.</P>
    <P>(c)  On the resumption of the sitting at 8 p.m. the Committee Stage of the Bill shall be considered and the proceedings on that Stage, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 9.45 p.m. by putting from the Chair forthwith and successively any Questions necessary to bring the proceedings to a conclusion: Provided that after the appointed time no Question shall be put from the Chair on any amendment, and after such time only one Question shall be put from the Chair bring the proceedings in <Col N="1918" /> Committee forthwith to a conclusion, and that Question shall be in the form (as the case may require), &lsquo;That the Section, the Sections, the Schedule and the Title stand part of the Bill,&rsquo; or &lsquo;That the Section, the Sections, the Schedule and the Title as amended (if amendments have been made) stand part of the Bill.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>(d)  Immediately on the conclusion of the proceedings on the Committee Stage of the Bill, the Seanad shall stand adjourned until 11 a.m. on Saturday, 17th October, 1931.</P>
    <P>(e)  At the sitting of the Seanad on Saturday, 17th October, 1931, the Report Stage of the Bill shall be proceeded with as first business, and the proceedings on that Stage, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 12 noon on that day by putting from the Chair forthwith the Question necessary to bring the proceedings to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>(f)  The Fifth Stage of the Bill shall be considered immediately on the conclusion of the Report Stage, and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m. on that day by putting from the Chair forthwith the Question necessary to bring the proceedings to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>(g)  Immediately on the conclusion of the proceedings on the Fifth Stage of the Bill, the Seanad shall stand adjourned <i>sine die.</i>&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The following amendment was handed in by Senator Johnson to Senator Wilson's motion:&mdash;</P>

      <P>An amendment to Senator Wilson's motion has been tabled and copies have been circulated to Senators as they entered the Chamber. I propose to call upon Senator Johnson as soon as the motion has been moved and seconded.  The effect of his amendment if passed will be, in my opinion, (and I so rule) that at 9.45 p.m. any amendments offered on <Col N="1919" /> the Committee Stage of the Bill which have not then been reached will be put from the Chair successively and without debate.  I need hardly point out that a division might be challenged on each.  A number of amendments have been tabled for the Committee Stage of the Bill, and the Clerk hopes to be in a position to circulate these in stencilled form within the next quarter of an hour.  If Senator Wilson's motion is passed, the Committee Stage of the Bill will begin at 8 p.m. this evening and an effort will be made to have printed copies of the amendments available by that hour.</P>

      <P>I move the motion that stands in my name&mdash;No. 1 on the Order Paper.  The object of this motion is to facilitate the passage of the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Bill through the House, and in order that the Bill may come up for discussion it is necessary that certain of the Standing Orders be amended. Now my motion deals with the changes in the Standing Orders and I will take each section of the motion separately and explain as well as I can to the House the slight changes that are necessary in order that this Bill may be allowed to proceed.  Some Senators have been saying that this is a revolutionary motion.  What happens in this: That in ordinary circumstances three days shall be allowed to elapse after the passing of the Bill in the Dáil before it comes here for discussion in this Chamber, and I am moving in this motion section (a) that the Bill be permitted for discussion to-day.  Instead of three days' notice it is simply allowing the Bill to be discussed after one day.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Senator Wilson is speaking to a motion which was handed in in respect of a measure which was not officially in existence when this detailed time-table was handed in.  I ask your ruling if it is in order for a Senator to put in a motion relating to a measure&mdash; for instance, the Transport Bill, of which we know through the Press, but which is not in existence as a Bill. Here a detailed time-table is submitted to the House in respect of a measure not in existence when the <Col N="1920" /> motion was put in.  It may be as voluminous as a Bible and Senator Wilson has put this motion that it be passed in a few hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is complete master of its own procedure. Accordingly, if this motion is passed it makes all proceedings in accordance with this motion in order, as the motion is a direction of the House as to how the Bill in question is to be dealt with.  It is quite unnecessary to suspend any Standing Order, as the motion itself is in order and its passing will make all proceedings in accordance with it in order.  I so rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Section (a) which I have been explaining permits the discussion of this Bill at 4.15 to-day and in addition to that it brings forward a closure motion.  If this Bill is passed at 6.45 the closure motion will be put from the Chair, and that closure motion will dispose of the Second Stage of the Bill.  That closure motion is in accordance with Standing Orders.  Under our Orders any Senator can get up after an hour's discussion and move the closure, so there is nothing revolutionary about it.  The only thing wrong with Section (a) is that instead of three days having elapsed from the passage of the Bill in the Dáil one day has elapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>One hour!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, one hour.  Section (b) states that immediately on the conclusion of the proceedings on the Second Stage of the Bill the sittings shall be suspended until 8 o'clock. That means after 7 o'clock when the Second Stage is disposed of we suspend sittings and resume at 8 o'clock, and then at 8 o'clock the Committee Stage of the Bill shall be considered. The Committee Stage ought ordinarily not be taken the same day as the day on which the Second Stage has been passed in this House.  There is a change there in Standing Orders. Standing Orders say it must be taken on a day subsequent to the Second Stage, but I am asking on behalf of the Government, as a state of emergency <Col N="1921" /> exists in the country, that the Committee Stage of this Bill shall be taken and proceedings resumed at 8 p.m.</P>
      <P>In Section (c) there is also a closure motion which permits discussion for one and three-quarter hours.  Section (d) merely asks that after the Committee Stage is taken the Seanad shall stand adjourned until 11 a.m. to-morrow. There is nothing revolutionary about that.  Section (e) means that the Report Stage shall be proceeded with to-morrow at 11 a.m.  An hour's discussion will be permitted in accordance with our Standing Orders. Any Senator has the right under the Standing Orders after an hour's discussion to move the closure.  Section (f) means that the Fifth Stage shall be taken immediately on the conclusion of the Report Stage.  There is nothing revolutionary about that, because frequently in this House the Fifth Stage has been taken on the same day as the Report Stage, especially when there have been no amendments carried into the Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to point out to Senators generally that this motion which is very large really means nothing.  It makes no changes in Standing Orders except that instead of having three days' notice of the taking of a Bill we are to have one.  I want to place before you the reason why this is done. You must remember that this is a Government motion.  The Government who have to govern this country demand from us that this particular measure should be passed forthwith. I cannot see any great reason why it should not be passed if the state of the country is taken into account.  While we do not like changing the Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a most important change.  We cannot allow a position in which men can intimidate the public, intimidate members of Parliament, intimidate jurors and commit crimes which deserve to be punished.  We cannot stand for that position and therefore emergency legislation is necessary.  It is the Seanad's duty to support the Government in whatever <Col N="1922" /> measure they consider necessary for the good order and government of this country.  The Constitution says that the liberty of the person is inviolable. Was the body of Ryan inviolable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The man who was murdered in Tipperary a few weeks ago.  Can men shelter themselves under the Constitution, and at the same time break the spirit of the Constitution? If we are to consider the Constitution as the charter of our liberty, it implies also that we, as citizens, ought to be obedient to the Constitution and whatever ideals we hold, whether we want separation from England or Communism, must be pursued not by violence but by argument and the votes of the people.  If those people who are breaking the law refuse to observe the Constitution, what else can the Government do but to meet force with force?  I, as the mouthpiece of the Government, say that we would be neglectful of our duty if we did not support the Government in doing what they consider necessary in order that good government in this country shall be preserved, in order that our condition as a nation amongst other nations of the world may be such that property and life are safe, and that we can pursue our daily avocations without the danger or fear of the gunman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that Senator Wilson has moved a motion which involves a closure.  An amendment is proposed by Senator <Col N="1923" /> Johnson.  That amendment will be included in the time given to Senator Wilson's motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Senator Wilson, in drawing up this time-table, had anything to say to the time in which the House might discuss his motion.  It will be observed that the House was called to meet at 3 o'clock, and one and a quarter hours are allocated to the closure motion, two and a half hours to discussion of the Bill on the Second Stage&mdash;to accept or reject the principle of the Bill&mdash;and one hour and forty-five minutes to discussing in detail 35 sections.  If that is Senator Wilson's idea of the due allocation of time to amend the Constitution in the way that it is proposed it should be amended, I have very little regard for his sense of proportion.  When moving the motion, the Senator said something about this nation taking its place among other nations of the world.  I had the idea when I read this motion that the Senator, and those for whom he was the mouthpiece, as he explained, had in fact been familiarising themselves with what might be called current international movements. Those of us who read the newspapers are familiar with certain current international movements.  Those members of the Seanad who are members of the Inter-Parliamentary Union will be familiar with the documents that have been circulated regarding current dangers to the Parliamentary system, and how it has been shown that the current movements for the Fascist form of Government on the one hand and the Communistic form of Government on the other hand, are united in the idea that Parliamentary Government is a farce and should be abolished.  We have had, frequently during the past few years, indications from Ministers of the way their minds are running in respect to this question, sneers at representative Government, sneers at Parliament, sneers at the manner in which parties are supposed to express their views through representatives in Parliament, the break up of the idea of a popular vote, and generally the expression has come from Ministers at <Col N="1924" /> different times, of the inutility and obstructive effects of Parliamentary discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>We have here the result of the mind of Ministers in a resolution.  I am not going to deal with the merits of the Bill, but solely with the resolution before us, which is designed to prevent this House discussing for more than one hour and forty-five minutes changes in the Constitution which go to the very foundation of this State as an organised institution.  Really it does suggest this, that the Seanad is asked to commit <i>hari-kari.</i>  I wonder whether the Seanad realises that if it passes this motion it is practically saying with such Parliaments and representative institutions as exist in Fascist and Communist countries, that their business is to ratify without discussion the decisions of the Executive&mdash;to discuss them, but not to attempt to amend them.  Let the spokesman for the Government lay before the House the decisions and records of what are being done, and take them as accomplished facts.  If you like to change the Government, perhaps there may be another opportunity given; but perhaps there might not.  So far as representative institutions are concerned under that method they are not to discuss propositions from a Government but to accept them.  That seems to me to be the genesis of this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving it the Senator claimed that it was not revolutionary.  Of course not.  It is quite in accord with the Standing Orders!  Presumably if <Col N="1925" /> it were not the Cathaoirleach would have ruled it out of order.  I now come to my amendment.  I put it forward as a very mild and simple proposition that would at least save something of the dignity and self-respect of this House.  It is proposed in paragraph (c) of the motion that the Committee Stage of the Bill shall be resumed at 8 o'clock, and that the discussion may continue until 9.45.  In that one and three-quarter hours it is suggested that the House can discuss sections one and two of the Bill proper, and thirty-five sections and an appendix in the Schedule.  Contained in the Bill are many very important and very, very serious propositions.  The intention is that this House shall be given one and three quarter hours for the discussion and consideration of the Government's proposals as contained in the Bill, and any amendments which any Senator may desire to insert.  At the end of that time all other proceedings in connection with the Committee Stage of the Bill shall cease except one comprehensive motion to approve of the Bill.  I am dealing with the matter now purely from the point of view of a practical working out of this system.  It may be, let us say, that on Section 25 Senator Counihan, even Senator Wilson or Senator Brown may think that there is necessity for an amendment.  Possibly either of those Senators or some other Senator may have put down a motion or an amendment which will appeal to the House as a whole.  It is even possible that there is a flaw in the Bill.  The Bill as presented to Dáil Eireann was, bear in mind, altered.  It was amended.  If at 9.45 to-night this motion is carried, and if we have only got as far as discussing Section 15, then the amendment of any later section is impossible. Senators may say that we will meet to-morrow but they cannot amend the Bill to-morrow.  Under the Standing Orders notice must be given for the consideration of any amendment on Report.</P>
    <P>In the motion as presented it is going to be impossible to amend this Bill after 9.45 to-night.  We are supposed to have discussed the 35 sections in one hour and three-quarters, and either agreed or not agreed to any amendments <Col N="1926" /> that have been submitted.  As I pointed out, the effect of my amendment is simply this, that at 9.45 to-night, if there are any amendments on the Paper which appeal to the House, they may be embodied in the Bill by vote of the House without discussion. If there are any sections of the Bill which the House considers ought not to be in it, then the House will have an opportunity of deleting particular sections without having to throw out the whole Bill.  It seems to me that if that very mild and moderate suggestion, to modify the motion of Senator Wilson, is not accepted by the House, it is a clear indication that the House does not intend in any possible circumstances&mdash;because no other circumstances can be imagined which would have a greater appeal in that respect than this&mdash;to do anything more than ratify decisions already made by the Executive Council.  Senator Wilson admits that that is his position, supported by Senator Miss Browne and possibly by other Senators.  I think that is not the view of the House as a whole, and I think it is a reasonable test, whether that is to be the future mind of the House or whether Senators are going to consider their position, of having a right and a duty to consider fairly legislative proposals that emanate from the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that I question whether either the motion or the amendment is in order, for the simple reason that we have no Bill before us.  It is usual in the Seanad that a Bill is complete as passed in the Dáil, but as far as I know we have no Bill here now.  In view of that fact I think our proceedings are entirely irregular and out of order.</P>

      <P>On these benches, I think you will agree, we have the most <Col N="1928" /> profound respect for the Cathaoirleach and for his judgment.  I am bringing this matter forward, not with the idea of putting any obstacles in the way of the Chair, or in the administration of the business, but to point out how irregular, how unconstitutional, and how grossly disorderly every step that has been taken on this measure has been.  Senator Wilson, in making his appeal on this issue&mdash;and I am dealing now both with the motion and with the amendment&mdash;displayed the most grotesque mentality I have yet seen in this House, and that is saying a great deal.  He talked about the Bill having been passed in one day, showing that he was clearly of opinion that it was passed in the Dáil last night.  He is not conscious yet when the Bill was passed, whether it was passed or what was passed.  That was clearly evident from the fatuous and grotesque statement he made about the Bill being passed.  As a matter of fact, as was pointed out, this Bill was only passed to-day&mdash;in other words, about one hour and 25 minutes prior to the time he got up to speak.  This gentleman, this Senator, has the audacity to come amongst a body of intelligent men, and he stands here as a so-called fitting representative of democratic people. While we have had many travesties in the Oireachtas, this is the last word.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Chair one question, and I do so with all respect.  You stated here to-day, sir, that the House had control of its own procedure.  If you will reflect for a moment you will remember that you said here on Wednesday that you had no option&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;but to order the business of this House in such a way that this measure would be dealt with this week.  These are two conflicting statements, if I may say so with great respect.  If the Chair had no option I think this House is entitled to know why.  I think we are entitled to know what pressure was brought to bear upon the Chair and who held a pistol at the head of the Chair as regards the administration of the business of this House this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that quite readily.  The President of the <Col N="1929" /> Executive Council informed me that in the urgent necessity that existed in this country, it was imperative or important that I should summon a meeting of the Seanad for a specific purpose, and being so guided by the Head of the Executive Government, now or at any time, I felt that it was my duty to the House and to the country to summon such meeting.</P>

      <P>I am not discussing the Bill at the moment.  Senator Fanning, in view of his avocation in life, knows more possibly about these people than I do.  I want to suggest now that there is a very definite reason for Saturday evening.  The reason is that it comes before Sunday morning, and that on Sunday morning, when the decent people of this country, equally with the saint that has been held up to us as a model, namely, the President of the Executive Council, go to Mass, they may hear something on moral conduct which, if digested properly, may influence them to some extent on the immoral conduct that some Senators, in common with the members of the other House, were guilty of <Col N="1930" /> during this week. It is all right to sneer and laugh.  Senators should remember that each Wednesday this meeting opens with a prayer for truth, justice, piety and religion.  Some of you were in for that prayer to-day.  I was not.  I say this, and I say it after very serious and careful thought, that the members who said that prayer here to-day, and who said it on Wednesday, were guilty of nothing less than rank blasphemy.  Sixty per cent. of the members of this House do not believe in their hearts in this Bill, or do not believe it is necessary.  Let them understand that they are setting machinery in motion now by this closure motion to establish Star Chamber methods to bully through legislation which is going, perhaps, to sink this country in blood.  Then they talk about truth, justice, piety and religion.</P>
      <P>We listened to Senator Wilson's schedule of time.  There is nothing revolutionary in Senator Wilson's schedule of time!  If we were discussing premium bulls for the profession to which he belongs, hours and days would not be too much for that, but an hour and a half is sufficient to decide what is the nature of the legislation that is to deal with Christian humanity in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We can discuss that and feel no shame about it.  At least the products we manufacture do not injure humanity.  I submit that this programme that has been submitted to us is an insult to the House.  It is an outrage on everything decent that the Seanad should stand for.  It is being rushed through with a very definite purpose, to defeat whatever we may know on Sunday so that the measure they are going to run through all its stages this week will be law before Senators are stirred in their consciences. I do not know whether that is true or not.  The President of the Executive Council, judging by his status, at least by the status we suppose he has in Christian religion, may know more than I do about it.  I submit <Col N="1931" /> that the time schedule is absurd, that this Bill which is going to come before us, will involve undoubtedly human lives, justice and everything else that stands for peaceful Government and citizenship in this country. All these factors would require not a few hours but a few weeks of careful consideration, if they were considered honestly, reasonably and intelligently by the Seanad.  That opportunity is not going to be afforded to us.  We have not the Bill, as has been pointed out, that has been passed to-day in the Dáil.  We have not that measure before us now.  We have the Chairman's word, and we accept it, that the Bill was not amended but legislatively we have not that Bill before us.</P>

      <P>The point I want to make is this.  This House was summoned first of all on the direct order of the Chair under pressure from the President of the Executive Council. Notwithstanding the fact that on the motion for the Adjournment we had an assurance that the Chairman would have us here to discuss a Bill which had not passed its final stages, it was circulated as having been passed, sent out by post, and at two o'clock, one hour before the Bill was brought before us, a certified copy was handed to the Chair.  I just want to draw attention to these facts and to point out, how we, a supposedly intelligent body, are to sit here in this Assembly, in which part of the Sovereignty of the State is supposed to reside, and be treated in this manner.  We are supposed to be discussing a Bill, one hour after the Bill is supposed to have reached the hands of the Chairman of <Col N="1933" /> the Assembly, and yet we have not got a copy of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am allowing you a great deal of latitude in regard to this matter which really is not fundamental. I have the certified copy of the Bill. There is here the certification of the Clerk of the Dáil which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deimhnim gur ritheadh an Bille seo istigh go cuibhe ag Dáil Eireann ar an 16º lá de Dheire Foghmhair, 1931.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In English that means:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I certify that the within Bill has been duly passed by Dáil Eireann on the sixteenth day of October, 1931.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the copy you have in your hand.  I am in no way treating you unfairly.  You have the same copy as the Chair has and I must ask you to allow the matter to end.</P>

It is symptomatic of what we may expect when the Bill is law.  The amount of time that is given to us to discuss this Bill may be very well symbolical of the short time that will be allowed to those whom this Bill is meant to condemn and execute.</P>

      <P>I beg to support the amendment of Senator Johnson.  Before I go into the reasons I wish to emphasise what has been said by Senator Connolly and Senator O'Doherty in regard to the manner in which this Bill has been brought before the House.  If there is one thing essential to the security of the people&mdash;and that is what we are here for, to secure the liberty of the people&mdash;if there is one thing more than another that is essential to the security and the liberty of the people, it is that the forms of law should be observed.  We received this morning copies of a certain measure passed in Committee of Dáil Eireann. <Col N="1934" /> We were not entitled to discuss that document.  We would be bound to discuss a document passed by Dáil Eireann.  There is not before us any Bill as passed by Dáil Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot allow you to continue in that strain, Senator.  I have told you the Bill before you is the Bill as passed by Dáil Eireann and has been so certified.  If you continue in that strain I shall hold you guilty of disorder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>You will not hold me guilty of disorder because I shall not be guilty of disorder.  We accept what the Cathaoirleach has said, that he has received a measure certified as being passed by Dáil Eireann and that that is in the same terms as the measure sent to us this morning.  I hope I am entitled to make this observation, that apparently Dáil Eireann did not make many amendments in that measure and probably the members of Dáil Eireann voted according to their allegiance. That is all I say of a provocative kind in relation to this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great sympathy for my friend Senator Wilson.  He looked to me like a poor fellow who was going over the top for the first time.  It was the first time he represented the Government in moving a motion and he has done it very well.  I want the House to say that really this time table is unnecessary.  I am very glad we have the President of the Executive Council here, because I will make this one admission, that if there is any grain of sense at all in the Executive it resides in the President.  I want to say that there is no necessity for a time table, and the reason there is no necessity is that we have never wasted time in this Assembly.  I challenge my friends on the other side to say where, in this Assembly, we have ever wasted one five minutes of your time.  We have never said one word for the purpose of delaying or interfering with business.  The closure has never been moved in this House except on one occasion, in reference to the Jurors Bill, and it was not necessary on that occasion because we kept within the time.  We discussed the measure and discussed it very closely.  It was very <Col N="1935" /> closely argued and argued within the scheduled time.  Therefore, on the present occasion there is no necessity for limiting the time for a discussion, particularly of a Bill of this character.  I say again that I am glad that the President of the Free State is here, because I want to tell the members of the Seanad, men who are supposed to be more or less removed from the anger and the heat of Party controversy, men who are supposed to be of mature years, that this is a Bill requiring long and careful consideration.</P>
    <P>It is a very revolutionary measure. It ought to be considered by you.  It ought to have full time for consideration by you.  Mind you, foolish things are done in a hurry and in my opinion&mdash;of course my opinion will have little weight with people who are opposed to me politically&mdash;but in my opinion this is the most foolish measure that has been applied to this country for a hundred years.</P>
    <P>Now let me tell you why it is a foolish measure.  It is a foolish measure because it goes beyond the authority of the persons who introduced it.  Again I say that I do not wish to be provocative.  But I ask: What does the measure do?  It provides that all offences&mdash;and mind you, offences are to include crimes, but they are to be something else besides crimes and they are to include anything that does not meet with the goodwill or the good wishes of the Executive Minister &mdash;it provides that all offences are to be triable, not by a court of justice, but by three military officers not one of whom need be a man acquainted with the laws of this country or the Constitution of this country.  It also provides that the punishment for these offences shall not be in fines or imprisonment or even death, but such punishment as these three military officers may consider proper.  Now that is one section in the Bill.  There is another section in this Bill, that these military officers may condemn a man to death for an offence&mdash;not for a crime but for an offence.</P>

Here is a matter I want to have discussed, a most important question.  I wish to make this submission: that you in your wisdom should consider it to be just that if these three military officers condemn a citizen to death, the sentence should not be carried out unless with the sanction of the Executive Council.  Is that a matter for discussion?  I say that this is a Bill in respect of which no closure should be applied; and if my friend, Senator Wilson, will withdraw his motion, I, on my part, will undertake, so far as I am concerned, that there will be no waste of time.  I undertake that if he will allow fair discussion there will be no waste of time and that this Bill will be fully and fairly discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>My friend, Senator Wilson, I take it, refuses to withdraw his closure amendment.  Let me tell you this, that this is not a Bill to amend the Constitution.  This is a Bill to suspend the Constitution, because a section in this Bill includes a section to allow three men to inflict a sentence of death for an offence which need not be a crime.  They override the Constitution according to the express terms of this Bill.  I listened very carefully to the debates which took place in the Dáil on this measure.  I will say that they were very able debates, although they were marked by a certain amount of excusable heat, let us say.  I listened to them very carefully, and from my consideration of the debates I am of opinion that this Bill has not the sanction of the people through their elected representatives: that the terms of this Bill suspending the Constitution were never put to the people, and that the <Col N="1937" /> President of the Executive Council is of the same opinion himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say now with whatever authority comes from long years of experience, that a representative assembly, the delegated representatives of the people have power to pass such laws as the people expressly or by implication authorise; that the people did not expressly or by implication authorise the subversion of the Constitution.  Above all, they did not authorise the subversion of national liberty.  Now I will leave it at that.  I say to the President of the Executive Council who is here, that he has not got that authority from the people.  Not alone does he in express terms by the measure subvert the Constitution, but he overrides natural right and natural justice.  An Article of this Bill says that the Articles of the Constitution shall be read as subject to this Bill.  We have an opportunity now of having the President here, and I say it in his presence and with full consideration of my own experience and on my own responsibility, that the President has not got from the people the authority to subvert not merely the Constitution but the natural liberties of the people. The natural liberties of the people are subverted when he subjects any man to trial by three military officers for any offence and without any appeal from that trial.  I crave the attention of the Seanad to this: That what I have said is the opinion of the President himself. I have observed in the speech of the <Col N="1938" /> President that he is not going to put this Bill into execution.  Remember when this Bill is made an Act it cannot be put into execution unless on the resolution of the Executive Council.  I think I gathered from the speeches of the President that he is not going to put this Bill into execution until he gets it confirmed by the people.  He doing that, the President is right.  He has not the prior authority of the people.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That this Bill be now read a second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very short time which will be allowed for the discussion of this measure, I do not propose to delay the Seanad at any length.  It is within the knowledge of most people throughout the country that many acts of intimidation, many attempts at assassination and assassinations themselves, have occurred in the country during the last twelve months.  The ordinary law, which, normally speaking, ought to be in a position to deal with the matter, has proved ineffective.  One of the most prized institutions in this or any other country, trial by jury, has been attacked by a conspiracy which is in existence in this country, not alone for the overthrow of the State, but for the subversion of ordered conditions of civilisation and of any attempt to govern by democratic means.  That is a serious menace.  Apart altogether from such heinous crimes as the assassinations I have referred to, apart from the attacks upon individuals, which have been numerous&mdash;that is, attempted assassinations &mdash; apart from the attacks on prisons or prison warders, apart altogether from the activities of particular organisations engaged in this conspiracy, we have had within the last few months an attempt to found and to propagate through the country another organisation which apparently had its roots in another country, and which boasts quite openly of its attempt to achieve by revolutionary means the objects which are set out by the organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For something like 50 or 60 years there has been in the mouths of patriotic Irishmen all over the world from the first time they were pronounced in a court the salutation &ldquo;God Save Ireland.&rdquo;  The Irish translation of that saying is, &ldquo;A Dhia Saor Eire.&rdquo;  This new organisation has taken out the Dia, leaving the two words Saor Eire. From that fact the Seanad and the people of this country can draw their own conclusions.  This is the first time in this country that any attempt has been made openly and blatantly to carry out the activities of an organisation without invoking the aid and the assistance of Almighty God.  This conspiracy is something which will have to be dealt with and would have to be dealt with by any Government, leaving out of consideration for the moment all questions of politics, political parties and the various divisions that there are in the country.  At long last it comes down to this, that representatives of the people in their Parliament <Col N="1943" /> must select an Executive, and upon that Executive is laid the responsibility of enforcing the law, order, government, liberty, and all the rest of it.  To that end various institutions have been set up in this State, founded upon the most democratic principles and appealing to all lovers of liberty&mdash;true liberty, liberty under God and under God's law to carry out whatever orders and whatever statutes the Parliament and the people may decide. It does not matter what Government is in power.  Upon that institution, however composed&mdash;of whatever men and of whatever political party&mdash;there will rest the responsibility in the first and last degree of ensuring to the people of the country liberty, and liberty without licence.  These organisations have taken to themselves all authority and power to enforce their will upon unarmed people.</P>
    <P>That is where the first weakness or infirmity was found in our Constitution. We had provision for dealing with peaceful conditions, institutions set up under the State to deal with crime and offences against the laws of the State and so on.  Once an attack was made on those institutions an attempt was made on the Oireachtas.  Remember it is not the Government which passes laws.  There are some apparently who have the idea that these are the Government's laws.  They are the laws of the Oireachtas, of the two Houses of Parliament set up by the people of the country, and it is they and they alone have the right to determine who shall represent them, what are the laws that they want and what are the conditions under which they wish to live.</P>
    <P>At this period in our history, when every State in the world without exception is groaning under economic difficulties the like of which has never been known in the world's history, when ordered conditions ought to prevail, when every effort should be made by every law-abiding citizen to build up his country, the whole work of this State is held up by a crowd of people who posture as nationalists, who pose as patriots, and who act in contravention <Col N="1944" /> of the law of the State, the law of God, and every law which any democratic State could set up.</P>
    <P>To deal with that situation we have produced a Bill.  It is a Bill of far-reaching power and authority.  It seeks to deal out justice to those who offend against the State's laws.  It gives greater freedom to the person charged with an offence than any of the victims or any of the possible victims of the conspiracy which I am denouncing to-day.  This is a period in which every citizen in the State who values his conscience or his soul or his country ought to respond to the call of country first, to the call of the best dictates of democratic Government, and to the call of nationality in order that our name as a nation may not be a byword amongst nations.</P>
    <P>I presume it is unnecessary for me to recapitulate the various attacks which have been made on individuals, the short shrift which was afforded in the first remarkable instance here of the murder of a Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána.  What institution is meant when we say the Gárda Síochána?  That is an institution set up by the State for the protection of the citizens and of their rights, to ensure the detection of criminals, and to ensure every law necessary for ordered conditions and for the progress of society.  This Superintendent was shot down for &ldquo;exceeding his duty.&rdquo;  That is the description that is blatantly and publicly given in one of the publications which emanate from the authors of this conspiracy.  They glorify the fact that he has been shot for &ldquo;exceeding his duty.&rdquo;  An interview given by one of these men stated that the C.I.D. are employed and paid to do their duty and they have no grudge or ill-will against them.  Why?  Because a grudge or ill-will against them postulates an attack on them.  Why are they not attacked?  Because they are armed.  This is practically an unarmed State without this Bill.  We propose to arm it in defence of the rights and liberties of the people, and we ask the Seanad, in the name of God, to give this power, not to this Executive alone, but to any Executive bearing responsibility <Col N="1945" /> for government in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephODoherty" hpid="Mr. O'Doherty Mr. O'Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to ask the Seanad to refuse a Second Reading to this Bill.  I am going to ask them not to be blindfolded by the use of very choice phrases by the President of the Executive Council.  Democratic Government coming from him means a different thing to the definition of democratic government that this country lived up to through the ages, but especially from 1916 to 1921.  I charge the President of the Executive Council with the responsibility for much of the turmoil that is in this country at present, because of the bad example that he gave in the exercise of functions placed in him democratically by the people of the country.</P>
      <P>In 1919 the most democratic Government that ever assembled in Ireland met in this city of Dublin.  It declared its form of government, namely a republic or a free Ireland, claiming that the <i>de jure</i> right of exercising the functions of government resided within it, and that these functions should be exercised from the centre to the sea.  From 1919, through a reign of terror unequalled in this or in any other civilised country, our people stood behind that Government, giving to it, as no people ever gave a Government in this or any other age, such loyalty and devotion, such magnificent services, as should stand to the credit of our people for all time and to all democratic peoples as an example of liberty-loving citizens.  That Government endeavoured to exercise its <i>de facto</i> functions.  It was thwarted by a foreign Power.  It was met by whatever forces that Power could muster and as a result a war was waged against external forces, against the British Empire, which culminated in December, 1921, in the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between this country and Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These Articles of Agreement for a Treaty did not embody the full principles of liberty and nationality which were enshrined in the annals of our people throughout the ages, but unfortunately they were accepted by a <Col N="1946" /> small majority of the elected representatives of the people.  Following that acceptance we reached probably the most momentous stage of our history when the average man could read the writing on the wall that old comrades were about to hurl themselves at each other's throats over the merits or demerits of that document called the Treaty.  The Government was split, the administrative offices of that Republic were split, the Army itself was split, and the people were split, because of the recognition or non-recognition of a new policy enunciated, namely, that through that Treaty we would gain a new liberty, that we would gain recognition of the Republic democratically established and that we would march forward without any difficulty and without further bloodshed to a realisation of the nation's dream.  But a civil war became so imminent that the elected representatives of the people, through pressure brought to bear on them by the national organisations on the one hand, by peaceful-loving citizens on the other hand, not up to then connected with any organisation, by the custodians of the moral laws in this country, the heads of the various religious sects were called together to formulate some programme and some method, and the responsibility was thrown upon the republican representatives of finding some way out of the morass, some manner or means by which civil strife, the greatest curse that could visit any country, could be prevented.  To the credit of the leaders and to the credit of the public representatives of the period such a way out was found&mdash;at least it was thought it was found.  A Pact election was called.</P>
    <P>That Pact election, mark you, in 1922 was called not by the Provisional Government afterwards set up under the Treaty, not by the Parliament of Southern Ireland, not on a writ of the British House of Commons, but on the definite writ of the Republic of Ireland. The representatives, men who held different views on the merits or demerits of the Treaty, anti-Treatyites and pro-Treatyites, standing on the same platform, appealed to the people <Col N="1947" /> to throw upon them in a democratic manner the responsibility of maintaining peace, order and good government, which is prayed for here in this Assembly.  The people of Ireland responded to that call, and at the Pact election 75 per cent. of the elected representatives were given a mandate to maintain peace in Ireland and to avoid civil strife.  But before that Parliament elected by the people could meet, civil war had broken out, and I say here and now by and with the authority of the British Government.  The first principles of democratic government were trampled under foot by the present President of the Executive Council of the so-called Free State and his followers. They refused the mandate given to them by the people of Ireland. They prevented the Parliament of Ireland meeting and deciding the ways and means whereby civil strife could be obviated and peace and government maintained.  Then the President comes to talk to us here glibly of democratic government and the moral law and the God-given moral right of the people. Not content with smashing up that effort on the part of the people to guarantee the prevention of civil war, not content with preventing the elected representatives of the people meeting, the President and his associates who now profess such a magnificent love for justice, who now appeal to you for the sanctity of the courts and the administration of the law also at the time tore down the courts set up by the Government of the people of Ireland without reason or without cause.  There is an example of a love of justice that resides in the hearts of these people who are responsible for this latest measure of coercion for the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>The President, in a rather debating society manner, has discovered that the new Communistic organisation has left out the word &ldquo;Dia.&rdquo;  Well, for all the organisations that leave out the word &ldquo;Dia,&rdquo; the President of the Executive Council makes up for; he can scarcely close a door without calling on the name of God.  He and his colleagues had an opportunity of writing the name of God in a place that would have demanded the respect of all <Col N="1948" /> our people and the name of God was not written there by the President of the Executive Council and his colleagues. That is in the alleged free Constitution of the so-called Free State.  Let us get away from all cant. Let us see where we really are.  Let us see where we are going.  The young brilliant Minister for External Affairs is here listening to the debate.  I am glad he is here.  On the last occasion when the Minister for Finance took advantage of a clause in the Constitution which I believe was inserted there without any reason or at least without any hope which would provide an opportunity for the Minister to come and propagandise in favour of a particular Party or a particular Bill, I reminded the Minister and the Seanad that it would be well if our young and able Minister for External Affairs would devote some little of his time and energy to try and preserve peace among the people of Ireland instead of among foreigners who have at the moment nothing at all to do with this country.</P>
    <P>We are committed to the expenditure of money for the maintenance of order and good government and the elimination of arms and force as factors amongst the free peoples in the world. The only peace the Irish people can lay claim to is the peace of the tomb following coercion.  We are called on to pass this Bill, which not only is a measure of coercion, but in my opinion it is asking you to put your name to a death sentence, not merely on the names that are in the Bill, but on any man and woman in Ireland who dare lift their voices to say this country is not politically free, that this Assembly is not a Sovereign Assembly.  Our nation was not designed by God to be governed by two puppet parliaments. The line should not have been drawn straight across Ireland in an irregular fashion from the north-east to the south-west leaving the most northerly part in what is called Southern Ireland &mdash;this was an arbitrary arrangement of territory made by Lloyd George and those in the country who feared the puckering of his brow&mdash;but by a more arbitrary finger, the finger that has written our coast line.  That is the <Col N="1949" /> boundary we want and the people within that shall always, regardless of all the coercive measures, regardless of the Public Safety Bill, regardless of the efforts of this Executive, with outside or inside help or aid want that geographical boundary.</P>
    <P>That is the geographical boundary that should be cherished by our people and the sovereign rights that should be cherished by our people are the sovereign rights of the whole people of Ireland.  We ask you not to consider in any way from a party point of view this Bill.  We have pointed out to you in the discussions which took place already on the motion for closure, on the motion proposed by Senators Wilson and O'Rourke, the methods that are being adopted to put through this measure in such a short time as to prevent due consideration of this Bill and all its sections.</P>
    <P>With respect to the Chair, I will emphasise that this Bill so placed before us was being discussed in this Assembly and that it, or at least its implications were actually an hour under discussion before this Assembly was notified that the Cathaoirleach had a certified copy of the Bill in his possession.  I will emphasise now and always that even now when we know that the certified copy is in the hands of the Cathaoirleach that there is not a member of this Assembly at the present time in this House who can get up and say that he has seen a certified copy.</P>
    <P>The Bill arrives in our hands the morning after the Committee Stage has been passed in the Dáil.  What is the usual course?  We are interested in two stages of any Bill that is introduced. When we wish to devote any time or energy to its consideration, we read the first or initial draft and find out the objections to it.  We may or may not read the amendments embodied on the Committee Stage but we do look forward to the final draft as passed by Dáil Eireann.  I repeat that that final draft has not been placed in our hands.  We were limited this <Col N="1950" /> morning, we were limited at 3 o'clock to-day and we are limited now in the consideration of this measure, passed by Dáil Eireann an hour before this Assembly sat.  I am not appealing to you as a member of a political group. I want to point out that you are hurling the word &ldquo;murder&rdquo; across at our Party and our Party are hurling the word &ldquo;murder&rdquo; across at your Party, while the remnants of a Party who sit here having no connection with the Gael, belonging to the Gall, smilingly walk into the division lobbies to vote for a measure which will consolidate imperialism in this country.  I say as an Irishman to Irishmen&mdash;I leave the others out&mdash;that this Bill if it becomes law will bring in its train bloodshed. The President of the Executive Council, the Minister for External Affairs and the other Ministers can translate them, as they translated Deputy de Valera's statement in Tipperary in 1921, as meaning war.  Every man with his eyes open knows that the translation of this Act into fact and the endeavour to put this oppressive measure into operation will, undoubtedly, have its repercussion in force&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The alternative is this: Let us approach this matter as Irishmen.  Let us approach it as a problem which concerns us all, from the national point of view, and from no other point of view.  Let us see whether this Assembly in which we sit possesses in its Constitution anything which, at the moment, is debarring other Irishmen from accepting it or coming in to discuss matters.  Let us consider all the clauses of our Constitution which are sacrosanct.  The liberty of the people, which is being overthrown by this Bill, was supposed to be sacrosanct.  That is a very beautiful subject for fine phrases from the President of the Executive Council and his <i>confreres.</i>  But there are other clauses of the Constitution which are sacrosanct.  What are they?  Allegiance to the British King and an oath to a foreign power.  The late Minister for Justice told you that you dare not <Col N="1951" /> alter a comma of these clauses, but the fundamentals, which have so much concern for the Irish people, can be washed aside.  I ask you to let stand those provisions for representative democratic institutions, those provisions appertaining to the liberty of the subject and to examine the others. But you dare not lest you offend England.  Alter these other provisions. Wipe away the Oath of Allegiance. Wipe away the Governor-General and all his chattels.  Senators may smile. In 1921, some of us were associated with the discussion connected with the so-called Treaty or Articles of Agreement. One argument put forward then by a then headquarters staff man of the I.R.A., who now holds a very responsible position in the Free State police force&mdash;an argument for the acceptance of the Treaty&mdash;ought to bring a blush to the face of any policeman&mdash;namely, that after six months this Governor-General should be shot. On lies, you built up your support for the Treaty.  What were the lies?  In 1921 it was whispered by the I.R.B. &ldquo;We have no arms, but we will get arms under the Treaty.&rdquo;  It was whispered that the clauses of the Treaty which referred to partition would definitely operate to bring Ulster in&mdash;that the Six Counties would be so economically small a unit that they could not exist.  They went further with their lies.  They sent emissaries right into the Six Counties.  The then Minister for Education, with the Minister for Finance, was definitely responsible for getting teachers from the northern section of our country to refuse allegiance to the Government set up under the 1920 Act in the North-East corner.  That was done on the understanding, first of all, that they would receive their money from the central Government and, secondly, that their action would help the central headquarters of the Republican Government to establish a government for all Ireland. They told the people of two counties&mdash; one of which I belong to, and the Minister for External Affairs belongs to, Derry&mdash;they told the people of the city of Derry that whenever they had <Col N="1952" /> a majority in the city of Derry, portion of the clauses of the Treaty would operate in favour of Derry coming in with Donegal and that then the rest of the county of Derry would be secured. The Minister for External Affairs knows that.  But that belongs to External Affairs now, because it is outside the jurisdiction of this Parliament, in whose Executive Mr. McGilligan sits.  Let him take up the case of his own people across the Border. On the question of minorities in Poland and Yugo-Slavia, the relations between the Chinese and Japanese, whether Italy shall have a big or a small navy, our brilliant little Minister is doing exceptionally good work.  Let us ask him to devote some of his energy and his brains to solving the position at home.  It will not be solved this way.  They betrayed the people of the North.  Definitely and unequivocally, I say that.  They have failed in the Departments in which they claimed they would most succeed.  According to the protagonists of the Treaty in 1921, Ireland was to be a land flowing with milk and honey.  Economic stability was sure to come.  Our people would advance in prestige and population. Our industries would flourish. What do we see to-day?  Is there any man in the country, whether he be farm labourer or agriculturalist working a large farm, whether he be an artisan or a member of board of directors of one of the manufacturing concerns in this city or in any other in the country&mdash;is there any such one satisfied with the economic position at the moment?  Surely the attitude of the supporters of the Government in the Seanad debate the other day in reference to the motion to appoint a Joint Committee to consider the most advisable way of dealing with the present economic situation proved how little the Government or its followers care whether we have economic stability in Ireland or not.  It seems to me that unless all suggestions for economic stability emanate from the Executive Council they are tarnished. Ireland must be saved, but according to the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, both in the Dáil and <Col N="1953" /> in the Seanad, at the back of the Executive, it must only be saved by and with the methods of the present Executive.  I ask Senators as Irishmen to consider whether the alleged Communism or Bolshevism that exists is going to thrive or be driven under or disappear under the operations of this measure now proposed.  Every thinking and intelligent man I think knows that the real generator of Bolshevism and Communism was the arrogant dictatorship and tyranny of the Czar and all he stood for.  We know that tyrannical measures adopted in any country have their repercussions eventually, and that they will take the form that those who lead think best suited to the circumstances of the moment.</P>
      <P>I am not going to invoke Catholic principles here on this occasion.  There are other places for doing that, but if we want this country to advance economically, if you want to retard the alleged advance of sections of our people in regard to those associations and societies which are inimical to the basic principles of freedom of democracy, if you want to guarantee that the people of Ireland will march forward with the principles and tradition of their fathers, the first thing to do is to pay attention to the position, nationally and fundamentally.  I ask you therefore to refuse to give this Bill a Second Reading and to throw back in the face of the present Executive the insult they hurl at us in asking us to consider and pass this measure through all its stages in such a short time.</P>

      <P>It was my intention to state briefly the reason why I voted for the Closure, but that was impossible at the time.  I want to say I find it impossible to separate the Closure from the Bill.  If a case was made for the Bill and if you accept it the Bill is one that must be passed immediately. It is many years since this House decided to make a decision of the same importance as it is being asked to make to-day.  The Executive have come to the Oireachtas and they have solemnly told us that they are satisfied that a state of affairs exists in the country which can only be dealt with by methods set out in this Bill. They have stated that they must have these powers at once.  The Bill, if I understand it correctly, means that the Executive is, in effect, being given full responsibility.  They are being given <i>carte blanche;</i> they will decide when the powers are to be put into effect.  They will appoint the tribunal and they may remove it. They, I assume, will review such sentences when revision is deemed necessary; they alone can alter or cancel or defer sentences of the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House is only indirectly responsible to the people; it is only indirectly representative of the people; it does not claim to be the medium of the expression of the will of the majority in the same way as the Dáil can and does claim.  Its general function is revision; it has also powers of delay.  Senator Johnson in his reference to the Closure suggested that <Col N="1956" /> Parliamentary Government has only one function&mdash;to discuss and amend and debate.  Surely Parliamentary Government has another function, and that function is to control the Executive of the nation.  Parliamentary Government equally fails if it fails to act promptly when there is occasion for acting promptly, just the same as if it fails to discuss or debate or amend when there is occasion and opportunity.  It seems to me that on this occasion this House is not facing the question of revision.  That is not the question that is before it.</P>
    <P>The Government have made it a definite issue that they must have this Bill at once or they cannot be responsible for the consequences.  Any amendment means delay, therefore I assume that no amendment will be accepted or seriously considered here.  There is only one issue, to my mind, in this House.  Are you satisfied with the case and the statement made by the Government, or are you prepared to accept the statement made by their principal opponents?  The President in the other House set out a long list of crimes of violence, none of which is disputed.  His case for the Bill, and it is the only possible case that to my mind would justify a Bill of this kind, is that these are not isolated crimes but that they are a definite part of a conspiracy, and that either the State will be killed by the conspiracy or the conspirators will kill the State.</P>
    <P>The opposition Party contend that these crimes are only isolated instances which everyone regrets and they can be dealt with under the ordinary law. That is the issue.  If we accept the position that the Government is honest we have no option but to give them the powers which they are asking.  If we believe with Fianna Fáil that this is an election trick, that this is simply a dishonest and corrupt scheme to risk the lives of people in order to get political advantage, then you must vote against the Government.  To me this is a simple issue&mdash;difficult if you like but a plain issue&mdash;on which it is not possible to have a half-way house and it is for that reason, because I am not prepared to say that the Government are dishonest and because I am <Col N="1957" /> not prepared to go against them and say that the whole proposal is corrupt, that I am going to vote for this Bill, and it is exactly for the same reason and no other that I have voted for the Closure.  I believe that it is a responsible thing to give a vote for this Bill and I believe it is equally responsible or perhaps more responsible to give a vote against it.  Because if you vote against it you state that you are prepared definitely to withhold from the responsible Executive of this State what they have solemnly stated is the only way in which they can carry out the law in this country.  I do not believe you should minimise it and pretend that it is not serious.  It is serious and it has to be given with honesty and courage; either you are prepared to go against them and take the consequences, or support them and take the consequences.  Now I do not believe that force is any permanent remedy for this or any other evil.  I entirely agree with those who say that lawlessness and discontent can only be ultimately stopped by improving the conditions of the people, by giving them something worth living for and by education and industry.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that social conditions in many parts of the country are not what they there ought to be.  Everyone knows that there are desires for certain political changes, but I am absolutely convinced that if what we have been told (when we have not the same knowledge as the Government) is true, that if you allow the gunman to rule in this country it will be the absolute end to any improvement in our political, social, or economic conditions, and I believe it will be the end of religion.  And we are in this position to-day, that it is not a question of casuistry, discussing how much we dislike, and I heartily dislike portions of this Bill.  It is not a question as to whether this Bill can or cannot be amended.  It is a question of whether we are to face the issue before this House, and accept the whole thing or whether we are prepared to say &ldquo;No, we do not believe what has been put before us and we are prepared to take the responsibility for that action.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that the statement of Senator Douglas that he could not disassociate the closure measure from the measure itself surprises me.  To me it is simple incredible, without the mentality in discriminating the analytical mind of Senator Douglas, that such a measure as this with such powers as the President described as <i>carte blanche</i>, can be even read over carefully in the time available to us for discussion.  I would ask Senator Douglas was he satisfied with this closure measure and with the importance of some sections and ideas in it which he confesses are very distasteful to him and I am not surprised they are distasteful to him. If that be the case did it not occur to him that the Executive Council might have curtailed its holiday?  The holiday was full and nobody can pretend that the time allowed for discussion either in the Dáil or here is adequate in any degree.  I am voting against this measure because I regard it as an election dodge.  I saw some men guarded coming up here last Wednesday whom I met in O'Connell Street mixing with the crowds which had come to Dublin for the hurling final. Then apparently the state of the country was such that they did not require a guard.  What extraordinary transformation and what dangerous atmosphere has been created since then?  When I see men walking about Cork guarded, men of wide and deserved popularity not a hair of whose head any man, woman or child in Munster would touch&mdash;when I see these men guarded I think the thing is a farce.  The only regret I have in connection with it is that the money spent on guarding these men might be more properly expended in the construction of houses or amelioration of some of the other social evils to which Senator Douglas has referred.  During the holiday the Minister for Justice has in the intervals permitted to him in the exposition of high international finance spoken repeatedly on this measure.  I think at least half a dozen speeches he made around his constituency broadcasting the dangerous atmosphere in which we live.  In the last session the Minister for Justice <Col N="1959" /> carried through the Juries Protection Act, which has expired.  He had it reenacted. A debate took place on that measure and on the 17th of June of this year, in summing up the second reading debate (Column 1164 of the Official Reports), Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney said: &ldquo;I say that the Act has in fact worked and the Intimidation of juries has been reduced to a negligible point.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When was the truth being told?  Now or then?  Has any crime referred to by the President in his speech occurred between now and then?  The deplorable and unjustifiable murder of Superintendent Curtin had taken place long before that.  And in reference to the intimidation of juries I would point out that unfortunately nobody has ever been arraigned before a jury in connection with the murder of Superintendent Curtin.  I deplore that.  I would sincerely rejoice that those who were responsible for that man's murder had been arrested, convicted and punished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President has referred to Communism. I think he will agree with me that I have as little in common with Communism as he has, but how any man who thinks of it can imagine for a moment that Communism has any chance of successful development in this country is more than I can imagine.  You have a country intensely Christian.  I do not advert to Catholic principles.  I say, and I rejoice in saying, that religion in this country with every Christian sect is a well-grounded belief, and is not merely as possibly it may be in some countries not too far away, more or less a gloss or window-dressing.  Whether they be regarded as bigots or enthusiasts the people of Ireland of all Christian denominations hold fast to their religious belief.  That in itself is the first great block against the propagation of Communistic propaganda. We have in addition to that a widespread peasant proprietorship all over the Twenty-Six Counties.  All down through history people have tried to drive the Irish peasant off the land; sometimes they succeeded temporarily, <Col N="1960" /> but everybody who knows anything about it knows the extraordinary tenacity with which the Irish peasant proprietor holds his property and land, and regards it as a very valuable property.  You have in addition to that, not as numerous as I would like, but still numerous enough, another factor, the labourer with his cottage and acre of land.  In face of all that, because a few hare-brained idiots in Dublin calling themselves what they like with or without the prefix of the Divine Name, can be regarded as a justification for a measure such as that which is put before us to pass within a few hours is ridiculous.  Inevitably if it were intended that this Act should be administered seriously as the law of the land, it would have violent reactions, but I do not believe that any attempt will be made to do it.  It is an attempt to create an atmosphere for a successful election.  As such I regard it as a degradation of this Assembly to put it before it for consideration at such a time as the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The President in his speech stated quite rightly, and I am very glad he emphasised it, because his words become very much more authoritative than words from any member of this Assembly, that these Acts are Acts of the Oireachtas and not of the Executive Council.  I would like to ask Senator Douglas and those who think with him to ponder those words and not to be over-impressed with the necessity for simply doing what the Executive Council wishes them to do, because it is not the Executive Council's responsibility.  It is the responsibility of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill in many respects is like the Public Safety Bill of 1927, in many other respects it is a very different Bill from the 1927 Bill.  We were told by Mr. Blythe, Minister for Finance, on Wednesday, and the Dáil was told by other Ministers that for the eighteen months during which that Act was in operation it was effective, but that after it had been allowed to lapse in deference to the pressure that was applied to him from parties in the Dáil violence, outrage and murder began to come into operation.  I opposed that Bill in 1927 and I am proud that I <Col N="1961" /> opposed it.  I take the Minister's assurance that it was effective, that it did the work that it was believed that it would be able to do.  If that Act had been brought here now with the assurance that it had done that work and was effective in doing it and that no other less powerful authority and repressive legislation were possible, I think my attitude to the Bill would be different.  The Act was effective in 1927 and 1928.  Were the circumstances of 1927 much less terrible than they are to-day?  The Minister for Finance told us on Wednesday that there was nothing very dangerous at the moment or something to that effect but it was feared that something might come out of the present conspiracy. But the Bill we are now asked to deal with multiplies all the defects in the 1927 Bill which Senators on the benches opposite expressed themselves as very fearful of and removes many of the safeguards that reassured Senators opposite and justified them as they said in accepting the assurance of the Executive Council.  All those safeguards that were the final assurance that enabled Senators to support the Bill of 1927 are removed from this Bill, with this further very important feature that this Bill is not a seven years Bill, as the original draft of the 1927 Bill was, or a five years Bill as it was passed with the additional right of the Ministers to have it annulled after a period, as they did in eighteen months.  But this is an amendment of the fundamental law of this State, an amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>As regards the conspiracy that is spoken of, I am not one of those who are going to belittle it.  I am not of those who think that to improve the social conditions will entirely eliminate that kind of conspiracy.  If my understanding of the situation is anything like valid there are two types of mind working.  One type is not going to be deterred from conspiracy to revolution by force of arms by any amelioration of the social conditions, but it is a very important fact that their field of operation would be very much restricted.</P>
    <P>The number of people approached through poverty, through excited feelings, <Col N="1962" /> and envy, hatred and uncharitableness, will not be quite so readily available or so easily reached if the ameliorative social legislation which is necessary were put into operation.  But the Minister is allowed to stress here, and the public have been somewhat inflamed by the rise of a new movement so it is said&mdash;Saor Eire the President spoke of.  I think the minds operating behind that movement are not wholly the same as those which were operating what may be called the purely Nationalist movement.  In so far as Saor Eire is Communistic, it will be less Nationalist than the older I.R.A.  What I am wanting to say is this: that this Saor Eire movement has undoubtedly got its inspiration from Russia and from the Communist International, but it is no new thing to this country to have a Communist organisation. There has been a Communist movement, a very small Communistic influence working in this country at least for eight years or nine. It is now taking a hand in the arming of certain elements, probably a separate and distinct body of people.  And I draw attention to that because I want to know whether the existence of Communistic activities in this country is the occasion for the introduction of this Bill giving the powers that are in the Bill or whether the emphasis is rather upon armed activities.  Because there is a difference.</P>
    <P>For quite a number of years now I have been persistently trying to prevent any associations where I had some responsibility&mdash;trying to prevent men from allowing their natural desires, their obligations to improve the position of the workers and to defend them against attack&mdash;I have been persistent in trying to prevent them from allowing their minds to become infected with the Communist philosophy.  I have very persistently, perhaps without the knowledge of some of my colleagues, taken steps many times to prevent those men unconsciously moving in the direction in which the Communist movement draws them with its very powerful propagandist machine for influencing the workers and the working classes; and I think that the <Col N="1963" /> Communist movement as such has had very little influence among the working classes in this city or in this country. Undoubtedly the Communist organisation is extremely influential by virtue of its experience all over the world, extremely influential because it knows how to inflame, excite and permeate the minds of people who are suffering from injustice through economic depression and oppression.  But let me say this: that it is not essential to the Communist movement that they should use arms to attain their ends. It is not part of the necessary method of Communism, and it so happens that they have taken advantage of the situation in this country to utilise the militant nationalist idea and ideals to propagate the ideas they have set forth.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to this question: Is it to the political, social and economic idea of Communism that this House is going to direct its aims against, and that this Bill is intended to stress?  Or is it the attainment of those ideals by means of arms that they are intending to suppress? I think that it is important that we should draw a distinction, because if we do not we are going to pass a Bill which, under cover of preventing the dissemination of Communistic political, social and economic ideas and purposes, will enable the Executives of the future to suppress every minority idea, every movement which had no notion of achieving its ends by arms, armaments or by violence.  If this Bill were directed against the use of arms and armed force, you could talk of it in one way. So far as it is directed against the use of the platform and the printing Press for the propagation of social and political ideas irrespective of the use of arms and violence, then we have got to think of the Bill in another way.</P>
    <P>I want to put a point of view to some of the Senators quite seriously, perhaps running some risk of misunderstanding. We know there are zealots in all movements.  We have <Col N="1964" /> seen pretty frequent reference in the newspapers to Freemasonry, and we have frequently seen references in the newspapers coupling Freemasonry and Communism, as two sides of the same movement.  Be careful that some future Parliament will not elect a government of zealots, who also may connect Freemasonry and Communism as two sides of the same shield.  Article 9 of the Constitution reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The right of free expression of opinion as well as the right to assemble peaceably and without arms, and to form associations or unions is guaranteed for purposes not opposed to public morality.  Laws regulating the manner in which the right of forming associations and the right of free assembly may be exercised shall contain no political, religious or class distinction.</P>
    <P>You are given that guarantee by Article 9.  At the will of the Executive Council that guarantee to these minorities may be removed.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill to amend the Constitution, and at the will of the Executive Council these Tribunals may be set up without reference to Parliament.  The Tribunals will act on their own initiative.  They may try in secret and they may execute in secret.  There is nothing in this Bill to insure that there will be any report or record made of the trial or of the execution. There is nothing in this Bill which will guarantee to the people those things which the people in 1922 were guaranteed.  One might say quite fairly that the Constitution is a compact between the State and the citizens and some kind of assurance even to non-citizens having association and compacts with the State and with its citizens.  There is some kind of a compact between the State and the citizen, subject of course to the citizen knowing that the Parliament always has a right to annul the contract or compact and make changes in its laws.  But when making that compact there surely was given to citizens some kind of promise, implied if not explicit, that the Parliament before <Col N="1965" /> altering that fundamental law which was of the nature of a compact would give due consideration to the terms of the compact and the guarantees.</P>
    <P>The procedure here to-day is the annulment of the compact between the State which formulated the Constitution in 1922 and the individual citizens who were induced to enter into that compact and claim the citizenship of this State.  It is not possible if one wants to pay any regard to the rights of other Senators to examine in detail the sections of this Bill and to direct attention to the enormous and terrible changes that are being made in the law, and the powers that are given to the Executive and the armed forces subject to the Executive.  But I do say without encroaching upon the rights of others that the entry upon this course is, to my mind, a certain method of developing the Communist movement, not necessarily the armed Communist movement, not necessarily the movement for the overthrow of this State by force of arms; but the development of the Communist idea is going to be fostered by the fact that this is the kind of Constitution which a democratic Parliamentary Government is capable of.  If this Seanad is going to consent and to approve, well I suppose nothing more can be said and nothing more can be done.  But it will undoubtedly have a very serious effect upon the attitude of many people to the Parliamentary institution and the State organisation which we have up to now endeavoured to make one which would give security to the citizens and prevent injustice from the Executive authority.</P>

Personally I take a rather detached view and ask myself how all this debate and discussion will affect the business and industry of the country. I listened very attentively to what I thought was the remarkable <Col N="1966" /> speech which Deputy de Valera delivered in the Dáil on Wednesday last.

He made it perfectly clear that the reason he said they were not entitled to pass the law was because he denied they had a majority of the people of the country behind them.  Deputy de Valera denied that the present Government has a majority of the people behind them, the reason being, as he said, that a considerable section of the people were disfranchised in view of the fact that they did not recognise the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The main point I want to emphasise is merely this: that if the Government have a majority behind them and if we believe they have a majority behind them then we must realise that it is their function to maintain law and order and it is our duty to support them.  Deputy de Valera pointed out, and that as far as I could understand was his view, that if a majority of the country endorsed the Government and if the Government found it must administer the law of the country then they were perfectly entitled to go to Parliament and to ask for those powers.  I am deeply anxious not to misrepresent what he said, and I do not think I have.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Every section of the House agrees that freedom of opinion in politics, as in religion, must be maintained in the Free State&mdash;that everyone is entitled to do what he can to advance his opinions whatever they may be so long as he does so constitutionally and that no one must <Col N="1967" /> be prevented by intimidation or threats from voting or acting as he thinks fit.  We also agree that no law should be passed which should interfere in the slightest degree with the rights of private citizens.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I said all through the debate I found very considerable agreement. The Minister for Justice says he wants this Bill and that he cannot get along without it.  If we believe that the majority of the country endorses the Government then it is our bounden duty to give them the powers they ask for.</P>
    <P>My hope is that when this passing phase is over we will have a rest from politics, that we will be allowed to forget all about gunmen, that we will be allowed to devote all our attention to take the advantages which are now offering to us.  Next year I think we may look forward to a year of prosperity. Large crowds must visit Ireland in connection with the great religious ceremony that is to take place here.  An improvement in industry must follow.  Better prices must result for farm produce and an era of prosperity should begin.  Let us not present to the world the silly spectacle of a country, with boundless opportunities such as we have, wasting time in petty internecine strife which amounts to nothing and which, by no manner of means, can ever accomplish anything.  Let us take advantage of any opportunities that are offered to us, let us forget all the strife and let us take the Eucharistic Congress year as a red letter year in the history of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Senator Douglas described the differences between the two parties&mdash;those who believed that the Government were quite right in attempting to put down the troubles that are occurring, and on the other side those who believe that the matter was a political stunt.  I think if we examine the way in which this whole question has been put forward many of us will agree that it is a political stunt.  We find crowds of police around Kildare Street and at the approaches to this building.  Soldiers and armed people are moving about and people are being guarded.  A policeman came to me and asked me if I wanted a guard.  I told him to go to the devil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether he went or not I do not know, but he opened the gate and went out.  When we look at all this tomfoolery that is going on it is more fit for a cinema than anything else.  We have all this nonsense going on because it is pretended that some terrible things are going to happen. We are told that everything must be done immediately because dangers are in front of us.  Senators have been told that this Bill must be passed immediately with the result that there can be no proper discussion of it. All this is done as if we were on the eve of war, as if half Dublin were in the hands of some enemy and that arrangements had to be rushed to make the defences ready.  If I were asked who won this cinema battle, a battle that is supposed to be staged against the I.R.A. and other institutions I should say that the I.R.A. have had a fine victory.  They can say: Here we are, a small body of people in this country; we have upset the whole of this Free State Government, we have made them stand on their heads and tear their hair; they do not know what is going to occur and Bills must be rushed through at record speed.  I think the I.R.A. have had a fine victory.  They have made fools of these people and they can laugh.  They can laugh openly and say what a lot of tomfools there are in the country&mdash;we have shown <Col N="1969" /> now what our power is in the country. That really is what they have done.</P>
      <P>Personally, I am ashamed.  I never thought, in my time at all events, that a Bill such as this would be brought before the House.  In all the time that I have been considering these questions I thought that things would be done in a pacific way.  I am not advocating any shooting or plunder or anything of that sort.  I never have, but on the other hand I do not want to see any incitement to that sort of thing.  I do not believe that there was the least danger of any attack, of any violent attack on this Parliament or anything else requiring batches of police and that sort of show and propaganda to frighten the people.  All this is frightening lots of people.  Friends of mine who are Unionists, who do not approve of me or of my Party, have come to me and asked if it were safe for them to go to the country.  I told them it was and not to believe in all this tomfoolery.  In my opinion the Minister for Justice did a most dastardly thing in giving a statement to an English newspaper saying that this country was in a most desperate state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view of all these matters is that no revolution is possible in a well governed State.  It is only in badly governed States that revolutions take place.  Look at the countries in which revolutions have taken place.  Why did a revolution take place in Soviet Russia?  Because for ages the people had been governed, as the Ministers here want to govern this country, in a despotic way and because the country was poor.  This country, too, is poor because it has been plundered by the present Ministry who are sending over five millions a year across the water.  That money ought to be spent here.  Because it is being sent out of the country the people are impoverished and they resent that.  Spain we are told is in a terrible state of irreligion and Communism.  What has brought that about?  It followed eight years of despotism such as the Ministers here are trying to stage for this country.  Everyone knew that years ago Spain was a religious country, that the people had no thought of Communism, but now after a despotic <Col N="1970" /> rule of seven or eight years the country has suddenly been plunged into a revolution.  That has occurred at all times in all countries.  Look back at all the revolutions that have occurred.  Go back to the revolution in England when Charles I had his head chopped off because he had been trying to do exactly what the Ministers want to do here.  He had his Star Chamber to punish so-called offenders.  The people opposed his particular form of Government, and that brought about the revolution. That is what the Ministers here are going to do and they will get the revolution.  Why did the revolution occur in France?  Because the Government was extremely bad.  The country was impoverished and the King and his ministers were dealing in a despotic way with the people. The revolution would never have occurred only for that.  Countries that are well governed and that are not impoverished never have a revolution.</P>
    <P>My memory goes back a long way in this country.  I remember all the fighting and all the discussions that took place about the Land League.  The people were poor and the Land League sprang up all over the country.  Landlords were shot because the people were impoverished.  They could hardly live in the country at all and they revolted. That has always happened and will happen again.  What was the first step that led to revolution here?  The first step was taken when the revolutionists, including myself and others, were engaged in the landing of the rifles at Howth.  I daresay the President was there.  He probably was. Some of the Ministers were there, but I cannot say now who was there or who was not.  At any rate, the police and the soldiers went out there and attempted to seize the rifles from the hands of the people.  There was a scrimmage, and shortly afterwards the soldiers shot people.  The Ministers are going to try and do the same thing now.  They are going to seize the arms from the people.  I told the Minister six or seven years ago in private conversation that he would not succeed in getting the arms.  &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will get them and get them in good <Col N="1971" /> time.  I will seize the dumps.&rdquo;  He did not get them, because he told us the other day that there were dumps all over the place, and that he had not been able to seize them.  That was the first success that the revolution had in this country.  The next was when the authorities who were in force in this country at the time seized the people who fought in 1916 and shot them. These shootings at once brought success to the movement.  They gave it prominence and everyone knows that. Crowds of people who were not revolutionists at all joined the movement after that just as they did after the landing of the rifles at Howth.</P>
    <P>After the Howth landing I went to inspect Volunteers at Belfast.  As a result of what took place in connection with the landing the strength of the Volunteers there was increased by twenty-five per cent.  That is what is going to happen now.  Finally, the revolution in this country was successful on account of the Black and Tans. That is the way it is going to be.  The Minister told us that the jury system had been brought to naught.  I told the Minister for Justice when he brought in his legislation in connection with that, that he would fail; that the result would be that jurors would not convict.  The other day a man was being tried for some supposed political offence.  When the trial was going on the policeman who was giving evidence was asked by counsel if he had been convicted of beating and ill-treating prisoners in prison.  He admitted that he had been, whereupon the jury at once ignored his evidence and acquitted the prisoner.  The wholesale beating of prisoners by policemen has been a cause of a great deal of the trouble here.  The people resent these things very much and struggle against them.</P>
    <P>Several Ministers have asked what we here would do if we had to tackle this matter.  As a matter of fact that is not our business to consider.  That is the business of the Executive Council. I may say, however, that the first thing we would do would be to put discipline into the C.I.D.  We would make them obey orders and discipline. <Col N="1972" /> We would not allow them to ill-treat prisoners and so on.  The first thing we would do would be to put our own side in good order and afterwards deal with the others.  Our next step would be to improve the position of the people by keeping our own money in the country instead of sending it over to England illegally and robbing our people in order to pay debts we do not owe.  The sending away of money has been the cause of practically all the trouble that has been happening in Europe.  Germany got into trouble because her money had to be sent away to pay the other nations that had beaten her in war.  The same things occurred in France and in England. We hear about the murders that have happened in this country.  When you make a comparison they would represent about one to the four hundred or five hundred that are committed in England and in other countries, and in respect of most of these the people who commit them have never been discovered.  I believe that the whole of this business is a put up job in order to frighten the people into voting for the present Ministry again.  That is what many people think.</P>

      <P>Listening to Senator Colonel Moore, one must be convinced that there must be some mental  sion on the part of Superintendent Curtin that makes him believe he is dead; there must be some delusion on the part of Ryan that makes him think he is dead.  It is the appalling stupidity manifested by people like that that creates the situation in the country. You have in this country at the present time a strong  of crime and you have the bland, stupid blindness of people like Senator Colonel Moore who just say when people are murdered in the country that it really is not happening at all and that we are only imagining it.  Such people say that this is only a put up job, that it is propaganda.  What are the facts? Here we have a country with people who have not had the opportunity of knowing reflexively the ordinary reactions that a citizen should have to circumstances.  We have here a people who were denied the right of having a national Government for hundreds of years and consequently they fail to have that sense of the powers and the rights of authority that should be natural amongst all law-abiding people and that are natural under the moral law.  That has created in them, to a large extent, a failure to understand the need for obedience.  The fact that we have achieved what we did achieve by what had the outward semblance of being lawless means tended to make people who wanted illegitimate objects think they could also be achieved by actual lawless means.</P>

      <P>I made a few notes on the speeches of Senators and I am consulting them.  Senator Johnson seems to think that the all-important thing is to have down on pieces of paper certain guarantees for the people whether they get them or not.  He reminds me rather of the case of the doctor whose patients always died cured.  Senator Johnson wants to have all these nice fine phrases of liberalism, radical socialism and the rest of them <Col N="1974" /> that sound so well.  Here we have a Constitution guaranteeing all sorts of things to the people and as far as the Executive is concerned it has done its best to give the people these rights. Opposed against them you have various bodies of men through the country disregarding all law, having no sense whatever of right or wrong&mdash; blinded to all that&mdash;and putting the people in this position, that unless the people are prepared to assist the murderers they themselves will be murdered. Every citizen of a country has imposed upon him a bounden duty to come forward to give evidence and to make it possible for the police to bring murderers to justice.  What is the position in this country where we have these splendid guarantees for the rights of the subject?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty-five minutes are all we have given to us.  Give it to us, please&mdash;in your charity, do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is helping a lot to waste those precious minutes.  Under the moral law people are bound to give information to help to bring murderers to justice.  What is the position here?  The man who endeavours to do what he is bound by the moral law to do, to assist the police, is promptly murdered.  If you do not assist these people, if you do not connive at their misdeeds, you are sentenced to death by a hidden tribunal of blackguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson asked upon what was the emphasis.  Is it, he asked, upon Communism or upon the gun work?  You have a peculiar situation in this country where you have a tradition of action with arms previously for national reasons.  The thing can be condemned for two reasons: first, because the end it seeks to attain is bad; and, secondly, because the means by which it seeks to attain that end are bad.  In other countries, as Senator Johnson says, Communism does not necessarily involve the use of arms.  In other countries nationalism is not necessarily involved with Communism. Here you have people who, owing to our former situation, have not very clear ideas on nationalism or authority; but they have a tradition of using <Col N="1975" /> the gun.  You have people coming from outside trying to inculcate amongst our people an immoral doctrine, trying to have a coalition between gun work and the Communistic ideal.  This movement is doubly dangerous here: first, because of the gun work; and, secondly, because of the end that it seeks to attain.</P>
    <P>We are bringing in this Bill in order that the ordinary citizen may be protected against blackguardism and against crime, and in order that our young people may be saved from the constant propaganda which Senator Johnson referred to, and which has already extinguished the interior light of conscience of thousands of young men in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned the President will have every opportunity of speaking when I am finished.  The Senator objects to interior light.  That is exactly what the blackguards outside object to.  They are using every possible means, in a country where circumstances make it peculiarly easy for them to do it, to kill the interior light in the minds of our young men.  There are two things which prevent people from doing wrong.  One is the consciousness of moral guilt, and the other the consciousness that they are likely to be punished for it.  What is the situation in this country at present?  Everybody knows it&mdash;everybody of ordinary intelligence. I do not say that Senator Moore necessarily knows it.  The very people who at this moment tell us there is nothing to worry about if you call them on a jury with clear evidence in front of them as to the guilt of murder, or what is called political crime, will they bring in a verdict according to the evidence?  Of course they will not. We know that Senator Moore can talk all this bland nonsense, but call upon them to fulfil that duty and they suddenly realise the reality of the threat there is in the country.  Then we have people coming along talking about tomfoolery and so on.  Senator Dowdall says this country is perfectly safe, <Col N="1976" /> because it is Christian, because the people are peasant proprietors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>From Communism. What is the position in the country? Our peasant proprietors achieved what they have got arising out of a number of circumstances, including the fact that the landed proprietors outrageously refused to accept the responsibilities attached to their proprietorship. Consequently  you might call a form of injustice had to be done, and greater stress had to be put on the right of the tenant rather than the landlord.  It appeared to a man who had been paying rent and was merely a tenant, that at a stage he became the owner in fee-simple, subject to paying an annuity.  It appeared as if he became a proprietor by a form of confiscation from the landlord.  Then you had certain dishonest blackguards going through the country assuring the people that they really need not pay these land annuities.  Of course, that is a very easy doctrine.</P>

      <P>Occasionally.  The Senator is very anxious to waste time. All this childish frivolity is going on while the country is actually and really dangerously threatened.  We have a small Army and a small number of police.  It is said that there is only a small minority in the country who are touched with this Communism.  You can have an infinitesimal minority of the country touched by Communism, and be actually a threat to the whole Army and police force, except that we do realise, and that most of the people realise, what that trouble is.  These people are going round.  They do not say to the peasant proprietor: &ldquo;You have no right to own the land; the Communist ideal requires that the land should be the property of the State.&rdquo; They do not say that; they are too dishonest.  All they say is: &ldquo;Do not pay the land annuities,&rdquo; in order to create a condition of social disorder in this country, to collapse all law, all authority, and to build out of that anarchical condition the ideal that Senator Johnson referred to&mdash;the Communist ideal.</P>
      <P>What is the Seanad going to do in the matter?  This country, with its traditions of nationalism, is now being prostituted by blackguards going round assuring the young men that in order to be a decent Irishman you have to cease to be an honest man.  What do they say to the young men?  There is no anti-religious propaganda.  They are too cowardly to come out straight. They give hints.  They preach a doctrine contrary to Christian doctrine. They say: &ldquo;We are not trying to overthrow Christianity, not at all; we merely want to establish in the peoples' mind a kind of doctrine that is contrary to truth.  Once we have got them there, we will not have any trouble with Christianity.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Moore referred to the case of Spain.  What brought about the situation in Spain?  The fundamental cause of the collapse there was that prior to the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera there was an Executive that refused to take its job seriously.  It was not from the Czarist régime that the Soviet Government took over. They took over from Kerenski, a man with exactly the same ideas as Senator <Col N="1978" /> Johnson.  He wanted a lot of fine phrases on paper and blinded his eyes to what was happening in the country until he found that the Bolshevists had control.</P>
    <P>What are we asked to do?  To sit down and every time we get our reports in as to what is happening in the country to close our eyes and if we say often enough, &ldquo;It is not happening,&rdquo; all will be right.  We are an Executive with responsibility.  We have authority which we are bound to exercise.  Senator Moore in that usual way of his says he has no proposal to offer, that it is our responsibility.  He then does all he can to prevent our having the powers which are required to deal with the situation.  We are not entitled, we have not the right to sit down and to say: &ldquo;Let the thing go on.&rdquo;  It is our duty to bring these men to justice in so far as we can.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Dowdall said that we had not been able to bring the murderers of Superintendent Curtain to justice.  Of course we have not been able.  Who is going to come forward and give information when they know well that there is the whole force of the law, first of all, to protect the murderer?  When he comes forward, blackguards outside, who are not handicapped by any fine phrases, can come along and murder him, and when he is murdered the whole force of the law as it exists at present as against organised crime can be mobilised to defend the man who has murdered him, without coming along and helping us to get the murderer.  The one way to enable us to get the murderers of Superintendent Curtin or any other murderer when a murder has taken place, or to prevent a murder, is to give us power to make it safer for the law-abiding citizen than it is for the anti-law-abiding citizen. That is all we are asking for.</P>
    <P>What is the threat that is held out? That you are giving excessive powers into the hands of the Executive.  This country must have an election every five years.  The Dáil majority elects the Executive, and the Executive is controllable by the Dáil and ultimately by the people.  You have a choice between handing over power into the hands of the communist gunmen <Col N="1979" /> and leaving them with the protection of the law, with none of the restraints of the law on them, or handing over what you may consider rather excessive powers to an Executive which is subject to the Dáil, whose life is definitely determined, and which is chosen by the elected representatives of the people.  What is the choice going to be?  Is it going to be for the gunmen communists or for the Executive elected by the people?</P>

      <P>I do not propose to say very much.  There has been little time left to say anything, but I am not impressed at all by the last speaker with his usual supercilious attitude, that superior mentality that he evidently acquired in the capital of a great Empire.  He sneers at everything in the mentality of the people.  Apparently, according to him, there is only one group that has intelligence, has the super-mind, in this country and they think that they alone are in a position to decide what ought to be done.  There is one thing that they could have done and one thing they can still do and one thing that must be done if the fertility of the soil is to be nullified for Communism and other doctrines preached in this country.  There is a barrier against a certain element in this country.  It may be right or it may be wrong, but that outlook is genuinely felt and so long as that barrier remains that element is disfranchised in this country from recording their votes or being represented in the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no intelligence in the country besides the Executive apparently.  We have to bow to Senator Gogarty; that is news to some of us.  I say the oath of allegiance and the affiliations we are tied up with are preventing these people from getting some expression politically, and so long as that is so there is, I hold, fertile soil for the doctrines that the Ministry want to keep out of this country.  Now this Bill ought to be analysed and there has not been much opportunity to analyse it.  It is a Bill that, clause by clause ought to be argued and considered and if certain elements in the Bill are considered at all they should be sufficient to have the Bill thrown out.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (5) of Section 6 denies any appeal whatever from any decision whatever by this star chamber.  Sub-section (5) of Section 7 does not permit any coroner's inquest to be held. That is to say, nobody is to know how the victim of the present Executive has met his end, whether instantaneously or after a series of tortúres administered by their agents when they have him in their power.  It surely is a negation of all law that this is permitted under this Bill.  After all, the vilest criminal gets at least a coroner's inquest, but that is to be denied under this Bill.  Section 15, sub-section (2) encourages and directly orders or permits third degree methods to be employed by any element of the Guard. Any member of the Gárda may stop any citizen, and whether he believes him to be guilty or likely to commit an offence or anything else, if he has any particular grudge against an individual or one of his masters has a particular grudge against an individual, that individual can be taken away and third degreed at the will of the ordinary Gárda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say this with regard to the Gárdaí, that a certain development has taken place in this country during the last two years, and the public were coming to the point where they could differentiate between the <Col N="1981" /> Gárdaí as such and the C.I.D. as such and again between the C.I.D. that was devoting its attention entirely to ordinary crime and the C.I.D. that was devoting its attention to political action.  One of the great disasters of this measure will be that the Gárda Síochána will now be put in a position of complete hostility to the people and the people will be put in an attitude of hostility to them, and I cannot see how decent law and order can be preserved with that state of affairs being developed as it undoubtedly will be under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The freedom of the Press, of course, goes by the board.  Under Section 23 there is the abolition of by-elections, and now we find that the Executive can nominate members, operating, of course, through the Governor-General, representing the King, and can appoint any members of this House or in the other House if anything happens to any particular member.  It would seem to me that the Executive have gone mad, or that it deliberately wants to provoke blood and chaos in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether they are acting in the interests of any particular group that are supposed to want to prevent the Eucharistic Congress next year or not.  There is a good deal of debate regarding the Eucharistic Congress and a good deal of talk going on with regard to the reaction on the Congress of the coercion. I venture to think that if this measure is passed we will have blood and chaos and that there will be no possibility of having any Eucharistic Congress or any peace in this country.</P>
    <P>Sir Walter Nugent has appealed for peace and has appealed to us that we ought to forget the past.  How in the face of a Bill like this can we forget the past and is it likely that after all the historical knowledge that members of this House have they can conscientiously face this Bill in the hope that any coercive measure like it will be productive of peace?  I suppose it is too late now to make any appeal to the Executive or to this House or any appeal to those in control. It is really futile for the Seanad to sit here in face of certain statements <Col N="1982" /> that have been made.  Senator Douglas wants the Seanad to wash its hands like Pontius Pilate of any responsibility for it.  The Seanad cannot do that.  Senator Douglas must take his responsibility with the rest of us.  It is an Act of the Oireachtas. The Executive may have bullied it through, they may have broken all the traditions of this House and the other House in bullying it through in the time, but the Seanad itself had the opportunity of rejecting the closure motion and of taking its stand definitely in the interests of peace.  The Seanad has definitely refused to do that and Senator Douglas like every other member who voted for the closure motion is committed to the principles of this Bill.  I regret that is the case.  We had hoped, by making every reasoned and honest attempt, to remove the national disabilities before this measure was carried through.  I hold the Executive are at present preparing for the courtsmartial, for the murders and executions of many young Irishmen, and by no means are they going to stop the various movements by a measure like this.</P>

      <P>Senator Johnson said he was ashamed of this measure. So am I.  But we have to examine where the responsibility for it lies. Surely, the responsibility for these drastic powers, which are in direct conflict with the true principles of parliamentary government and with the fine platitudes of liberalism which Senator Johnson uttered, rests on public opinion.  If public opinion was healthy, there would be no need for any measures of this kind.  Who represent public opinion?  Do not the Parties in this House represent public opinion?  If those who oppose this Bill wished to modify its provisions, it rested with them to do so.  They had <Col N="1983" /> only to come out openly and say &ldquo;We stand for the suppression of disorder; we are determined to put down the disgraceful acts that have been taking place during the past year.&rdquo;  If they went to the Government with the intention of co-operating with them, if Fianna Fáil and Labour spoke unanimously condemning these acts, it would be very easy to modify the provisions of this measure, because public opinion would be so strong&mdash;</P>

      <P>The time has come when all those who have hitherto clung to Parliamentary methods should take stock. They, too, must discard their belief in Parliamentarianism for direct action.  They can no longer continue to sit in safety upon the green be-flagged Parliamentary stool.  For the people, pressed more and more into the capitalist mire are impatient. They realise more clearly than ever that a change of Parliamentary Government is but a change of bailiffs; that the mere re-shuffling of party labels such as is now going forward in John Bull's own island is but the clapping of a new sticking plaster upon a cancer which should be cut out at the root; they realise that the quack remedies of politicians are useless, and above all, that the cancer must be cut out with the bayonet of the people.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(4)  If at any time when an Order is made under this section the Oireachtas or either House thereof stands adjourned to a day and hour more than five days after the making of the Order, the Order shall be expressed and shall operate to summon the Oireachtas or such House thereof (as the case may be) to reassemble at a convenient hour to be specified in the Order on a convenient day to be similarly specified not less than three nor more than five days after the making of the Order, and in every such case the Oireachtas or <Col N="1989" /> such House thereof (as the case may be) shall reassemble on the day and at the hour so specified as if it had stood adjourned to that day and hour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The proposed new sub-section provides that when an Order is made setting up the Tribunal the Order shall be submitted to the Houses of the Oireachts in the usual form.  The formula is taken from the Public Safety Act of 1927.  Part IV of that Act provided for the establishment of Special Courts which at the discretion of the Executive Council might be wholly military courts, but any Order that was made, or proclamation, as it was then called, to establish such a court, had to be presented to the Oireachtas.  And if the Houses were not sitting the issue of the proclamation had the effect of calling the Houses into session.  I think, not to occupy too much time in presenting the argument for this amendment, I cannot do better than quote Senator Brown on this same question.  The wisdom of setting up military courts was under discussion, and I quote Senator Brown's speech from column 365 of Volume 9, in the Seanad Debate of 10th August, 1927:&mdash;</P>
    <P>As a lawyer, I view with the utmost dislike the setting up of military courts.  Their existence and their operation can only be justified by a state of absolute emergency.  I would have opposed these provisions of this Bill if it were not for the safeguards to which the President has just referred.  If a military court is set up in this country, this House would have the responsibility.  No military court can be set up without a proclamation, and no proclamation can be made without calling together both the Houses within five days, and each of these Houses will have the responsibility for the setting up of military courts.  If the two Houses are satisfied that such a state of affairs exists in the country as justifies and calls for military courts, then my objection as a lawyer is gone.</P>
    <P>The safeguards that the President referred to were the facts that the Houses were to be called together and <Col N="1990" /> that regulations were to be presented to the House, regulations setting forth the procedure under which the military courts should act.  The Houses were to have control, the last say, and the former right to annul the proclamation. With these safeguards the Senator and those usually associated with him thought that they could, under these circumstances, concede the setting up of these military courts.  This Bill as it stands leaves the discretion to set up a tribunal absolutely to the Executive Council.  The tribunal is to consist of military officers.  There is no provision here that any member of the Court will have legal experience and no provision that the procedure of the Court will be according to any regulations provided by the Ministry.  The tribunal will have absolute authority in all respects regarding procedure, sentences, publicity and whether there is any report to be made to the Executive Council as to whom they have sentenced; what sentence has been imposed and who carried out that sentence.  All these things are left to the absolute discretion of the military courts.  The arrest can be secret, the trial can be secret, the sentence can be secret, and no one but the military courts and the people who carry out the sentence need know anything about the trial, the sentence or the execution. It will be all legal under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am seeking, that, at least, when the order is made to set up the Court the Houses will be automatically called together, and will have an opportunity of discussing whether the emergency requires the Court, what the circumstances are, and exercise immediate authority over the Executive Council.  These tribunals may be set up while the Houses are adjourned. I would ask the Seanad to project their minds ten years hence.  Do not think only of the present situation or of October, 1931.  Think of the possibilities five or ten years hence when making up your minds on this amendment.  If you do give any consideration to the matter, except merely acquiescing without discussion and without consideration in the <Col N="1991" /> dictates of the Executive Council, I am sure you will vote for this amendment.</P>

      <P>The quotation which Senator Johnson has read from my former speech is perfectly accurate, I need scarcely say.  I then had, and I still have, the objection which every lawyer has to the setting up of any courts other than our own civil courts, and especially a military court.  I have it still.  The circumstances under which the question came before us when I made that statement were entirely different to what they are now.  There was then no such emergency as there is now.  There was then no state of war in this country. You are not entitled to set up martial law as a matter of constitutional law unless there is something in the country which amounts to a state of civil war.  In this country at the present moment, if the facts which the Ministers have put before this House, and before the Dáil, are accurate, there is a state of civil war and it is that civil war which is being carried on by the only means in which civil war in a country like this can be carried on, and effectively carried on. Therefore, although I was, and am still, most reluctant to give my assent to the establishment of any military court, I do so because I feel that the emergency is entirely different from what it was then, and that there is such a state of affairs in this country as makes this Bill absolutely justified.</P>

      <P>The conscience of the learned Senator is easily satisfied. He says there is a state of civil war in the country.  Even if there were a state of civil war here the military courts proposed to be set up by this measure could not be justified.  What are they?  They are courts consisting of three military officers without a legal adviser, without confirmation of the sentence, courts which can condemn to death a prisoner taken in cold blood.  During the British occupation of this country there was a question whether or not there was civil war in Ireland, and military courts were set <Col N="1992" /> up.  Of course the gentlemen who are now on the Treasury Bench have got the full advantage of the exertions of counsel in those days, and of the success with which we proceeded against these military courts.  During the British occupation, when military courts were set up, somewhat similar to the courts now proposed to be set up, we broke these courts and we broke them by writ of prohibition, which went to the House of Lords, and in respect of which the President of the Executive is fully aware.  We broke these courts because they were contrary to law and to the principles of liberty. The breaking of these courts as is disclosed in General Macready's reminiscences, was the cause of the Truce coming about.  General Macready's words were that if he could have shot the barristers and lawyers he need not mind shooting the others.  The President knows all that.  He knows that he is now establishing courts which cannot be prohibited, under which the citizen will have no chance of any defence, courts which cannot be prohibited, and which are contrary to law.  My friend Senator Brown has his conscience to salve.  He is quite satisfied.  He says that there is a state of war in this country.  I have been all through the country and I have not seen any state of war.</P>

      <P>I am firmly of opinion, that if any court of justice was asked to decide whether or not there was a state of war here it would decide to the contrary.  Nothing could be more absurd than to suggest that there is a state of war when everyone may drive about the country in motor cars and railways with perfect freedom. There is no army here that could face the Free State forces.  There is no state of war except a few odd murders.</P>

There may be a difference in the law of the land about a thing like that but there is no difference in the teaching of God, the law of God that has been taught to us all these ages by the Catholic Church.

Senator Brown will sit here smugly accepting that.

      <P>Senators will insist on going back to discuss a lot of matters that have nothing to do with the amendment.  The necessity or otherwise for the Bill does not arise in regard to this amendment.  The position is that the Bill provides for power to be given to the Executive Council of the day, without any other authority whatever, to set aside the guarantees embodied in the Constitution as we have known it up to the present.  The amendment suggests that at the same time that is done Parliament will be summoned so that it may have an opportunity of stating whether the necessity for enforcing this measure has or has not arisen. Surely that is not an unreasonable request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the most drastic Bill that has ever been introduced here because it is an amendment of the Constitution and it sets aside every guarantee <Col N="1998" /> that is normally given to each citizen in every civilised democratic country. There may be occasions when these powers may require to be used and it may be argued that the present is one such occasion.  This amendment does not prevent the use of these powers. It merely suggests that Parliament shall be summoned at the same time that these powers are put into operation. As Senator Johnson points out we must not look only to the present time or the immediate future; we have to look to all the future, and there may be a Government in office that may make very drastic and improper use of these powers.  Even to-day there are people aspiring to power in this country and one would have very serious qualms of conscience about placing these powers in their hands. As it is, they can be used without even the assembling of Parliament at the same time as they are put into operation.</P>
    <P>If this were a temporary Bill there might be some justification for opposing the amendment, but as it is going to be enshrined in the Constitution, and will become the fundamental law of the State in future at the behest of any Executive Council, I think it is absolutely essential that we should have some sort of a safeguard, inadequate though this particular safeguard may be, and I hope Ministers will see the reasonableness of accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree entirely with what Senator Brown said.  It is highly undesirable and really a hateful condition of affairs that it is necessary to set up abnormal courts of this nature. It is known to every single person in this country that as long as it was possible for us to carry on under the ordinary every-day system to which we have been accustomed, we have done everything we could do to preserve the jury system, and it is now because the jury system has broken down, it is now because jurymen have been terrorised into giving verdicts against their oaths, that it is perfectly plain, patent and apparent to everybody that courts of this nature must be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1999" /> We do what we are doing lamenting deeply that such an occasion has arisen and that there are people in this country actuated by motives so vicious that the setting up of these courts has become an imperative necessity for the preservation of the State, for the preservation of the Oireachtas, and even for the preservation of persons like Senator Colonel Moore sitting in this Assembly.

      <P>Since Senator Johnson has said that I may be wasting time, I will pass away from that question.  I will also pass away from what Senator Connolly said about the procedure in these courts and I will not touch upon how, in advance, he condemned the system of procedure which is to be set up when really he has not the remotest idea of what the system will be.  I will deal now with Senator Johnson's proposal.  This is germane to the issue.  We are now confronted with a completely different and a worse state of affairs than in the year 1927.  These organisations have spread their criminal activities more widely and they are better organised and are more dangerous now than they were in 1927.  You have to consider not what was considered to be right <Col N="2000" /> and proper legislation then, but what is and ought to be considered as right and proper legislation in this year of 1931 and in the condition of affairs which now obtains.  Let me draw the attention of the House to what everybody here knows happened last week.  We know there was a deliberate attempt made to terrorise members of the Oireachtas from coming here to do their duty.  That is a fact you cannot leave out of consideration when you are considering this amendment.  It is a vital fact.  I know no such attempt was made as far as Senator Johnson is concerned or as far as Senator Johnson's Party are concerned.  As far as Senator Colonel Moore and his Party are concerned, of course no such efforts were made. Senator Johnson is full of the spirit of liberty and the Senator is always on the side of a person who may be charged.  He has no interest or sympathy with the liberties of the vast majority of the people.</P>

      <P>That is precisely what I was coming to, and Senator Johnson must have seen that. He is not so dull as he tries to make out at the present moment.  Senator Johnson and others like him are not visited, but other members of the Oireachtas have been visited, and everybody knows that.  For what purpose were they visited?  It was to intimidate them from coming here and voting.  Is there no danger that that may be carried further?  Is there no <Col N="2001" /> danger that attempts may be made by physical force to prevent them coming here?  Is there no danger that even worse than that might be done&mdash; no danger that there might be, amongst members of the Oireachtas who believe in the preservation of order, two or three odd murders? Senator Colonel Moore, of course, would brush aside such a possibility.</P>
      <P>What would happen then?  An emergency worse than the emergency that has arisen.  What would happen in every other emergency would, I am sure, be exactly the same as happened in this emergency.  An attempt would be made to intimidate members of the Oireachtas, probably to kidnap, and possibly to murder members of the Oireachtas for the purpose that a majority might be turned into a minority.  We know that.  We see it already.  Senator Johnson comes along and says that it should not be done until these murder gangs have got a fair and open opportunity of turning a majority into a minority by murder and the like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that when an occasion like this arises the responsibility is upon the Executive.  It is not right or fair that the members of the Oireachtas should be exposed to the extra risk that Senator Johnson wishes them to be exposed to.  It is all right for him. Senator Johnson's soul is filled with sacred theories regarding the liberty of persons who join criminal conspiracies; he is perfectly safe.  But there are other persons who would be in danger, and it would be perfectly wrong that these persons should be exposed to unnecessary risks and dangers and that the Constitution of the State should be challenged as it has been challenged within the last few days.  Apart from that consideration, suppose there was a general election being held, suppose that there was no Dáil or no Oireachtas, and suppose that an effort was being made by these criminal organisations over the country to prevent the holding of a general election?  Suppose it were necessary to have the courts to deal with the matter, then the hands of the Executive are to be entirely tied and they are to go on.  What the <Col N="2002" /> Executive Council asks the Oireachtas to do is to give the Executive, in times of emergency, sufficient powers to deal with each particular emergency as it arises.  They are responsible to the Dáil and the Seanad.  That is the court to which they are responsible. There is a higher court still to which they are responsible.  We now, and our successors, are responsible to the highest court of all, the people of this country, and it will be for them to say whether we have acted wisely or wrongly in any emergency.  We ask that the Executive should have this power, and that the members of the Oireachtas should not be exposed to any unnecessary risk.  For that reason I ask the House to reject the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind Senators what the amendment proposes. The amendment proposes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) If at any time when an Order is made under this section the Oireachtas or either House thereof stands adjourned to a day and hour more than five days after the making of the Order, the Order shall be expressed and shall operate to summon the Oireachtas or such House thereof (as the case may be) to reassemble...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that the reason why he refuses to make this provision is that it would expose members of the Oireachtas to danger, that there would be attempts to turn a majority into a minority and that the lives of Senators and Deputies would be endangered. I take it from that that it has been decided, at the instigation of the Ministry, that the Dáil shall not meet until the emergency has passed because of the danger!  If the Minister says &ldquo;No&rdquo; then what is the value of his argument?  The Order, supposing there was such danger, would be enforced, notwithstanding that the Deputies or Senators were not able to attend.  The fact that there had been danger abroad of attacks upon Senators and Deputies would not make the Order ineffective under this amendment, and whatever danger there is in the plea of the Minister applies equally on Monday, <Col N="2003" /> Tuesday or Wednesday next.  That argument will not stand.</P>
    <P>This Order that is in mind presumably is going to be issued immediately, and if this amendment is inserted in the Bill it will make no difference at all on this occasion because it only applies to any time when an Order is made and either House is adjourned for a period of more than five days.  The Dáil, I understand, is adjourned until Wednesday next.  If the Order is made this week-end, as has been suggested, the Order will not have any effect whatever in respect of this emergency.  Now as to future emergencies, the Minister says that there would be danger in framing the Order in such a way as would automatically call the Houses into being.  As I have said, under the section as amended, the Order will still continue.  It will not be annulled. It does not mean that it must be ratified by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It means that the issuing of the Order will automatically have the effect of calling the Houses into being, so that if the Houses decided that the Ministry could not make an effective case for the issue of such Order then the Houses can annul it and the Ministry will resign.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the Seanad that the Dáil adjourned in July.  It met in October.  If, in some future July, the Ministry decided that there was an emergency and issued an order setting up military courts without this amendment there is no need for the Houses to meet until October, and whatever may be the case against such order it could not find expression in the Houses of Parliament.  Therefore, for the four months the Ministry is absolute, dictating the course of justice and exercising power without any check whatever of a Parliamentary nature.  Now that is a possibility under this Constitutional provision in respect of future emergencies. I ask the Seanad does it really intend that that shall be a power of the Executive?  Bear in mind it does not affect this particular emergency in the slightest possible degree.  The amendment has no effect upon this emergency. <Col N="2004" /> It only will have effect in respect of future emergencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The passing of the amendment would, of course, have one effect on the emergency which no doubt Senator Johnson has in mind.  It would delay the passage of the Bill, and that I think is what he is after.  As regards future emergencies, the Senator has made no attempt to reply to the Minister for Justice.  I am certain that one of the causes for the great increase of activity in the case of these organisations last spring was the hope that there would be a general election this year, that during the time the Dáil was dissolved they would have an opportunity such as they never had before, and that at a time when the Executive was weak, when there was no Parliament and when the civil law had already proved ineffective, they could create turmoil, if not chaos in the country.  I am quite satisfied that if you had a section like this in the Bill and a similar crisis arose again, the time for the conspirators to take action would be immediately after the dissolution.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, as I say, that one of the reasons for the special spurt was the belief that in the present Autumn there would be an election and that during that period there would be sufficient activity possible by these people to secure that there would not be a free vote of the people and that a Government which they, at any rate, thought would be more or less gentle to them would be returned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards leaving the Executive several months without any possibility of the Parliament meeting, the Senator knows perfectly well that what he was talking in that respect was absolute nonsense.  There is nothing to prevent the Seanad, if it has not done it already, passing a Standing Order saying that if a case of emergency arises the Cathaoirleach or the Clerk can summon the Seanad.  The Seanad can make any arrangement it likes in Standing Orders to provide that on any special occasion whatever it shall be summoned.  Without putting this in the Bill, and having the possibility <Col N="2005" /> of making the Bill inoperative, there is nothing to prevent the Dáil passing a Standing Order declaring that the Ceann Comhairle, if this section as it stands is put into operation, can immediately summon the Dáil.  Senator Johnson knows that well and he knew it when proposing the amendment.  I think his object in proposing it is not <Col N="2006" /> any one of those he has declared, but the one I mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 2:</P>
      <P>Schedule.  Section 1.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Every Order made by the Executive Council under this section shall forthwith be published in the &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; and shall also be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if either such House shall within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which such House has sat pass a resolution revoking such Order such Order shall forthwith expire, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such Order.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This surely is an amendment which should be accepted.  It also is taken out of the 1927 Act.  It provides that when an order is made by the Executive Council under this section it shall forthwith be published in &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; and shall be laid before both Houses in due course, and if either House shall, within the next subsequent twenty-one sittings, pass a resolution revoking such order, such order shall forthwith expire.  That does not make the order invalid.  It makes it imperative by authority of the Constitution that the order shall be made public. <Col N="2007" /> There is nothing in the Bill at present to ensure that when the order is made it shall be published.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This divides itself into two parts.  As far as the second part of the amendment is concerned, it comes under precisely the same objection which I made to the previous amendment.  I will not repeat my speech.  As far as the first part is concerned, that is publication in &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil,&rdquo; no doubt every order will be published in &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; because it will facilitate in the greatest possible manner the proving in court of the existence of the order, as of course the order will have to be proved in court. A copy of &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; will be evidence that such order has been published. Therefore, as a matter of ordinary precaution, the Senator may be perfectly certain that it will always be published.  But I object to making, and I ask the House not to make that anything like a condition precedent to these courts functioning.  I have already stated that everything that possibly can be done will be done by certain ill-disposed persons to prevent these courts operating and it might be quite possible that it could not be published forthwith for this reason.  It is pretty well known, or can always be discovered, where &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; is being published.  There are methods of dealing with and terrifying even printers.  Buildings even in Dublin can be blown up.  It would be simply asking for trouble if this were made a condition precedent.  I tell the Senator that he may be perfectly certain that it will be published, because, as I say, it will very much facilitate the working of the courts that it should be published, but I ask the Seanad not to make it a condition precedent.</P>

      <P>Schedule.  Section 2.  After the word &ldquo;Constitution&rdquo; in line 48 to insert the words and figures &ldquo;save Articles 18, 19, 20 and 24 thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to secure the privileges of Parliament. <Col N="2008" /> Under this extraordinary measure every Article of the Constitution after and including Article 2 stands suspended. I ask the House that Articles 18, 19, 20 and 24 of the Constitution should not be over-ridden by this new Act.  These Articles of the Constitution provide for immunity from arrest in coming to the Seanad and Dáil and in going from the Seanad and Dáil. They provide freedom of speech in this Assembly&mdash;I hope not too much of it&mdash;freedom of discussion in this Assembly and that the Assembly shall have control of its own proceedings. If the Minister is going to accept any amendment I hope he will accept this. Of course I know it will delay the passage of this Bill which is supposed to be most urgently needed; a Bill that could stand over the long vacation and is now so urgently needed!  Of course the T.D.'s would have to come back to the Dáil if this amendment were carried.  These are the pros and cons of this motion.  I will say no more about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what Senator Comyn thinks will happen if this amendment is not accepted.  If the Senator imagines that this particular Bill is going to be used, that you are going to have a Government that will attempt to set up a dictatorship, which seems to be what the Senator is suggesting, then you are not going to prevent that happening by the amendment that he has put before the House.  There is no intention of interfering with a member of the Oireachtas who is going to or returning from the House&mdash;not for any Parliamentary action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly think we have not just at present the sort of Deputies in the House who are engaged in any sort of murder conspiracy.  We know that the members of the Dáil at present and more so the members of the Seanad are members who, whatever affiliations they may have had in the past with an armed conspiracy against the State, have broken that connection and there is no likelihood that I can foresee that action is going to be taken against one of them.  But you can have the position arising where the immunity of a Deputy would be a most undesirable <Col N="2009" /> thing.  In other countries it has often been found that acts of violent criminality by Deputies have escaped punishment for a very considerable period because of this immunity of a representative. We have, as I stated to-day in the Dáil, quite a new situation arising, not in this country alone but in many other countries in regard to opposition to Parliamentary Government. We have in most countries in Europe Communist parties which are determined so far as they can do it to break down the Parliamentary system and to put an end to democracy&mdash; people who believe in the gun for themselves and who believe in establishing the rule of the minority by the use of the gun.  I hope we are not going to amend or enlarge or, in any way, extend the scope of this particular amendment to the Constitution. We are now putting into the Constitution emergency powers which should be ample for every possible occasion. You might have, in future, your Communist Deputy coming into the House with a gun in his pocket.  It is not so long ago since in this Parliament it would have been conceivable to have a Deputy coming into the House with a gun in his pocket.  You might quite possibly have had one of the men who had just emerged from the campaign, or armed conspiracy, in the early days when they were new to their Constitutional faith, coming into the House with a gun in his pocket.  I think it should be possible to deal with the situation that is developing, or any similar situation with these powers, and, for that reason, I do not think that this amendment should be made.</P>
    <P>It is provided that reports and publications of the Oireachtas are privileged and that utterances made in either House, wherever published, are privileged.  It seems to be assumed that the power in this Bill is going to be used to prevent ordinary discussion in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is utterly absurd.  But I heard, for instance, one member of the Dáil making very violent statements.  He is not of any consequence and I would not pay any attention to what he says, but I do say that I would not allow a man to preach murder in the Dáil and I <Col N="2010" /> would not allow a newspaper to publish direct incitements to murder.  We have to-day a man in the Dáil who was rather talking about the past, but he is a man who professes fairly violent principles.  We might easily, in a year or so, have in the Dáil men who profess Communist principles.  We might easily have men who would, as people have done outside, point to their opponents opposite and assert that they should be murdered.  As far as I am concerned, I do not believe that Parliamentary immunity should be carried to that length.  I do not believe that newspapers should be free to come along and say that President Cosgrave should be murdered, and so on, because somebody might have got up in the Dáil and expressed a sentiment of that sort.</P>
    <P>This whole Bill is based, and has to be based, on some belief in the decency of the Executive.  If you do not believe in the decency of the Executive, you should not pass the Bill.  You should turn the country over to the gunman. You have got to believe that the standards of the elected Executive&mdash;the Executive which obtains its place by vote of the majority of the representatives of the people&mdash;you must be prepared to believe that that Executive has higher standards than the murderers of Curtin or young Ryan.  If you do not believe that, there is nothing to be done; one side is as bad as the other and it would perhaps be just as well not to pass the Bill but to let the murderers have their fling and let the worst come as early as possible.  So far as the present Executive is concerned&mdash;and I am prepared to believe it of any other Executive, no matter what Party it may belong to&mdash;you are not going to find any gross abuse of powers which are put into their hands.  What I would fear in a change to another Executive would be not so much violence as yielding to violence and a refusal to deal with the worst elements in the country.  The present Executive has never used its powers immoderately.</P>
    <P>Some Senator was anxious to know this evening would death sentences by the Tribunal be reviewed by the Executive.  Even during the civil war, <Col N="2011" /> there was never a sentence of any military court carried into execution without the facts being placed before the Executive and the Executive agreeing to the execution.  When an ordinary murderer is convicted, we review the sentence most carefully and we have often spent a very long time upon its consideration.  So far as this Bill is concerned, every sentence will be carefully reviewed.  Any one who looks at the history of the last few years with an impartial eye will see that powers have been very sparingly used.  We had powers of internment and we used them once&mdash;towards the end of the civil war.  We had the Public Safety Act for eigtheen months and, except for one or two minor clauses, we did not put it into operation.  The fact that the power was in existence caused a cessation of political crime during the period.  Our whole policy has been to use the powers that we have as sparingly as possible.  I do not believe it would be possible in this country for a Government, unless it was a Government of people utterly without principle who would use the worst elements in the country in a campaign of assassination&mdash;unless it was a Government representing the people who are now in the I.R.A.&mdash;even if it wished could step over the line and create a sort of dictatorship.  Its own forces would fall away from it.  All its own support would fall away from it.  We come up from the people.  We have no support at all except such confidence as the people have in us.  We have no strength but that.  We have no prestige such as monarchs have or such as exists in countries where you have aristocratic government, in which there is prestige of wealth and prestige of long tradition.  We have nothing behind us, and no Government replacing us can have anything behind them, but the confidence of the people.  Any Government in our position is bound, at all stages, to do what it can in every way, both by the use of power and by being sparing in the use of power, to retain the confidence of the masses of the people who provided their authority. This whole question depends on <Col N="2012" /> whether you are prepared to trust the best Executive that the majority of the representatives of the people can elect.  If the representatives of the people are going to elect a crowd of ruffians, then it is all hopeless.</P>

      <P>I take it that the next sentence the Minister would have uttered, if he had thought of it, would be that no Constitution is of any value; that you may trust any Executive that will be elected.  I should like to find out from any person versed in the law whether the section which makes the various Articles of the Constitution of no effect does not mean that the provisions of the Constitution will be abrogated in respect of much smaller offences than murder and incitement to murder.  &ldquo;Sedition&rdquo; is a word which covers a very big range of offences against the established order.  I think it is very likely that there will be many utterances in the Seanad and Dáil which could be classed &ldquo;seditious,&rdquo; which utterances will be published in the speeches of Senators and Deputies. Is immunity in respect of such utterances cancelled by the Bill as it stands?</P>

      <P>I am bewildered.  I never heard such a soothing speech delivered by any autocrat as the speech delivered just now by the Minister.  I have always heard that you ought to beware of an autocrat when he speaks with syrupy sweetness.  What did he say?  &ldquo;I do not want anybody to come here with a gun in his pocket.&rdquo;  I have said nothing at all about guns in pockets. What I say is that the ordinary privileges of Parliament should be respected even under this dictatorship. &ldquo;This is not a dictatorship,&rdquo; said the Minister.  No.  It is more than a dictatorship; it is a tyranny, under which any of you may be hauled up before three military officers, none of whom may be a lawyer, for an offence which may not be a crime and you may be, on their sentence, either hanged or shot.  Is that a tyranny?  The gentlemen of the Seanad have voted here to-day, as they have always voted, on their allegiance to the Ministry.  You have a Ministry of decent men, we are told.  What about the members of the Dáil and Seanad?  Are they decent <Col N="2013" /> men?  If they are decent men, why should they not have the ordinary privileges of Parliament?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>Schedule.  Section 3, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 9 the words &ldquo;the word &lsquo;offence&rsquo; includes crime.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of the last amendment caused very great hilarity in the House so that perhaps another turn will not do any harm.  Perhaps some Senators who have not closely studied this Bill will give me their attention while I explain the meaning of the amendment. If Senators will turn to Section 2 they will find that &ldquo;the word &lsquo;offence&rsquo; includes crime.&rdquo;  It is not that the word &ldquo;offence&rdquo; means crime, but that the word &ldquo;offence&rdquo; includes crime.  There are a number of offences dealt with in the 34 clauses of this precious Schedule.  I hope there will not be a Schedule of the same character before the Dáil or the Seanad again.  Offences, treasonable acts and misdemeanours; also offences under the Juries Act, and offences under the Fire Arms Act; seditions, libel and other offences enumerated under this Bill.  Here we have the most peculiar thing I have ever seen in any piece of legislation.  The Minister for Finance seems to be acqainted with the legislation of various new countries in Europe, but has he ever seen anything to match this: &ldquo;Any offence whatsoever (whether committed before or after this Article was inserted in this Constitution or before or after Sections 4 to 34 of this Article came into force) in respect of which an Executive Minister certifies in writing under his hand that to the best of his belief the act constituting such offence was done with the object of impairing or impeding the machinery of government or the administration of justice?&rdquo;  Supposing I said that Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald's parliamentary <Col N="2014" /> style was better than the style of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>He might be fined or imprisoned. I hope I would have legal representation.  We have the word of the President, and the Seanad is witness to it, that these men are to be legally represented.  I might be hauled up and sentenced, not to fine or imprisonment, but to whatever punishment the three military gentlemen chose to inflict.  I ask to have the operations of this measure confined to crime, and therefore to strike out the words &ldquo;offence includes crime.&rdquo; By striking that out you will not interfere at all with the legitimate operation of this measure.  You will not prevent them excluding from this House gentlemen who bring guns in their pockets.  It will not help what they call the gunmen in any way if you do this, and it will bring us into some sort of conformity with the law as we have understood it up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>To strike out these words would mean that crime, unless otherwise brought in, would not come into the Schedule, because Senators will notice that the Schedule refers repeatedly to &ldquo;any offence.&rdquo;  Coming to Clause 7, it says: &ldquo;Any offence whatsoever whether committed before or after this Article was inserted in this Constitution.&rdquo;  The words Senator Comyn wants struck out are the words &ldquo;offence includes crime.&rdquo;  The object of Clause 7 is that if we get the murderer of young Ryan we will put him before the Tribunal, and there will be no chance of intimidation, but if we accepted Senator Comyn's amendment we would have to put the murderer before the ordinary court.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Schedule.  Section 4, sub-section (2).  To delete the words &ldquo;five members, all of whom&rdquo; in line 33 and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;three or more members, of whom one (who may or may not be an officer of the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann) shall be a person certified by the Attorney-General to have legal knowledge and experience and the others.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This also is taken from the Public Safety Act of 1927.  It was upon this proposition that Senator Brown uttered the words regarding the undesirability of military courts.  He had certain assurances then from the President that it was not only Parliamentary control but that there was some legal knowledge in the constitution of the court.  As the Bill stands there is no obligation upon the Ministry or the Governor-General on the advice of the Ministry appointing a court that it shall contain any person having any legal knowledge.  Inasmuch as this court is going to have very wide jurisdiction, a very wide range of power and authority to try and sentence, my amendment provides that one member of the Tribunal should be a person certified by the Attorney-General to have legal knowledge and experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty about this is in a way the difficulty that there is about legal tribunals.  Army officers by their profession are men whose duty it is to face any danger that may come up against them in the ordinary course of their work.  If the military officer is not prepared to take the danger of being shot or killed in some other way when his duty requires it he is not fit to be a military officer. It is not the duty of civilians to undertake these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might not be possible to get a suitable civilian to undertake the task. Remember he is a man who would be appointed for perhaps six months or a year.  He might incur very considerable enmity.  He would not always be living in barracks and perhaps carrying <Col N="2016" /> arms as a military officer would be. He would be a man who having undertaken this difficult and dangerous work would have to go out perhaps finding his practice at the Bar gone and finding himself in considerable difficulties about recovering it.  We have come to the conclusion that in the circumstances we are up against it would not be fair to put a man into that position and it might not be easily possible to get a really suitable man, because for this work you would certainly have to get a very good man.  I am satisfied that with a section drawn as this section is you do not really require a legal man.  You require simply three intelligent, resolute and conscientious men who will bring commonsense to the problem.  Legal technicalities will not come into the procedure of this court.</P>
    <P>It is not tied up with all the forms that a civil court is tied up with.  In one sense it is like one of the military committees that were set up during the civil war, except that of course it will ordinarily sit in public and except that it will have professional men appearing before it and that the members of the court will be permanently in their position, that as long as the court remains you will not have one set of officers trying one case to-day and another set of officers trying another set to-morrow.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Senator Johnson would like the Cheka. If we took no measures we would have it here.  It would grow up of itself and a very disorderly and undesirable Cheka with no principle or policy behind it.  After all, as I say, this court has no civil jurisdiction.  It is not going to be trying the question of the ownership of property.  It is not going to be trying difficult, intricate matters at all.  It will simply have to sift the evidence that may be put before it with regard to whether a man, say, was found in possession of a gun or not, the evidence as to whether a man was found in possession of seditious documents or not, the evidence as to whether a man was a member of an illegal organisation or not.  As I say, <Col N="2017" /> no very intricate or difficult problems will come before it.  It will have undoubtedly legal men on both sides who will have to prosecute and defend.</P>
