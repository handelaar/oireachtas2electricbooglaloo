      <P>Senators, need I say that a moment such as this fills one with many kind thoughts&mdash;that one has been selected to preside over an Assembly such as this for a second <Col N="3" /> time?  One cannot presume that there are qualities in oneself that fit one for such a position, but yet one can feel that a body which is practically the same as we had here for the last three years will give the same assistance to me in the future that it has accorded to me in the past.  Senator Dr. O'Sullivan, in proposing me, said that I was of no Party.  I could be of no Party because we have here in this Assembly men of diverse Parties, all working for the one object: the preservation and dignity of this Seanad, to ensure that the Seanad will fulfil the object for which it was elected under our Constitution, that is, to give a reasoned consideration to all matters that come before us from the Dáil and to make amendment, where necessary, in the Bills that are sent before us. We have loyally done that duty in the past.  I feel that with your help that shall also be done in the future.  I thank you all sincerely.  Words fail me, but from my heart I thank you and assure you that I shall try to do my duty.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;There are so many items on the Order Paper for next Wednesday, a draft copy of which is enclosed herewith, that it will probably be desirable for the House to take a decision regarding the order in which the respective items will be taken.

It would be agreeable to the Government if, after items 1, 2 and 3 (which are governed by Standing Orders) have been disposed of, the remaining items were taken in the following order: 14, 10, 13, 12, 4, 5, 11, followed by the remaining items in the order in which they appear.

      <P>On the last occasion this Bill was before the House, Senator Johnson asked some question arising out of it, and perhaps the Minister would be able to deal with that now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain remarks were made with regard to the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923.  So far as that is concerned, there is a poor law side to it and there is also the question of local government reorganisation.  On the matter of local government reorganisation I am not in a position to say anything more than I said in the Seanad in June last, when the Local Government (Elections Postponement) Bill was before the House.  I then gave the backbone of what was in our minds with regard to these proposals.  Since then the matter has been receiving attention, but with a Housing Bill, a Traffic Bill and a Town Planning Bill, and the general circumstances that I referred to then, we have not thought it advisable to put these proposals before the Oireachtas yet.  I do not anticipate that these proposals will be put before the Oireachtas until after a general election.  As I explained at the time, the proposals are of a kind that ought to be dealt with on their merits, and it would be difficult to do that leading up to a general election.</P>
      <P>On the poor law side, I have said on several occasions that it is very necessary we should codify our poor law, but in view of the present position, as between, say, boards of health and county councils, and in view of the fact that they will have to be radically changed&mdash;at any rate that will be suggested in the legislation that will be put forward for reorganising local government&mdash;it will be quite obvious that any codification of our poor law must follow the legislation dealing with the reorganisation of local government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be in order to call attention to an Act which comes <Col N="6" /> up for renewal in this Expiring Laws Bill?  I refer to the Labourers (Ireland) Act.  The first Labourers Act was passed, I think, in 1883.  The question of these labourers' cottages is becoming a rather serious one in the country at the present time.  Many of them have been built for forty years and some of them are getting into a state of dilapidation.  They are showing considerable signs of wear and tear and of old age.  I would like to know from the Minister whether it is his intention, when codifying the poor laws, that there should be some scheme whereby labourers will be put in the position to purchase their houses and plots.  Of course, purchase has this great advantage, even in the case of ordinary agricultural land, that the tenant purchaser is more careful of the soil.  I think he is more industrious than a man who is merely a tenant.  I should imagine that that impulse would be much stronger in the case of a labouring man who felt that the house was his own, or was going to become his own.  I would like to know from the Minister whether there is any scheme whereby labouring men in labourers' cottages can be enabled to become ultimately the owners of these cottages.</P>

      <P>I have always supported the ownership of labourers' cottages by the labourer.  I had a great deal of experience of these Labourers Acts across the water.  I always supported the proposal that the labourers in this country should own their cottages.  I even introduced a Bill to that effect, but my efforts in that direction did not succeed.  I think that the labourers ought to own their cottages and plots.  I know that in some counties that view is not held. I think that so far as the rates are concerned, as well as on the score of improvements and of other things, it would be an advantage to the country if the labourers did own their holdings.</P>

      <P>The difficulty about the suggestion that has been made by Senator Comyn is that if you give the labourer the right to buy you must give him the right to sell.  There is no <Col N="7" /> reason why, if he has the right to sell, these cottages in probably less than half a generation would not be inhabited by people who are not labourers. It was for labourers they were intended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister has not been able to give the House any information as to when the Workmen's Compensation Bill which has been proposed and which is, presumably, to follow the recommendation of the Commission, will be introduced and passed into law.  The same intimation has appeared several times on these annual returns relating to the Expiring Laws Bill.  Certain things must wait.  The Workmen's Compensation (War Addition) Act, 1917 must be continued until the proposed new Workmen's Compensation Bill has been passed into law.  I want to give a little stimulus to the Department concerned as to the importance of bringing that Bill forward at as early a date as possible.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go in any detail into the question that Senator Comyn has raised, but I put this to those who may be thinking with him: Do they anticipate at any time within, say, the next 50 years that there will be any improvement in the agricultural conditions in this country requiring any addition to the number of agricultural labourers?  If they do, what do they think as to the housing of the future agricultural labourers if the present occupiers are placed in a position to sell their houses at any price they wish? When they have sold their houses there will be a new agricultural labourers' housing problem to be faced.  I think we should be cautious about creating a new housing problem for the next generation so far as agricultural labourers are concerned.</P>

      <P>Apart altogether from the problem that is, possibly, involved in the sale of a cottage by a tenant who has purchased it, it might be well, perhaps, if I gave Senator Comyn some figures.  These can be got in the report of the Local Government Department.  When the Senator has those figures before him he can, if he <Col N="8" /> wishes, return to the question on the Housing Bill to-morrow.  The position, roughly, is that 42,000 cottages have been built in the country.  At present there is a debt that is outstanding and that has to be repaid within the next 40 years or so.  That debt amounts to £5,000,000.  The finances involved in the matter are roughly that £120,000 are provided annually from rents. About £80,000 are provided annually by the local authorities, and about £70,000 by the State.  The cottages are let at an average rent of about ½ per week.  The great national advantage, so far as I can learn from people who talk about it, that would result from tenants becoming owners of their houses, is that they would not have to pay more than they are paying now&mdash; probably they would like to pay less&mdash; that by the tenants carrying out the repairs themselves the local authorities would not have to pay that £80,000, and the debt of £5,000,000 would vanish.  There is an arithmetical problem there; the type of problem that faces people who have to pay off debts that have been incurred.  While there has been a terrible lot of talk about it, and, as Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde has indicated, the talk has been going on for a very long time, no one has yet got a little bit of paper and put the figures down to solve the problem.  It is for that solution that we are waiting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which is based on the Report of the Tariff Commission arising <Col N="9" /> out of an application for a tariff on oats.  The Bill imposes a tariff of 2/6 per cwt. on oats with two-thirds imperial preference rate.  In connection with that imposition of a duty on oats it increases the existing duty on oatmeal, which is 2/6 per cwt. without imperial preference, to a rate of 6/- per cwt. with 4/- imperial preference. Ordinarily, this is not a tariff that will have any very great effect.  This year, owing to the shortage of the oat crop, it has definitely affected the price of oats here, but ordinarily it might well not affect the price of oats at all or only very slightly indeed.  It will, however, ensure that the price of oats will not be depressed unreasonably or unnaturally in any year by any sort of bounty-fed, or special importation of, oats into the country.  While it is a matter of some importance to require careful investigation&mdash;the Tariff Commission heard evidence from all sides &mdash;it is the kind of tariff which in a normal year will have little or no effect.  It will at any rate ensure that there will not be some external factor operating to cause quantities of oats, which are not really required here, to be imported and unnaturally to depress prices.</P>
      <P>So far as seed oats is concerned, the view of the Tariff Commission, which I think is the correct view, is that this will lead to the production in this country of all the seed oats required. A number of years ago, when a tariff on oats was first mooted, it was thought that there would be a case for the exemption of seed oats.  It is clear that there would be a great deal of administrative difficulty in the exemption of seed oats.  It would require the keeping of records as well as inspections, and would cause trouble and expense which would hardly be justify. The view taken by the Tariff Commission was that there was no reason why seed oats that are required in the country should not be produced here, and that in fact benefits might follow from the production of seed oats in the country because then there could be something better than good commercial varieties of oats supplied for seed.  Most of the seed oats imported is only good commercial oats.</P>

      <P>As this is a Money Bill we cannot do anything with it except to say whatever happens to be in our minds.  It seems to me that this is not very well-considered legislation. Presumably the object of this Bill is to help the Irish grower of oats.  It cannot help him in so far as his export business is concerned.  This country has got a surplus of oats, and normally a good deal of that is exported. The Bill may help the Irish grower to some extent to get a better price for his oats inside the Free State.  I do not know to what extent it will help him in that direction.  It is almost impossible to say.  But to whatever extent it does help him it will be to the detriment of the consumer of oats inside the Free State.  So that nationally, what you gain on the swings you are going to lose on the roundabouts.  This legislation does not seem to me to be very well considered, or in fact that it is necessary at all. These customs questions are undoubtedly very complicated and one may very easily go wrong, but in speaking on this Bill one cannot lose sight of the fact that the Minister for Agriculture, speaking in another place a few days ago, said that this Bill was powerless to do the farmer who produces oats in this country any good. If that is so, why is the Bill introduced? I am not satisfied that the Bill is necessary or that it is going to do any good.  Unless you are certain that you are going to do good, that the object in view will be attained, then I think that this had better not be done at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely disagree with the conclusions arrived at by the last speaker.  I think it is very necessary that a Bill putting a tariff on oats should be passed.  My only regret is that this Bill was not introduced earlier in the year so that farmers who grow oats would have gained the benefit of the tariff.  Unfortunately a great many farmers were obliged to sell their oats to the merchants before the tariff was put on.  They had to sell at a very small price.  This year it is the merchants who will gain the benefit of the tariff, but I hope that in the future <Col N="11" /> arrangements will be made to enable the farmers to get the benefit of it.</P>
      <P>As regards the seed oats, if it had been announced earlier that a tariff would be imposed on imported oats farmers would have been enabled to take steps to provide seed oats for the ensuing year.  They would not have threshed all their oats in the autumn; they could have retained a certain quantity of it for the spring in order that it could be threshed freshly and so ensure a good seed.  There was a considerable amount of oats dumped in this country, and it reduced the price in the home market.  I entirely support the action of the Government in putting on this tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the views expressed by Senator Linehan are very sound.  Land is going out-of cultivation very rapidly.  I think more than a quarter of a million acres have been divorced from the plough within the last ten years.  Anything that can possibly remedy that state of affairs is desirable.  Senator Bagwell quoted the Minister for Agriculture as saying that this tariff could not possibly do the farmers any good.  I took particular notice that Senator Bagwell did not pledge his own word to that.  Does Senator Bagwell say that a tariff on oats will not do the farmer any good? The Senator is too intelligent a man to say anything of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of this tariff because it will encourage the cultivation of oats next year and the year after. With Senator Linehan, I regret that the tariff was not introduced at a time when it would be of some benefit to the farmers.  This year it will be of considerable benefit to the me Perhaps they need some consideration &mdash;I do not know.  I am sure that next year this tariff will be of benefit to the farmers.  For that reason, I hope it will be a continuing tariff until such time as we become an exporting country, not merely in oats, but in barley and other grain.  I would be inclined to think that the importation of seed oats might be desirable, because, as I know myself, the strain of potatoes, oats, barley and all sorts of <Col N="12" /> crops seems to get worn out in a particular district or country.  That fact would not, of course, be sufficient to induce any person to offer the slightest objection to a tariff on oats in an agricultural country like this, where undoubtedly we can grow very good oats.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes said that we cannot grow wheat.  That is a delusion.  We can grow wheat.  We have some of the best wheat land in the world.  Another delusion that is frequently fostered is that there are areas in this country suitable for grass and unsuitable for tillage.  That is an absolutely flagrant falsehood.  We ought to turn our attention to the fact that we have a growing population and a diminishing agriculture.  That position must be rectified at once.  If tariffs, no matter how high, are necessary to effect a remedy, I certainly will support them. I support Senator Linehan's statements. I understand the Senator is in favour of a policy of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the tariff, but I am not so optimistic as my friend Senator Comyn.  The Senator says that next year the farmers, who this year are being robbed of the benefits of the tariff, will have their innings. I am afraid that next year, instead of a shortage, we will have a surplus, and we will have to accept world prices for a lot of our oats.  Possibly in the Twenty-six Countries, by reason of the tariff, we might be able so to manipulate matters that we will drive up the price in the home market and make the people who want oats pay for them, especially those feeding horses and the like.  I agree that it is a good thing to have a tariff on oats.  So long ago as 1924 I moved a somewhat similar proposal in the Dáil.  I dealt also with the question of butter, but my suggestions were not agreed to.  Possibly I was before my time.  People are now coming round to the ideas that some of us then had.  As the Government gain experience they observe things more from the point of view of what the people require.  This tariff will let the farmers know how far any benefits are to be derived from tariffs on agricultural produce, excepting wheat.</P>

      <P>So far as the tariff on oats is concerned, if the farmers are satisfied, if the feeders of oats are satisfied, if the Government are satisfied, and if all the rest of the people interested are satisfied, I do not think there could be any objection to the passing of a Bill dealing with a duty of 2/6 on oats.  I was curious, when Senator Comyn spoke of the country becoming eventually an exporting country, what was going to be the effect of this tariff upon other countries to which the Senator expects oats and other produce will be exported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so very long, I think.  Appearances indicate that you will have a tariff on oats and other things in the only market that is likely to be a buyer of our agricultural goods.  I have no doubt that in the consideration of the fiscal policy of Great Britain and Northern Ireland the fact that there is a 1/8 tariff against Great Britain and Northern Ireland in respect of oats will be taken into account when fixing the tariff that will be put upon Free State oats in those markets.  I notice from the figures that were considered by the Commission that in the last five years there has been a very great surplus of exports of oats over imports of oats, and in only one year out of the last five years has there been any appreciable excess of imports over exports.  Quite apart from the question of policy, it may be very doubtful wisdom to tempt the market for our export trade to put a tariff upon those articles which the farmers of this country will desire to export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every emphasis has been laid upon the duty on oats, but nothing has been said about the duty on oatmeal.  I cannot find genuineness in the explanation that has been given for the increase of the duty upon oatmeal imports.  It has been for some time 2/6 per cwt., without any preferential duty.  It is now proposed to make it 6/-, with a preferential duty of two-thirds&mdash;in effect, a 4/- duty.  I am inclined to think that simply means raising the price to the consumer perhaps by 1/2d. a 1b. retail.  The Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="14" /> defending this Bill and speaking for the Government in the promotion of a tariff on oats, said, according to the Dáil Official Reports: &ldquo;The production of oats and the price will depend absolutely and always on the price of Indian meal and maize, and as far as this tariff is concerned it will make no difference whatsoever in production and price.&rdquo;  The Minister has repeated time and again that in the judgment of the Ministry there will be no increase in the price of oats.</P>
    <P>It appears form the report that the 2/6 duty upon oatmeal has resulted in the oatmeal millers being able to secure the bulk of the market for their product.  If they can do that with a 2/6 duty, where does the need arise for raising the duty to 4/-?  The Minister stated that, according to the Commission, if you are imposing a duty on oats there ought to be a proportionate increase in the duty on oatmeal.  That would be justifiable only if you are raising the price of oats, but in as much as the Minister says you will not be raising the price of oats I submit there is no justification for the increase in the duty on oatmeal.  It may be said that there may be a seasonal increase in the price of oats, but the trade in oatmeal is an all-the-year-round trade.  The millers will buy, not at that portion of the year when the market is more likely to be against them, but rather when the market is likely to be with them.</P>
    <P>Without any application from the millers, without any justification in the report or from the Ministry, there is an increased duty proposed in the case of oatmeal.  That simply means that there is another 1/- or 2/- per cwt. in the pockets of the millers.  It is not justified, because it means an increase in the cost of oatmeal to the consumer. I think the House ought to express its dissatisfaction.  The House should indicate that it is not satisfied that there is any justification in the circumstances for the increase in the duty on oatmeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill.  There is no doubt this tariff on oats will have the effect of raising the price, but in the end it will be a distinct <Col N="15" /> advantage to the country.  The yield of oats this year is about half what it would be in a normal year. Whether there was a tariff or not we would not have had much oats to export this year.  The reason of this tariff is quite obvious.  It is there because of the low price of oats imported into this country last June and July.  Canadian oats were landed at the North Wall at 6/6 and 7/- a barrel.  That came heavily on the farmers because the farmer growing a cash oat crop could not possibly meet that price.  If we have a normal crop of oats next year, and there is every likelihood that we will have a larger crop than we had this year, in my opinion oats will be no dearer in the Free State than they will be across the water.  At the present moment the price across the water is 2/6 lower than in the Free State.</P>
      <P>It has been stated here that it is the intention of Great Britain to put a tariff on produce going into that country from the Free State.  It has been mentioned that Britain will retaliate in the matter of tariffs if we impose this tariff on oats.  That argument does not arise at all, because England does not export oats, and she has no hope at all of sending us oats. She certainly sends us manufactured goods, and it is our mission to send England farm produce.  The legal</P>
      <P>Oats is an ideal crop for the Free State.  It is the grain crop that suits our climate.  Senator Comyn said very distinctly&mdash;and I am sure he is great authority on wheat growing&mdash;that we can grow wheat here.  If one speaks to any farmer outside the barley-growing areas about wheat-growing that farmer will simply laugh at the idea.  In the barley-growing counties no doubt wheat can be grown, but there is a great difficulty about getting a sale for it.  Our climate is so moist that it is almost impossible nine years out of every ten to save wheat satisfactorily. It is a very sensitive grain.  If it is not dried within two or three weeks after it is cut it becomes quite musty and is practically useless for anything except stock feeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> No doubt we could grow sufficient wheat to meet our home requirements, but I think that it would mean a tremendous capital expenditure in order to have the wheat kiln-dried immediately it is cut so as to be able to retain supplies to meet the requirements of the people in the country. Oats is the most suitable grain for growing in this country.  It has the largest acreage of any grain crop, because it is particularly suited to the climate.  It is grown successfully in the poor counties just as well as in the rich counties.  Perhaps it is grown more extensively in the poor counties.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson spoke about the tariff on oatmeal; he said the tariff should be on oats and not on oatmeal. If oats go up by the full price of the tariff, 2/6, the miller will have to pay that full price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, with all respect, does not happen to be right in this matter.  I daresay that on the present occasion the tariff has had the effect of increasing the price of oats, because it was a short crop.  If we had a normal crop we would be exporting oats.  We did export oats last year. The reason we exported so little last year was not so much because it was a short crop; rather was it because the price was low in England and it would not pay the farmer here to export it. The Free State farmer preferred to use the oats on his own farm.  Four or five years ago we had a fine trade exporting oats, but when the price comes down to 9/- or 10/- a barrel the farmer prefers to use the crop on his own farm rather than go to the trouble of exporting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the increased tariff on oatmeal, the fact of the matter is that if the millers do not get an increased price now for their oatmeal they must go out of business, particularly when there is a likelihood of the price of oats per barrel increasing. During the last four or five years oatmeal has been no dearer in the Free State than in Northern Ireland or Scotland.  The tariff on oatmeal has <Col N="17" /> had no injurious effect in the way of putting the price up.  The tariff did have a good effect on the millers' trade.  The millers captured nine-tenths of the whole oatmeal trade of the Free State, and it meant prosperity for them.  As a result of the tariff they were able to work the full twelve months of the year; before that they were working only three or four months each year.</P>
    <P>I think it would be ridiculous if the Tariff Commission were to recommend a tariff on oats and not an increased tariff on oatmeal.  The 4/- as against the 2/6 is not a sufficient increase, but it will be adequate enough to enable the millers to retain their trade in oatmeal in the Free State.  I believe that next year the price of oats in the Free State will be the same as the price on the other side, and I think oatmeal will resume the position it held for the last five or six years; it will be the same price here as in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is a scheme in force on the Continent in connection with general tariffs.  I have in mind countries like Germany and France.  The point is that if in a particular area they have too much oats they may export oats from that area and get a certificate in order to do so.  Under that certificate they are then enabled to import, some six or twelve months subsequently, the same quantity of oats as they exported. I think a similar scheme would be very suitable in this country in relation to oats.  In Wicklow, Wexford and Waterford they grow black oats.  According to the evidence that was given before the Tariff Commission, black oats are not suitable for the oatmeal millers, and it is considered that black oats are not suitable either for hunters.</P>
    <P>In a wet season the oats would undoubtly be in a very bad condition. They would contain more moisture than usual, and they will not keep unless in stack.  If the oats are threshed they have to be kiln-dried. If, in a big area, it was found they had too much oats, would it not be better to export those damp, black oats and have some arrangement whereby they could import a similar quantity later on?  There is always a good market in <Col N="18" /> the South of England for black oats; pit ponies use them largely.  If these oats were exported under such a scheme as I have suggested, oats suitable for the requirements of millers, horse trainers and others could be imported free of duty.  That would be of considerable benefit to the farmers accustomed to growing oats.  There would be no loss involved.  Black oats, I understand, were offered in Wicklow at 10/- and 11/- a barrel.</P>

      <P>I did not think the price was so low as that.  Whatever the price may be, I think black oats are not very much appreciated in this country either for milling or for feeding horses.  It would be as well to export black oats, get a certificate, and then import more suitable oats subsequently. It certainly would save storage expenses and would facilitate the trade in every way.  I offer that suggestion to the Minister in the hope that he will favourably consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>With, reference to the point raised by Senator O'Rourke, the inauguration of a scheme of export certificates such as he suggest would mean a fairly big change.  It would mean the starting of a system, because we have no such system in existence. It seems to me such a thing would be started only after definite consideration of its advantages and disadvantages here.  It could hardly be brought forward in relation to a small tariff such as this without, beforehand, having received special consideration.  There are factors in operation in some of the countries where such things exist, factors that do not operate here.  There is the question of great distances and internal transport costs, which may make it desirable that a surplus in one part of the country should be exported <Col N="19" /> to another part and a deficit in a different part should be made up by imports from abroad.  To some extent that might operate here, but it is a matter that would require a certain amount of consideration.  There are, perhaps, other tariffs in connection with which such a scheme might be inaugurated, but I think it is a matter that ought to be specially brought to the attention of the Tariff Commission so that all its aspects might be examined before we would take it up.</P>
      <P>As has been indicated here, this tariff accidentally is having a considerable effect this year.  The benefits of the tariff are not all going to the merchants. The tariff has been in operation for a considerable time now, because it came into operation as soon as the resolution was passed in the Dáil.  While it was a week or two too late to be of benefit to all the farmers, there were, however, very large numbers of farmers who are accustomed to sell oats, who had oats for sale, and who had not then disposed of them, and they were among the farmers who got definite advantage from the tariff this year.</P>
      <P>I do not think we can expect a tariff such as this to have any great effect on the area under cultivation.  It is true that the fact that prices have improved this year may cause more oats to be sown next year.  I hope it will not have the effect, in areas where oats are grown for seed, of causing too much oats to be sown with consequent disappointment and reaction.  It will do simply what I have already indicated. It will prevent in normal years a possibility of the market being disturbed by bounty-fed importations or other exceptional importations which might depress the market out of all proportion to the quantity brought in.  It will have the good effect of causing steps to be taken so as to ensure that nearly the whole quantity of seed oats required will be produced here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not a great deal to be done in connection with oats.  The oat crop is mainly grown for feeding on the farm.  There are comparatively limited areas where oats are grown for sale, <Col N="20" /> and up to recently there has been an excess of exports over imports.  If there were changes in conditions through the world here and elsewhere we might have that position again, and in that case a tariff such as this could not do much. I do not think any damage in any direction will be inflicted by this tariff.  Some little good will be done. There will be a stability of price, and that will be safeguarded to some extent. Generally this tariff is a minor matter which will do some good and I think, will do no harm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to oppose this Bill, because, in the first place, it would be useless, and, in the next place, I do not think that any one&mdash;certainly I do not&mdash;wants to question the decision of the Government to have a supplementary Budget and the provision that has been made for a tax on petrol, but I would like to suggest to the Minister for Finance that should he by any chance be in position that he has to impose or adjust any further taxation that the motor car is taxed just about as much as if not more than, it can reasonably stand at the present time.  Apart altogether from expensive cars that run into £700 or £800, on which a man could undoubtedly afford to pay a substantial tax, I suggest that taxation on a comparatively cheap car, such as a car that costs £200 or £250, is really too heavy at the present time, and that when times are better, if it is possible, something ought to be done to reduce taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> I made a somewhat rough calculation, but I think for practical purposes you may take it as correct.  If a man buys a car for £250 and uses it for five years&mdash;if he uses it for trade or has to travel a great deal or if a farmer is using it in the country and gets 10,000 miles a year, which is not unreasonable &mdash;he covers 50,000 miles in the five years.  Assume that he is fortunate enough to sell it at the end of five years for £40.  Adding up the cost of the car, the road tax, petrol and say £25 on spare parts, which is very moderate for a car that type in five years&mdash;and if he gets 25 miles to the gallon&mdash;I have found that his total expenditure after deducting the £40 that he would sell it at would be about £490.  The road tax, import duty and the tax on petrol would amount to £193, so that out of £490 in five years he actually pays £193.  I could give similar figures for other cars, but I am taking the low priced cars and the English car, which pays a minimum duty, for my calculations. I suggest, if it is possible in the future, that some steps should be taken to make some concessions, at any rate, on the total amount of the tax attached to low priced cars.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister a suggestion that I made here some time ago.  I am not opposed to this petrol tax in so far as it affects motor cars, but there is a certain hardship which is reacting on manufacturing, commercial and business concerns, namely, what this increased tax is going to mean as regards the working expenses of delivery lorries.  Commercial vehicles include buses as well as delivery lorries, but I want it understood that I am referring purely to delivery lorries.  The suggestion I would make, if the Minister would consider it in view of the difficulties or practically the impossibility of differentiating between the petrol tax for one purpose and another, is that some concession might be afforded as regards delivery lorries in the annual tax that is contributed.  I think that would go some way to meet the additional cost which is burdening industry at the present time in so far as those delivery lorries are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the representations made in regard to this tax, though for somewhat different reasons.  In recent times it has become necessary for farmers to use lorries for all their outgoing and incoming traffic. The roads-have practically been taken over altogether for motor traffic.  Horse traffic has almost ceased.  For that reason our villages throughout the country are now being supplied in all their wants by means of lorries.  I believe that the additional 4d. a gallon petrol tax coming on the consumers in these areas is excessive and I would ask the Minister if opportunity affords to do something in his next Budget to ease the burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised that the tax operates in such a way as to be rather more severe here than in Great Britain. It is more severe because, of course, the distribution costs of petrol are higher, or are alleged to be higher, and there is an extra price charged, also, because the vehicles are subject to an import duty.  I do not see in the present financial circumstances any possibility of an early reduction in the petrol tax now proposed, and I do not see any possibility of reducing the import tax on motor vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to a reduction of the road tax, the difficulty is that it is not so very long since we had loud and frequent demands for an increase in the tax on these very heavy vehicles.  It was alleged everywhere that the ratepayer was being charged for the cost of maintaining roads for lorries and other vehicles that were doing harm altogether out of proportion to their contributions to the Road Fund.  We had experience of that some time ago.  There has been silence about it recently.  I have no doubt that if the proposal were seriously put forward to reduce the road duty it would reawaken all that clamour.  It may be that in city streets, for instance, the delivery van may not do a great deal of harm. Perhaps a light van may not do a great deal of damage but heavier vehicles I think do a very considerable amount of damage.  I would not <Col N="23" /> like to promise that we could at the present stage propose that a higher proportion of the costs of the roads should be thrown back on the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>What Senator Douglas said with regard to the total burden of taxes is impressive in its way, but I am of the opinion that while of course there are many of the ordinary motor cars which are used mainly or even solely for business, an enormous number of them are mainly if not solely luxury vehicles.  Every day I see people coming into town in motor cars who not long ago travelled on trams. They could go on the trams very well and not lose a great deal of time. So I regard these as luxury vehicles and quite suitable for a fair amount of taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is slightly awkward that this Bill comes immediately after the discussion on the petrol duty.  Senators are aware that we have felt it necessary most years that some sum should be voted at this time of the year for the carrying out of schemes which would relieve unemployment and distress. We feel it necessary, in spite of the difficult financial circumstances generally, that some money should be found this year.  There has been a slight increase in the recorded figures of unemployment and there are areas too in which it is pretty clear that there has been such a shortage in the potato and oat crops as to cause some hardship.  The general decline in prices too has caused some sharpening of the distress which in many areas we will always have in the winter season.  The problem of finding the money has not been so easy.  We did not feel that we should borrow for it.  We felt we could only borrow <Col N="24" /> for distress and unemployment if there was some enormous increase and that schemes far beyond anything we have ever carried out were necessary. If we had conditions which obliged us, shall we say, to spend one million or one and a half millions, then the most exceptional measures would be taken and the amount required would certainly be beyond what could be expected to be raised by taxation.</P>
      <P>The amount that is being asked for this year is not exceptional.  It is something like the amount that we have asked for in previous years.  We felt that it is not consistent with reasonable Budgetary policy to borrow in order to find the amount required. On the other hand, we did not feel in the present state of affairs that we could impose taxation for the purpose.  It was in those conditions that we looked to the Road Fund. We are not proposing actually to deprive the Road Fund of money that would normally be available for the purpose of the fund in the present year.  So far as the Road Fund is concerned, it will have all the income that the road tax will give it, and all normal schemes of improvements, maintenance and repairs that should be carried out will be carried out out of that fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators, I am sure, are aware that there was at the time of the Treaty a United Kingdom Road Fund which was, of course, a joint fund and to the assets of which the Saorstát had a claim.  For a very long time it was impossible to arrive at any conclusions in regard to the apportionment of the fund, but in 1927 the matter had proceeded so far that the British Government paid a sum on account of £200,000.  It was not possible to get any further by means of negotiations and the two Governments agreed on the appointment of an arbitrator.  Sir Henry Strakosch was chosen.  The next step was to prepare an agreed statement of the facts.  That took a very considerable time and a great deal of difficulty was found in arriving at agreement as to the facts.  However, agreement was finally reached last June and the two Governments accepted <Col N="25" /> a statement to lay before the arbitrator in regard to the facts.  Then each Government had to prepare its own claim to the assets of the fund and to make its own case.  The two cases have now been prepared and they are being exchanged.  Each Government will prepare a comment on the claim of the other, and the agreed statement of facts, the claim of each Government and the counter statement of each Government will be ready to be laid before the arbitrator within a very short period.  The three main documents are ready.  When the arbitrator has received those and studied them he can either come to a decision on them or hear either Government verbally if the Government wishes it, or he can ask for additional information or additional arguments. But it is not anticipated, matters having reached the stage which they have now reached, that there will be any great further delay.  The main difficulty that was experienced since the appointment of the arbitrator was in agreeing to a statement of the facts. It is anticipated, therefore, that most probably it will be possible for an award to be given within the current financial year, and even if it is not given before the 31st March next that it will not be delayed very much beyond that. We anticipate that there will be a payment out of the old Road Fund available for the Road Fund certainly within six or seven months and probably within a shorter period.  The Road Fund has generally a considerable amount of cash in hands during the earlier part of the year, and it is anticipated that it will be possible to find this sum that is now being asked for out of the Road Fund and that the Road Fund itself will be recouped at quite an early date.</P>
    <P>This money which will be received out of the old United Kingdom Road Fund was of course the proceeds of road taxation contributed prior to 1921. The people who contributed it probably in many cases are no longer motoring.  A great deal, of course, has been done with the roads in various ways.  For instance, in the repair of bridges that were broken down, undertaken by the 6d. rate, a good deal <Col N="26" /> has been done and the extra point duty men who have had to be put on to deal with traffic have never been charged up to the Road Fund.  I think there is no hardship involved in taking this £250,000 in anticipation of the special receipt which the Road Fund will shortly receive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to quarrel with the taking of £250,000 from the Road Fund for the purpose of relieving unemployment.  What I do quarrel with is the small amount of the sum that is being put up to deal with this most important problem that we have to deal with at the present time.  The Minister has told us that there has been a slight increase in the numbers of people unemployed. I do not agree that the increase has been slight.  There has been an alarming increase in the numbers of people unemployed in this country during the last twelve months.  Take, for example, the railways. It is a well-known fact that the railways, from one cause or another, have curtailed services and reduced their staffs very considerably. It is also a well-known fact that owing to the economic conditions in other countries the young men and women who normally had to flow from this country to earn their livelihood elsewhere are not being able to go away to seek their livelihood.  The position of this country at the moment with regard to unemployment is becoming alarming.  We have only got to study the reports of the officers dealing with the question of home help.  In these reports you will find that increases have been taking place every month in the number of people demanding home help.  In Dublin alone, in the month of October, 7,100 families received relief from the Dublin Union authorities.  That goes to prove that the conditions in the country are a good deal worse than the Minister is prepared to admit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, I say that the amount of money that the Minister proposes should be spent in the relief of unemployment is altogether inadequate to deal with the circumstances of the moment.  The Minister <Col N="27" /> has other means of raising money if he requires it.  Suggestions in that respect have already been made.  I think the Roads Advisory Committee suggested that a large loan could be got on the security of the Road Fund and that the money could be usefully spent in providing employment for the people who need it.  Plenty of useful work remains to be done, and employment could be given to people doing it.  I would go so far as to say that they are entitled to get it.  I think that every man and woman who is able and willing to work has a God-given right to be allowed to work and that the means should be provided for them.  We heard the statement made before, that it is not the business of the Government to provide employment for the people. It is the duty of the Government to see that they do get employment in their own country.  The Church has stated openly and quite emphatically that the people are entitled to be provided with employment or with the means of subsistence.  To their credit they have seen in recent months the danger that exists.  The Church has said that there is a menace there and the sooner it is tackled the better for society.  Every man who has a family has the right to get the means of providing for his children. Nobody can say that the poor working man has not the same love for his children as the wealthy man.  These people ought not to be tempted too far.  They are being driven to desperation.  Is it any wonder that they are joining illegal organisations? Everyone knows that the labourers of this country did their share when men were wanted and what is their condition to-day?  In every respect they are worse off than they were before the fight started.  Widows and orphans get no pensions here.  If they had remained under the British Government they would get pensions and the men who are out of employment would get something at least to keep them.  They would not be offered the miserable thing that barely keeps <Col N="28" /> body and soul together.  That is the cause of a good deal of the trouble that is occurring in this country.  I earnestly suggest to the Minister that this quarter of a million of money is not nearly adequate to deal with the problem that is before us.  This unemployment problem is a cancer that is eating the vitals of the country.  It is responsible for most of the trouble in the country.  The people believe that they can get employment, and that if the Government were in earnest the means of employment could be provided for them.  They believe that this country can provide employment for its own people.  No serious effort is being made to do that.  Unless something is done very soon to aid these people it will be a bad thing for all concerned. Responsible people in this country have sounded a not of warning with regard to this important matter and I hope the warning will be taken notice of.</P>

      <P>From the Minister's statement, it was not quite clear that they are certain of getting this money about which there is a dispute.  He told us that there was a dispute between the two Governments as to what part of the Road Fund should come to this country and that both Governments had made up their case and put it before the arbitrator.  Then he proceeded to jump to the conclusion that the Free State would get what they wanted out of it.  Is not that rather premature?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to repeat a question that I submitted to the Minister on the last occasion to find out whether it is the intention of this section that when rules have been <Col N="31" /> made setting up the Apprenticeship Committee and when any employer takes into his employment apprentices &mdash;I am referring more particularly to those trades where the apprentices have been hitherto called learners&mdash;it is to be assumed that this section will make it obligatory on that employer to keep in continuous employment the apprentices for such period as is fixed by the committee.  We had a statement from Senator Comyn giving us authoritatively, or at least what purported to be an authoritative interpretation, the meaning of this section.  I am not quite convinced of it.  If I were, I think the attitude I would adopt to the Bill would be very different, but as it appears to me, under this section when we have designated a trade any persons employed in that trade will be obliged to serve the employer for such period as is fixed and the employer will be obliged to retain in employment such persons for the period that is fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hitherto, in numerous trades such as some of those which one would hope and expect to be brought within the scope of the Bill, it has been the practice to pay off in slack times a certain number of apprentices and a certain number of adults.  Rather than have to pay off all the adults it has been customary to pay off an understood proportion of the learners.  Henceforth, it would seem that the obligation will be to keep the learners in employment and to pay off the adults. That is to say, the adults who will be paid at the higher rate will be paid off. Those who will be paid at the lower rate will be kept on.  One might assume that will be the normal practice. As a matter of fact, by arrangement with the representatives of workers generally, it has been fairly regular that a proportionate number of learners only should be paid off with a proportionate number of adults.  If we are going to make it obligatory on the employer to keep in employment all the learners, then it will mean the disemployment of adults to the advantage of the firm no doubt, but to the disadvantage of the employees.  If one firm has a larger number of learners <Col N="32" /> than another, obviously that firm will have an advantage over its rival in the same trade which may have a small proportion of learners.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill to make it obligatory upon the Apprenticeship Committee to fix the number of learners in any particular establishment. It is optional in the clause dealing with the rules.  I can see very considerable difficulty arising out of this clause from the point of view of the continuous employment of learners when a slack time comes.  It is only the adults who will be dismissed.  That is a most undesirable development.  As the clause stands&mdash;I do not know how it can be amended now&mdash;I think it constitutes a very considerable danger to the working of the section and to the working of any trade to which it is hoped the Bill might apply.</P>

      <P>The difficulty which the Senator foresees is not in the section at all.  Section 12, about which the Senator has been mainly speaking, refers to the period of apprenticeship. The Senator brought into his argument a point as to the number of apprentices. The gravamen of the Senator's case was that the number of adults might be very considerably reduced while apprentices were kept on in certain circumstances in slack time.  I refer the Senator to Section 8, sub-section (2), paragraph (d): &ldquo;The committee, when fixing the number of apprentices, may fix it as expressing the proportion of the number of persons of any class or classes employed from time to time,&rdquo; and so on.  Of course it is optional, and always will have to be optional.  There are trades where that would clearly not be the proper thing to do.  Section 12 contains the answer to the Senator.  Under that section the committee may &ldquo;release both parties from their respective obligations under the agreement implied by this section or modify such agreement.&rdquo;  That gives a way out if a difficulty supervenes at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Senator will agree that if we are going to consider apprenticeship at all it must be considered in <Col N="33" /> relation to the number of apprentices. The number of apprentices must be fixed up in such a way that it will be in proportion to the number of adults employed.  The period of time must also be envisaged.  Every conceivable case cannot be met by a special subclause. Where, say, a factory was burned down, does the Senator imply that in such a case the employer would have to keep a body of employees to teach a certain number of apprentices? I refer the Senator again to the concluding portion of Section 12, where the committee in such circumstances, or other equally good circumstances, may arrange to release both parties from their respective obligations under the agreement or establish a proportion in accordance with the new circumstances.</P>

      <P>This Bill is quite simple.  Its purpose is to extend the period for application for the provisional registration of slaughter premises from twelve months to eighteen months.  It will enable me to agree to provisional registration more than once.  The original Act was too rigid.  Application for registration of premises had to be applied for within twelve months.  We want to extend that to eighteen months.  Under the original Act, provisional registration to enable an owner to make changes in his premises so as to come within the requirements of the Act could only take place once. If he applied afterwards he could not <Col N="36" /> get provisional registration.  I am asking under this Bill to get the right to give provisional registration more than once.  The net effect of the Bill is that the premises must be put in order not within a period of twelve months, but within a period of eighteen months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all welcome the introduction of any measure dealing with this important subject. This Bill is, to my mind, one that is long overdue.  It is one that has been necessary for a very long time in this country.  We know that our productions in manufactured goods are comparatively limited, but such productions as we have are in continuous <Col N="38" /> competition with products from other countries which are on show in all our cities, towns and villages.  Up to the present there has been nothing to indicate the source of their origin.  In most other countries that I know of this question of marking goods and commodities with the country of origin is very rigidly applied.  It is deliberately used as a protection in itself for the home manufacturer.  One of the things that I would like to bring up in connection with this Bill&mdash;it is my main and fundamental objection to the Bill as drafted and conceived&mdash;is the fact that the entire onus and initiative is left to the home producer and to the home manufacturer to take steps to prevent the alien and the foreign manufacturer from coming in here with his goods without marking the source of origin on them.  I may be wrong, but it seems to me that the onus for getting goods into this country should rest on the foreign manufacturer and the importer here of the foreign goods. I think that is the general rule elsewhere. I think the method adopted elsewhere is that regulations are laid down in those countries by the department that would be equivalent to our Department of Industry and Commerce which have to be complied with if goods are to be admitted into those countries at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel it is hardly fair to the home manufacturer to have to take the steps that are laid down in this Bill.  According to one of the sections, a commission is to be appointed.  The manufacturers in any particular industry will have to make a definite application to that commission.  They will have to fight their case, either by their own representatives or by counsel, and convince the commission that it is desirable, in the interest of a particular industry, that all goods belonging to that particular industry should be marked with the country of origin.  In most other countries I claim that it is a <i>sine qua non</i> in the case of all imported goods that they must be marked with the country of origin.  I think that would have been a better line of action for us: to ensure that there should be a blanketing provision covering all goods imported into the country&mdash;that they must have the <Col N="39" /> country of origin marked on them. The regulations in other countries are mainly concerned with the method of marking; that is to say, where the article itself has to be marked and what the nature of the mark is to be. There are textile commodities, garments and some other things which cannot be stamped, but where an indelible stamp is possible without causing injury to a commodity, then that is the method of marking which is invariably applied.  Where labels firmly attached are the only reasonable methods that can be used, then such a regulation is laid down.</P>
    <P>I will give you an example of what is done in the United States as regards this question of marking commodities. The regulations there stipulate for indelible marking on hosiery goods; one of a pair had to be so marked.  For the protection of their own manufacturers they altered that regulation.  Fearing, apparently, that expensive hosiery would be imported, they put a new regulation in force which insisted on both stockings or socks of a pair being marked.  I mention this merely to illustrate the importance attached to this question of marking goods with the country of origin, and to show that the onus, handicap and liability are entirely on the foreign manufacturer and importer.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that would have been the proper approach in dealing with this question of merchandise marking. There may be reasons why such a course was not followed.  I would be very much interested to hear those reasons at this stage, because on the Committee Stage it might be possible to have amendments passed which would overcome these difficulties.</P>
    <P>I gladly admit that there are many sections in the Bill which are extremely valuable, and that the Bill itself will be valuable.  I do not think, however, that it is the right approach to the object we should have in mind in this matter of the protection of our own marks.  The penalties for inadequate or non-marking of goods in the case of imports to the American markets are accompanied by a fine equal to <Col N="40" /> ten per cent. of the value of the goods plus the responsibility on the importer to have the goods marked before they are cleared at the Customs.</P>
    <P>I mention these points in order to show what importance is attached to the question of the mark of origin.  I did feel, when it was intimated in the Press that this Merchandise Marks Bill was going to be brought forward, that it would go upon those lines, and that, if anything, the exceptions would be at the discretion of the Ministry, and I felt that the general basis of policy would be that every commodity brought into this country from a foreign country should be so marked. I do not see at the moment how that purpose can be achieved in that form on the Committee Stage by any amendment. I would be interested to hear the reasons why the present course is being adopted.  The other is the usual method adopted in other countries, and I think it is the more obvious protection for the home manufacturer.  I do not know why the manufacturer here should have to go first of all to the expense, trouble and difficulty of getting his trade together, then making an application to a commission which would be synonymous almost with the Tariff Commission, then having to pay a fee and to work up his case while the other method has been so successful elsewhere and is, in my judgment, the proper one to follow in the interests of the home manufacturer.</P>

      <P>I wish to throw out the suggestion that in view of the fact that the House is apparently quite satisfied to take this kind of Bill as a matter of course, we might all make suggestions and bring forward Bills extending the provisions of this sweepstakes system to different kinds of charities.  Unless somebody is going to give us some explanation as to why the Principal Act should be extended to cover one class of organisation and another class of organisation, I assume that we are prepared to extend <i>ad libitum.</i></P>

      <P>With reference to what Senator Johnson has said about the <Col N="42" /> extension of the sweepstakes, I would like to see some of the revenue devoted to the welfare of the poor persons in the country who have to be treated in hospitals.  Most of those people suffer great hardships.  In order to have treatment they may have to go to Dublin, and that means great expense.  If there is to be any extension of the sweepstakes I would like to see the funds utilised in that direction.</P>
