      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that in the national interest a wide extension of winter dairying is desirable and should be encouraged by positive action on the part of the Government, but considers that the summary of evidence contained in the Report of the Tariff Commission on the application for a tariff on butter does not warrant the conclusion of the Commission recommending a flat rate tariff of fourpence per lb. applicable in normal years, and asks that a full transcript of the shorthand notes of that portion of the evidence which was not confidential should be laid on the Table of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last clause was included in the motion in the belief that the evidence which was presented to the Commission must contain material which is not referred to by the Commission in their summary, because I do not think that the conclusion which the Commission came to is justified by that portion of the evidence which is included in the summary.  I rather think that some facts, figures, and arguments must have been presented by those who were supporting the application for a tariff which were overlooked by the compilers of the Report.  Otherwise, I do not think that the Commissioners could come to the conclusion which they reached.  Though no formal intimation has ever, to my knowledge, been made to Senators or Deputies I have been informed within the last two or three days that the transcript of notes taken at these inquiries does become available in the Library to those who make application, but that it only becomes available a little while after the presentation of the Report.  It is well that Senators should know that the transcript of notes in regard to these various Commissions on tariffs is ultimately made available to those who make a special effort and apply for it. The formula of laying this evidence on the Table would, however, indicate the wish of the House that the matter should be publicly intimated.  I should say that the evidence of this Commission should, if possible, be printed and not merely typewritten.  However, <Col N="395" /> that is a matter which will, no doubt, be determined by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I dare say that most Senators will realise that I have not approached this question with any anti-tariff prejudice. I am quite sincere in the declaration that there should be, even if it required State aid, an extension of winter dairying, and that some effort of a positive character should be made to induce farmers who are dairymen to extend their operations into the winter months.  The reasons for that are very plain and have been set out in the Report of this Commission.  It will, perhaps, be no harm to advert to them shortly.</P>
    <P>The salient features of the whole position regarding dairying and the butter industry may be said to be that the production of butter in the Saorstát is round about one-and-a-half million cwts. in the year, of which considerably less than half is creamery butter, and that the consumption of butter within the Saorstát is only about one million cwts., taking the whole year into account, leaving half-a-million cwts. for export.  It is claimed &mdash; probably rightly claimed now, though it was not so a few years ago&mdash;that the quality of Irish creamery butter is as good as that of Danish butter, on the whole.  Perhaps I may be a little more precise and say that good quality Irish creamery butter is as good as good quality Danish creamery butter.  But it happens that the Danish industry has organised itself in such a way that its exports to England and its production at home are fairly well evened out throughout the year.  Consequently, in their export trade to the British market, they are able to maintain connections right through the year, and, by the goodwill secured in that way, are able to maintain a regular price for the whole of their export supply.  On the other hand, it has been for many years a grievance and a complaint in respect of the Irish butter supply to the English market, that the Irish creameries are bound by the circumstances to make new connections every Spring. They have large surpluses in the Summer months.  They cease to sell in <Col N="396" /> the early Spring&mdash;during the first two or three months of the year&mdash;and then they have to make new connections in May or June.  Consequently, there is a handicap on Saorstát butter right through the year in the English market.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners, in their report, have taken a certain line in relation to winter dairying.  They emphasise the importance of winter dairying in the country, and they have acceded to the claim of the applicants and recommended that a flat rate of 4d. per lb. import duty should be placed upon butter in the hope&mdash;not a very confident hope, I may remark&mdash;that the farmers who are butter producers will be induced to turn their attention to winter dairying.  The applicants, in making their case, by no means emphasised that the winter dairying aspect was the important one in their minds. They sought this tariff of 4d. per lb. with the intention of holding over to a much greater degree than they had ever done before the supply of summer butter for the winter months so that they could steady their marketing operations and even out the supply of summer-produced butter.  I do not think it has been contended that summer-produced butter sold in the winter months, after being cold stored, will be equal, in command of the market, with freshly-produced butter.  I do not know whether that is contended or not, but, at any rate, I presume that the contention is that the holding over of summer-produced butter in the Saorstát and the selling of more equal quantities of that butter throughout the year will enable a higher price to be maintained in the English market by virtue of the fact that the creameries will be able to maintain a steady supply throughout the year to their customers.  The Commissioners, as has been pointed out, have refused to give very much credence to the claim of the applicants in regard to this holding over and storing of summer supplies. They say that if what was required was a tariff sufficient to enable the farmers to get a price which would cover the cost of storage, insurance, interest, etc., a much less sum than 4d. per lb. would be ample, and they mention the figure of 1½d per lb.  The Commissioners <Col N="397" /> refused to give much weight to that portion of the application which was, in fact, the main purpose of the applicants.  Nevertheless, the Commission seem to have overlooked certain facts which are essential to the consideration of this question.  The Commission, reviewing the possible benefits to be derived from an extension of winter dairying, weighing the advantages against the disadvantages, the national profit against the national loss, came to a conclusion in favour of a tariff, and they assumed, without shewing much confidence, that the 4d. per lb. will suffice to encourage winter dairying.  I think it would have been well had there been some evidence put forward to the Ministry and to the House as to the prospects of the tariff inducing farmers to enter into winter dairying extension. It has been doubted whether, even with an enhanced price of 4d. per lb. over the normal summer price, farmers will go in for winter dairying. That question I will come to later.  I want to emphasise the point which has been emphasise by the Commission and by every expert on this subject for years past, that the great thing to be desired is that there should be an evening out of supplies to Great Britain, so that the market connections may be maintained and retained right through the year.  If that could be accomplished, there would be a much smaller difference between Danish prices and Irish prices.  How is that going to be attained by the imposition of this tariff?  We have the holding over, at present, of a considerable proportion of the summer supply. That is done, the farmers and merchants taking the risk, the risk being that in recent years the tendency towards the closing up of the gap between summer prices and winter prices has been accelerated.</P>
    <P>If a tariff is imposed, and an increase of 4d. per lb. is assured in the home price of butter during the months January to May, who is to regulate which creamery or creameries shall hold over supplies?  That point is made, incidentally, in the course of the Commission's Report, but very little notice is taken of a very important fact which did not, and ought not, to <Col N="398" /> have come under the supervision or jurisdiction of this Commission, but which is extremely vital to any consideration of the subject&mdash;that is, the movement for regulated marketing and the refusal on the part of a very large proportion of the creameries and the farmers controlling creameries to have anything to do with compulsorily-regulated marketing.  It seems to me that if you are not going to have a controlling authority which will decide the proportion of each month's production that may be exported to Great Britain, you will have creamery vieing with creamery as to the amount that ought to be exported and the amount that ought to be retained for the home trade.  Each will hope that instead of making sales on summer prices they will get 4d. per lb. more for their supplies in winter, and they will take the risk that theirs will be the creamery which will get this 4d. per lb. additional. There is the prospect, in the absence of regulated marketing, of complete chaos in the trade and a possibility&mdash;this is also pointed out in the Report&mdash;that the last state may be worse than the first.  We have, therefore, to ask ourselves whether this desideratum of winter dairying or even improved summer prices is going to be assured by the mere imposition of a tariff unless that is accompanied by regulated marketing and a controlling authority to determine what supplies shall go to Great Britain and what supplies shall be retained for home use.  I should assume that once a tariff is established, even those creameries and creamery managers &mdash; perhaps one should emphasise &ldquo;creamery managers&rdquo; in this regard&mdash;who have been adverse to regulated marketing will be induced by the circumstances of the time to agree to some scheme of controlled marketing; otherwise they will get no advantage in the winter out of the tariff on imported butter.  That leads us then to the question whether the flat tariff rate of 4d. per lb. on butter in normal years is going to have any effect on the summer price at home.  The Commission restated an argument which the Minister for Agriculture is very fond of adducing, that in the case of a commodity of which there is an exportable surplus, a tariff is useless as a means of enhancing the <Col N="399" /> home price.  The Commission, therefore, say that for the eight months of the year during which there is an exportable surplus there will be no advance in the price of butter to the home consumer.  Therefore, in regard to home production, the farmer will during that period get no benefit out of the 4d. per lb. tariff.  If that is the case, one wonders what was contained in the evidence of the applicants supporting the application for this tariff. Did they understand that there was to be no enhanced price within this country for the summer sales?</P>
    <P>We are assured in the Report that little, if any, difference can take place&mdash;in another section, I think, we are assured that there can be no difference&mdash;in the summer price of butter to Irish consumers because of the fact that there is a large exportable surplus.  That is not a valid statement unless the exportable surplus is available for the market&mdash;unless it is offered to the public, as consumers.  If there is competition to sell that exportable surplus, no doubt the doctrine is valid and sound, but in the absence of that free competition for sale, so far as the price goes, it is just the same as if there were no exportable surplus at all.  That is to say, the surplus is not in the market and, therefore, does not affect the market.  I take it that that must have been in the minds of the applicants for this tariff.  That brings us back to the probability that when this control is established&mdash;it will inevitably be established if there is any advantage to be got out of the stored butter &mdash;it will almost automatically, and as of course, take steps to assure to the Irish producer some advantage from the tariff in respect of the summer trade.  It will seek to get an advantage for the summer season as well as for the winter season for the producer.  I am not criticising that as an objective, but I want to know whether the Commission and whether the Government, in accepting the Report and advice of the Commission, took into account the fact that there was going to be a charge upon the whole body of consumers of butter of something less than 4d. per lb in <Col N="400" /> the summer and 4d. per lb. in the winter.  The Commission say in their Report that they only take into account the fact that there will be an added price to the consumer for the four winter months.  I assert that there will be an added price for the whole of the year&mdash;perhaps not the whole 4d. per lb for the summer months, but whatever the ultimate future controlling authority&mdash;which must I think inevitably come if the industry is to be saved&mdash;may determine as desirable for the butter-producing community.</P>
    <P>There then arises the question of how this tariff is going to affect other industries or other portions of the agricultural industry.  I have no great knowledge of this particular aspect of the question, but I would put it to those who are interested in the various aspects of agricultural operations&mdash;the cattle industry and others&mdash; whether any reaction is likely upon the livestock trade, supposing the aim were accomplished in Ireland as in Denmark, and the production of butter were evened out throughout the year instead of being concentrated in the summer months.  It would seem to me that if instead of 50 per cent. of the calves being born in June, July and August, only the due monthly proportion were born in these months, it must have an effect on the spring livestock trade in the following year, and, probably, would have a very considerable effect upon the whole economy&mdash;whether for good or ill, I am not certain.  When one takes into consideration the Danish position, one ought to remember that the practice there in respect to calves is to kill them as veal and not to rear them for stores.</P>
    <P>I think that is a matter of considerable moment and it ought to be considered in weighing up the pros and cons in this case.  That is not done in this Report.  I think it is important for farmers as well as the rest of the community&mdash;perhaps most important of all, the public health side of the community&mdash;to take into account one of the probable results of enhancing the price in the winter months by fourpence per pound.  It will be remembered <Col N="401" /> that when levying a tariff on imported margarine there was an assurance given by the margarine industry that prices in this country, so far as the tariff could affect them, would not be higher than the prices of similar quality margarine in Great Britain, where there was no tariff. That is being maintained and, I have no doubt, will continue to be maintained, but it will mean that the gap between the price of margarine and butter will be further enlarged to the disadvantage of butter and to the encouragement of the consumption of margarine by the poorer sections of the community.  One of the things this country may take pride in is that the consumption of butter has been much higher than in other countries, and the fancy for margarine has not taken hold of the public taste to the same extent as it has in other countries.  I think one of the debit items to be placed against so many credit items in Denmark is that the section of the population producing the best butter in large quantities is addicted to the use of margarine.  I think it is a matter to be taken into account that there will be a tendency in the town population and the poorer country population against the use of butter if you encourage, by this wide margin in the winter months, a handicap in favour of margarine.  From the public health point of view it is important that the poor people, who have very little but bread and butter to eat, should not be discouraged from consuming butter in favour of margarine.</P>
    <P>A curious calculation is made in this Report regarding the effect upon the cost of living.  We are given certain figures, which are no doubt quite accurate, regarding the percentage effect upon the household budget and the percentage effect upon the net cost of living index figure.  We are then told by the Commission that the cost of living will be increased by .5 per cent. over the year.  It makes very little difference to the average workman or his wife&mdash;more particularly his wife&mdash; when buying butter in January, February or March, what effect an enhanced price on any item would be upon what one would pay in June or July.  If we are to take this matter seriously at all <Col N="402" /> we have to think not of what the effect upon the annual cost of living for a man who gets a daily or a weekly wage would be, but rather what would be the effect upon the cost of living in those months during which a person would be required to pay this enhanced price.</P>
    <P>It is important, too, to note that the proportion of creamery butter which is exported is very much higher than the proportion of farmers' butter exported, and that the consumption of farmers' butter in the Free State is in the proportion of two to one in relation to creamery butter.  It is important to note that the application of the recommendation will have effect mainly in respect of the creamery side of the industry; it is the creamery side of the industry that will be getting the greater portion of the benefit.  The Commission tell us that this portion of the industry is mainly run and controlled by the thirty to one hundred acre farmer.  I mention that because I want to say that any criticism one may make of this proposal in its present form is not a criticism in the interests of the town consumer only.  The agriculturist consumer who is not interested in the selling of butter in the English market in the winter time is a purchaser of butter to a very large extent, and is also going to be affected detrimentally if he does not become a producer of butter.</P>
    <P>We are given certain figures regarding the practice in other countries, some of which have a surplus for export; that is to say, the amount of the tariff they impose upon imports.  It would have been of very great assistance to the proper understanding of this subject if we had been placed in possession of the effect upon retail prices in those countries of the tariff and if we had been given information as to how retail prices there compare, for instance, with export values.  I hope it will be possible before this matter is finally decided to have information of that kind made available. Perhaps the most important feature, so far as my criticism goes, is the recommendation that this tariff should be a flat fourpence per lb., having no regard whatever to the ruling prices. We are correctly told that the tendency <Col N="403" /> in recent years in regard to prices has been for the summer to move towards the winter or the winter to move towards the summer.  If we take the figures that are presented in Appendix 10, showing the prices of butter in the respective months of each of the years 1916 to 1930, we find that in only four years has the price in the winter fallen below 10/- per cwt. over the previous summer level. Taking the averages of the April to November prices in each year and comparing them with the averages of December, January, February and March, the differences in favour of the winter prices run like this:&mdash;44/-, 34/-, 41/-, 43/-, 6/-.  In 1921 the winter price was 20/- less than summer price; in 1922 the winter price was 22/- above the summer price; in 1923 it was 56/- above the summer price, and then you have other figures such as 27/-, 2/-, 18/-, 27/- and 4/-.  If we take only the last seven years it will be found that an average of 18/- per cwt. for the Irish creamery butter, free on rail, has prevailed in the winter months above the average for the summer months.</P>
    <P>My point is that it requires twopence per gallon, or an equivalent of fourpence per lb., which is the recommendation, to induce the farmers to go in for winter dairying.  Taking into account the 37/4 proposed to be levied as a tariff by which the home price is to be raised, if we have £1 a cwt. for a period of years on the winter over the summer price we would require only 17/4 additional to equalise the winter cost of production with the summer cost of production, on the figures given here.  If the price in the winter were 30/- above the summer level there would be only 7/4 required to equalise winter costs with summer costs.  If we are to impose a flat 37/4 per cwt. in favour of the winter producer, and if, in addition, there is an enhanced price in the winter of 15/-, 20/- or 30/- per cwt. over summer level, there is an inducement over and above what is necessary, according to the Report, for the farmers to increase their supplies of winter butter.  Probably it has been in the minds of the applicants that the tariff they desire is one which will raise the price in the summer as <Col N="404" /> well as in the winter.  Surely we ought to have some standard or some figure to go by as to what price would pay the agriculturist over a period of years to produce milk or butter.  It is only when we have got that standard that we can determine what is the rate of tariff, if any, that is required.  I contend that the imposition of a mere flat rate, whether you have a plentiful season or a bad season, whether world competition has been less fierce or more fierce, whether market prices are higher or lower, is not a scientific way to approach this subject, is not fair to all sections of the community, and is not going to assure us of the best return for State action.  We ought to make it clear in our minds, as presumably the Government has done when acting on the recommendation of the Commission, that the sole object of this tariff is to increase winter dairying. If that is so, then we ought to ask ourselves whether this is the method by which that object can be attained.</P>
    <P>From what I have said, I think it will be seen that it is a cumbrous and an unnecessarily costly method on the community.  One estimate, and I will give it for what it is worth, is that the cost of production of the quantity necessary for maintaining the level of exports would be less than half what is sought to be imposed upon the consuming community, even supposing that winter production were enhanced to such a degree as to supply the whole of the exports necessary to maintain the summer level.</P>
    <P>I suggest that to attain the object of encouraging and extending winter dairying it is cheaper for the community and equally good for the farmer, with a more sure result, that a direct subsidy should be given for every cwt. of winter-produced butter that is exported, or, if you like, for every cwt. of butter that is produced in the winter. That would tend to ensure that the object aimed at will be accomplished. To impose this tariff, with the very doubtful hope that the Commissioners state in their recommendation, is a blundering way of achieving this end.  I can understand the Commission's doubts.  I remember the Food Prices Tribunal's report.  Anybody may refer to it and find that consistently <Col N="405" /> for years there has been a difference, not of 2d. per gallon, but of 4d. and 6d. per gallon, for town supplies of milk in the winter as against the summer. One would think that if 2d. a gallon would induce farmers to produce winter milk to a greater degree than they have done, 4d. or 6d. a gallon, and a very big demand in the winter, would be more than sufficient to induce a much larger number to enter into that department of their business than has been the case.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal in this Report of very great interest.  There are very many matters about which we ought to have information before a final decision is taken upon this question. I do not know to what extent the non-creamery farmers have joined in making this application, or whether they have expressed any opinions upon the various portions of the application. The Report is very deficient in information or even comments upon that larger section of the butter trade known as the farmers' butter.  I think we ought to have further information presented to us on that point.  I am going to assume that evidence on those matters was given to the Commission, though it has not been reported in the document presented to us.  I am hoping that when we do have possession of the notes we shall find much more evidence of an informative character than is presented in the Report, full though that may be of both relevant and irrelevant material.  I think that is all I have to say upon this subject at the moment. I beg to move the motion which stands in my name.</P>

      <P>I may be wrong, but it seems to me that the passing of this motion, whether Senator Johnson means it that way or not, may imply a condemnation of the Tariff Commission and of the Government in adopting the recommendations of the Tariff Commission.  While with a considerable proportion of what Senator Johnson said I am in agreement, I would like to say a few words upon the matter and upon the condition of affairs as viewed by the Tariff Commission. The creamery butter of this <Col N="406" /> country has been marketed to a considerable extent by two organisations &mdash;one, the Irish Associated Creameries, which was set up by a consider able number of creameries; and the other a holding board set up under the Department of Agriculture, which has marketed the product of a very considerable section of creameries formerly known as the Irish Condensed Milk Co.  Those two organisations were endeavouring&mdash;and to my mind were very properly endeavouring&mdash;to secure as far as they possibly could a continuity of supply over the winter months, and for that purpose they had considerable quantities of butter in store which they marketed under their own mark.  They were endeavouring to put their butter into packages so as to preserve the identity of the product.  The reason for doing so was that an increasingly large quantity of butter marketed in England was really a blend of several butters&mdash; Siberian, New Zealand and Australia. Irish butter was blended also; and the butter, were it ever so good as a result of the efforts of the Department of Agriculture, never reached its proper place on the English market because its identity was lost in the blending.  Those two organisations were endeavouring to place their butter on the English markets in packets or cartons with a distinctive mark, so that people could ask for the same butter again if they were pleased with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The butter market in England has got in to the hands of very powerful distributors, well backed financially. These people by reason of the necessity for a continuity of supply, usually keep a very large stock of butter in cold storage.  It is kept in cold store partly on the safety first principle, but it is also a very useful reserve to have if they wish to bring the seller's price into conformity with their own ideas.  For instance, in the middle of the Irish season or at any particular period they can hold up the market for a fortnight or three weeks and work on their stocks and of course the creameries have to fall in with their idea as to price.  Last October advices from Australia forecasted that there would be increased <Col N="407" /> production of butter in Australia to the extent of 100 per cent. on the previous year.  From New Zealand also it was forecasted that butter production would be considerably in excess of the previous year's supplies. The big organisations in England, with possibly a million boxes of butter in cold storage, suddenly stopped buying.  The consequence was that while butter in July was 128/9d. per cwt., butter in November was 119/4d. per cwt.  The butter that was marketed in November was marketed very well and under very advantageous conditions, and if it had not been that favourable contracts had been entered into earlier the price would have been nothing like 119/4d. Australian butter was offered at 93/- in October, C.I.F. Glasgow or London. It was first grade Australian butter. When landing, discount and other charges were added the price came to about 98/- per cwt., or 10½ per lb. and that butter could be retailed at 1/-.  The Irish Associated Creameries, the holding board and other creameries or traders anxious to have a continuity of Irish supplies were faced with the task of having to pay the farmers and producers at the rate of from 93/- to 98/- per cwt. That price would have been absolutely ruinous for the farmers and in those circumstances I think the Government acted very properly in putting on a prohibitive impost in the first instance of £5 a cwt., and subsequently acting on the report of the Tariff Commission by placing a tariff of 4d. per lb. on butter.  This enabled the dairy farmers to secure the necessaries of life and it tended to meet the cost of production for the producer.  As a mere matter of interest I may mention that the average price in a trading concern with which I am connected was 167/3d. in 1929 and 126/8d. in 1930.  In connection with the point made by Senator Johnson, it would be well to remember that the dairy farmer in this country is to some degree penalised.  My point is that the dairy farmer now is allowed to use only bulls which are registered and I think in the approval and registration <Col N="408" /> of those bulls more regard is paid to beef than to milk production.</P>

      <P>I do not want to stress the point.  I think that, in the circumstances, the Government acted quite properly in adopting the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, but I can see that the tariff of 4d. per pound may defeat itself.  As one who has not theorised very much on this matter but who, over a considerable number of years, succeeded in making some sort of living from trading in Irish as well as in a great many other butters, I can tell Senator Johnson that whether there is a tariff of 4d. or 14d. per pound on butter during the summer months, while there is an exportable surplus the tariff will not affect the price of butter in this country.  I think that if the Senator were to do a little thinking on that, or were to consult some of the creamery managers in the country, he would find that any misgivings he may have on that point would very soon be dissipated.  It you want to secure that the farmer will in future get the cost of production during the winter months I think the tariff of 4d. a pound would become ineffective, and for this reason: that while there is an exportable surplus of butter a great many people will cover their winter supplies in store.  When prices are low and when it comes to the winter months they will try and use up their stores of butter, with the result that the 4d. per pound, as an advantage to the farmer, will be ineffective.</P>
      <P>I beg to move the following amendment to the motion proposed by Senator Johnson.  I am moving this amendment with the object of securing that the farmer will get the advantage of producing winter milk or winter butter. The amendment I move is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To delete all after the word &lsquo;Government&rsquo; in line 3, and to add &lsquo;and recommend that further consideration <Col N="409" /> be given to secure this object in the manner most advantageous to the dairy farmers and at least cost to the community&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What I mean by that amendment is this: That a subsidy be given to the farmer for every hundred gallons of milk he produces from the month of October to the end of February.  In other words, that the man who arranges that his cows will calve from October to the end of February will get a direct subsidy from public funds. If the idea behind that amendment is acted upon, then the farmer will get a direct, tangible benefit and will be enabled to see whether winter production pays him or not.  The acceptance of the amendment will not in any way cause the butter consumer in the country to be exploited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Walter Nugent</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment moved by Senator Dowdall. I listened very attentively to Senator Johnson's speech.  It seems to me that his motion may be divided into two parts.  With the first part we are all in agreement.  We are all anxious that any steps that can be taken should be taken to assist our dairy farmers to enable them to establish themselves in the market already taken possession of by Danish producers. Senator Johnson agrees with that.  It seems to me that Senator Johnson, while he is in favour of steps being taken to assist the dairy industry and to encourage winter dairying, does not want to have that done by means of a tariff on butter.  His suggestion was a subsidy.  The main difference between a subsidy and a tariff is this: If you encourage industry by a subsidy the entire amount of the subsidy will be paid by the taxpayers.  On the other hand, if you impose a tariff, then portion of that will be paid by the importer. When this matter first came on in the Dáil and a tariff of £5 per cwt. was imposed, the price of butter to the consumer was hardly increased at all&mdash;certainly not more than 1d. per lb.  In the case of a tariff, in all probability the cost of it will be divided, portion of it being paid by the importer and portion by the consumer, while if a subsidy is granted the entire amount of it will be paid by the taxpayers. <Col N="410" /> For that reason I favour a tariff as against a subsidy.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnson suggests that the enhanced price would be passed on to the consumer, but that did not happen before.  The same cry is raised every time a tariff is put on anything.  I do not hesitate to say that I am always in favour of giving help, whether by a tariff or otherwise, to any industry which is suited to the country and is capable of producing goods profitably. Experience in other countries shows that the cost of tariffs is not paid entirely by the consumer.  The producer may not benefit to the extent of the full amount of the tariff&mdash;what the revenue receives will benefit him indirectly. It is a fallacy to assume that if you put a tariff of 4d. a lb. on butter that it will mean an increase of 1½d. per lb. in the cost to the consumer. The whole question boils down to this: how are you going to assist the dairy farmer?  Is it to be done by means of a tariff or by means of a subsidy?  I am in favour of a tariff, although Senator Dowdall's amendment does not quite cover that point.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, we are not now asked to express a definite opinion on the question of a tariff.  I take it that Senator Johnson is just giving a preliminary talk on the matter. He is asking for more information to enable us, when the matter really comes before the House, to know something more about it than we do at present.  If that is the position then the resolution we pass to-day will not be of very great importance one way or the other.  Senator Johnson and Senator Dowdall seem to agree that this tariff is not going to do the thing it is wanted or supposed to do.  Senator Dowdall said he did not think the tariff that was going to be put on would meet the situation.  Senator Johnson seemed to come to the same conclusion, but along another line of reasoning.  Senator Sir Walter Nugent said that if winter dairying was to be encouraged then a tariff would be a cheaper method of doing that than a subsidy.  Senator Johnson and Senator Dowdall recommend a subsidy as the only way of meeting the difficulty.</P>

      <P>I did not hear the Senator prove how it would be effective. The opinions we have heard expressed to-day will help the House when we come to deal seriously with the question.  On the question of winter dairying, Senator Johnson talked about Denmark.  The position in New Zealand and Australia is altogether different from that in Denmark.  The reason, I believe, why Denmark is able to defeat us in producing winter butter is that they have huge establishments which were built and suitably arranged for the purpose at a time when building costs were low.  If we were to attempt to put up buildings of the same sort to house our cattle so that we could have winter production of milk and butter, I believe that such production would not pay because of what it would cost to put up the buildings at existing prices.  That is one reason why we cannot attempt to compete with Denmark.  The case of New Zealand and Australia is different. Their butter is produced by much the same method as it is here with us, the only difference being that when we have summer they have winter, and vice versa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the way to help winter dairying is to help those who are attempting to carry it on.  Therefore, in my opinion, a subsidy seems to be the only way to do that.  As regards a tax, I cannot see how it is going to accomplish the object for which it is going to be put on, and on that aspect of the question I agree with Senator Johnson and Senator Dowdall.  One can see the effect of a subsidy.  If a man knows that he is to get a certain amount of money for producing milk during a certain period of the year, then that <Col N="412" /> would be an inducement to him to go in for winter dairying and to produce the goods.  In the case of a subsidy it will be fairly easy to see what the results of it will be.  The amount given will be known as well as the results from it.  I take it that if the subsidy is not big enough the milk will not be produced.  I suppose that if it is too big we will see our farmers making fortunes which at present they are not doing.  A good deal of information has been given in the course of this debate which will be of help to us when the matter comes seriously before us at a later stage.  At present, I would not care to vote for a resolution condemning the action of the Government in putting on this extra duty.  I would not like to do that without having more evidence than we have at present. In fact, I would not care to vote for any resolution at the present time. I think, if the House were to do that, it would be prejudging the debate on this matter which no doubt will take place later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing very much has been said on the resolution before the House on which one could hang a reasoned statement.  I was somewhat disappointed with Senator Johnson's speech.  With the pious expression in the first part of the Senator's resolution, that in the national interests a wide extension of winter dairying is desirable, we all agree.  The Senator suggests that should be encouraged by positive action on the part of the Government.  I thought he would proceed to enlarge upon that part of the resolution and tell us how such a happy result was to be brought about, but he did not do so.  I was anxious to hear him on that, so that we could get down to something concrete.  The subject is a rather difficult one for anyone to tackle, and particularly those who have not had practical experience in the industry.  Senator Jameson spoke of Denmark, and said one of the reasons why Denmark was able to maintain uniform supplies on the English market, and in that respect was supreme to us, was because Denmark had huge establishments for the housing of cattle which enabled dairying to be carried on all the year round in that country. <Col N="413" /> I cannot see how that argument holds at all.  We, in this country, have as good cow-byres as they have in Denmark, while our creameries, which are an essential factor in butter production, are splendidly built and equipped. With regard to milk production in winter, it is not the buildings that matter so much as having the cows calve at the right time, in the fall of the year, and in being able to feed them properly with a nourishing ration.  These are the two things that really matter. It is because Denmark is foremost in these two matters that she is able to maintain uniform supplies throughout the year on the English market.</P>
      <P>As to the positive action that might be taken by the Government to stimulate winter production, Senator Dowdall spoke of a subsidy on every hundred gallons of milk produced during certain months of the year.  There are all the old arguments for and against a subsidy, which I am not going to repeat.  There are also the arguments in connection with tariffs&mdash; that the imposition of a tariff increases the cost of living, and so on.  There are people, of course, who argue that a subsidy should be given to encourage milk production in the winter; a number of other people argue in favour of the subsidy in respect of wheat-growing, barley-growing, and a lot of other things.  In my opinion the application of the principle of a subsidy to any particular line of the agricultural industry would be a very difficult matter to tackle.  Suppose, for instance, the principle of a subsidy was to be applied in the case we are discussing, how would it work out in practice?  Half the butter of the country is produced by farmers who do not send their milk to the creameries.  Take it that I am a farmer living in portion of the County Clare, and that I make all my own butter at home.  How is a check going to be kept on the quantity of milk I get from my cows to ascertain whether I am producing so many hundred gallons of milk more now than I did before the system was introduced?  What a team of inspectors you would need to have going round the country to make these checks!</P>

      <P>In answer to what Senator MacEllin has said, I may say that very strong inducements have been offered to the farmers of this country to join Cow Testing Associations. It seems a sound thing nation ally and economically to have such associations.  We all know that competitions are held and prizes offered not only at the local shows throughout the country, but at the national show at Ballsbridge with the object of encouraging farmers to join these associations. Despite all that has been done, we know that it is almost impossible to get farmers to join these associations. There are only seven or eight per cent of the farmers of the country in these associations, the object of which is to raise the standard of milk production in the country.  It would be impossible for these associations to keep the check that I speak of.  If the Government were to decide on a subsidy of the type Senator Dowdall spoke of, I would like to know how it is going to be applied.</P>

      <P>I think, when speaking to his amendment, he suggested that there should be a subsidy.  At the outset I thought that the amendment might not be accepted by the Chair, as it is practically an addendum to Senator Johnson's resolution.  As to the positive action that the Government should take, I waited in vain for Senator Johnson to outline what, in his opinion, should be done to bring about the happy results desired.  Senator Johnson referred to some points in the Report of the Tariff Commission with which I would like to deal.  He referred to the question of a co-ordinating market, and said he thought the Tariff Commission did not give due regard to that aspect of the case.  I would refer the Senator to pages 12 and 13 of the Report.  From the statements made there it is to be inferred that the Tariff Commission gave very <Col N="415" /> considerable thought to the question of co-ordinated marketing.  The Report states:</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the holding back of appropriate quantities of the summer surplus, whatever such quantities may be, implies some co-ordinating authority between all the producers which does not exist at present and which may not be established in the future.  In the absence of some central organisation to which all the producing creameries would adhere, it is difficult to see how the creameries, acting singly, will, in the aggregate, hold back just enough for winter home needs.</P>
      <P>It is to be inferred from that that the Commission gave due regard to the essential factor of establishing some co-ordinating machinery in this country whereby the creameries would combine for a specific purpose.  The members of the Tariff Commission further state in their Report:</P>
      <P>The case for a tariff made by the applicants carried no conviction to us as long as it was based mainly on the need for creating a protected winter market for some of the summer-produced butter which, it was stated, could not be marketed to advantage in summer, and it was difficult to see how this proposal was compatible with the second branch of their case, viz., the stimulation of winter dairying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There we have the admission of the Tariff Commission that, unless winter dairying was stimulated by a tariff, they would not feel inclined to recommend it.  What is the position with regard to winter dairying in the country?  The only thing that will bring an increase in winter dairying in Ireland is an increase in monetary values to the producer.  It all narrows down to a question of price. What is going to be the result of a tariff of 4d. a lb. on butter?  It takes about 2¼ gallons of milk to make a pound of butter.  Suppose that you have a tariff of 4d. per lb. and that this means an extra 1½d. per gallon for the producer is that going to encourage him to go in for winter production?  The price for milk <Col N="416" /> in summer&mdash;I am talking of the creameries&mdash;is anything from 4d. to 4½d per gallon.  In the best years it was 5½d., 6d. and 6½d. but take it that the producer is to get an extra 1½d. per gallon for his winter production, does anybody who knows anything about the subject think that he is going to do it for that?  There is no man keeping cows who for the sake of an extra 1½d. per gallon is going to be induced to produce a single gallon of milk more than he is producing at present.  Even 2d. or 3d. a gallon extra would not be a sufficient inducement to him.  There is one thing that such a tariff might do; it might help to conserve the cow population that we have in the country.  It may encourage a farmer to keep cows that he would otherwise sell off.  The tariff might prove an incentive to him to keep these cows in production.</P>
    <P>As regards producing an extension of winter milk-production in this country, I would not say that this tariff is ever going to bring about such a result.  Let us take it the other way.  What is going to be the result if this tariff of 4d. per lb. continues to be imposed?  There can be one result.  If one looks at the question fairly and examines the facts and figures as they are presented, he will see that those creameries and those business people who have a milk surplus in summer are going to hold the butter and offer it for sale at the higher price in winter.  What is going to stop them from doing that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy to hold it over.  There is available in this country accommodation to hold over 100,000 cwts.  The figures are given in the Report.  Does anybody assume that if any considerable monetary incentive is held out to these people, they are not going to hold over a certain proportion of the surplus produced in summer and make it available at the higher price in winter?  It costs 1½d. a lb. to hold over butter.  That covers interest on capital, insurance and storage.  The incentive to hold over is 4d. per lb.  Further than that, there <Col N="417" /> is the incentive which is provided by analysis of the price-figures available over a number of years.  On Senator Johnson's analysis, the price of butter in winter was 18/- per cwt. higher than in the summer months.  To the business man or the creamery proprietors, or any combination of creameries who want to hold over their butter from summer, there are these incentives.  If the accommodation is there, and if there are these incentives, then the business men of this country&mdash;as the business men of any other country would do&mdash;are very likely to take advantage of them.  If there are all these incentives&mdash;the incentive of 4d. per lb. extra at an extra cost of 1½d. per lb., the increased price usually obtainable in winter as compared with the price obtainable in summer&mdash;is it not logical to assume that there is going to be no really big extension of winter dairying on the part of the farmer?  The opportunity is going to be seized by people to hold over butter in summer, when there is a surplus available, and to sell it in winter, when it is scarce, at a better price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question bristles with difficulties.  I should like to analyse certain other statements which have been made if there were time.  Senator Dowdall said that if there is an exportable surplus in summer no tariff would have any effect on the price of butter. I refer him to the instance of Australia. The very position which he says could not exist does exist in Australia. There is an exportable surplus there.  That surplus goes abroad, but there is a tariff against butter coming into the country.  By reason of that tariff, there is a higher price for butter sold in Australia than there would otherwise be.  There, you have a combination of all the butter manufacturers and producers in Australia, and, through their ring, they keep up the price.  If you brought into existence in this country what it is hoped will be brought into being, but which will proceed along other lines&mdash;if you had a great central organisation to which all the butter producers and creameries would adhere, and if there were a tariff imposed, then, by forming a ring, what Senator Dowdall says could not happen <Col N="418" /> might happen.  They might very easily force up the price.  I am afraid that we are reasoning the problem out rather loosely.  In the consideration of the question there are a number of matters which require to be analysed. There are a number of points to which I would like to refer, but I did not know on what lines Senator Johnson was going to proceed, and I did not catch with exactness many of his points.</P>
    <P>I think the House would be unwise to vote upon such an amendment as Senator Dowdall has submitted with regard to a subsidy without arguing the matter further.  We should see where we are going and what principle is being introduced.  Senator Dowdall suggested as the basis of his amendment, though it is not included in it, a subsidy of so much per gallon on milk.  I should like to have other methods placed before the House and discussed before we voted in favour of that.  Senator Johnson speaks of &ldquo;positive action on the part of the Government,&rdquo; and I should like to know what sort of positive action he himself advocates before we vote blindly on this motion.  It must be said for this tariff that, without doubt, it offers some relief to a very depressed section of the agricultural population. There is that much to be said for it. Whether the farmers are really gaining very much in the ultimate is a question which might be argued and on which there might be a lot to say. Through acquiescence in this policy of tariffs, the farmers are conceding a lot and gaining mighty little, but that is another question.  This tariff is practically experimental.  Even on the Report of the Tariff Commission the tariff is based, not so much on concrete facts and figures presented to that body, as on the hope that as a result of its operation there will be an extension of winter dairying.  Time will be necessary to show whether or not that hope will be realised.  The tariff is, in a great degree, experimental, and we have got simply to wait and see.  I do not think the House should come to any hasty conclusion on this question, and I think it would be well advised to wait a little further and see results.</P>

      <P>There is one very puzzling statement in the Report of the Tariff Commission on this subject.  It condemns the application for a tariff on the ground of &ldquo;holding over,&rdquo; and it grants the application for the reason that it will lead to an extension of winter dairying.  Those two actions are not mutually exclusive.  It might be like the case of the temperance advocate who condemns drink on the grounds of drink, but recommends it on the grounds of medicine.  He allows you to get drink nevertheless.  If the tariff goes on, it will be used for holding over&mdash;the purpose for which it was condemned; it will not be used for the purpose for which it was recommended &mdash;winter dairying.  It is obvious that it will not be used for winter dairying. Threepence is the amount of benefit that has been mentioned in this connection. To make winter dairying a paying proposition, you would want 6d., if costings count for anything.  I should like to know what winter dairying costs.  I understand that the Minister is working in his Department on the question of costs and expenses, and these particulars should be before us before we come to a conclusion on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I do not like in these matters is running to the Government for assistance on every occasion.  Why should we not leave those matters to be settled by ordinary economic forces?  You never know what is going to happen when you begin to interfere with trade.  Senator Dowdall suggested the possibility of subsidising milk production.  If there is going to be a subsidy for milk production there will be at once an outcry by milk consumers for regulation of the price of milk in cities and towns.  At once, you release a whole series of unseen forces, and you also set up a large number of Government inspectors.  The happy state of this country at the present time&mdash;though it is not as happy as one would like&mdash;is, to a large extent, due to the fact that the people are left alone.  The farmers are left alone. We know that they are suffering.  They would be suffering far more, and any recovery would be far slower if the State began interfering right and left with everything they do.  I know that <Col N="420" /> you cannot stand on these doctrines in their absolute purity.  I know that a great deal of good work is being done by regulating the quality of the produce of the farmer.  But that is a totally different matter from stepping in and regulating prices.  We can turn our minds to other countries which are suffering to-day.  In many cases you can trace their condition to-day to an attempt to become prosperous by fiscal artifice.  I think that is what has happened in Australia.  We will get the very same result unless we are careful. Let things alone.  The people know the worst as they are.  Otherwise they will be living in foolish hopes.  In matters of this kind, you will be throwing dust in the eyes of the farmers.  For that reason, I hope the House will, while looking on this as a pious aspiration, leave it to the operation of natural forces and not seek to attain the end by fiscal artifice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this tariff was to meet the depression and the fall in prices.  That has been explained. The question is being debated whether, with this 4d. per lb. on butter, you will have winter dairying.  If it all depended on the 4d. you would have no winter dairying. That increase would not bring about the production of milk in winter.  What is forgotten, and has been forgotten by every speaker so far, is that if we are to have a continuous supply of butter through the winter, there is 30/- per cwt. to bring us up to the Danish price.  You will have 30/- of a rise in your price, plus the 4d. per lb. which ought to be sufficient to bring about winter dairying. Therefore, the tariff has been applied as an experiment and ought to be allowed to pursue its course until we see what eventuates.  There is the possibility of the tillage farmers in the midlands producing milk.  The creameries have got into the midlands. To the tillage farmer, the production of milk in winter is not such a great expense at all.  He is not circumstanced like the Limerick man.  He has the food there and he can calve his cows in the fall of the year.  If he gets 4d. per lb. and if he is able to bring up his price anywhere near <Col N="421" /> the Danish standard, he is going to get 6d. a gallon, and that ought to pay him and pay him handsomely.  I think we ought to agree that the Government has acted properly in carrying out the recommendations of this Commission.  I am not prepared to vote for the motion and I am not prepared to vote for the amendment. I prefer to let things proceed as they are and to see what the results will be.

If we vote one way or other, it implies criticism of the Government for not doing enough about winter dairying&mdash;a subject on which it would be exceedingly unlikely that this House could give them any advice of a definite, positive character with which most people would agree.  Under those circumstances, I think it would be in the general interest and in accordance with the wishes of a number of members like myself, if the mover of the resolution, seeing how difficult the question is&mdash;he probably realises now that it is a more difficult question than he thought when he tabled the motion&mdash;would withdraw the motion.</P>

      <P>I did not put this motion down with the object of getting Senators to determine one way or another how they stood in respect to this issue.  I contemplated discussion of the question, and I hoped that the Minister would be able to throw some <Col N="422" /> light on the general problem, but I did not, in fact, expect that the House would divide upon the motion.  The criticism of the resolution seems to be based upon the assumption that anything that comes from me in this matter must inevitably be directed against the Government.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand some of the criticism except on that assumption.  Except for Senator Wilson, all the speakers have agreed that the evidence presented to the House in the Tariff Commission's Report does not lead to the conclusion which the Tariff Commission arrived at.  I have assumed that the Tariff Commission, plus the Government, were intelligent men who were guided by evidence and that there was evidence available.  That evidence ought to be placed before the Oireachtas, before we are asked to come to a final decision.  I frankly hope that there will be more convincing evidence in favour of this conclusion than appears in the Report.  Senator O'Hanlon, who speaks with expert knowledge upon this question, and who is possessed of an ordered mind and trained intelligence, practically said &ldquo;ditto&rdquo; to every point I should have liked to make and which I thought I had made to establish the contention that the evidence does not lead to the conclusion that was come to.  The evidence contradicts the conclusion arrived at and holds out only the most attenuated hope that the 4d. per lb. tariff will lead to an extension of winter dairying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Wilson raised a point which is made in the Tariff Commission's Report, that there are some tillage districts which have been induced to enter upon winter dairying.  They say that tillage crops, which they have been accustomed to sell, have failed them, and that they have turned their attention to winter dairying.  They were hopeful of dairying generally assisting them to prosperity, and then there came suddenly the slump of last year.  Consequently, this recommendation is almost wholly directed to encouraging the present tillage farmer to continue in tillage, and Senator <Col N="423" /> Wilson confirms that deduction.  One may put this point: if any sum from £500,000 to £1,000,000 had been devoted to assisting these farmers in their other crops, would it not have saved their prosperity?  That is by the way.</P>
    <P>The statement of Senator O'Hanlon confirms my opinion, drawn in the main from the Tariff Commission's Report. I do not pose as an expert in this matter.  I was looking to the Report to confirm the Commission's conclusion. I read the evidence and it leads to a different conclusion.  I must insist that we have a right to believe that there is other evidence, presented by the farmers in support of the application, that ought to be made available to help us to support the Government in its action.  We cannot do that on the evidence already presented.  I have been asked by Senator O'Hanlon what is the positive step that might be taken by the Government.  That is a matter that I am not able to speak with confidence upon in the absence of the evidence that I am seeking.  I do suggest that if there is to be a direct inducement to farmers to extend their activities to winter dairying, it should be done by the subsidising of exports of winter-made butter, the point of the whole problem being that to raise the price of Irish butter in the English market to the Danish level you require to maintain a supply all the year round of freshly-made butter.  To make that butter in the winter for home consumption is not going any distance whatever in the direction of assisting Irish butter in the English market.  Whatever freshly-made butter is produced in Ireland in the winter must be exported to England if it is to have the effect that is hoped for by the Tariff Commission&mdash;the raising of the price of Irish butter in the English market. Until you have got a supply of freshly-made butter in winter and the export of that Irish made butter to England, you have not got anywhere towards achieving the object sought in this application and set out in the Commission's Report.  It is not going to achieve that to say that we are going to extend winter dairying and by that winter production meet the demand <Col N="424" /> which is at present supplied by imported winter butter for home consumption. It may be beneficial to the farmer to produce that particular winter butter, but it is not achieving the big object that is sought, as Senator Wilson pointed out&mdash;the raising of the level of Irish butter in price on the English market to the Danish figure for the whole year round.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, another positive course of action, and I venture to say that it will be in this direction that success will be achieved.  I touched upon the very important question of marketing control.  I believe that if the tariff is continued control will be found to be inevitable, and that it will be compulsory control.  It will be a control which will regulate the marketing of Irish butter in England, and the farmers who are at present objecting to that compulsory power will be very glad to avail of it before many months are over.  I think that that control will also have the effect that Senator O'Hanlon indicated of regulating somewhat the prices in the summer months in the Irish market.  If we are asked what kind of positive action the Government might take, the answer would be to impose such a control or such an authority, with provision for protection of consumers on the Irish side, so that this control would not seek to exact an undue price from the Irish consumer.</P>
    <P>I am glad that we have had a discussion on this question, and that we have had information from those who are intimately associated with the production and sale of this commodity and know the market well.  I should have liked to have heard the Minister's views upon the subject.  No doubt we shall have an opportunity of learning his views either in this House or from reading the debates in the other House.  I am inclined to think that he is of the same opinion that I and most of those who have spoken are&mdash;that the conclusion of the Tariff Commission is not warranted by the evidence as published. With these remarks, I ask the permission of the House to withdraw the motion.</P>
    <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
