    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill I drew attention to the words &ldquo;upon the request of the Minister&rdquo; which occur in sub-section (3) of this section.  The sub-section provides that all moneys, stocks, shares and securities transferred to the Minister at the commencement of this Act which are standing in the books of the Bank of Ireland or of any other corporation or company in the name of the Department shall, &ldquo;upon the request of the Minister,&rdquo; be transferred into the name of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The other sub-sections provide that automatically anything that stands in the name of the Department is transferred to the name of the Minister. The Minister for Industry and Commerce was in charge of the Bill when I raised this question on the Second Reading, and said that the wording of this sub-section was in accordance with some provisions of the Companies Acts. I have not attempted to find out what that provision is, but it occurs to me that in enacting legislation of this kind we need not put in the words &ldquo;at the request of the Minister&rdquo; if we want the transfer to take place automatically. It seems to me, in the absence of any explanation, that there is no necessity to insert the words &ldquo;at the request of the Minister.&rdquo;  If the Minister failed to make the request, then it would appear that these stocks, shares and other securities would remain in the name of the Department, which, of course, would be foolish, because after the passing of the Act there will be no Department.  I am raising the question to find out why the request of the Minister should be required in this particular class of transaction when all other matters are automatically transferred by the passing of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a functionary known as the Registrar of Public Companies. It is his duty to transfer shares.  He does that after somebody has moved, and not on his own initiative. There is, for instance, an agreement between people and shares are transferred.  Shares are also transferred under Acts of Parliament.  If it were the responsibility of the Registrar to transfer shares on his own, his task would be practically impossible.  He would have to keep in touch with all agreements filed and all legislation passed.  This sub-section is provided as a matter of convenience.  The Registrar of Companies does not transfer shares until a request is made to him by somebody.  That absolves him from the duty of keeping in touch with all the regulations passed and agreements <Col N="553" /> filed.  If he could transfer shares on his own without anybody making a request to him to do so his duty would be a rather onerous one. Where a transfer of shares is to take place either under an agreement or an Act of Parliament, it is felt that it is perfectly safe to put the onus on the person who is going to benefit to draw the attention of the Registrar of Companies to the fact that the transfer is necessary.  He never acts until his attention is drawn to the matter.  For that reason, it is provided here that the Minister shall draw the attention of the Registrar when a transfer of shares is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>There may not be very much in this, but it seems rather curious that all these arguments do not apply to the transfer of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Land is transferred automatically by Act of Parliament. The land coming within it is mine as Minister.  The position is different with regard to stocks and shares. In addition to the passing of the Act of Parliament it is necessary that some one should move before the transfer of stocks and shares in books can be effected.  That saves the Registrar from the very serious duty that otherwise would devolve on him: of keeping in touch with all the legislation passed and agreements come to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>If, automatically, the Department becomes the Minister, surely then in any future legal action of any kind the Minister is the Department, and the shares belong to the Minister?</P>

      <P>I move amendment 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11, sub-section (4).  To delete <Col N="554" /> all after the word &ldquo;Minister,&rdquo; in line 2, down to the end of the sub-section.</P>
    <P>I consider it would be quite sufficient for the council to meet whenever it is called upon to do so by the Minister. Any further meetings could only lead to expense.  In any event it would have nothing to do except to deal with matters that might be referred to it. I take it that whenever the Minister requires to get its advice he will take steps to call the council together.  I think the sub-section as worded might only lead to expense, and I move the deletion of the words indicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of the amendment is that the council should not meet unless it is called together by the Minister, that the members should not have the option of meeting on their own volition.  Possibly the Senator's experience of me has led him to believe that all Ministers are perfect.  The fact is that they are not.  My own view, while I do not care what the Seanad does with the amendment, is that there may be other Ministers more sensitive to public criticism than I am, and consequently may be a little bit chary of calling the council together.  My own personal view is that the members of the council should have the right of coming together if they wish to do so. I think that a council like this, a council of technicians, should have the right of coming together to express their views if they wish to do so.</P>

    <P>(1)  Every council of a county shall in every local financial year (including the local financial year commencing on the 1st day of April, 1931) raise equally over the whole of their county (excluding any urban districts comprised therein) by means of the poor rate a sum equal to not less than a rate of two pence in the pound on the rateable value of such county at the beginning of such year, and may, if they so think fit, in any local financial year (including the <Col N="555" /> local financial year commencing on the 1st day of April, 1931) raise by the same means and in the same manner an additional sum equal to not more than a rate of one penny in the pound on the rateable value of such county at the beginning of such year, and all sums raised by virtue of this sub-section are in this Act referred to as the agricultural rate.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where the Minister has made a forestry scheme order in respect of a county, the council of such county shall in every local financial year after the date of such order if so required by the Minister during the preceding local financial year, but not otherwise, raise equally over the whole of their county (excluding any urban districts comprised therein) by means of the poor rate a sum (in this Act referred to as the forestry rate) equal to not more than a rate of one halfpenny in the pound on the rateable value of such county at the beginning of such year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 3:</P>
      <P>Section 36, sub-section (1).  To delete the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in line 54 and to substitute therefore the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is really the most important amendment which I have down in connection with the Bill.  Hitherto, the striking of the rate by the county councils was optional and so was the contribution from the Department of Agriculture.  This Bill, while leaving the contribution of the Department optional, compels the county councils to strike a rate of 2d. in the £. From time to time we see here different sums being placed on the ratepayers. Under the Vocational Education Bill there is a rate up to 6d. in the £, I think, imposed, and under this Bill there is a further 2d. in the £ to be struck.  That is made mandatory on the county councils.  I am aware that, heretofore, the councils have themselves struck a certain portion of this rate and that useful schemes have been carried out on that rate for the development of agriculture.  That condition of affairs, I think, might be allowed to remain.  I think that the Minister <Col N="556" /> and the Department might trust the county councils and might appreciate that they would never turn down a useful scheme but would be as ready to supply the necessary funds in the future as they were in the past.  The manner in which the rates are increasing is very serious.  No Bill is being introduced to reduce the rates or to wipe them out.  Every Bill is putting an additional burden on the unfortunate ratepayer, and the word &ldquo;ratepayer&rdquo; is, of course, another name for the farmer.  I really believe that the Government are not fully aware of the position of the agricultural community. If they were, the placing of an extra rate upon them would be the last thing that they would think of.  As the previous scheme of voluntary co-operation between the county councils and the Department has gone on so successfully, I think it is a great mistake to make a change now and to apply coercion to the county councils in respect to this rate.  The Bill will be quite as valuable and as workable if the striking of the rate is left optional with the county councils, as was the case in the past.  I move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this amendment whole-heartedly, because it involves the element of permission instead of legislative imposition. I admit that all, with the exception of, I think, three county councils, have up to the present imposed a 2d. in the £ rate, but that does not affect the principle.  If they have done that voluntarily, why not leave well alone? I suppose the Minister thinks that these three recalcitrant councils are not alive to their duty and should be forced to an understanding of it.  There, I say, the Government attitude is wrong.  These people should be allowed to do what they like.  There is no question here of public health or anything like that.  The members of these councils are the elected representatives of their areas, and if they do not want to strike this rate why interfere with them?  This amendment bears on the motion which I have on the paper and about which I shall speak at some length some other time. If we admit this principle, where will <Col N="557" /> it lead us?  A certain number of councils&mdash;say half&mdash;may in the future strike a 2½d. rate and we may have legislation brought in to compel the remaining councils to strike that rate.  We are getting back to a principle of the American Constitution&mdash;that when a certain number of States accept a particular principle the others are roped in automatically.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that there is no analogy whatever between rates and taxes.  Taxes are payable out of profits.  They can be avoided by the person affected.  If he does not possess the requisite income, he is not subject to income tax.  If he does not drink or use tobacco, he escapes other taxes. In the case of rates, the person concerned has got to pay whether he is making profit or not.  The option, whether or not a particular rate should be struck, should, therefore, be left in his hands.  He should be allowed to exercise his discretion freely, because the principle of compulsion in this matter is wrong and should be resisted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Sir John Keane.  In regard to practically every Bill brought forward by Ministers here, it is a case of &ldquo;must, must, must.&rdquo;  The county councils and the local bodies have no power to do anything.  They must appoint certain officials and carry out the Minister's will in practically everything.  That is not alone the case in respect of the particular Minister present to-day, but it is the case in respect of practically every other Minister.  There is one matter which the Minister might explain on the present Bill.  The Bill says that the Minister may draw up a scheme.  Is he free to draw up any scheme he likes?  Must that scheme be laid before the House?  Are the county councils bound to strike rates for any scheme the Minister chooses to bring forward, or is he bound by any Act as to the manner in which the scheme is to be drawn or the purposes for which it is to be drawn? I support the amendment because I do not think that the bureaucrats here should be given power to do as they like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, at this hour of <Col N="558" /> the day, the Senator should know that the schemes are prepared by the county committees, and that the Minister has only sanctioning powers.  The initiative is with the committees of agriculture.  There is one point on which the Seanad should be clear at the beginning.  There was a certain fund available for this work up to about two years ago.  It represented the proceeds of the rate struck by the county councils and the contribution of the Department of Agriculture. There was a certain fund built up as the result of savings each year&mdash;that was ten or twelve years ago&mdash;and that fund has been used in recent years to supplement the finances of the county committees&mdash;in other words, to supplement the amount found by the Department of Agriculture and the amount found by the ratepayers.  That fund is almost exhausted.  The schemes that are at present in operation were prepared when you had a rate of 1¾d., when you had taxation that brought in about twice that amount, and when you had this fund which is now almost exhausted.  These schemes were paid for out of a joint fund&mdash;rates, taxes, and the residue I have referred to. Unless you have a slight increase of rates or taxes existing schemes cannot be kept up.  There is no doubt that the existing schemes are sound.  They were prepared by farmers. and, as a rule, by fairly sensible farmers, who were pretty close to the ground and knew their business.  Nobody in the country&mdash;no matter how foolish&mdash;can attack any of our principal schemes. They are all sound.  If they are to be maintained, not to say increased, there must be a slight increase in rates or taxes.  We propose that there should be a slight increase in rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Linehan suggested that there was no proposal that taxes should be maintained.  Of course, with the contribution from taxes, the present schemes could not be kept up unless there was a slight increase in rates. What are the contributions from taxes? The State spends £600,000 every year on the Department of Agriculture alone.  The county committees spend £125,412 on their schemes&mdash;schemes <Col N="559" /> initiated by themselves, over which we have no more than sanctioning powers. Of that £125,412, we find £79,000, and they find the balance, £47,000, out of rates.  There is no likelihood whatever that our contribution will decrease.  It has been increasing every year, and will increase further.</P>
    <P>Senator Keane said that there should be freedom to do as one likes.  I am not going into that question at this hour of the day.  The people have come to realise that these questions are no longer academic and can no longer be discussed in an academic way. Criticism is pretty free in this country. The people&mdash;especially the local bodies &mdash;feel quite free to express their opinions on schemes which are initiated in Dublin.  There is no reason why they should not do so.  As a rule they do not mince their words or hide their feelings.  We took the precaution of seeking the views of every country council in Ireland on this scheme before bringing it before the Dáil or Seanad.  On the 31st January we wrote a letter to every county council in Ireland telling them what we were going to do.  We did not receive a single protest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you ask them for their opinion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We wrote them telling them what we were going to do, and we took it for granted that if they had any objection to the proposal somebody on the county council would say a word openly about it.  If you put a proposition before a county council on the lines, &ldquo;We propose to provide by legislation that you shall compulsorily strike a 2d. rate for agriculture in the future,&rdquo; every county councillor understands what is intended.  There is no danger that anybody will misunderstand it.  There is no danger that anybody will be under any delusion as to what we are going to do.  We did not think that any further invitation was necessary.  Knowing county councils as I do, and knowing how free they are with criticism, I am satisfied that if there was any real, popular opposition to this proposal we would find somewhere <Col N="560" /> some county councillor objecting to it.</P>

      <P>When you know how easy it is to get the county councils going and when you know how many cranks, if I may say so, there are on the county councils; when you have all parties represented on the county councils and all seeking to take some political advantage of the Government, and when you find that there was not a single county council to take exception to this proposal, you must assume that the county councils realised that it was something above politics and clearly in the interest of agriculture; that they realised that it is vital to keep our schemes going and that they cannot be kept going unless with this 2d. rate.  We gave the county councils the opportunity of making objection, but there was no opposition whatever to the proposal. If this proposal is not carried, our schemes will have to be cut down. They are valuable schemes, and I put it to the Seanad that if they reject this <Col N="561" /> proposal they will be acting against the views of every county council in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>What does reduction mean?  You are giving a tremendous amount of money in premiums.  These premiums, which are a subsidy from the State and a subsidy from the ratepayers, merely mean the subsidising of the breeders of livestock.  These premium schemes cost a lot of money, and could very well be reduced by 20 per cent. or 15 per cent. or so, representing the difference between the voluntary rate and the compulsory rate which the Minister is seeking to impose. The Minister says that at a time when taxation was much greater than it is at present we voted 1¾d.  At that time, the prices of commodities produced by the farmer were much greater than they are at present.  At that time we were not selling milk at 2d. a gallon. At present the prices of the farmers' commodities are down to bedrock, and any increase in rates is to be deplored and ought not to be introduced. The present schemes provide, in many cases, for subsidies to the extent of £60 for premium bulls.  That amount is spent over three years.  That is a tax upon the man who wants to buy an animal at the Show and who has not a premium, and it really means subsidising the breeders of livestock. I cannot see why the schemes could not be reduced to bring them within the cost of 1¼d. rate&mdash;the rate voluntarily raised heretofore by the farmers on the county councils.  I propose to vote against the proposal in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the amendment brought in by Senator <Col N="562" /> Linehan is concerned with this question of premiums.  I have spent a lifetime in the study of this premium question and I always considered that the premiums were too low.  The man who has to feed and keep a premium bull according to regulations is generally at a loss.  In some counties, the premiums are not applied for owing to the loss. The premium does not compensate the man for the amount he has to spend in keeping the bull according to the conditions laid down by the Department. Only those who have had experience are aware of the cost of keeping these bulls, which are really for the benefit of the country.  The man who keeps a premium bull is conferring a great benefit on the district in which he lives. I am not satisfied with the amount of the present premiums and I think the Minister should increase the premiums by £10 each, at least.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that it is fair, at this hour of the day, to raise an objection to this proposal.  I agree with what the Minister has said.  Each county council had an opportunity of making objection to the scheme at the proper time.  As far as the county council which I represent is concerned, the demand there is for increased grants to agriculture.  This Bill is introduced with the intention of helping agriculture.  As regards the premiums for bulls, if there were not a demand in a county for additional premiums, surely the money would not be voted. I think that the Department realises that the demand exists because grants have been given out of the Relief Fund for the erection of poultry-houses. When each county council got opportunity to raise objection to this proposal at the proper time and no objection was entered, I think this is not the time now to take exception to the proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>We here have nothing to do with the county councils, <Col N="563" /> though they are a factor in the situation. I have read the circular which was sent to the county councils.  It gives them an opportunity of making a protest, but it does not invite them to offer their opinion.  It informs them undoubtedly that it is proposed to make the striking of this rate mandatory. However, whether they objected or not, the vicious principle would still be there.  I do not quite see how schemes will be substantially affected, as I understand most of the county councils have already been raising a 2d. rate.  Those who would not raise a 2d. rate would be very few and they would be the only councils which would be interfered with.  I cannot allow the Minister to stand on the principle of interference and to say that I cannot stand on the principle of freedom.  I do not stand for absolutely unfettered liberty, but I do not think the Minister can stand for the unfettered right to make the councils do what he likes. The principle in this case should be resisted. That principle is the right of the State to tax people in respect of rates&mdash;the right of the Government to impose rates, as distinct from taxes, on the people.  They have no such right. The county councils alone have that right.</P>

      <P>The speech of Senator Sir John Keane was rather remarkable, because, as far as I know, he has been a fairly strong supporter of the action of the Ministry whenever it has been decided to close down a local authority, such as the Dublin Corporation or some county council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never heard the Senator raise any objection to interference of this description.  Obviously, it is his opinion that it is the duty of the State to interfere when it considers that a local authority has failed to do its duty.  Senator Sir John Keane is evidently arguing this as a question of principle, while Senator Wilson is arguing it as a question of finance&mdash; the difference between 1¾d. and 2d.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator limited <Col N="564" /> his case to the question of finance.  I wonder for whom the Senators we have heard to-day speak?  I think they are speaking, in the main, for the large farmers, who are a very small minority of the community.  A 2d. rate, whether compulsory or voluntary, is a very small consideration to the majority of Irish farmers, who have valuations of less than £10.  The idea of this Bill, as I take it, is to consolidate these schemes, to ensure their continuance for the future and not leave them to the vagaries of any particular county council which, for some cause or another, might decide not to levy any rate at all, and thus cause the collapse of schemes that are vital to the development of the agricultural industry. A Labour party on the county council might take quite a different view from that which is at present held.  They might decide to levy a rate for works of quite a different character and make a saving in the rate for agriculture. I think the farmers ought to be thankful that they are safeguarded in respect of this Bill.  From every quarter we hear calls at present: &ldquo;What are you going to do for the farmers?&rdquo;  If you are going to do anything for them, there must be a certain element of compulsion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane knows that compulsion is necessary. He has belonged to a party which has imposed more compulsion on this country than any Senator here has. You have to impose compulsion on a county council to collect rates.  You do exercise a certain amount of compulsory power in local government affairs, and it is ridiculous to use the argument of compulsion on this Bill. I do not say this of Senator Sir John Keane, but anything is good enough for some people to use as a political stunt, irrespective of the fact that it may injure the people whom the speakers profess to serve.  Anybody who professes to have any interest in agriculture at all must know in his heart that this is a proper and businesslike proposal, no matter who makes it; that it is in the interests of agriculture, that it is not going to impose <Col N="565" /> any hardship on anybody&mdash;even the big farmer&mdash;and that it is the farmers, and the farmers only, who are going to benefit by it.  I do not understand the reason for the storm which has been raised in the teacup over this matter.  If it is a question of principle, that question has been decided already.  If it is a mere question of finance, it is hardly necessary to enter into it at all.  The object of the proposal is good.  No principle has been violated, and I will vote for the Bill, believing that I am voting in the interest of the farmers to a far greater extent than those who hold themselves out as self-appointed guardians of the farming industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only matter raised that I think I have to deal with is the statement that a letter was sent to the county councils notifying them of the intention to make this rate mandatory.  I have here a copy of the circular letter sent out, and I find that it contains quite a number of other matters which were brought to the attention of the county councils.  The councils were informed that the Bill was going through the Dáil.  Possibly that gave them an idea that it would be futile to raise any objection to a Bill already under way.  It is stated in the circular:</P>
      <P>It is fully anticipated that this Bill will become law before the 31st March next, but as the county council will shortly be considering their estimates, I have to suggest that they should take the necessary preliminary steps towards raising, in respect of the Agricultural and Live Stock Schemes, a sum equivalent to the proceeds of a rate of 2d. in the £, as stipulated in the Bill.</P>
      <P>My idea of this circular is that the county councils were asked, when they were considering their estimates, to decide whether they would raise this 2d. in the £ suggested by the Minister, although there was no legal sanction for so doing.  The circular also declares:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to regularise the position of the county councils in this matter, the Minister for Agriculture will arrange, when the Agriculture Bill is next under consideration by the <Col N="566" /> Oireachtas, to obtain legal sanction for any action taken at this stage by county councils towards the striking of a rate in excess of 1d. in the £ for the purposes of the schemes referred to.</P>
    <P>I take it that is the most important point in the circular.  It is not merely that there was a notification that 2d. in the £ was mandatory, but the county councils were asked to notify the Minister whether they would strike this extra 2d., and whether also they would do so before they had any legal power. The making of a rate of 2d. in the £ mandatory is the greatest objection that I have to this Bill.  I know that the schemes would go on quite as well if it were left optional with the county councils to strike the rate.  I think it should be purely a voluntary matter with them now as in the past.  I do not agree to this extra rate being made mandatory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator O'Farrell that I have consistently welcomed the suppression of local bodies, if I ask the Senator to verify that I think he will find it very difficult indeed.  In some cases I have agreed to the suppression of local bodies for obvious and marked misbehaviour and dereliction of duty, but I think I can honestly say that I have throughout rather defended the liberty of local bodies and pleaded liberty of action and local option in favour of local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read portion of the circular for the Seanad:</P>
      <P>You are probably aware that under Section 32 (1) of the Agriculture Bill now before the Dáil, it is proposed that the raising by means of the poor rate of a sum equal to not less than a rate of 2d. in the £ in each financial year (including the financial year commencing the 1st April, 1931) shall be mandatory, and that each county council shall be empowered in the same financial year to raise, if necessary, a further sum equal to the proceeds of an additional 1d. rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That circular was dated 31st January, 1931, and there was not a single protest. With regard to Senator Sir John Keane, he says that he takes a stand <Col N="567" /> on principle.  That is the trouble about Senator Keane&mdash;he is always saying he is standing on principle without knowing exactly what it means.  What is the principle?  It is the principle that the county councils shall have absolute discretion as to the striking of the rate. Apparently this is the first time that principle has been infringed.  Apparently the Senator is enunciating that we are doing something new.  Does <Col N="568" /> the Senator object to a compulsory rate for criminal injuries?  The county councils are compelled to strike a rate for criminal injuries and for the Diseases of Animals Acts.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 4:</P>
      <P>Section 36, sub-section (2).  To delete the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in line 8 and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is somewhat to the same effect as amendment 3.  It refers to a rate of one halfpenny in regard to forestry.  Whatever reasons there may be for having a compulsory rate for agriculture I see none whatever for a forestry rate because forestry is of no benefit to agriculture.  Forestry, in my opinion, will never produce a profit.  The only thing it will do for the country will be to enhance the beauty of the scenery.  Perhaps forestry might give employment, but in that way the work would be in the general interests of the community at large.  I suggest that this rate of one halfpenny should be voluntary and not compulsory.  Of course the amount is very small, but the principle is the same as in the case of the last amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

      <P>(1)  Where the Minister, on the joint representation of the council of a county and the committee of agriculture for such county, considers it desirable that steps should be taken to preserve existing woods standing in such county, the Minister may by order (in this Act referred to as a forestry scheme order) declare that such county is a county in which it is desirable that a forestry scheme under this section should be put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, no forestry scheme can be put into effect unless there is representation made by the county council. It is entirely for the county council <Col N="569" /> cil to make representations.  If they consider a forestry scheme is desirable they can make a representation to the Minister.  The Minister may refuse that scheme or he may agree to it. If he does agree, there must be a rate, but the rate is in no sense mandatory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised certain issues in connection with this Bill last week, and it was my intention at that time, if possible, to draft several amendments to it; but in going through the Bill I came to the conclusion that it was practically impossible to prepare any amendments that would be in any way acceptable.  That was due to the fact that, in my opinion, an entirely different Bill to what is before the House would be required to ensure sewerage and water supply schemes. It is my opinion that this Bill will not achieve the purpose for which it was obviously drafted.  My feeling is that county councils will not co-operate in the necessary enactments for rates so as to make the Bill a practical proposition for the country.  I think we are all agreed that sewerage and water supply schemes are very necessary in practically every county in Ireland, and we are agreed that there is a great deal of work to be done in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The peculiar circumstances existing in each county, where rates will have to be struck for areas at a great distance from other points within the county, will in my opinion tend to render the Bill practically inoperative. I feel another line of action might have been taken.  Rightly or wrongly, my conception is that if the county councils are going to have the responsibility of imposing taxation for the carrying out of sewerage and water supply schemes, the only method likely to achieve that purpose will be for each county council to adopt a series of systems and to schedule these on a county basis.  Then an equitable <Col N="572" /> rate could be struck.  When we come to the question of the equitable rate, the area deriving greatest benefit should be taxed to the greatest extent. A small tax should be imposed upon the areas not immediately benefiting and the balance could be made up by a contribution from the State. Let us take any county in the Free State and I am sure we will find a disinclination to strike a rate for an area twenty or thirty miles away from the location of most of the ratepayers. My feeling is that this Bill, drafted as it is, will not be workable, and the result will be that sewerage and water supply schemes will not be developed in the way we would like to develop them.</P>
    <P>When I have made that explanation Senators will readily see that from my point of view it was practically impossible to get an amendment drafted that would in any sense amend this Bill or one that would be acceptable to the Ministry.  I feel that in this Bill the Minister could have justified imposing compulsion on the counties.  We know that in other directions and in other circumstances the Government have been quite keen in enforcing their will.  Surely this is one instance where the welfare of the whole country might have led the Ministry to exercise a certain amount of compulsion in insisting on the execution of necessary sewerage and water schemes?  While I am opposed generally to the principle of compulsion on county councils, I feel that here is one case that is infinitely more important than the many other cases in which compulsion has been applied. It is one case where, on reasonable terms, the Minister might have exercised a certain amount of compulsion. The outcome of that, with a State contribution, might have helped to solve the problem, a problem that I am satisfied is not going to be solved by this Bill.  On that basis I am going to vote against the Final Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think that when the Cathaoirleach has heard me he will agree that it would be a very desirable course to pursue.  I regret I was not able to be here for the Second Reading and Committee Stages of the Bill, because it seems to me that the members of the Dáil and Seanad were not aware of some of the consequences and implications which will arise when some of the sections of the Bill come to be construed. Senators are aware that under Section 238 of the Act of 1878 it is provided that the sum borrowed shall not at any time exceed, with balances, etc., of sums previously borrowed, twice the net annual value of the premises assessable within the district in respect of which such money may be borrowed.</P>
      <P>Taking Section 3 of this Bill, I consider, in view of previous existing legislation, that there is no clear definition of what &ldquo;district&rdquo; is.  Think as I may, I cannot determine what the district is that is to be taken into account when you are estimating the sum which is to be borrowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's observation is an example of the difficulties that will arise in construing this Bill when it becomes an Act.  Are we to understand that a sum can be borrowed equal to twice the annual value of all the land hereditaments assessable in the county?  I do not think that is a true construction.  If it is, it enables the Minister to borrow at least forty times as much as the Public Health Act of 1878 permitted to be borrowed for schemes of this description, and that is why I submit that before the Bill finally leaves the Seanad the Minister should be here to explain or correct the doubts and difficulties that are in the minds of Senators regarding this Bill. My own humble judgment is this, that the Bill has gone through <i>per</i><Col N="574" /><i>incuriam</i> certainly as regards some of its provisions.</P>
      <P>My main objection to the Bill in principle is that it proposes to put on the farmers of this country by far the greater part of the burden of public health charges.  It has been said that the poor rate is an unjust tax.  I think myself it is an unjust tax, because it is mainly a tax on the income of persons engaged in agriculture.  Here is a Bill which provides for the raising of money for sewerage schemes for towns and, I hope, for villages also, and for water supplies for towns.  The Bill undoubtedly provides that the main cost of sewerage and water supply schemes for towns and villages, which are not county boroughs, shall be borne by the people who derive no special benefit from them, namely, the farmers of the surrounding district.  Therefore, the Bill is unjust in two ways: one, because it provides for the raising of this money by means of poor rate; and secondly, because it puts the main burden upon the people who will not benefit from it.  I think it is an absurdity to hold out a hope to the farmers of this country that their land is to be de-rated and on the same day to make provision for imposing a rate that is going to fall mainly upon them. I am strongly opposed to the principle of this Bill, and to its being passed now in the absence of the Minister.</P>

      <P>What has emerged from the last two speeches on the Bill points in rather different directions. Senator Comyn said that he considered rates were an unfair tax, while Senator Connolly wants to impose rates on an unwilling council.  These contradictions are rather puzzling.  The debate shows that this question of rating has to be considered with very great care.  One Senator wants money for drains, and another Senator wants money for something else.  Everyone has his own pet scheme, and wants to put the cost on the unfortunate ratepayer.  There is no <Col N="575" /> suggestion at all that the taxpayer should do anything.  It reminds one of the story of the man who said: &ldquo;I am all for economy, but hands off my Department, or any vested interest that affects me.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Seanad could help to answer a question that I want put.  As I understand it, this Bill provides for placing a rate on an outside portion of a county for work done before the passing of the Act or since its passing.  In the case of water supply schemes that have been in existence for three or four years, or even twenty years, and for which people have been paying a district rate over all that period, I want to know if they will be entitled to make a claim for a refund of their money from the county?</P>

      <P>Judging by this debate, talk about water schemes is not such a dry subject as one would imagine.  The questions that are now <Col N="576" /> being put should have been asked on the Committee Stage and, if necessary, amendments put down dealing with them.  I think it is rather elementary procedure on the part of Senators, when the Minister is not here, to be putting questions that should have been dealt with on the Committee Stage. Even if the Minister were here, I do not think he should be asked to answer some of these questions.  The argument advanced by Senator Comyn to the effect that this Bill is of no interest at all to the farmers of the country was effectively answered on the Second Reading Stage.  It was a pity the Senator was not here then.  The answer to the Senator's argument is so obvious that it is not necessary to repeat what was said then.  I do not think that the consideration of the Bill should be postponed for the attendance of the Minister.  The Bill cannot be amended now.  All the Seanad can do is either to pass it or reject it.  While the passing of the Bill may do no harm, it certainly can do good.  I believe this measure is a step in the right direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving the Second Reading of the Bill it may be necessary for me to explain, at some length, the reason for it and some of its provisions. It was introduced into the Dáil by Deputy Little.  The first clause of the Bill is almost identical with the first clause of an Act of Parliament in Northern Ireland dealing with the same subject.  The Bill as introduced by Deputy Little was referred to a Committee of the Dáil.  Looking through the report of that Committee I find that most clauses of the Bill were altered by the Committee.  Of the original Bill introduced by Deputy Little there remains only what I may call the paternity of the Bill.  It now falls on me to introduce the Bill in this House.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with the legitimation of children born before the marriage of their parents.  It is intended to bring the law in this country into line with the public law of Europe.  In fact, its design is to make the law what it was after the introduction of Christianity into Europe, and to repeal in this year of grace, 1931, the pagan law which obtained in England and in Ireland since the time of Henry III.  I have said that it is the Christian law, and for this reason, that in old Roman times there was no such thing as the legitimation of the child born out of wedlock, the offspring of a woman who was not free.  There was in the Roman Constitution a certain provision, however, for legitimating children in certain cases, but it was only in the time of Constantine, and after the introduction of Christianity, that the legitimation of children by the subsequent marriage of their parents became the Civil Law&mdash;the law of Rome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the time of Constantine&mdash; about the year 300&mdash;it continued to be the law not alone in Eastern Europe but in Western Europe until the time of Henry III.  It continued to be the law of France and of Scotland.  It <Col N="579" /> was the law of ancient Ireland, but for a special purpose, in the time of Henry III.  For the nobles of England determined that they would not permit the legitimation of children born out of wedlock.  Of course, the reason for that was political.  They did not wish that the children of Saxon women should be entitled to succeed to the estates of the Norman conquerors of England.  It then became the law of England that, so far as the succession to estates was concerned, children born out of wedlock should not be entitled to succeed.  Being then the law of England, it became the law of Ireland, and was strictly enforced here for the same political purpose.  Some time ago, an Act was passed in the British Parliament putting an end to that anomaly, and in 1928 an Act was passed in the Northern Parliament providing that the old Christian rule as to legitimation should prevail. Now, it falls to me to introduce this measure and to explain some of its provisions.</P>
    <P>The first section provides that children born out of wedlock shall become legitimate on the marriage of their parents.  The second section provides that any child so legitimated can obtain in the courts a declaration of legitimacy.  The third section deals with the rights of legitimated persons. Generally, these rights are&mdash;that a legitimated person shall have the same standing as a child born in wedlock as regards the distribution of the estate of an intestate, and in regard to any other disposition coming into operation after the date of legitimation. There is, however, the provision that the legitimated child, in the matter of succession to real estate, shall be only entitled to succeed next after the child born in wedlock, or, to put it in the words of the Bill: &ldquo;the legitimated person or persons shall rank as if he or they had been born on the day when he or they became legitimated by virtue of this Act.&rdquo;  I think that is reasonable enough, so as to provide for the cases of persons born in wedlock before the passing of this Bill.  A legitimated person, in the matter of succession to real estate, will come in after a person born in <Col N="580" /> wedlock.  There is another provision which is rather curious to find in a statute of the Free State legislature. It is that all property devolving upon a person who is designated as the possessor of a title of honour shall go to him notwithstanding the provisions of this Act.  In other words, where property is settled to follow the succession of a title or dignity, that property shall follow that succession notwithstanding the provisions of this Act.  Section 10 provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall affect the succession to any dignity or title of honour or render any person capable of succeeding to or transmitting a right to succeed to any such dignity or title.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, the old pagan law will still apply in regard to the succession to titles of honour, and that same law will still apply in relation to the succession to property which, by any will or other disposition, is expressed or by implication is understood to be attached to such title of honour.  There is another provision in the Bill in relation to the succession on intestacy to legitimated persons and their issue.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a legitimated person or a child or remoter issue of a legitimated person dies intestate in respect of all or any of his real or personal property, the same persons shall be entitled to take the same interests therein as they would have been entitled to take if the legitimated person had been born legitimate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is only a corollary to what appears in an earlier portion of the Bill.  If a legitimated person is to be entitled to share on intestacy with persons born in wedlock it is only just that persons born in wedlock should be entitled to share in the estate of a legitimated person.  Another section in the Bill provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A legitimated person shall have the same rights and shall be under the same obligations in respect of the maintenance and support of himself or any other person as if he had been born legitimate ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Up to this a bastard had no right and no obligation.  Now he is to receive the rights of a child born in wedlock in case his parents marry each other after his birth, and <Col N="581" /> it is only fair that in such case he should have the obligations of such child.  There are minor provisions relating to death duties.</P>
    <P>I shall refer to one clause in which members of the Seanad on my right will be interested.  I think we ought to have some amendment of that clause, which deals with the right of an illegitimate child to succeed to his mother on intestacy.  The clause states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Where, after the commencement of this Act, the mother of an illegitimate child, such child not being a legitimated person, dies intestate as respects all or any of her real or personal property, and does not leave any legitimate issue her surviving, the illegitimate child, or, if he is dead, his issue, shall be entitled to take any interest therein to which he or such issue would have been entitled if he had been born legitimate.</P>
    <P>The meaning of that is that if the mother has no other children the illegitimate child shall succeed to her estate, but if she marries and has any other children, then her illegitimate child has to go without any provision whatsoever.  The House may be of opinion that if an illegitimate child is entitled to succeed to his mother when she remains unmarried, he ought to be entitled to some share even when she does marry.  It is a matter to which I would direct the attention of the House.  There is another clause which states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Where, after the commencement of this Act, an illegitimate child, not being a legitimated person, dies intestate in respect of all or any of his real or personal property, his mother, if surviving, shall be entitled to take any interest therein to which she would have been entitled if the child had been born legitimate and she had been the only surviving parent.</P>
    <P>Now, we are going to alter the law. We are going to provide that the estate of an illegitimate person, instead of going to the Crown as it used to go on intestacy, shall go to the mother, if the mother survives, and I would suggest to the House that there is <Col N="582" /> great justice in that provision.  But if there is justice in that provision, I think there is equal justice in providing that where the mother dies intestate the illegitimate child ought to have some share in the distribution of her estate.  The House may think that that is a matter which will call for attention.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of the Bill.  I commend them to the House because they are a very late instalment of justice.  They bring the law of this country into conformity with the public law of Europe.  This Bill enables the status of children to be determined as it was determined in the Christian Church before the middle ages, and as it is determined up to the present according to the laws of the Church.  I think that there will be no great opposition to the principle of this Bill.  There are two or three matters in relation to some of these clauses which need special consideration from the House.  Perhaps, some Senators will ask why we should be interested in titles of honour or the succession to land associated with titles of honour.  Some Senators will ask why, if the mother is to succeed to the estate of the bastard child, should not the illegitimate child have some share in the estate of the mother. There is another matter which, in my judgment, has not received sufficient attention in the Bill.  I think that there ought to be provision whereby a father should make some declaration of legitimacy in the event of his marriage with the mother of the child. That is the law of France.  In France, when people have offspring and subsequently marry, there is a provision that the father shall make some declaration of acknowledgment.  There is no such provision in the law of Scotland.  There was no such provision in the Civil Law&mdash;the old law of the Church.  It will be for the Seanad to say whether there should not be some provision whereby the father should declare his paternity of the child when he marries the mother, as is the case in France, or whether you think this cumbrous method is sufficient, whereby a child born before wedlock can himself go before a court and, under the Legitimacy Declaration <Col N="583" /> Act, obtain a declaration of legitimacy.  Perhaps the Seanad would think the latter course is better, for the reason that the rights of the child are in no way prejudiced by the fact that the father does not make a declaration acknowledging the child when father and mother marry.  The child is given the status of a legitimate child according to the law of the Church.  On the distribution of property afterwards, if his right or his parentage is contested, it will be open to him to prove it.  These are a few matters which, I think ought to be remembered by the Seanad when it comes to consider the Bill and to determine whether or not amendments should be made to it.  On the principle of the measure, I would say that this is a Bill long overdue.  We live under a pagan law.  This Bill will make our law conformable with what has been the civil law from the time of the introduction of Christianity into the Roman Empire.</P>

      <P>I second the motion. At the same time I think there are some points in the Bill which require explanation and perhaps correction. The first section of the Bill states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this section, where the parents of an illegitimate person marry or have married one another, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, ...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to me to be an extraordinary statement, because there is nothing there to show whether these people were parents of the child or not. If it were stated that the child was that of the man, it would be equivalent to setting out that he was the parent, but it does not state anything of the sort.  It merely states: &ldquo;Where the parents.&rdquo;  That is an assumption that the man is a parent.  He may not be a parent at all.  You must begin by stating that the man is a parent before you begin to call him a parent.  That is one of the things which require an explanation.  There may be other parts of the Bill which would allow him to prove that he was the parent.  Here it is an entire assumption.  If the father <Col N="584" /> of the child, when he married, stated that he was the father of the child, it would probably be sufficient, but something will have to be done about the provision as it is at present.  The fact that the mother registers the child and registers a particular person as the father of it does not bind the man at all, unless he agrees to it or signs the register as father.  The fact that the mother puts his name down merely means that she wants to father the child on him.  None of these things goes to show that the man is the father of the child.</P>
    <P>A question also arises about these dignities and titles.  What titles are recognised in the Free State?  It is laid down that no title shall be given to a citizen of the Free State for anything that is done in this country.  Are the titles of people who had acquired them before this provision was made recognised? There are titles given by various people.  Some friends of mine have got French titles, and some others have got Roman titles.  Hitherto, in Great Britain, these titles have not been recognised at all.  They have been simply outside the law.  Courtesy titles were given to a great number of people who had no right to them.  Are they recognised in this country, and, if so, which of them?</P>
    <P>Are Papal titles or French titles to be recognised?  I think we ought to have some legal explanation on that. It is unfortunate that we have not got somebody here who would give us authoritative information on that matter. Until we get that information, I do not think we can possibly pass those two clauses which deal with titles of honour.  The mover of the Bill has explained it very clearly, and, taking it as a whole, I willingly support the measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that this Bill is one which, in its main intentions, should become law.  I am much more conversant with the intentions of the Bill after the introductory speech by Senator Comyn than I was before it. The Bill obviously deals with two things.  It deals firstly with the status of the child who would have been illegitimate but for the passing of this measure.  It legitimises that child <Col N="585" /> when its parents become married.  In the main, I think that the Bill is intended to deal with the succession to property, and it is of very much greater interest to that section of the community which is interested in property, property rights and the succession to property than it is to others. The Senator, in moving the Second Reading, mentioned certain provisions of the Bill with which he did not seem to be thoroughly in accord, and he indicated that he would like some amendments to be made to them.  I should like him to give us the benefit of his experience and knowledge as to what would be the change in the situation of this country if we tried to make this Bill retrospective, say, for 400 years or even 100 years, and delete those sections dealing with succession to property following titles of honour.</P>
      <P>I am rather astonished at the Senator backing a Bill which contains a section like Section 10.  Speaking, I presume, with the full approval of the members of his Party, the Senator moved a Bill which contains the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Nothing in this Act shall affect the succession to any dignity or title of honour or render any person capable of succeeding to or transmitting a right to succeed to any such dignity or title.</P>
      <P>I think that that clearly affects the Crown.  I am sure that it is really intended to preserve the legitimacy of the British King in respect to this country.  Coming from the Senator, I wonder how he justifies it and whether he can give any encouragement to the suggestion that, on the Committee Stage, this particular clause should be deleted.</P>

      <P>Three points were raised in the course of the discussion on this Bill.  As was natural to expect in connection with a Bill of this character, they are most important questions.  I was reluctant to introduce this Bill and to assume, I may say, paternity for it, because, except in regard to its title, it is really not a Bill introduced by us.  As I was very careful to explain, the only part of this Bill of which Deputy Little can claim ownership is the title.  The first section of <Col N="586" /> the Bill is taken from the Act in the North of Ireland and all the other sections have been introduced in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing with the questions raised by Senator Colonel Moore, this Bill is, no doubt, open to the objection that it is not proposed to make the law of this country the same as the law of France. In France, when a man marries a woman by whom he has had children, it is competent for him to make a declaration of legitimacy.  That was never the law of Scotland, nor is it the Civil Law&mdash;the law of the Church. But still it is the law of France.  This Bill, in one way, goes a great distance towards meeting the objection raised by Senator Colonel Moore, because it provides that a child can bring a suit under the Legitimacy Declaration Act, 1868&mdash;a suit for a declaration that he is the child of the particular father or mother.  Then there is a provision in the Schedule for the re-registration of children born out of wedlock.  It is necessary for me to explain what the law is.  If a child is not born in wedlock, on the original registration it is not competent for any person to put in the name of the male parent without his consent.  There is a very severe penalty for making a false or fraudulent statement in regard to the registration of a child who is not born in wedlock.  That is the law at present. This Bill proposes to allow the father, when he marries the mother of the child, to re-register the child in the name of the father and mother.  That brings the law more or less into line with the law of France, which provides for a declaration of paternity by the father.  There is something to be said for leaving the law as it is in this Bill. If passed in its present form, the Bill will leave it open to the child at any time to come forward and say: &ldquo;My father and mother got married after I was born, but he was my father.&rdquo; Suppose the mother survived, it would be open to her to prove that the man she subsequently married was father of the child who was born out of wedlock. They would go before a court. I think it is reasonable enough that the provision should be left in that form.  As regards titles of honour, we have no titles of honour.  Of course, <Col N="587" /> men who are noble and who had their distinctions before the passing into law  the Constitution are entitled to say,  that we held we hold.&rdquo;  Article V. of the Constitution provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>No title of honour in respect of any services rendered in or in relation to the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) may be conferred on any citizen of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) except with the approval or upon the advice of the Executive Council of the State.</P>
    <P>No new title can be conferred without the approval of the head of the Executive Council.  It says nothing about titles of honour or distinctions which previously existed&mdash;there are a good many of those titles, some of them honourably acquired, others acquired, perhaps, without so much honour, some indeed with dishonour. There are people in this country who are entitled to claim high distinctions and who, in the course of time, and in the circumstances through which we have passed, have had to lay aside the assumption of titles or dignities to which they were entitled, not merely under the law of England and Scotland but under the ancient law of Ireland.  Perhaps the time will come when, although we may reject English titles, some people such as Senator Moore may say: &ldquo;Well, he has got a distinction from a higher source.&rdquo;  Therefore, I am not at all afraid of sponsoring that section. If we admit an acknowledgment of ancient titles, or even Union peerages, I suppose some of you may think it would not be fair to deprive the holders of such titles of lands or other property which their parents or relations considered ought to be left to uphold the titles.  That is a matter for the House.  I do not think that was in Deputy Little's Bill, but it is in the Bill before this House, and it is for the House to say whether that is right or wrong.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson asked what would be the result if we made this Bill retrospective. I think it would lead to some considerable degree of confusion. This matter of titles of honour, if we did make it retrospective, would lead to that little place in the Castle <Col N="588" /> called the Herald's Office receiving a great amount of attention in the near future.  I do not, however, anticipate anything of that kind.  The Bill seeks to make the law of the Free State coincide with the law of the Christian Church and to divorce the law of this country once and for all from the pagan law that obtained before Christianity was introduced into the Roman Empire and that obtained in England from the time of the Parliament which was held at Merton in the reign of Henry III.</P>
