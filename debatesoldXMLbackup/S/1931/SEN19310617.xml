      <P>I have an announcement to make to the House regarding the Betting Bill, 1930, which appears on to-day's Order Paper for the Report Stage.  The Minister has an amendment which he wishes to move dealing with the question of football betting, which was the subject of amendments tabled by Senator Johnson for the Committee Stage.  Unfortunately, the Minister was unable to let the Clerk have his amendment within the time prescribed by the Standing Orders, i.e., before 4 p.m. on Monday last, and, in the circumstances, the Minister has asked me to ask the House to agree to the postponement of the Report Stage of the Bill until next Wednesday.  Is that agreed?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney) James Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill brings in some amendments to the Charitable Hospitals Act of 1930.  Under the original Act, a considerable number of sweepstakes, with gratifying results to the hospitals, have been held.  This Bill proposes to make certain alterations in the distribution of the moneys available under the sweepstakes held under the provisions of the original Act. Certain hospitals were not eligible to come in under the provisions of the Principal Act.  That is to say, they did not give a certain proportion of their beds to free patients.  Owing to the particular work they do, it would not be feasible for them to give that proportion of their beds to free patients.  Section 2 proposes to add six hospitals to the list of hospitals eligible to participate in this scheme. The first hospital in the list included in that section is Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, The Cedars, Dún Laoghaire. That institution was, up to some time ago, a sanatorium.  It has lately become a hospital for tubercular bone disease, doing for adults what the two hospitals mentioned later in the section&mdash;Cappagh Hospital, and St. Joseph's Hospital, Coole, Co. Westmeath&mdash;do for children.  They deal with tubercular bone disease.  Peamount Sanatorium, Hazelhatch, Co. Dublin, is also an institution which we suggest should benefit under this scheme.  They have started a new village for tubercular patients, where the tubercular patient is able to work and to earn wages.  Though, of course, these patients cannot do a full day's work and cannot obtain a full day's wages, still some of them are able to save comparatively large sums, because their upkeep is not costly. Some of them are able to save 9/- and 10/- a week, which makes them independent of their people at home and, in certain circumstances, enables them to contribute to their people at home. I think the House will agree that all these hospitals are doing excellent work and are entirely within the spirit, though they do not come within the strict letter, of the original Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> Section 3 provides for the setting up of a Committee of Reference.  The duty of the Committee of Reference will be to see that such sums as are available for the voluntary hospitals will be divided fairly and equitably amongst them.  Up to this, there has been, I admit, very little trouble with the voluntary hospitals as to the distribution of the proceeds of these sweepstakes.  But though they have completely agreed amongst themselves and have always come forward with an agreed scheme, I came to the conclusion that some hospitals&mdash;especially the smaller hospitals&mdash;were receiving too much and that even some of the larger hospitals, as things go on, will inevitably receive more than they really require.  I think it is right and proper that there should be an independent body to examine into the needs of the hospitals&mdash;to see what structural alterations they want, what is the state of their accounts and matters of that nature&mdash;and to see that the hospitals receive sums of money proportionate to their individual needs &mdash;that it will not be left to bargaining between the hospitals themselves. which is not very satisfactory and which sometimes may lead to the hospital whose claim is put forward by a more skilful or a more persistent advocate gaining more than a hospital whose claim is not quite so well urged.</P>
    <P>A new principle is introduced into this Bill dealing with the allocation of the proceeds of the sweepstakes.  Heretofore they have gone entirely to voluntary hospitals and not to hospitals which receive help out of the rates.  Under the provisions of this Bill, county hospitals, county homes, and institutions of that sort will benefit to the extent of one-third of the proceeds.  That figure of one-third was rather hard to arrive at.  After considerable discussion in the Dáil. that was accepted as an agreed figure.  The amount available for these hospitals which receive assistance out of the rates will be paid to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and he will see that it is distributed according to the needs of the various hospitals for improvements, <Col N="1092" /> but not for maintenance of patients or anything which could be said to go directly in relief of rates.  It will go to what possibly ought to be done out of rates&mdash;improvements, better equipment, and the provision of better medical appliances, things which, of course, ought to be done out of rates, but which, in fact, will not be so done, because they would put rather a heavier burden on the ratepayers of most counties than would be justified at the present moment.  These sweepstakes have brought in a very considerable sum of money.  There have been three held already, as I dare say the Seanad knows, and another sweepstake, which has now been launched, is to be held on the Manchester November Handicap.  The hospitals mentioned in Section 2, and also the rate-aided hospitals&mdash;I am using the words &ldquo;rate-aided&rdquo; loosely, because some of the hospitals that come in as voluntary hospitals are rate-aided hospitals&mdash;will come in under the provisions of Section 9 and be able to participate in the November sweepstake.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into the general question of sweepstakes at all. Whether sweepstakes are good or bad, and whether hospitals are wise or unwise in participating in a sweepstake scheme, does not, I think, really arise on this particular measure.  These are matters on which people may differ, and do differ, but at present there is an Act legalising sweepstakes for hospitals, and the question now is simply how the proceeds of these sweepstakes are to be divided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurVincent" hpid="Mr. Vincent Mr. Vincent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Vincent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of this Bill, so far as it goes.  But there is one omission in it which I think is quite important.  You have got two sets of hospitals.  In the first set are those whose income is assured on the rates.  Under this Bill&mdash;very properly &mdash;any money they receive is to be spent not in alleviation of rates but by way of capital improvement.  That, I think, is a very sound provision.  In the other category are voluntary hospitals. That is to say, they have practically to beg for their bread and butter, year in and year out.  They are to get two-thirds of the available <Col N="1093" /> surplus and the others are to get one-third. I think it is of the utmost importance that there should be some provision, or supervision, by which portion of the money that they receive would be invested for future use.  The way I look at the matter is this: if I owned a gold mine and knew that it had only a three years' life, I should consider myself very foolish if I were to spend all the money I received yearly by way of dividend.  An investment fund should be built up.  The question may be a difficult one, because the Government do not wish that this should in any way be looked upon as a State lottery.  However, I do not think there is insuperable difficulty in the way, because the machinery has been set up for another purpose.  The body set up to advise the Minister as to the proportions in which the funds are to be distributed to the various hospitals should give some supervision to the manner in which the hospitals dispose of these very large sums which they are to get.  This matter is of the greatest importance, because if this sweepstake innovation is to go down in the history of this country as a very successful venture, the public, not only here but elsewhere, must know that every step has been taken to ensure that the large sums which are coming into this country are dealt with in the most businesslike and practical manner.  I do not say for a moment that the governing bodies of the hospitals are not very fine bodies.  I make no allegation against them whatsoever, but human nature is human nature, and if you look around at boards of directors you will find that there is a great difference between one board of directors and another board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I want to ensure is that in no case, unless exceptional circumstances are proved to the satisfaction of the authority that has already been set up, is all the money going to be devoted to capital expenditure.  It is most important that some provision for the future should be made in the case of the voluntary hospitals, and, before they are allowed to spend in capital outlay more than fifty per cent. of the sums they will receive, they should be able to satisfy this body that is already advising the Minister in other important matters.  I <Col N="1094" /> think that is of the very greatest importance, because easy money, all the world over, is easy money, and it would be lamentable if, after all these sweepstakes are ended, some hospitals found themselves in a worse position than they are in at the present moment by an increase, through capital expenditure, of their running expenses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not aspire to persuade the House, now that this thing has gone so far, to object to an extension of the sweepstake funds to country hospitals.  I do not suppose there are many Senators who would agree with me were I to endeavour to persuade them to do so.  I will take this opportunity of giving a sort of survey of the relations between the easy money to which Senator Vincent has referred and the hospitals.  We have in a small country, with a population that hardly compares with the population of the City of Vienna, a capital city with nineteen hospitals, nineteen laundries, nineteen x-ray rooms, nineteen staffs, with patients to stretch over them all. It would really seem as if disease in this country is a good business.  One thing that has been omitted in the case of the hospitals that are benefiting through the sweepstakes is the number of people who form staffs and who are directly deriving a livelihood through the hospitals.  There are many hospitals that one could describe as more or less racketeering disease, to use an American expression.  All that may seem strange coming from me, but these are really the facts.  In other words, there are no voluntary hospitals in the country at all.  The industry of disease supports people who are not diseased.  There are certain ineradicable circumstances, and perhaps it is not desirable that they should be eradicated, which prevent a merging in this city of its nineteen hospitals, nineteen laundries and nineteen x-ray rooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I object to an extension of this fund to almost one hundred hospitals is that it would not be good in the long run for the patients, because they would not have the advantage of a centralised system.  This country is really a small country, and an accident could not occur anywhere <Col N="1095" /> outside a run of five hours to the city; in other words, the victim of any accident could easily be taken to Dublin within five hours.  Unless you centralise medical services you will never have efficiency such as is at the moment desirable.  It is a question whether you can have very competent service in the case of a surgeon who has not about one hundred beds.  It is considered that Belfast will overtake Dublin, because in Belfast they have more beds and, consequently, they are likely to be more experienced and more competent. They are more centralised in Belfast, whereas in Dublin we are divided up.  If you neglect to centralise the hospitals you will merely be putting the doctor in control of a local hospital in a very anomalous position. He will have to know all about eyes, ears, midwifery and kidneys.  Of course, he could not be expected to be a specialist in all these matters.  The great advances made in medical and surgical spheres tend naturally towards what is called specialisation. To become a specialist in any one matter affecting the human body entails many years of study and experiment.</P>
    <P>The spending of this fund which has been accumulated through sweepstakes will, in my opinion, tend to increase the maintenance of hospitals.  Every hospital which has benefited through the sweepstakes has either built additions or planned to extend buildings. Looking back over a period of twenty-five years, I do not think that there has been a single life lost in this city on account of inadequate hospital accommodation.  In no instance has the roof leaked, and nobody has lost his life on account of inadequate architectural construction.  I think it is madness to extend the maintenance charges.  If that practice is allowed to go on, in a few years there will be bigger hospital buildings with higher maintenance charges, and in that connection there is no provision envisaged. When we are dealing with this sweepstakes fund we should bear in mind what happened in the case of the Road Fund.  It might not be wise in the case of the hospitals to set aside a sum of one million pounds for the future.  I strongly urge upon the Committee not <Col N="1096" /> to allow the money to be run into architecture.  The other day a sum of £700,000 was set aside for cancer research. That will probably result in a skyscraper, reaching to something like one thousand feet, and the human element will scarcely be considered at all.</P>
    <P>I am strongly of opinion that the revival of certain country hospitals should not take place.  Certain country hospitals have been merged into county infirmaries, and workhouse hospitals have been similarly merged. I would like some assurance that we will not have more than one hundred hospitals when all the awards have been made.  It is evident that the sweepstakes cannot go on for ever. There are certain things that may be called national sweepstakes.  In Spain and France they had a system of lotteries, and after a short time people became apathetic about them.  The sweepstakes that have been organised in this country have been the means of accumulating large funds, which will be divided amongst the various hospitals.  If that sort of thing continues, we may easily have more hospitals than we can ever hope to have patients to fill.</P>
    <P>There is not so much extraordinary illness in Ireland.  If a man breaks his leg in the country, it is quite easy to get a local person to diagnose what has happened, without having any x-ray treatment at all.  Thirty years ago one was supposed to diagnose cases of fracture without the assistance of all the equipment we have in modern times.  I cannot see the necessity for an extension of this money through the country.  What should be done in the interests of the public is to centralise all the hospitals.  In this small island there is no need for so many different buildings, and there should be a general merging.  We will at least have it on record that somebody saw the farce of having twenty hospitals in a city with about 400,000 of a population.  A large city like Vienna, with two million people, has only one hospital.  People come from the very ends of the earth to get surgically treated there.  Many of the outstanding discoveries which have <Col N="1097" /> lessened the burden of human misery have come from places where disease was concentrated.  It is at a place like that, where disease is concentrated, that alleviation will be found.</P>
    <P>We are merely dissipating our energy by throwing money into every village in the country.  If a man is seriously injured in the country, he can be taken by bus to Dublin within a few hours.  If a country doctor declares that he is not an eye specialist, he will lose prestige for having some hole in his armour.  In Dublin, a specialist can say: &ldquo;I know nothing about the eye; you will get better treatment in the next wing.&rdquo;  You are merely putting a doctor in an anomalous position if you set him up as specialist in a country village.  Many unfortunate cases have failed to get relief for the simple reason that the diagnosis was not arrived at in time. Human nature will scarcely prompt a doctor in the country to say &ldquo;I do not know what is wrong with you, but I may be able to tell you in about six months.&rdquo;  There have been instances where relief has been too late just because the diagnosis was not arrived at in time.</P>
    <P>There are many places in the country where the unfortunate local doctor is expected to know more than all the medical men in the City of Dublin. That condition of things will be accentuated if you start to endow the county infirmaries.  It was stated here that money has to be spread over nineteen hospitals in Dublin.  Years ago a sum of two million pounds had to be refused simply on account of the conditions under which the hospitals were originally founded, conditions which made religious considerations paramount.  That was a really lamentable condition of things.  I am satisfied that people realise now that it is high time there was a merging of the Dublin hospitals, as far as it is possible to bring that about.</P>
    <P>I will go back now to staff conditions. Suppose we had the nineteen Dublin hospitals merged to-morrow, we would have nineteen leading physicians and surgeons all over the place, becoming senile.  The whole question of medicine will have to be considered.  It might easily get to be <Col N="1098" /> considered here if it were mixed up with economics.  The question might arise: What are you to do with the doddering doctor?  I must be the lonely voice in this matter.  It is not that I wish to deprive anybody in the country of assistance.  The fact is that there are too many hospitals in this small country.  By endowing district hospitals you are putting further away the day when centralisation will be facilitated.  The advantage of centralisation will be denied the men who are practising in this country.  It is a very serious thing.  Belfast is getting ahead of us, because in certain hospitals there they have more beds.  We have more buildings, but not more beds.</P>
    <P>I am speaking on this matter without any ill-feeling.  I have no axe to grind.  I was very nearly presiding over the distribution of £100,000 yesterday. A certain hospital got a large grant from the Government, and it proposes to spend £100,000.  Sweden has the latest hospital.  In Sweden there are no more than four people in a ward, and, therefore, it is a much later hospital than the one which has eight people in a ward.  The whole thing is perfect nonsense.  There is not a single hospital in Dublin that is not water-tight and clean enough.  Of course we may have local philanthropists interested in running up a shack.  If a wealthy man is ill he goes to a private home; but that is really only a lodging-house with a good deal of plumbing at the back.  It was never built as a hospital, and one of the effects of these private homes is to lower the rateable value of Merrion Square, Fitzwilliam Street and around that area.  The man who has a good deal of consideration for the value of his life goes there.  Where the geraniums used to be there are now buckets and pipes and tin tables.  The sooner we get rid of the nonsensical mixture of charity and pathos, with a foolish administration of cash, the better.</P>
    <P>There is no need for any new building in this city.  There is really great need for the nineteen existing hospitals to be merged into one big central hospital.  Another thing to which I <Col N="1099" /> would like to draw attention is that the hospital are erected in the most insanitary parts of the city.  That is the extraordinary thing about it, that notwithstanding the great advance in medical knowledge our hospitals are still situated in the slums.  The slums are round the hospitals because no one wants to live near the hospitals, and the fact that the hospitals are there is one reason why the slums exist around them.  Suppose the nineteen sites were sold and a central hospital were established, the position would be ever so much better.  In my opinion, however, the sites should not be sold; they should be turned into playgrounds. One big central hospital should be built near the mountains, up at Kilbride, say.  That is only a matter of eight or ten minutes in a modern bus.  Of course, that will never be done.  They will prefer to go on enlarging the hospitals.</P>
    <P>Let us even take Dublin City.  It was never built by sanitary engineers. Those who built the city built it round a large sewer which is punctually emptied by the tide.  It is about the most punctual service that we have in the City.  The City of Dublin was never built by people who had any idea of health.  If ever there is a big central hospital built the question of the site ought to weigh very considerably with those in authority.  It is monstrous to have this city splattered all over with lazar houses.  It must be a strange thing to come to a city where you see nothing but saints and doctors and cinemas.  If the Corporation are not checked we will soon have a cement lid in the middle of the River Liffey for the accommodation of transport.  The suggestion has been put forward that they should build a big bus garage over the Liffey.  I hope the citizens of Dublin will take serious consideration of this proposal.  The only ventilator we have is the Liffey;  brings the land and sea breezes up every day.  Some provision ought to be made to prevent any attempt to make the city more unsightly and unhealthy by extending the existing hospitals in places where a hospital should never have been erected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very much interested in the speech delivered by Senator Gogarty.  I am sure we all found it very refreshing to hear Senator Gogarty discussing this subject. However much the Senator inclines towards centralising the hospitals, in my opinion he is taking on a very big job if he proposes to have a centralised scheme carried through.  I can imagine him going to the boards of the various hospitals and fighting out that issue with them.  He would have to fight out that issue with them before he would convince us in the Seanad.  As regards the Bill, I would like to ask one or two questions.  I think we would be all glad to see certain hospitals given a share of the sweepstakes fund.  I cannot speak for all of them, but I do happen to know something of the work carried on in a couple of them, such as the Cappagh Hospital and the Coole Hospital.  I am quite sure there are other hospitals equally worthy of support.</P>
      <P>I would like to make some reference to the accounts connected with the sweepstakes, the accounts of the Hospitals Trust, Ltd.  I would like to know from the Minister if it would be possible for members of the Oireachtas to get a balance sheet relating to the sweepstakes fund, or is that something that we are not entitled to see?  It would be interesting to know how the various percentages work out as regards the expenses incurred, as distinct altogether from the allotment for the various hospitals.  We would like to know exactly what percentage goes to cover expenses, what amount goes to the hospitals, what amount has been spent on advertisements, and so on.  I think that is information that should be supplied to the members of the Oireachtas.  They have given their authority to the legislation enabling sweepstakes to be carried on.  I would be glad to see the accounts submitted to the Oireachtas in the way I have mentioned, so that members of the Dáil and Seanad may be able to inspect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 allots to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health one-third of the available surplus. The Minister might be able to tell us, <Col N="1101" /> without going into exact details, how it is proposed to distribute that.  Is it to be allotted so that an equitable distribution per county or per area, on a population basis or otherwise, will be made, or is it to be solely at the discretion of the Minister for Local Government how this one-third surplus is to be made available to the various local bodies?  It is set out specifically in the Bill that none of this money will go to the alleviation of rates.  I think the Minister for Local Government will have great difficulty in preventing that.  It may not be spent specifically on things in a particular year for the saving of rates in that year, but obviously if it goes to capital investment it normally would fall under the head of public charges and would in future years eliminate the necessity for expenditure on the part of local bodies. Therefore, in subsequent years it would go towards alleviating the rates. I suggest that the Committee of Reference should be appointed to act with the Minister for Local Government as regards the distribution of that one-third.  I am against the principle of any Minister having sole authority as regards the distribution of any particular fund like that.</P>
    <P>Senator Vincent referred to the fact that human nature is human nature. It is, and just at the moment I doubt very much if it would be fair to expect that the Minister for Local Government would have any soft spots in his heart for certain areas in this country. Of course if it is going to be distributed on an area basis, or on a county basis, or on any basis that would work out equitably, then there is no more to be said.  It automatically would go that way, but there is no such condition in Section 6.  The section seems to me to imply that the Minister will have arbitrary control of that money, and I do not know that the Seanad will altogether approve of that.  In conclusion, I desire again to stress the desirability of having the Committee of Reference co-operate with the Minister in the distribution of that one-third.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be generally agreed that up to now these sweepstakes have been of great advantage <Col N="1102" /> to the hospitals, but we are now at the point where I think it is proposed to take a wrong turn.  Through this Bill the State proposes to take advantage of the sweepstakes for the relief of rates.  I think that is a mistake.  If the State is in earnest in that matter at all then it ought to go the whole hog and make this a national undertaking. Under Section 6 of the Bill the Minister has power to spend money upon the prevention of disease.  I hope he will give consideration to the suggestion I am going to make.  I contend that the slums are a great source of disease and are largely responsible for the overcrowding of hospitals in the country.  Every party and every section of people have deplored the fact that we have such hideous slums and have promised to do what they can to abolish them.  Some small attempts have been made to do away with the slums, but these efforts have been so small that the slum areas instead of decreasing are increasing.</P>
      <P>My suggestion to the Minister is that he ought to ear-mark some portion of this money to be used as free money for housing in order that the people can get houses at an economic rent. It would require many millions to make an impression on the slum problem that we have in this country.  I know no party, whether they be in Church or State, that is prepared to put up the money required to do anything substantial in that connection.  I believe that in these sweepstakes we have an opportunity of getting free money that would enable us to make a big effort to abolish the slums.  By doing that we would be building up, so to speak, a healthy people and doing away with the need for the nineteen hospitals that Senator Gogarty referred to.  He says that there are too many of them and he ought to know.  I differ with the Senator in this way: he said that no human being has lost his life through want of hospital accommodation.  It has been my experience on a number of occasions to see men, almost fatally injured at the docks, taken to hospital. Those taking them there were told to bring them home, that there was no room for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some people who may <Col N="1103" /> argue that sweepstakes are immoral. I say they are less immoral than slums. People who have scruples as regards gaming or gambling must accept responsibility for the prevalence of the awful slums that the poor people in this country are compelled to live in. At some time the requirements of the hospitals will be met through these sweepstakes.  I think that under them an early opportunity ought to be taken to secure portion of the money for free housing.  I would like to explain my point in detail.  We all know that the Dublin Corporation and other public bodies throughout the country are building houses, but owing to the interest charges that they have to meet on the money borrowed for that purpose the houses cannot be let at an economic rent.  Let me refer to the latest development that has taken place in connection with the very laudable housing scheme that was carried out at Marino.  Splendid houses were built there, but what has happened? In order to pay the rents charged the tenants of these houses are compelled to take in other families with the result that we have substantial and enormous overcrowding in these modern houses.  That must go on so long as these people are obliged to pay 17s. a week for their houses.</P>
    <P>I know the slum problem pretty well.  I have heard authorities talk about it all my life, but up to the present I have seen very little diminution so far as the slums in this city, at any rate, are concerned.  I think that under these sweepstakes opportunity ought to be taken to ear-mark a portion of the money to be applied towards the abolition of slums in the country generally.  I contend that can be done under Section 6 of the Bill where the Minister is given power to ear-mark money for the prevention of disease.  I think that Senator Gogarty or any other medical man in the country will agree with me that the slums are almost entirely responsible for disease in the country and for the overcrowding of our hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like a good many other Senators, I look upon Section 6 as an important part of the Bill.  How <Col N="1104" /> it will be administered in practice will depend almost entirely on the Minister. Although I cannot speak with authority, like some other members of the House, perhaps it is just as well that the Minister should know how the matter strikes a man like myself who has been in no way associated with the initiation of the sweepstake movement or with any particular hospital or set of hospitals.  I am just interested in the subject generally.  I find myself very largely in agreement with much of what Senator Gogarty said.  Much of what he said has been before my mind, but after hearing him I am all the more strongly convinced that there is great danger of waste in spending a large amount of this money in equipping rate-aided hospitals.  The advantage of concentration in the effort to deal with disease must, I think, appeal to Senators, particularly in complicated matters of surgery and medicine.  Concentration in dealing with these cases is very important, because a man who has only one case of a kind once a year or over several years cannot possibly give the same amount of relief to human misery as a man who is constantly treating them and thereby becomes an expert.</P>
      <P>I think it would be a great pity if a large amount of the money was spent in equipping those rate-aided hospitals in such a way as to encourage them, so to speak, to attempt treating cases which really had better go to the centre where the expert is to be found, to the man who has great experience in dealing with cases of a special kind. As far as I can see, the Minister is not compelled under the section to spend the whole of that money.  A great deal of discretion is left to him. I hope he will bear in mind what has been said about the danger of dissipating the money in directions in which it may not do as much good as if it were spent at a centre where we know the greatest skill is to be found.</P>

      <P>This debate has taken a very wide range.  It has gone from surgeons to slums, and from slums to hospitals.  I propose to deal with the Bill before the House, and I am sorry <Col N="1105" /> to say that on a fundamental point I differ from the Minister.  In my judgment the Bill introduces a new principle of the first magnitude.  I oppose it, as I opposed the original Bill, which is now the Principal Act. The original measure empowered sweepstakes to be run in aid of voluntary hospitals.  I did not oppose it on any moral ground.  I opposed it on the ground that in so far as the money would be collected in Ireland, it was a most expensive way of raising revenue, and in so far as the money would be collected abroad, it was eminently calculated to create difficulties with other countries.  I have never doubted for a moment that the scheme for a lottery or sweepstake would be the tremendous success it has been, but I think I am borne out by the facts when I say that so far as our relations with other countries are concerned this is a matter which is likely to cause irritation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>And I am.  Therefore, I say that even in relation to sweepstakes for the voluntary hospitals it was a matter that was not politic.  I say now that in relation to hospitals which are poor law hospitals, the evil is much greater.  Here you have the Government not merely lending the prestige of their authority to sweepstakes, but you have them really participating in the proceeds of these sweepstakes.  The Minister, I think, has very fairly stated the position in regard to that.  No doubt, under the terms of the section the money to be devoted to these rate-aided hospitals is not to be in aid of the rates.  I accept what the Minister said.  He said that these moneys do not directly relate to rates.  They do not directly relate to present rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also agree with him when he said that the work to be done is work that ought possibly to be done out of the rates.  Therefore, what you have is a sweepstake, advertised all over the world, in aid of the public rates of this <Col N="1106" /> country.  I think that adds to the impolicy of the original Act.</P>
    <P>I do not oppose this measure on any personal ground, nor do I oppose it on any moral ground.  I oppose it on public grounds and on grounds of policy.  I desire to say that since the original Act was passed I have on every occassion made the closest and the strictest inquiry that I could into the administration of the sweepstake.  I want to say this: that so far as I could see it was conducted with absolute honesty, and, not merely with honesty, but with a kind of generosity and decorum that is certainly to be admired.  I have had tickets in the sweepstake.  I have tickets in every sweepstake.  I am by nature a gambler as much as anybody else.  I went to see the draw.  Not merely was it conducted honestly, but it was conducted with a sort of solemnity.  It was like a pagan sacrifice, with a revolving goddess and all the devotees in that darkened room looking with eager eyes and hoping that fortune might shine on them.  It was splendidly done.  It was the most decorous performance that I have seen in the City of Dublin for many years. But still I am more opposed to it than ever, because if this thing goes on, if the Ministers of other States are not irritated beyond endurance, and if these hospital sweepstakes or sweepstakes for any other purpose organised in Dublin, are allowed to continue, then this city will become the gambling centre of the English-speaking world. That is what is going to happen.</P>

      <P>Personally I look upon the general provisions of this Bill as being all right and in some cases desirable.  I do object, however, to the very undesirable and in my opinion vicious principle which has been introduced in this Bill through the medium of Section 6, namely the utilisation of the proceeds of sweeps for the relief of rates.  That is what <Col N="1107" /> the section amounts to, no matter what attempts may be made to explain it away.  The Principal Act was justified only on the grounds that it proposed to raise funds for hospitals in debt and that were maintained by voluntary subscriptions.  Voluntary subscriptions cannot be increased at the behest of those who control these voluntarily maintained institutions. Hence the proposal to raise money for them by sweeps was the only method available.  In regard to poor law hospitals they may be badly equipped and badly staffed, but that is because the authorities responsible for the financing of them will not levy the rate necessary for their upkeep, because they have no real interest in hospitals at all, or because they will not risk unpopularity by raising a rate sufficient for the purpose.  Everyone knows that all important operations are performed in the different hospitals in the City of Dublin, and that will go on no matter how the little local hospitals are endowed.</P>
      <P>Probably most of the patients in these hospitals come from the districts that are most reluctant to raise a rate sufficient to maintain their own district hospitals in a proper state of efficiency. It is this sort of mentality that Section 6 panders to&mdash;devoting one-third of the total money available to the upkeep of these hospitals, and hence to the reduction of the rate necessary for their proper upkeep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is certainly a novel procedure to find a body like Hospitals Trust, Ltd. collecting money all over the world and handing over a large proportion of it to a Minister of State, who himself takes no responsibility for the collection, for division among the local hospitals throughout the country.  We are told that this money is not going to be used for the relief of rates.  In actual working out, that is mere eye-wash.  After the first year it will be impossible for the Minister to ensure that the grant which he gives to a particular hospital will not be used, to a large extent, for the purpose of relieving rates.  He may seek to use his powers in the case of any local authority which offends in <Col N="1108" /> this respect.  But what will the effect be?  You may have a repetition of the Mayo comedy, where everybody has given up reading because somebody's nominee was not appointed to a particular job.  You may have even the Government bigwigs in the constituency, as is happening in another place to-day, finding themselves torn between public duty and parochial popularity, and the Minister's action will be absolutely nullified.  Moreover, this new development is going to make it well-nigh impossible to make the scheme a success in those countries from which the great bulk of the money is coming at present.  Certain States have been singularly tolerant of what has been a flagrant violation of their laws up to the present.  Now, we are going, knowingly and deliberately, to throw down another challenge to them&mdash;to tell the world that we are going to raise money in other countries for derating purposes here.  This will eventually drive those Governments to administer the law in such a manner as will bring the citizens to their senses.  You will, in that way, be drying up the source from which this stream of gold has come up to the present.  The next proposal will probably be that we run a sweep for the payment of old age pensions and &lsquo;relieve the State of that burden, or run a sweep for the upkeep of lunatic asylums, the cost of the upkeep of which generally falls on the public rates.  I can quite understand Deputies being exceedingly generous with money that does not belong to them. We should take a different view.  A Deputy can only afford to look so far as the next general election.  He has, of course, the local Press, the local authorities in his constituency, and, above all, the local ratepayers to consider. If he can relieve them of a burden, from whatever source the money may come, he is carrying out what is considered a good political deal for himself.  If this House can do anything to justify its existence, it would be to prevent such a policy as this creeping into a Bill of this kind, seeing that the ultimate result of it must be to deprive this country of a considerable amount of money which <Col N="1109" /> might otherwise be obtained, and which could be spent on one of the greatest causes possible&mdash;the development of medicine and the relief of human suffering.  I do hope that we shall not endorse that particular section of the Bill when it comes to be dealt with in Committee.  Senator Gogarty and others have pointed out that, in any case, the local hospitals will never be able to deal with major operations, never be able to deal with the vast proportion of the work which is being done here at present.  The adoption of this principle is simply going to create difficulties in other countries where the money is being raised, and, in the long run, we will find that the bone over which we are now fighting shall have disappeared altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasToal" hpid="Mr. Toal Mr. Toal">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Minister will not pay any attention to the attempt that is being made here to centralise everything and to ensure that the rural population will get no benefits from sweepstakes or anything else. Attempts have been made to show that the rural population will use this money for the relief of rates.  I was very much surprised to hear the last speaker proceed on the lines he did, knowing, as he does, the great hardships that we suffer in the matter of hospital accommodation in the country. No man knows better than he does the number of railway officials who have suffered owing to the want of hospital accommodation.  Time after time accidents have occurred at railway stations, and if proper hospital accommodation had been available locally, the lives of the unfortunate men might, perhaps, have been saved.  But they had to be carted off to the City of Dublin or Belfast, or some other large centre before they could obtain relief.  The provision in this Bill is an attempt to equip county hospitals, not for the relief of rates, but to enable major operations to be performed in them.  Take the county in which I reside.  There have been hundreds and hundreds of major operations performed there.  They have been performed only under difficult circumstances and without proper equipment.  An attempt is being made <Col N="1110" /> now to equip that county hospital with x-ray and other apparatus so that the performance of serious operations will not be attended with so much difficulty.  The money will be spent on capital improvements and not on relief of rates.  We are always prepared to subscribe the necessary funds from the rates for the maintenance of the hospitals, but in poor districts we are not in a position to supply the up-to-date equipment which the hospitals in the City of Dublin possess.</P>
      <P>It would appear from statements made here to-day by a number of Senators that everything should be centralised in Dublin.  Surely the people of Dublin should be satisfied with the amount of money that is pouring into the city day after day from the rural areas.  The whole flow of money seems to be towards the City of Dublin.  Yet representatives of the City of Dublin will not tolerate the raising of their voices by Senators or Deputies seeking for fair play for the rural districts, which have done so much to place the City of Dublin in the position it occupies to-day.  I think it comes very badly from Senators to try to prevent the poorer districts from getting the accommodation that is necessary in their hospitals by means of these sweepstakes.  They should realise that a great deal of the money of Dublin is coming from the rural areas and the provincial towns, and they should not try to collar and capture all the money available.  I hope the Minister will not give any attention to the attempt made here to centralise everything in Dublin.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to intervene in this debate at all, but it appears to me <Col N="1111" /> that Section 6 is a very serious one in connection with the entire sweepstake scheme, and I should like to add my voice to the chorus of disapproval. There are two points to be considered. In the first place, the Minister has powers which are not precisely laid down.  No doubt, he will administer them properly, but I think that sub-section (a) is extremely loosely worded. The second point, and the more important one, is that the money to be applied shall not be in substitution of rates.  It is extremely difficult to do that.  Let us assume that a particular hospital is not up to the standard of some of the other hospitals in the country.  The Minister, in dividing this money, gives to that hospital something over and above the normal cost of maintenance during the last five or six years to bring it up to that standard. That is nothing but relief of a rate which should have been struck in the years before and was not struck. According to the Poor Law Report, several of these hospitals were in a disgraceful state.  Suppose one of these hospitals in former years wanted to be placed on a proper basis.  It could have applied to the Minister for a loan and would have got, no doubt, a grant equal to the amount of money it borrowed.  If it did not do so, and if a grant is made now out of this money, no matter what you call it, that grant goes in relief of a rate which should have been struck before and was not struck.  I think that the whole of that paragraph should be struck out on the Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardBigger" hpid="Sir Edward Coey Bigger Sir Edward Coey Bigger">
      <NameTxt>Sir Edward Coey Bigger</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister deserves credit for bringing forward this amending Bill, because it gives the House an opportunity of considering the whole matter in the light of the experience gained since the Principal Act was passed last year. Section 3 provides for the appointment of a Committee of Reference for the purpose of this scheme and the sweepstake to which it relates.  Section 5 lays down the duties of the Committee which is required to report to the Minister as to the proportions in which the two-thirds of the available surplus <Col N="1112" /> should be divided between the governing bodies of the hospitals concerned. Then it goes on to state:</P>
      <P>for the purpose of making the report to the Minister under the foregoing paragraph of this section, such Committee of Reference may visit all or any of the premises of any of such hospitals and shall be entitled to inspect and examine such premises and the fittings and equipment thereof, and shall also be entitled to call for and be furnished with full information in relation to the management and the financial position of any such hospital and to see and examine all accounts of the receipts and expenditure of the governing body of any such hospital and also all or any books and other documents containing any record of such receipts or expenditure.</P>
      <P>Although these matters may be supposed to cover the essential requirements of the hospital, there are many others of equal importance which are not mentioned, such as the adequacy of the medical and nursing staffs, the number of free patients, whether the hospitals provide for extern patients, etc.  To carry out such an inquiry would require trained persons, together with one or more accountants. It might be of some service&mdash;which I very much doubt&mdash;if the sweepstakes were to be a permanent source of revenue to the hospitals.  But the Principal Act only runs for three years, and most of this time would be taken up by the Committee before it could report.  It would cost a great deal, and it would raise all sorts of difficulties but would produce nothing tangible or nothing that could be of any real assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister for this proposal, but I do blame his adviser. I do not know who he was, so I can speak without being personal.  I cannot help saying, however, that he knows nothing about what he has suggested, and could have had no experience of such work.  The committee of every hospital should know what improvements and additional equipment and apparatus they require, and they would resent being told what they <Col N="1113" /> should do.  I spent ten years visiting and reporting on the hospitals in this country, and have visited every hospital in Ireland, even to the small cottage hospitals, so that I ought to know what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>The hospitals all differ from one another in various ways.  What is necessary in one hospital may not be required in another.  One hospital may require their operation theatre to be enlarged or improved, or their sanitary arrangements improved.  Another may require the accommodation for their nursing staff to be enlarged or the cooking or laundry arrangements to be improved.  It appears to me that it would be infinitely better and more satisfactory to everyone if a small committee of, say, seven or eight persons was appointed to go fully into the matter and draw up a scheme on which the division of the two-thirds would be made.  There should be representatives on this committee from Cork and Limerick.  Some years ago the Irish portion of the Prince of Wales's Fund was distributed between all the voluntary hospitals in Ireland by a committee, of which the Master of the Rolls, Rt. Hon. Charles O'Connor, was Chairman.  The Rt. Hon Laurence Waldron was also a member, together with representatives from Cork and Belfast.  This committee considered the best lines to go on and unanimously agreed to a formula, with the result that the fund, amounting to many thousands of pounds, was distributed without a single complaint.</P>
    <P>If the sweepstakes for the next three years are as successful as they have been, there would be available about £4,000,000 for the Free State hospitals. This amount would be sufficient to reorganise the whole hospital system. There are too many hospitals in Dublin, and some could be amalgamated. There are three hospitals in Cork and three in Limerick, all of which treat the same class of patients. It would be a great benefit if some of them were also amalgamated.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which should be carefully considered and, if possible, provided for&mdash;that is, the need for better hospital accommodation for those with moderate means <Col N="1114" /> who cannot pay the usual professional and nursing fees charged in private nursing homes.  Some of the hospitals might wish to provide such accommodation, in which case they might receive special grants.  As the amount of money available is far more than was ever anticipated, it should be applied to bringing about lasting improvements for the benefit of the whole of the Free State.  Such an opportunity for reorganising the whole hospital system may never occur again, and it would be a disaster not to take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that one-third of the available surplus shall be paid to the Minister for Local Government and shall be applied by him in such manner as he shall think fit in or towards the provision, improvement or equipment of institutions.  It will be noticed that this section is drafted on quite different lines from Section 5, although both are dealing with the available surplus.  This section shows a different mentality and outlook, which is absent as regards the two-thirds surplus.</P>
    <P>I feel sure the Minister for Local Government will bring about a vast improvement in the county infirmaries and will use the money to the best advantage.  The poor law hospitals have been mentioned several times, but I hope the Minister will spend money on county infirmaries, which are old institutions.  I also deprecate the equipping of hospitals for doing large major operations.  Large major operations should be done where there is the best skill.  It is not merely a matter of picking out an hospital; it is the skill more than all of the surgeons and the person who has experience in dealing with such cases.  As far as possible those cases should come to Dublin, Limerick, Cork or Waterford, four county boroughs in the Free State.  Each of those boroughs should be provided with proper hospital accommodation and made really up-to-date institutions.  There are three hospitals in Limerick, not one of them properly fitted up or equipped.</P>
    <P>There are very few hospitals in Ireland which do not receive contributions <Col N="1115" /> from the State or the local authorities, and in this way the Minister for Local Government has a certain amount of responsibility regarding them, and I think he should be more closely associated with the whole scheme.  I suggest the formation of larger committees and that the whole matter should be gone into fully before any money is expended at all. The whole hospital system of the Free State can be reorganised and coordinated. Special provision could be made for amalgamating some of the hospitals and, if necessary, adding to existing hospitals, or building new ones to take the place of those amalgamated. Provision could be made to add accommodation to some of the hospitals for patients of moderate means.</P>
    <P>When I speak of co-ordinating hospitals I refer particularly to the colonies, Canada and Australia, where large hospitals are linked up with smaller ones, and they have a perfect system of sending operations from the smaller to the larger hospitals where they can get proper treatment and attention. I do not see why a county infirmary should be equipped with an x-ray or other expensive apparatus. It takes persons of skill to keep this apparatus in order.  There should be special provision made for the amalgamation of some of the hospitals and, if necessary, adding to the existing hospitals or building new ones.  Provision should also be made for patients whose means are restricted.  We may never have such an opportunity for improving our hospital system, and it will show a great want of organising and administrative ability if it is lost.</P>

      <P>I come from the country.  I represent some of the county hospitals on the Hospitals Committee here in Dublin.  I must join in the general chorus of condemnation which I think Section 6 has met with in this Seanad.  The discussion seems to have been following the supposition that country hospitals at the present time could not come in.  That is not so.  I represent one hospital, the County Limerick , which <Col N="1116" /> has participated in several of these sweeps, and if this Bill is framed in such a way as to admit any hospitals which it was desirable to admit, I think there would be no necessity for this Section 6.  Section 6 is open to a great many objections.  It will in all probability provide a certain amount of money which will be used in the country hospitals, and I think that what Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger has said about the co-ordination of the hospitals would meet the case.  If these country hospitals are permitted to come in under the existing Bill and are permitted to share in the way we have shared in the past I think the case would be met.</P>

      <P>When the original Act was before the House I supported it without any qualms whatsoever, and on that occasion, if I remember rightly, the Government refused to accept any responsibility for the measure that they had introduced on the ground that it would vitiate public life.  But the position has altered.  The Government have brought in this Bill, which I support with the exception of Section 6.  Not merely do they accept responsibility for this Bill but they accept part of the money raised for de-rating hospitals.  I am opposed to that, for, as many of the speakers pointed out, it is a bad principle.  Like Senator The McGillycuddy of the Reeks, I fail to see how the administration of that section can be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The organisation of medical services in the country has been pushed very well indeed, I must say as a layman. It comprises the appointment of medical officers of health in different counties.  I do not know what co-ordination exists among them, but I visualise the possibility of these men having under their control in their areas such hospitals as would reflect credit on their administration.  I take, for instance, a medical officer of health in a particular county who advocates the setting up of x-ray apparatus in a particular hospital. As far as I am aware, the Local Government Department does not insist on <Col N="1117" /> the local body striking a rate to instal any equipment that the medical officer recommends, and if they refuse to strike that rate the hospital will not get the apparatus it needs.  Say, on the other hand, that in another county the medical officer recommends the setting up of such equipment and a rate is struck and the equipment installed. In a few years, under this section, certain counties will be well equipped pursuant to the suggestions of the present medical officers of health, but other counties will not be so well off.  Then the Minister for Local Government will be forced into the position of giving to these counties that would not strike the rate a portion of this surplus in order that the hospitals may be well equipped and brought to the same standard.  I contend in so doing he will be relieving the rates, and the section as at present framed must eventuate in the relief of rates in certain areas.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (a) of sub-section (2), the Minister for Local Government is placed in the position of laying down such conditions as he thinks fit to impose without any reference to these conditions.  I suggest to the Minister that the Bill would have an easy passage through this House if the section were struck out altogether, or to take out of it that principle against which there is such opposition as was evidenced here to-day.  If this Bill is put to the House, I intend to vote for the Second Reading, but I intend to oppose Section 6 at every stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>When the original Act was introduced I opposed it, and I think my chief opposition was on the ground that it was practically asking this State to throw the burden of maintaining such hospitals upon subscribers in other lands.  This State was established as the result of a long agitation in the cause of self-reliance or, in other words, Sinn Féin, and that imposes upon the community in the country the condition to look after its own poor.  The establishment and wide development of the sweepstake system means practically a throwing-off of that responsibility and imposing on the people of other countries the task <Col N="1118" /> of providing the money which will maintain and sustain the hospitals in this country.  The scheme has been entirely successful, more successful than anyone anticipated, and I am wondering whether we have not raised a gold-plated Frankenstein which is going to cause more trouble than the value of the benefits.</P>
      <P>One of the immediate causes of the initiation of the scheme was the fact that the hospitals were in need; that there was little prospect of raising the money by the ordinary process of voluntary contribution, and that the governing boards of hospitals, and the doctors particularly, were opposed to anything in the nature of State assistance, because they feared that State moneys would involve the interference by the State authorities in the management of their affairs.  Time and time again it was stated that they must not allow State assistance because of the risk of State intervention in the management of the hospitals, and on the introduction of the original Bill it was insisted, time and time again, as has been pointed out by the Minister, that he was not taking any responsibility for the hospitals, or for the scheme.  He was going to do his best to ensure that the scheme would be fraud-proof, but that was the extent of his responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we come to the amending Bill, in which we find two sections, Nos. 5 and 6, both of which involve a very definite interference by the Minister or two Ministers in the affairs of the hospitals which are to be supported by the sweepstakes scheme.  What are the doctors saying about this? I wonder has the Minister consulted with the doctors and the governing bodies of the hospitals in introducing this Bill, and have they renounced their old opposition to State intervention? I noted the Minister speaking of the importance of having some check upon the way moneys are spent, and therefore, he was proposing to set up a committee which, according to Section 5, would examine the way the hospitals were conducting their affairs, inspect their premises, the fittings and equipment, thereof, and report <Col N="1119" /> to the Minister.  After receiving that report the Minister would determine the proportions in which two-thirds was to be divided amongst them.  This is a point that I am not positive about.  It would appear to me that according to the original Act the proportions were to be prepared and agreed to by the Minister in the first instance, and under Section 3 of the Bill it provides that when the scheme is sanctioned by the Minister he will appoint three members of the committee, so that we will have a scheme which contains the provision regarding the proportions in which the hospitals will receive the proceeds.  We will have that scheme sanctioned by the Minister, and afterwards the Minister is to appoint a committee to examine into the affairs of the hospitals.  I draw his attention to that; it appears that there is a contradiction.</P>
    <P>I am not quite at one with my colleagues with regard to Section 6 and the new principle regarding rate-aided hospitals, because the whole of the Bill implies that the money that is to be received in future for the new schemes is going to be held by the Minister until he is satisfied that the hospitals are conducting themselves in a way he would think wise, and I do not see any very great distinction between the moneys received in this way under this Bill for the private hospitals, voluntary hospitals, and moneys received in the same way and paid over to the Minister for Local Government for distribution by him.  It seems to me that the distinction between persons going to public hospitals administered under the poor law, or asylums, and people going to private hospitals which are run by private management committees but which have moneys at the discretion of the Minister for Justice is very thin indeed, and I can only suggest that if we are prepared to sanction Section 5 we ought to be prepared to sanction Section 6.  The two ought to be made one, and instead of bringing two Ministers into it one would suffice.</P>
    <P>I do not think there should be a rigid distinction between the Minister for Justice having a say in the management <Col N="1120" /> and control of the private hospitals and the Minister for Local Government having control of the public hospitals, which are both to be financed, in part at any rate, out of the money subscribed by the people of other countries.  I do not know whether Senators are aware that a proposal was made in 1922 for the setting up in this country of a casino or kursaal. It was being promoted, and the hope was very confidently expressed by some that the Provisional Government at the time would give its benediction to the scheme.  The inducement was that a proportion of the takings of this gaming house, to which the visitors were to be attracted from across the water, was to be handed over to the State to provide money for hospitals. It may also be remembered that that scheme was frowned upon, opposed, and finally collapsed on the ground that it was inadvisable for this State to depend upon this method of raising money.  We are several years older and apparently the keen, acute conscience of that time has been somewhat dulled and we are not so much averse now to financing our philanthropic institutions, our necessary social institutions, by an appeal to the cupidity of people in other lands.  If we are doing that, if we are proposing for the next three years to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds, perhaps millions, for the purpose of financing public hospitals in this country, it would seem to me that we should not draw any fine distinction between hospitals that are going to be managed under poor law institutions and hospitals that are managed by private governing bodies, both of which are receiving their funds from the same sources and both of which are submitting to a Governmental inspection and intervention in the management of their affairs.</P>
    <P>I would like to express agreement with the general tendency of the argument submitted by Senator Sir E. Coey Bigger, and what seems to be the inevitable conclusion of all this discussion and this scheme of hospital financing&mdash;that is to say, that we have definitely parted from the notion that hospitals are private institutions run <Col N="1121" /> for private interests, whether these private interests are money-making or training grounds for doctors, or whether any persons can come together and decide to set up a hospital and then go to the public for support.  I think it is quite evident that there has to be a new method.  That new method must involve public financial assistance and some assurance that the moneys provided are going to be spent in accordance with a definite plan and design.  I do not for a moment think that the hospitals ought to be conducted as a Government department would be conducted.  I do hope that the poor law hospitals will come under a new kind of control and supervision.</P>
    <P>I think there ought to be some general scheme of organisation so that the whole of the hospitals, whether under poor law authorities, as at present, or under private management, would have some kind of relation, one to the other, and be run in such a way that they will assist one another and cater for the ills that human flesh is heir to.  It can only be done in something like an organised fashion, because it is evident from all one reads that one of the great needs is scientific equipment, which costs a great deal of money and very close training and care.  That requires, especially in a sparsely-populated country, something in the nature of plan and organisation, and it therefore involves something in the nature of centralisation.  I hope it will not be lost sight of that the scheme of this Bill involves Governmental check, Governmental intervention and interference with the management of the hospitals which are to receive moneys out of this fund.  Once the hospitals accept that proposition they have given away for ever their old insistence upon the necessity of maintaining hospitals as purely private institutions.</P>

      <P>The words with which Senator Johnson closed his speech were that this Bill establishes Governmental interference in the management of hospitals.  It does nothing of the kind.  It simply says a committee will decide how a certain sum of money shall be divided <Col N="1122" /> amongst certain hospitals in proportion to their needs.  It does not bring any Government department into the management of the hospitals. Senator Johnson also talked a great deal about a casino, and he said that at one time the national conscience would not allow a casino, but now it allows sweepstakes.  I see the utmost difference between a casino and a sweepstake.  I need not labour the point now.  I think it is perfectly obvious; but if Senator Johnson cannot see that distinction by himself unaided, I will not be able to make it clear to his comprehension.  Of course, there is all the difference in the world between a casino into which persons go and gamble to an unlimited extent &mdash;they are encouraged to go in and gamble&mdash;and a sweepstake.  Apart altogether from the gambling, one must take into consideration the surroundings and the atmosphere of a casino.  Gambling at a casino would be completely different from, let us say, a person like Senator Comyn spending 10/- on a sweepstake ticket.  If the Senator's revolving goddess revolves the wrong way and he gets nothing he goes away disappointed, but he is not as mentally or morally damaged as he would be if he were to spend the night, say from 10 o'clock until 5 o'clock the next morning, indulging in the delights of a casino.  Of course, I know the Senator would not do that.</P>

      <P>Senator Vincent said he hoped the hospitals would set aside a capital sum.  I hope they will.  I ventured to say in the Dáil that I thought a hospital which was getting money out of the sweepstakes and did not lay aside a sufficient sum that would produce annually at least half its voluntary income would be acting extraordinarily foolishly.  I think the hospitals took on a very great gamble when they started sweepstakes. When they decided on getting support from sweepstakes, to a very large extent they destroyed for all time voluntary subscriptions. <Col N="1123" /> Although they have not completely destroyed the voluntary subscriptions, I am sure they will have cut them down by one-half, and they should have a capital sum laid aside to meet the depreciation in voluntary subscriptions which is bound to follow and which has already to a very large extent followed upon the establishment of hospital sweepstakes.</P>
      <P>Senator Connolly asked me about the accounts of the Hospitals Trust, Ltd. I have nothing whatever to do with the Trust, and I have nothing to do with the working of the hospital scheme in any way.  The Hospital Committee planned their own scheme; they did everything necessary for the running of the scheme, and they sent accounts to every member of the Oireachtas, to Senator Connolly just as they sent them to me.  All that is done under Section 6 of the original Act.  If Senator Connolly is not satisfied with these accounts, I have no more to do with them than he has.  Senator Connolly asked whether this money would be distributed by the Minister for Local Government on a county basis.  That would be impossible, because some of the county hospitals, such as Louth and Waterford, have received large sums because they have come in amongst the hospitals which benefited under the voluntary side of the scheme, as I may call it, and naturally they could not now expect to share with those counties the infirmaries in which have received no benefit; they could not expect to share with the counties where there are infirmaries and union hospitals which received no benefit so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Foran referred to slums; he said that there should be some relief given to the slum areas, and he thought that that would be most desirable.  I quite agree that the slum problem is a very serious problem; it is a problem that everybody wishes to see solved. But this Bill is for the benefit of hospitals, and if there were to be sweepstakes for the benefit of the slums it would mean the introduction of an entirely new principle and a new Bill would have to be introduced.  I may say that  whole lot of institutions which are <Col N="1124" /> not hospitals have endeavoured to be included in this Bill.  People who are interested in a great number of things, such as Jubilee nurses and other excellent bodies of that nature, have also been anxious to participate.  It must be clearly understood that this is a hospital scheme and it can only be applied to hospitals.</P>
    <P>Section 6 was attacked by Senators O'Farrell, Esmonde and The McGillycuddy of the Reeks, and I think it was defended by Senator Toal.  If one reads that section I think one will see, in the first place, that complete discretion is given to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. It is not necessary that the money he provides for the benefit of hospitals should go to any particular class of hospital.  He is given unfettered judgment, but the money shall not be given to hospitals where, in effect, the giving of it would be in relief of local rates. We have heard a great deal of attacks upon county infirmaries and local hospitals. We have been told that no patients ought to be treated in local hospitals; they should all come to a central hospital.  That may be a most beautiful theory, but the persons who put it forward are, to my mind, absolutely complete theorists and nothing else.  We know that at present people are being treated in county hospitals. The overwhelming majority of county patients are being treated in their own county hospitals, and we know that that practice will continue.  We know that they are going to be treated there, and the question we have to decide is: Are they going to be treated in proper surroundings and with adequate equipment?</P>
    <P>To say that there should be only one hospital in all Ireland and that that hospital should be in the County Dublin is going rather a long way. That would mean that a person suffering from a serious disease requiring an immediate operation would have to be brought without delay to Dublin.  That person might be living forty to fifty miles from a railway station.  He would have to be conveyed to the station, and then brought to Dublin.  Imagine the suffering <Col N="1125" /> that person would undergo before he would be operated on, and take into consideration also the great delay in transit.  The suggestion of a central hospital conveys the impression that it would be improper and undignified for any local surgeon who is not a complete specialist to operate on the patient.  That does not commend itself to me.  We are told that this is really a relief of rates.  It is not a relief of rates.  We know in fact, that the rates will not be lessened by one halfpenny by the passing of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The rates will not be lessened in the least.  We know that there are county hospitals in need of modern equipment.  Everybody who knows the country is aware that that is a fact, and is also aware that there is no likely source from which the hospitals could get sufficient money to instal this equipment. The question is: Should they get it from any source?  We say: &ldquo;Yes, let them get it from the Hospital Sweeps Fund just as the voluntary hospitals got money from the Fund.&rdquo;  If Senator O'Farrell wished to press his point to its logical conclusion, he might rule out almost all the Dublin hospitals, and any hospitals that ever received this aid.  Facts are what I am interested in, not mere theories. We know as a fact that these hospitals that are largely, some of them entirely, maintained out of the rates, are in need of improvement, and we know that they will never have that improvement unless money comes from some outside source.  It is to give them that money that we make this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to make provision for the registration and control of veterinary surgeons, and for other purposes relating to the practice of veterinary surgery and veterinary medicine and the persons engaged in such practice.  It is a Bill which is relatively simple; very simple, indeed, in comparison with similar measures introduced to regulate the registration and control of medical practitioners and dental practitioners in this country.  The main portion of the Bill sets up a Council, and gives that Council certain control over the registration and the professional practice of people on the register.  It gives certain charging powers, arranges for representation in a particular way, and establishes the profession in a regular way, making it illegal for anybody not on the register either to hold himself out as entitled to practise, or, in fact, to practise.  At the moment there is no method of either regulating or controlling veterinary surgeons in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, when passed, and a corresponding measure which will have to be passed elsewhere, will validate certain diplomas which have been granted on foot of certain examinations held without very much in the way of legal authority since the establishment of the Free State.  In addition, the Bill confirms an agreement which forms the first schedule to it.  This agreement is very much on the lines of the agreements previously entered into in connection with the medical and dental <Col N="1127" /> practitioners.  The differences in this agreement as distinct from the other two agreements come rather from the nature of the veterinary control as heretofore existing in the country.  In the case of medicine there were institutions recognised as teaching institutions entitled to give diplomas.  In the case of veterinary surgeons, there was only one, and that was the college recognised as being part of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.</P>
    <P>This agreement may be described as simply allowing the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons to establish a centre for the holding of their examinations here and to validate that holding.  In consideration of that the people who pass that examination will be entitled to have the diploma M.R.C.V.S. conferred on them to practise outside this country or wherever that degree gives power to practise.</P>
    <P>There is the further consideration in the other way, that those who take that degree, whether obtained here or elsewhere, will be entitled to go on our register and practise in this country. The Bill looks to the establishment of a diploma-conferring corporation in this country.  This Bill would have been delayed until that corporation was in being only for the fact that examinations already held in a somewhat irregular fashion had to be validated.  Those holding examinations complain very seriously of the delay occasioned even to date.  It was feared that the whole examination system might have broken down if this measure was not introduced.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the present Veterinary College should be handed over to the Dublin College of the National University, and that the University should be empowered to confer diplomas entitling to practise in this country.  The examination that will be held for that purpose will be somewhat similar to but may differ entirely from the examination held for the purpose of obtaining the M.R.C.V.S.  That, however, will arise in a later measure.</P>

      <P>I agree that some legislation is necessary in this country to regulate and control the profession of veterinary surgeons in view of the various changes that have taken place in recent years.  From what I know of the subject, this seems to be an excellent Bill.  There is, however, one provision in it which seems to me to be of doubtful wisdom.  It arises under Section 23.  It appears to me to make the Minister for Agriculture virtually the administrative chief of the Veterinary Council.  I think that would be undersirable and might lead to a lot of trouble.  The point is really a Committee one and can be dealt with later. I refer to it now so that the Minister may have an opportunity of considering it before we take the Committee Stage of the Bill.  If the words &ldquo;is authorised&rdquo; were taken out of the section it would meet my point.  I think it is right that the Minister should be given power to compel the Council to do everything they are required to do under the Bill, but that he should be put into a position to give them orders to carry out what they are authorised to do would really make him the virtual head of the supreme council of veterinary opinion in the country.  I doubt whether that would be a desirable position, and possibly it may not be intended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most important Bill.  It is essential that our veterinary surgeons should possess the highest qualifications and should be people of the highest integrity and honour.  It is important, too, I think that there should be harmony and co-operation between the Council to be set up under the Bill and the College of Veterinary Surgeons.  During the past two years the British Government have spent millions of money in trying to maintain a clean bill of health for their livestock.  In view of the enormous quantity of livestock that we export to Great Britain I am sure everyone will agree that there should be the greatest co-operation and harmony between the two bodies, the one operating here and the one at the other side. If we had an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in this country and <Col N="1129" /> there was any friction between our veterinary surgeons and the Department of Agriculture and between the Department of Agriculture in England and their veterinary surgeons it would place us in a very awkward position. They might place an embargo on our cattle as they did three or four years age, and then when they did let them in, unless they had confidence in the ability of our veterinary surgeons, they might hold the cattle in quarantine, a thing which would be ruinous to the livestock trade of this country.</P>
      <P>I do not think anyone can object to this Bill.  When originally introduced in the Dáil objection was made to certain provisions in it and these were eliminated.  Section 45 is the only one that I am not quite satisfied with. When we reach the Committee Stage I think the Minister might consider inserting in it certain words which would make it quite clear that farmers, their servants or herds can, without fear of prosecution, attend to livestock, that they can even perform surgical operations and treat the cattle with medicine and in other ways.  As the section stands it is not quite clear that they can perform these operations without rendering themselves liable to prosecution. I hope the Minister will agree to an amendment rendering them immune from such prosecution and that they will have a perfect right to treat their own livestock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the main principle of the Bill I am in agreement. Section 46 is the only one to which I take any exception.  It limits, to a certain extent, the option of farmers or stockowners to employ certain persons to treat their cattle.  I observe that the Bill as originally introduced has been considerably modified and improved in that respect.  There is, however, in my opinion, room for further improvement. Under the Bill as it stands, a farmer is entitled to employ somebody who is not a veterinary surgeon provided he is a farmer, that he is a person who habitually keeps animals for profit, or the servant of any such person. If he does not happen to come under any of these categories, and if a <Col N="1130" /> farmer calls upon him to treat his cattle, that person will be liable to a penalty of £100.  I suggest that that condition should be wiped out and that the farmer should be entitled to call in any person to treat his cattle provided that he does not represent himself as being a veterinary surgeon and does not claim the right to recover fees for what he does.  I will give an example of what may happen if such an amendment is not inserted.  There is one disease that farmers' animals suffer frequently from, especially young horses.  They take gravel in their hoofs. It enters between the quick and the hoof and causes an abscess.  The only remedy for it is to get a blacksmith to open up the hoof and free the matter.  Even if a veterinary surgeon is called in all he can do is to tell the farmer to take the horse to the forge and get the smith to see to it.  Under the section as it stands the blacksmith would be liable to a penalty of £100 if he attempted to treat a farmer's horse suffering from gravel in the hoof. I think if the Minister considers the matter he will hardly keep that section as it is in the Bill.  I suggest to him that he should remove such a useless condition as that, but retain the other condition that the man is not to represent himself as a veterinary surgeon and will not be entitled to recover any fee for what he has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct attention to exactly the same point that Senator Linehan has touched upon. The Bill, so far as it attempts to make the position of veterinary surgeons under the new political conditions satisfactory&mdash;that is to say, to regularise the position of veterinary surgeons&mdash;is worthy of support.  I am not going to deal with the details of the Agreement between the two Governments in that respect, but it is clear that the main purpose of the Bill is to place the veterinary surgeons of this country in relatively the identical position they were in before the Treaty.  Why the Minister should introduce new powers and give new privileges to veterinary surgeons I do not know.  So far as I have read the debates that took place on the Bill in <Col N="1131" /> the other House, there has been no justification uttered in favour of the proposal to extend the powers and privileges of the College of Veterinary Surgeons.</P>
      <P>In dealing with this Bill it is just as well, perhaps, to start at the beginning. To show what is the position of veterinary surgery in this country, let me say that, according to the census of occupation, there are 294 veterinary surgeons, of whom 65 reside in Dublin City and County.  That is to say, these 229 people outside of Dublin are going to be granted the privilege of attending and caring the whole livestock of the country.  For instance, in the County of Offaly there is one veterinary surgeon.  You have there 5,500 farmers, 12,000 horses, 96,000 cattle, and 55,000 sheep.  Therefore, what we are asked to say is that all the livestock and horses in that county are to be placed in the care of one veterinary surgeon, except that possibly a farmer or a farmer's man may be allowed to do work which is supposed to be the privilege of a veterinary surgeon.  But this question goes a little further.  As Senator Linehan has pointed out, the Bill, as originally introduced, aimed at preventing anybody performing operations, administering medicine, selling medicine, or doing anything of that kind except a veterinary surgeon.  Even on the last stage of the Bill in the Dáil, when all the amendments had been gone through and pretty well agreed to and when certain modification had been made, the Minister explained that he wanted to exclude everybody except the farmer or other persons who habitually keep animals for profit or the servant of any such person, from performing such operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of a man who lives not far from the ancestral home of the Minister who is called upon by his neighbours, over a very big area, to perform simple operations, administer medicine to livestock, and so on.  I do not know whether he keeps animals for profit.  Possibly he does.  If he has not been in the habit of doing so and wants to come in under this Bill, he may now take to the breeding of <Col N="1132" /> white mice.  Therefore, there can be easy evasion of the provision.  It would be an easy thing for a man, if he wants to evade this provision of the Bill, to bring himself within it by adopting the method I have mentioned. Throughout the country there are many people who are not farmers, farmers' servants, or herds attending livestock of one kind or another.  It is inevitable that that must be so because of the very small number, proportionately, of veterinary surgeons that there are.</P>
    <P>One of the Acts referred to in this Bill is the Veterinary Surgeons (Amendment) Act, 1920.  When that measure was introduced in the British Parliament a discussion took place in reference to a new by-law that had been introduced into the regulations of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons dealing with the question of unregistered practitioners.  Occasion was taken of the introduction of the amending Bill on behalf of the Veterinary College to criticise this new by-law.  There was great danger that the Bill promoted by the Veterinary College would not be passed because of the opposition of members representing farmers, of members concerned with sport and livestock to this by-law, which appeared to prevent livestock owners from calling in the aid of unregistered practitioners.  I propose to refer to one or two speeches that were delivered when the debates took place on that Bill.  I do so for the purpose of showing that there is a certain amount of breach of promise in this section on the assumption that this section has been put in at the instigation of the veterinary surgeons.  The Minister reminded us that the Irish veterinary surgeons are part of the Royal College.  It was on behalf of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons that certain promises were made.  The British Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Boscawen), speaking in the House of Commons, said that he wanted to speak of the fully-qualified practitioner who had an assistant who was unregistered and was not fully qualified. He went on to say:</P>
    <P>There is no objection to his <Col N="1133" /> doing so.  The Government certainly has no objection, and I do not think the promoters of the Bill have any objection, provided he does not use the qualifications and status of his chief to enable him to palm himself off as a registered practitioner.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether any veterinary surgeons in this country in practice have unregistered practitioners working alongside them, but I gather from the discussions that took place in this British debate&mdash;whether it has since been remedied I cannot say&mdash;that some of the university colleges outside the supervision of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons did train persons who did not succeed in getting their diplomas.  They were unqualified practitioners, and unregistered, and yet they were allowed to practise as assistants to qualified men.  Whether there are many persons of that kind in this country I cannot say, but if there are this Bill would prevent them from acting in the treatment of live stock.</P>
    <P>The member of the House of Commons&mdash;Mr. Cautley&mdash;who spoke on behalf of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, said the College had entrusted him with the care of the Bill.  In the course of his contribution to the debate he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;None of the old Acts or the amending Acts, or any of them, touch at all the practice of operations for the doctoring of animals at all.  The power that is given to the College is to set up a teaching school to exercise disciplinary powers over its members, and it has the power to secure to those of its members who have gone through an expensive training the right of reserving to themselves the title of duly qualified veterinary surgeons.  Beyond that it gives no power, and it is open to anybody to perform these operations on animals providing they do not represent themselves as duly qualified veterinary surgeons.  This measure is a proposal, not so much for the protection of the men who are qualified, as for the protection of the public at large, and it provides <Col N="1134" /> funds for the increase of veterinary knowledge and practice and for the extension of research work.</P>
    <P>The unqualified men who perform certain operations on sheep and pigs are doing not only a useful but an important work for agriculture.  This Bill does not interfere with them in the slightest degree.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, in the House of Commons, read a letter received from the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons on this particular matter.  Portion of this letter I propose to quote.  It is dated June 1, 1920, and says:</P>
    <P>The Council hereby also undertakes that no alteration in this by-law shall be made in future without consultation, in the first instance, with the Ministry of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>That is dealing with a by-law which was withdrawn because of the criticism of those who opposed the new powers which the College of Veterinary Surgeons sought.  The letter goes on:</P>
    <P>I am at the same time to give this official assurance that there is nothing in the amendment Bill which will interfere, nor has the college any desire to interfere, with the work of unregistered persons of any description in the performance of operations on or the treatment of animals, provided they do not represent themselves to be qualified veterinary surgeons.</P>
    <P>That promise was made by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, and the letter was signed by the Secretary to the Council.  Speaker after speaker, in the later stages of that debate, made it plain that, though there was no legal obligation upon future governors of the college to abide by that promise, it was an honourable undertaking and would be maintained.  Section 46 of this Bill seems to me to be clearly a departure from that promise, given on behalf of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, in so far as their Irish <Col N="1135" /> members are concerned.  Sub-section (3) of Section 46 says:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section shall render it unlawful for any farmer or other person who habitually keeps animals for profit</P>
    <P>to do any of those things to which I have referred, but if anybody wants to perform these operations and to evade the Act all they have to do is to keep hens or dogs or any other animals and attempt to sell them.  That will be called &ldquo;keeping animals for profit.&rdquo; If it is going to be so easy to evade a provision of that kind, ought it to remain in the Bill?  If it has any value at all, it seems to me it is to give a privilege to the veterinary surgeons which they never yet had&mdash;to give them the beginnings of a monopoly of a right to treat animals.  If there were a sufficient number of qualified veterinary surgeons in the country to perform all the duties that they are called upon to perform, there might be a great deal to be said for giving this institution a monopoly of the work.  If there were a sufficient number of registered and qualified plumbers, it could be said that they should have the government of their own occupation and a monopoly of its functions.  But we have only 200 or 300 veterinary surgeons in this country and the care of all the horses, cattle, pigs and poultry is to be entrusted to them except in so far as farmers and farm servants are to be allowed to treat them.</P>

      <P>Many thousands, but in many places the particularly competent man is neither a farmer nor a farm servant.  Any person who has had experience of dealing with farmers or cattle dealers or people of that class knows that it is the odd man very often who is neither a farmer nor a farm servant who has the particular knack, capacity, ability, insight&mdash;I might almost say the natural gift&mdash;to enable him to deal with animals.  Unless that provision is deleted, you will be extending the powers and privileges of <Col N="1136" /> veterinary surgeons.  Before the Second Reading of this Bill is passed, we should have some justification by the Minister for extending this privilege to 200 or 300 veterinary surgeons.  From the point of view of real utility, there seems to be no great need for it.  It seems to be a departure from the assurance given by the College of Veterinary Surgeons, and since it is a provision which can be so easily evaded it is unwise to include it in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read this Bill and I have followed some of the debates that took place upon it.  I do not propose to deal with any element in the Bill affecting the operations of the veterinary surgeons.  I do not know anything about veterinary work or about animal diseases.  I should like, however, to ask one or two questions regarding the Schedule and to raise one or two points on it.  I do so in the hope that the Minister will be able to give a satisfactory explanation. In the first place, it seems to me regrettable that an agreement in a matter of this kind should not be made on the basis of reciprocity. What I mean by that is that such degrees as would be conferred by the Irish Veterinary College would be accepted by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, and, on the other hand, that this country would recognise the degrees granted by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  It seems to me that such an agreement might be made on the basis of reciprocity rather than leaving us entirely subject to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, as the Schedule seems to imply.  Section 2 of the Schedule is most complicated.  I think it is one long sentence from beginning to end. It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of this agreement and notwithstanding anything contained in the Irish Free State Constitution Act, 1922, or the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1922, or the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) Act, 1922, passed by the Provisional Parliament of Ireland, or the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922, passed by the <Col N="1137" /> Oireachtas of the Irish Free State or any order made under any of those Acts, the constitution of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons under the Charters and the Veterinary Surgeons Acts and the powers and duties formerly vested in or imposed on that College of holding examinations for the purpose of testing the fitness of persons to practise as veterinary surgeons ... shall be deemed not to have been affected by the establishment of the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>I shall not read the whole section. Most of you have read it and tried to digest it, and it requires some digesting. It obviously leaves us a subordinate and subject body to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  That may be inevitable.  I do not know why it should be.  I feel that, sooner or later, we ought to evolve a standard of our own in our own veterinary college. I am speaking as a layman and not from the point of view of the university or the veterinary surgeons. I claim no right to give expert opinion, but it seems to me that we ought to reserve within ourselves the right to claim a status for our own veterinary college without being subject to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  Our standard ought to be at least as high as that of England, and the most desirable way, and the most suitable way, of dealing with the matter from a national point of view would be on the basis of reciprocity. They might recognise our degrees and we might recognise theirs.  I do not want to misquote the Minister, but I think he said that this Bill was more or less on the lines of the Medical Practitioners Bill.  It will be observed from Section 2 of the First Schedule that the entire control of the examinations carried out in the Saorstát will be directly under the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say, at the outset, that I am not satisfied with this Bill.  It is suggested that this Bill goes, more or less, on the lines of the Medical Practitioners Bill.  It is desirable that medical practitioners should be registered, and should be, if you like, a very close profession, because the lives of men depend upon their skill.  When you come to deal with <Col N="1140" /> the practice of the veterinary surgeon, the subject matter is different.  I do not pretend any ignorance of agricultural processes or of farming.  I do claim to have a thorough knowledge of farming, and, for that reason, I am opposed to making the ordinary attendance on and care of animals throughout the country the special province of a close corporation.  Many a time we see a yearling or calf, worth about £5, requiring a certain amount of attention and skill either in the way of medicine or in the way of a surgical operation&mdash;say a bone-setting operation.</P>
      <P>The beast might be worth about £5. Its leg might be broken.  There might be in the parish a man who could set that bone as well as any veterinary surgeon in Ireland or Great Britain. I have known men of that class.  They have held themselves out to be persons capable of setting the bones of cattle, giving medicine to cattle, and understanding the methods of treatment of cattle.  They had no other way of living, and they made a good living out of this work.  They were quite as skilful as any veterinary surgeons I know.  I have cattle, and if any of them were sick I would be as well pleased to go to a man with long experience in the care of cattle, whether he kept animals for profit or not, as I would be to go to the county town for a veterinary surgeon.  The cost of bringing a veterinary surgeon a long distance to see an animal worth £5 or £6 would be out of all proportion to the advantage gained.  For that reason I have the strongest possible objection to Sections 45 and 46 of this Bill.  This Bill seems to have been drafted by very able and skilful men following on the lines of the Medical Practitioners Act. They are skilful on these lines, but they did not know anything whatever about the facts with which they had to deal.  Here is what I object to&mdash;Section 45:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No person shall be entitled to recover in any legal proceedings any fee or charge for or on account of any veterinary surgical or veterinary medical advice or attendance given by him or any veterinary surgical operation performed by him unless <Col N="1141" /> such person was a registered veterinary surgeon when (as the case may be) such advice or attendance was given or such operation was performed.</P>
    <P>I know cases of men with great skill in the treatment of animals. They are known throughout the barony.  They are sound people to give medicine to animals, to set the bones of animals.  They are paid for their services; they are entitled to payment, and such people have been known for generations.  They are a part of the public life of the place, and I think that the Ministers, when they are drafting Bills of this description, ought to have more regard for the circumstances of the country.  These men are entitled to their wages, and many gentlemen here in this Seanad know thoroughly well that what I say is in accordance with the facts and with sound experience.  I am glad Senator Toal agrees with me, for these are matters within the knowledge of experienced men like the pair of us.  I object to Section 46, which is a prohibition of the practice of veterinary surgery or medicine by unregistered persons.  The section reads: &ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person to practise or to represent or hold himself out, whether directly or by invitation, as practising or being prepared to practise veterinary surgery or veterinary medicine unless he is for the time being a registered veterinary surgeon.&rdquo;  Therefore, the section, while pretending to yield to the rural objection&mdash;and I think I fairly represent the rural objection to this Bill&mdash;does not really yield at all, because here is a prohibition against a person holding himself out as prepared to practise certain things which are not defined.  The man whose life is spent and whose experience has been gained in the care of animals and ministering to them is not protected under that sub-section.  In fact, he is exposed.</P>
    <P>Section 2 states: &ldquo;... Every person who acts in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section, and shall be liable in respect of each such offence on summary conviction thereof to a fine not <Col N="1142" /> exceeding £100.&rdquo;  I would like to know where &ldquo;Seán Donohoe&rdquo; would get £100.  It is ridiculous.  Sub-section (3) reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this section shall render it unlawful for any farmer or other person who habitually keeps animals for profit or the servant of any such person to perform on or administer to an animal of any class (whether owned or not owned by any such person) any operation or medicine the performing or administering of which is incidental to the usual care and management of animals of that class: provided that such person or servant does not hold himself out as a registered veterinary surgeon.&rdquo;  Senator Johnson thinks that is in favour of the local practitioner, the unprofessional practitioner. What does &ldquo;incidental to the usual care and management of animals of that class&rdquo; mean? When that section comes to be construed it will be found that the privilege which Senator Johnson thinks is given to a person who keeps animals for profit is no privilege at all.  Here is where the pressure will come on that section&mdash;&ldquo;the usual care and management of animals.&rdquo;  What is the usual care of cattle, and what is the usual care of sheep, etc.?</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson, with great care, attention, and skill, read into that section that it would be possible for a man keeping a few hens to perform the operations which have been mentioned in the case of animals. Senator Johnson thought that the section could be evaded in that way. In my opinion the section cannot be evaded in that way, because it only refers to the usual care of animals. That is a section which will come up for consideration, and when it does receive consideration it will be of a narrow character.  Therefore the person called the &ldquo;cow doctor&rdquo;&ldquo;sheep doctor&rdquo; or &ldquo;pig doctor&rdquo;&mdash; we call them &ldquo;cow doctors&rdquo; in our part of the country&mdash;is completely victimised by this Bill, and deprived of his way of living, and the farmers of the country are interfered with in a most unjustifiable way by legislation <Col N="1143" /> of this character.  What is to happen in the County Clare with two, or perhaps only one veterinary surgeon?</P>

You are going too far with legislation of this character.  I am opposed to these two sections.  There are good points in the Bill, skilfully drawn by people making figures in the air, who know nothing at all about the real merits of the case.  I do not wish to oppose the Bill, but these two sections are bad.</P>

      <P>In connection with this Bill, I have a deep interest.  All my life I have been connected with the cattle trade, and I have an opportunity of knowing a good deal of the ins and outs of all things connected with the livestock industry.  With regard to this Bill, in connection with the arrangements made to give security and a good opinion to the people who are our best customers&mdash;the English and Scotch buyers&mdash;we are in agreement, and believe that every facility possible should be taken advantage of.  Coming down to our own country, the question of bringing in a veterinary surgeon to attend pigs, cattle and sheep is, I believe, unworkable. In my early days in the Co. Tipperary we had diseases such as blood murrain, staggers and other diseases, peculiar to the district. Some of the farms were absolutely unsaleable owing to the prevalence of illness.  The idea of asking veterinary surgeons to attend to the local cases that I know of, and we still have cases of blood murrain and other diseases that affect cattle, would be unreasonable. I have to make a personal matter of it.  I got a book of all the cures from the local herds, who had a life-long experience.  They possessed a certain amount of authority and people believed in them, and I, personally, <Col N="1144" /> have reason to know that the most celebrated cures for those diseases were handed down from father to son.</P>
      <P>I have a book, a large one, in which all these cures were entered from the local herds and those men to whom the Senator alluded as bone setters. I have friends of my own in the country who have cures that were handed down from father to son.  I had my arm broken twice and I had it locally set, and I must say that these people are almost perfect.  After reading the Bill carefully, I would certainly say with regard to these threats of prosecution against people who act against the ruling laid down in these sections, that to fine them £100 would be absurd.  I would suggest that Sections 45, 46 and 47 be washed out of this Bill altogether.  They are most mischievous and would not be popular with the people I represent.  People will not take the slightest notice of them, and I believe they are quite justified in attending to their own stock. There is no use in bringing in people who have only a theoretical or book knowledge in comparison to herds who have a life-long experience of much more value than any of those newfangled ideas.  Consequently I strongly oppose these three sections, 45, 46 and 47.  I think the Bill will be greatly improved by having them clean out of it.</P>

      <P>I rise to ask a question. I wish to know if the veterinary register is to be filled by examination set by the Veterinary College here, or by the National University.  I think the Minister, in his opening speech, referred to the National University.  I would like to know whether a veterinary surgeon who has received a degree, whether from the Veterinary College or the National University, comes under the Irish register and whether with that degree, or registration, he is entitled to practise in England, Scotland, or wherever the Royal Veterinary College has jurisdiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter that seems to have been overlooked by those who spoke previously.  There was no <Col N="1145" /> advertence made to professional services being within the reach of the small farmer.  In my experience the small farmers, and I might say the average farmers, are completely strange in remote districts to professional services of any kind, and I suggest that they cannot afford these services.  When this Bill was drafted, when the odium was thrown on men who gave local veterinary services, I think there should be some reciprocity between veterinary surgeons and farmers so as to put professional services within the latter's reach.  Comparisons have been made with the medical service, but in my opinion there is no parallel at all between the two professions.  Small farmers, and again I say the average farmers, find it almost impossible to engage a veterinary surgeon.  When he has to go a long distance, as they say in the country, &ldquo;it takes the beast to pay the damage.&rdquo;  If it was possible that some organisation of veterinary services could be thought out that would be in reach of the small farmer, it would be most desirable.  I have no objection to the general principles of the Bill.  I think it is desirable they should be placed upon the same plane as the other professions.  The matter should be considered and thought out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephODoherty" hpid="Mr. O'Doherty Mr. O'Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in thorough agreement with the general purposes of the Bill, and I cannot bring my mind into the same line of thought as Senator O'Connor or Senator Comyn as regards Sections 45 and 46.  I think the Bill as it stands does not preclude the big or the small farmer calling in the unqualified man provided that man does not hold himself out as a veterinary surgeon, and there is nothing in the Bill to prevent a farmer, if he is a decent man, paying the individual if he has got service.  I have sympathy with the individual referred to by Senator Comyn, who has no contact with farming except through practising in the way of small operations. I have in mind one particular individual who had claims to have a tradition in his family like some of the bone-setters in the country.  He holds himself out as an ordinary handy man and gets fees for that purpose.  The <Col N="1146" /> Bill, as soon as it is put into operation, precludes him giving out his service for fees and will minimise his chance of making a livelihood.  What can he do?  He has no line.  The Minister should think out some scheme whereby in the transition period these people would be safeguarded to some extent.  I have tried to think out something, but I cannot make any suggestion.  They have given service to the farming community and veterinary surgeons have not been so well organised.  In my opinion they are sparse enough at the moment.  I think men like the individual I refer to, on account of the services they have given, deserve some consideration.</P>
      <P>On the general principle I am in agreement with the Bill.  There is one section dealing with erasure from the register of persons convicted of crimes to which I would like to refer.  I do not anticipate that the Minister will agree with me when I say that the passage relating to disqualification for treason should be taken out of the Bill. I know how treason is looked upon by the Government, but it must be remembered that as we are at present constituted we have two Governments in the country, with the people living under each Government not particularly desiring that Government, and you will always have attempts of one kind or another until Ireland is undivided and absolutely free.  In 1916, during the initial stages of the fight for freedom, there were men connected with the medical profession and with veterinary surgery who were put on trial for high treason.  Attempts were made to put these men off the register because of that, but these attempts failed.  Some of these men afterwards turned out to be very good supporters of the present Executive.  I think this is a bad principle to introduce into a Bill that concerns the administration of the veterinary laws.</P>

      <P>Three points mainly have been raised, one relating to the Schedule, one relating to the group of Sections from 45 to 47, and the point that was raised by Senator Bagwell at the beginning.  With regard to Section 23, I am not at all wedded to the form of words set out there, but I would like to safeguard one principle. We are establishing a Council.  We are not having Government representation on it.  There is nobody appointed by the Executive Council. The entire personnel of the Council will be drawn from those elected by the members of the profession.  If it is thought right to have any touch as between the actions of this body and the Government, then there should be some way of removing those people from office if they misbehave.  If the Senator thinks that this section gives the Minister for Agriculture too wide a power, and if he submits an amendment which would allow of the removal of members and provide further that the Minister for Agriculture would lay a statement before both Houses, giving his reasons, that will give us sufficient control or touch, which will be exercised only as a last resort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section sets out: &ldquo;If at any time the Minister is satisfied, either after such inquiry as the Minister thinks fit to make or without such inquiry, that the Council has on any occasion failed to do any matter or thing which the Council is authorised or required ... to do ...&rdquo;  The Senator said that he did not object to the Minister taking power where a Council was required to do something and failed to do it.  The section states: &ldquo;... and the doing of which by the Council on that occasion was in the opinion of the Minister necessary or appropriate for the proper exercise of the functions ...&rdquo;  The Minister has to satisfy himself on the matter, and, of course, he would be subject to cross-examination by way of parliamentary question as to why the Council <Col N="1148" /> had been treated in that way.  I am not bound by this form of wording.  I want, however, to preserve some touch, even though at long distance and as a last resort, with the Council, so that if they did misbehave or did something which they were not authorised to do, then some other action could be taken.</P>
    <P>The question of the Schedule was raised by Senator Connolly.  I said, by way of introduction, that Section 2 of the First Schedule refers to the old powers of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  It sets out: &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Agreement ... the constitution of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons under the Charters and the Veterinary Surgeons Acts and the powers and duties formerly vested in or imposed on that College of holding examinations for the purpose of testing the fitness of persons to practise as veterinary surgeons and of granting as a result of such examinations diplomas qualifying for registration in the General Veterinary Register and other diplomas in veterinary science or any branch thereof shall be deemed not to have been affected by the establishment of the Irish Free State ...&rdquo; The last part of it says: &ldquo;... for the purpose of the preparation and keeping of the General Veterinary Register, the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and their officers shall, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, have and may exercise in relation to persons, colleges, and matters in the Irish Free State all such powers, jurisdictions, and authorities under the Charters and the Veterinary Surgeons Acts as the said Council and their officers formerly had ...&rdquo;  That section of the Agreement is entirely confined to entry to the General Veterinary Register and the keeping of that register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is entirely a different matter.  As far as Section 2 of the general agreement is concerned it relates only to powers previously <Col N="1149" /> held by this college with regard to examinations entitling to registration on the General Register.  The Senator also raised a point about examinations. That matter is dealt with in Section 8 of the agreement, which states: &ldquo;At every examination held in the Irish Free State by the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons ...&rdquo;  They are entitled to hold these examinations under Section 2.  Senator Guinness asked me a question which has relation to that.  He wanted to know what is the position of people who want to practise in this country.  They do not come under this agreement at all.  The only way in which this country is tied, and it is only tied to the extent to which it agrees to the Schedule, is on matters contained in the Schedule, and they only relate to entry on the General Register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no prohibition on this country having any examination it likes; establishing any corporation granting diplomas for the purpose of practising in this country.  Section 31 points to that.  It states: &ldquo;After the establishment of the register the following persons shall, on making the prescribed application, and paying the fees required by this Act to be paid on such application, be entitled (save as is otherwise provided by this section) to be registered in the register, that is to say:&mdash; (a) every person who is at the time of such application registered in the General Veterinary Register, and (b) every person who at the time of such application is possessed of a diploma in veterinary science, veterinary surgery or veterinary medicine, granted by a university or college in Saorstát Eireann, and for the time being recognised by law as a diploma conferring on the possessor thereof the right to be registered in the register.&rdquo;  This is aiming at what we have in view, that at some time in the near future the present Veterinary College is going to be handed over, with the approval of the Oireachtas, to University College, Dublin, a constituent college of the National University.  That college will establish a veterinary faculty. <Col N="1150" /> We will, in the act of handing over to that college, confer on them by law the power of conferring a diploma, entitling to practise in this country. A person who does not want to practise outside this country need not go near the General Register.  He can sit for his examination in the University College, Dublin, and that is all that he will have to submit to.  The person who gets the diploma, the M.R.C.V.S., is entitled to practise in England and in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The person who takes out the National University diploma can only practise in Ireland. If he wants to practise outside this country he will have to sit for a second examination.  We have been asked why we have not a reciprocal system. The answer is that we could not get it.  This Bill is practically on the same lines as the legislation in regard to medicine and dentistry.  There is a difference, however, in comparison with the previous constitutions of the medical and the dental establishments. The Veterinary College have held rigidly to this, that they do not recognise any examination held outside the ægis of their own system as entitling to the diploma of M.R.C.V.S.  If any person wants to get that diploma that person must submit to their examination. This agreement allows the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons to establish an examination centre for their degree in Dublin, and the consideration for that was that those of our people who took out the course here and sat for the examination got the M.R.C.V.S., if they passed, and that entitled them to practise outside this country.  The people who want to confine themselves to this country need not touch that examination; they can go for the examination in University College.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that certain colleges which have been in the habit of granting veterinary certificates <Col N="1151" /> or diplomas up to a point were not recognised by the Royal College and at that point were brought in and recognised?

      <P>That may have been with regard to people who at some time had a diploma and who were carried into the system.  At the moment, and for the future, the system is that anyone who takes out the M.R.C.V.S. degree has to submit to examination under the conditions which the Royal College lays down, or any colleges they recognise.  They do not recognise any college on its own as entitled to give a course and hold examinations separately.  They recognise certain of the Dominion colleges, and, in fact, they do recognise this, as entitling to give a course.</P>

      <P>The Royal College here is in a much better position than any college in any other Dominion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is on the same footing as colleges <Col N="1152" /> in Scotland and one other college in England, as well as the London College. No Dominion college has the same rights as the Veterinary College in Dublin; at least, it has not at the moment, and I understand the system will continue that way.  That deals with whatever remarks were made in connection with the agreement.  I think that, with the exception of one other small point, every other speaker dealt with Sections 45, 46 and 47, and dealt with them as if the only persons entitled to practise were the registered veterinary practitioners.  That is not so.  I had considerable difficulty about this clause.  I want to say that I did not draft the Bill and I did not even draw up the instructions for the drafting.  My Department of Industry and Commerce had nothing to do with the drafting.  The instructions for the drafting of the Bill were drawn up by the Department of Agriculture.  I happen to be dealing with the Bill because I dealt with the negotiations for the agreement and I had previous touch with two other measures which ran on similar lines to this.</P>
    <P>The Bill proceeds in the main from the Department of Agriculture.  It was discussed with agriculturists and members of the veterinary profession. On Second Reading in the other House I mentioned certain suggestions made to me by members of the veterinary profession as to an enlargement that might be made in one rather rigidly drafted clause as it first appeared.  I had very many discussions with those who presented this suggestion to me, as representing farmers' interests in the country, and I had the advantage of deriving a certain amount of information from them. We had two objects in view.  We wanted to establish the profession and give it a name, and we were anxious not to allow any persons to hold themselves out as registered practitioners unless they were actually so.  We did recognise that there might be a considerable number of small operations which would have to be performed, or cases in which medicine would have to be administered, when there would not be a registered veterinary surgeon within reach.  We sought to enlarge <Col N="1153" /> the Bill to allow these operations to be done without conflict with the law.</P>
    <P>With regard to payment, I found every Party in the Dáil in agreement that nobody should be allowed to sue for fees unless he was a registered practitioner.  I then came on to the point as to what type of operation was going to be covered and who was to be allowed to do small operations.  I put down amendments myself, and I would ask Senators to look them up, detailing the number of operations.  I pointed out these operations could be performed by anybody, making a limitation, not with regard to the person, but with regard to the type of operation. We considered a general clause that we should prohibit in a rigid way, but that the section should not apply to any operation which the Minister for Agriculture might schedule as an allowed operation.  That would have given very wide power and it would have been a very difficult choice on the part of the Minister concerned. I do not know that he was going to avoid that difficulty, but at any rate the amendment did not commend itself to the people who were discussing it.</P>
    <P>In the end it was suggested that we should throw open the administering of medicine and the performance of operations of a normal type to farmers, stockowners or to the servants of either.  I asked those who were then arguing that the Bill was too rigid to give me categories of people who were not covered by the term &ldquo;farmer, stockowner or the servant of either&rdquo; and then we would see if the section could be enlarged to bring them in. Deputy O'Connell, in the other House, gave me an example of a man who had been a farmer and stockowner but who is now unemployed, and he mentioned that although he was a handyman he was outside the Bill.  He did not press that.  Senator Linehan now gives the case of a smith.</P>
    <P>I had another case of a particular disease which is in a certain county and, when I asked how I was to include this, I was told I could not because it was not an operation nor did it mean administering medicine; it was really <Col N="1154" /> a miracle.  How we are to meet all these cases, I do not know.  The clause is open for enlargement, but it is not intended to enlarge it for the sake of single individuals.  If there are categories of cases we might make some attempt to cover them.  It is wrong to talk of the Bill as if we were merely dealing with 259 veterinary surgeons outside of Dublin.  We must consider the farmers, the stockowners and the servants of both, and if that is not a big enough number of people to perform operations on animals, then the animal deserves our pity and commiseration much more than the cow-doctors who may be put out of employment. The Department of Agriculture made the case to me that what they wanted was to exclude the type of man who had no experience of animals, who had not been a farmer or a stockowner but who suddenly came along and, having nothing better to do, decided that he would impose himself on certain people as a ready curer of animals' ailments.</P>

He was tried by a court and dealt with for maiming cattle or for some other type of inhuman conduct. The Department gave me other example of types of people who had no experience of animals.  The people who have experience of cattle, whether they are farmers or stockowners, are given every liberty under the Bill. We restrict them in certain ways that I think no one can have any objection to.  They are not to hold themselves out as registered practitioners.  That is all that is prohibited under Parts 1 and 2 of Section 46.  Another portion of Part 1 of Section 46 must be read in the light of sub-section (3).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and we want to preserve that position.  We go further.  I would rather approach this from the other angle, that the profession have a right to be protected. A certain number of people have incurred expense in becoming qualifield veterinary surgeons.  The number that we have in the country is small.  The country, I think, could support a great many more professional men of that type.  Let us see that they are protected.  A balance has to be struck, and we have tried to do that in the Bill.  I do not know whether the smith type of person that Senator Linehan referred to is very numerous, or whether the particular operation of removing an abscess arising from gravel getting between the quick and the hoof of a horse's foot is very frequent.  I am not at all certain whether the particular operation the Senator spoke of is a veterinary, medical or surgical operation.  That will require further consideration.  With regard to what Senator Johnson said, I do not hold myself bound by anything that was said in the House of Commons with regard to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  We have no touch with that.  The Bill was not drafted with regard to anything they said.  It was drafted arising out of the view of the Department of Agriculture as to what was the proper balance to be struck as between the profession and the requirements of the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Doherty made a point with regard to treason.  I hold, as I held on the Bills dealing with dentists and medical practitioners that if there are any people in this country who are convicted at any time of treason, which is, in fact, an offence against the majority of the people of the country, <Col N="1156" /> that they deserve, if they survive the other penalties, to be put off the dental, the medical or the veterinary registers.  Comparisons with anything that happened in 1916 do not affect me in the slightest, because the conditions are entirely different.  Anything that happened in 1916 was not a revolt against the will of the people of this State.  A person convicted of treason now would be convicted of something that is contrary to the will of the majority of the people as expressed at elections time after time, and for that every civilised country imposes a penalty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to extend, for another two years, the Juries (Protection) Act.  I need not remind the House that that Act was passed largely because attempts were being made to intimidate jurymen in this country from doing their duty as jurymen.  That intimidation had gone so far that actually on one occasion an attempt was made to murder an individual juryman. There are some provisions in the original Act which I myself would like to see, and hope I will see, made the permanent law of this country.  There are other provisions which may be regarded as of a more temporary nature. When the original Bill was introduced it was limited to a period of two years in the hope that at the expiration of that time a certain organisation which is anxious, by means of murder and other outrages, to disturb settled conditions in this country, would have ceased to be in existence.  Unfortunately, that is not now the case, and in consequence I ask the Seanad to extend the operation of the measure for another two years in order that jurymen may be able to carry out their duties as jurymen free from threat and menace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need not go into the provisions of this Bill.  They are familiar, I am sure, to Senators.  The measure was very fully debated in the Seanad a couple of years ago.  It has worked extremely well.  The intimidation of juries has been rendered by that measure not merely difficult, but practically impossible. In fact, when a recent attempt was made to circularise jurymen, those who wished to do so found themselves faced with an impossible position, because they had not, and they could not get, the existing current panel of jurymen.  The result was that all they could do was to circularise every name on the panel.  They only succeeded in circularising a comparatively small number of persons on the panel and a very large number indeed of jurymen who were not on that particular panel. But the fact that an attempt was recently made to intimidate jurymen shows the necessity for continuing this measure for the protection of jurymen. I might also point out that so completely <Col N="1158" /> has the measure stopped the intimidation or circularisation of jurymen that we have never found it necessary to put in force the powers conferred by Section 8 of the Principal Act&mdash;that is, the postponement of a trial where jurymen had been intimidated. I would ask the Seanad, in consequence, to pass this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister for Justice, himself a lawyer, should come forward with a proposal for the extension of the life of this Juries Act, but I am much more surprised at the reasons which he has given.  He has informed the House that the Juries Act has been a success, that it has put a stop to the intimidation of jurymen.  He has also informed the House that it is necessary to continue it because there has been one example of intimidation of jurymen by means of a circular.  Of course, the Minister has sources of information that other people have not, and I take it, as he says it, that there has been intimidation. Now, in my opinion the Juries Act is a dead letter.  There is a great deal of formality in relation to the empanelling of jurors.  They come in, in a mysterious way, by number. They are not called by name, and they go into the box.  You are not supposed to know who they are or what they are.  I do not like to use a vulgar phrase in connection with this Bill, but it seems to me that there is a lot of fee-faw-fum and humbug about the Juries Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the reason suggested by the Minister for the continuation of this measure?  The same reason that he urged originally for the introduction of this most reactionary measure. What is it?  That a man who had served on a jury was wounded.  That incident had occurred six months before the original Bill was before the House.  Now, that incident is at least three years back in the pages of history.  Does the Minister suggest that the ordinary principles of public liberty and the ordinary administration of justice should be, in appearance at least, completely subverted because a juryman was wounded three years ago?  I do not know about the <Col N="1159" /> circumstances of that case, but seeing that no other juryman has been interfered with, I would be inclined to think that probably the assault upon the juryman on that occasion, three years ago, was not in consequence of his having served on a jury at all.  At any rate that is a ridiculous excuse to give for such a flagrant invasion of the Constitution as this Bill is, in form at least.  I say in form, because in substance the principles of human liberty are so firmly embedded in the minds and consciences of the people that they seem to run their course without much disturbance by reason of this Juries Act.</P>
    <P>I want to tell members of the House this.  If an ordinary prisoner wishes to canvass jurors&mdash;I dare say it is more difficult for him&mdash;but if an organisation wishes to canvass jurors there is no impediment whatever put in its way by the provisions of this Juries Act.  I do not want to let people know&mdash;evil-disposed persons, well-disposed persons, or any persons&mdash;how the thing can be done, but once men go into the courthouse at Green Street it is perfectly obvious that an organisation can canvass them quite as easily as they could canvass them before this Juries Act was passed.  My mind revolts against this Juries Act, not for any injustice that it has been capable of accomplishing, but because it is contrary to the free, open, unashamed and unafraid administration of justice.  I am against it for that reason as my main reason.  I have another objection to the Juries Act, and it is this.  It provides for a majority verdict in criminal cases.  I am opposed to a majority verdict in criminal cases, and for this fundamental reason: that the right of the State to punish is, I think, conditioned by this, that an offence must be committed against the laws of the State, and not merely that, but proved beyond reasonable doubt against the individual according to the laws of the State.</P>
    <P>There are really three conditions which limit the right of the State to punish: there must be an act done; <Col N="1160" /> there must be proof that it was done, and that proof must be according to the forms of law and of such a character as to leave no reasonable doubt. Why I am against a majority verdict is this, that if there is a doubt in the mind of any one of the sworn twelve&mdash; that is, a reasonable doubt&mdash;it might be said: &ldquo;Oh, why should we wait to try and persuade a boot-eater on the jury to agree with the others?&rdquo;  Now, sometimes the one man who stands out is the man who has formed a correct judgment on the evidence, but under this Bill if three men stand out a verdict of guilty can still be found against a citizen.  If what one man considers in opposition to the opinions of eleven can be called unreasonable, can what three men consider be called unreasonable? Most assuredly not.</P>
    <P>I say it is wrong in an ordinary criminal case to punish a citizen unless you have a unanimous finding with a regular trial, but it is a hundred times more wrong where the result of the verdict and of the judgment is death, where the sentence is irrevocable.  It is absolutely and entirely wrong that a man should be sentenced to death and executed upon the verdict of a jury unless that verdict is unanimous. If the Minister considers that that is one of the matters that ought to be made permanent, I wish to let him know that it will have my undying hostility and opposition.  We had a very long and very bitter discussion upon the original measure.  It is a foolish measure and a futile measure. It is a measure which shows that men were prepared, for a temporary purpose, to turn their backs on what they knew to be long established principles of the administration of justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Ever since the Seanad was formed, Ministers have been bringing in one long series of coercion Bills.  Each one was supposed to accomplish the pacification of this country, and, according to the Minister, not one of them seems to have succeeded.  The Minister is the champion of the coercionists of this country.  We have had Buckshot Forster, and Bloody Balfour, and a lot of others, going back to time immemorial, <Col N="1161" /> but there is one who did what nobody else ever did&mdash;brought in such measures as this.  The Minister and his predecessors in office have been bringing in these Bills time after time.  I warned them and the Labour Party warned them, that the line which was being taken of coercion would not bring peace to this country, that it would only cause suspicion regarding the objects to be attained, and the actions of those ordered to carry out those things.  Justice is not respected as much now as it was a few years ago, because the people are beginning to distrust the motive of these measures.  They are considered to be political, and, very often, they are political.</P>
      <P>I know, for instance, what is being said in this town over a late action&mdash;I do not want to specify anything at the present moment.  Certainly a very terrible thing occurred.  There is no possible excuse and no possible doubt about the matter.  Yet, on account of these suspicions people are going round the place suspecting it was done altogether wrong.  On account of those political things being brought forward people are losing confidence in the method of administering justice in this country, and in the conduct of those who are supposed to carry it out.  They have grave suspicions about it and are, consequently, losing even that confidence in the country which ought to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object to this Bill for the reasons I have objected to every single coercion Bill brought into this House for the last nine or ten years.  I know that there are a certain number of people whose minds are so fixed on coercion that they think they can settle everything. It has always failed to settle anything in this country.  Never has it succeeded in my lifetime or the lifetime of those who went before me.  The same people have been going on in the same way, and the results are always the same.  Yet, people like the Minister imagine they can settle matters by bringing in a ridiculous Bill to prevent people knowing who jurors are when they are up in a box for anybody who wishes to look at them, and when <Col N="1162" /> people from their own locality can make their names known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to this Bill, but I cannot agree with Senator Colonel Moore that it is a coercive measure.  It is intended to be a protective measure.  I believe that it is unnecessary in the one direction, and that it is ineffective in the other.  It is unnecessary in ordinary criminal cases. There is no intimidation, or suggestion of intimidation, of jurors in ordinary criminal cases.  There has been intimidation of jurors in so-called political cases and, unfortunately, as is fairly well known, that intimidation still goes on.  Notwithstanding the secrecy and all the measures that have been taken on the lines of this Bill, jurors are still getting intimation of certain trials that are coming on; their patriotism is being appealed to and covert threats are being indulged in in certain eventualities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Intimidation is going on notwithstanding the Juries Act, and I think the Minister will admit that in any case at the present time where the accused can claim that his act is political, that it is an act against the State, it is utterly impossible to get a jury to convict.  Life is very sweet and a juror who has to go home and live by himself in the dead of night, a man whom the State cannot protect on every occasion, is not, except in very rare circumstances, likely to risk his life for the sake of upholding the authority and majesty of the State. From that point of view&mdash;getting convictions in crimes committed against the State&mdash;this Act is, in my opinion, absolutely ineffective, and in ordinary cases it is entirely and absolutely unnecessary. One will admit that something has got to be done to try to uphold the right of trial by jury and prevent wholesale intimidation and what is known as embracery, particularly in the City of Dublin.  A measure to this end was adopted in the original Act. It was the best, seemingly, that Ministers could conceive.  Yet I think that they will themselves, privately at all events, admit that it has been entirely ineffective and that they have evidence in their hands to show it has <Col N="1163" /> been.  The jurors are known, and whenever a case of this sort comes along jurors are threatened or intimidated. The result is that trial by jury for criminal political offences is an absolute farce, and the sooner the Government recognise that the better, instead of trying to make believe that they are protecting jurors by merely re-enacting or extending by this Bill the powers under existing legislation.</P>

      <P>The difficulty in a matter of this kind is that judgment as to whether an Act should or should not be extended can only be accurately and effectively formed by those who are in an administrative position. Most of us will agree with Senator Comyn in disliking the majority of nine to three in criminal cases.  We do not want to see that permanent. If I were in the position of Senator Comyn or Senator Colonel Moore&mdash; that I wanted to see the Government out of power and did not trust them&mdash; I would take their point of view on this question, because if I did not trust them I would not accept their judgment on this question.  The reason I am prepared to support this Bill is because the original Act was passed as the best measure the present administration could devise for dealing with the difficulty.  The reason for the majority of nine to three is to render it more difficult to have intimidation.  I do not like that majority.  Nevertheless, I do believe that it is more difficult to have intimidation where nine jurors are sufficient to return a verdict.  I am supporting the Bill because I believe that we have got the best available Government in power and that we are absolutely obliged, if we trust them at all, to take their opinion as to whether the period specified for this Act should end or should not end.</P>

      <P>I said &ldquo;the best available Government.&rdquo;  I suggest that the course I mentioned is the only right course for the House to take.  I believe that what Senator O'Farrell has stated <Col N="1164" /> is substantially true&mdash;that a certain amount of intimidation is still going on.  As to how far this Act has been effective in reducing it, it is impossible for us to judge.  For my part, I will support the continuance of the Act because I believe that this is one of the cases where those who are responsible for carrying out the law must judge whether an enactment should be continued or not.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Farrell concluded his remarks by saying that in this country trial by jury for offences in which the criminal alleged political motives was an entire farce.  I cannot agree.  If I agreed with him, then it would be my duty to produce a measure which would ensure that justice would be properly administered and which would provide that the jury system would be temporarily, at any rate, suspended and substituted by some other system.  But I do not agree with the Senator.  I am aware that there have been certain cases in which, what I might call, very bad verdicts of acquittal have been brought in.  But I know that in a considerable number of other cases the jurors have done their duty and have brought in verdicts of guilty where on the evidence the person charged was clearly guilty.  I say that the Act has, in fact, worked and that intimidation of juries has been reduced to a negligible point. Senator Colonel Moore talks about this as a Coercion Act.  He goes back to Buckshot Forster and Bloody Balfour, and he makes the same kind of speech that we always hear from the Senator on matters of this kind.  Senator Colonel Moore's view always is that anybody who says &ldquo;I do not like the present administration&rdquo; is entitled to arm himself and at any cost of blood to remove the present administration or the present form of government. Anybody who prohibits that kind of crime is, according to Senator Colonel Moore, a coercionist.  I do not mind in the slightest being called a coercionist. It does not frighten me in the least degree.  I think that all law is coercion.  That a person who desires to commit murder should not be allowed to do so is, of course, coercion. <Col N="1165" /> That law does not give him his freedom. That a man should not be allowed to rob a bank or to rob another person is coercion.  The law preventing that does not give him his freedom. All law is coercion.</P>
      <P>According to Senator Colonel Moore, the people concerned under this Bill are being coerced.  They are being prevented from committing crime.  That is what the criminal law exists for. The criminal law in every country is and must be coercive.  The word &ldquo;coercion&rdquo; does not frighten me in the slightest.  The view of Senator Colonel Moore is: &ldquo;Let them do what they like; let them arm and commit any kind of outrage and any kind of violence; when they have murdered enough and looted enough and destroyed the country, they will get weary and give up.&rdquo;  That is the statesmanship of Senator Colonel Moore, but I do not think it is the statesmanship of anybody else in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Comyn says that because there was only one attempt made to murder a juryman three years ago, this Act should not be continued. Senator Comyn should be able to draw the conclusion that the fact that an attempt was made to murder that juryman because he acted in a particular criminal case shows that the organisation, one of whose members he found guilty, were willing to go to this extreme.  Not only that, but the other members of that particular <Col N="1166" /> jury were followed about and intimidated, and had to be put under protection at the time.  We know, and everybody in this House knows, that that organisation, if they could, would carry on, and do so at the present moment.  They are not quiescent. They have not got tired of murder. We know that there was a very serious murder a short time ago committed by that very organisation in the County Tipperary.</P>

      <P>We had another murder very recently in Dublin&mdash;the murder of young Carroll. We have had other attempts all through the country.  At the present moment, that particular organisation is active and very active.  This is the particular time that Senator Comyn comes forward to oppose a Bill, the result of his opposition, if successful, being to facilitate this organisation in going on further and committing more crimes against those jurymen who do their duty.</P>
