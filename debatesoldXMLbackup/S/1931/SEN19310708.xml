      <P>This is a short and simple Bill, which deals with two points. It provides that records of butter in cold storage shall be kept and may be published by the Minister. Section 10 provides that licences to collect cream instead of milk shall be still legal.  There was power under the old Dairy Produce Act to collect cream instead of milk, but that power expired on 17th December, 1930.  This section provides that the Minister may still make regulations allowing cream instead of milk to be collected up to 31st March, 1933.  These are the only two points with which the Bill deals.</P>

      <P>On the last day on which the Bill was before the House, the Minister agreed to accept a small amendment to allow a grower who hitherto has not been an exporter of seed or potatoes to obtain a licence.  By deleting paragraph (c) of sub-section (3) of Section 6, the change which I wish to effect will be brought about.  The Minister agreed to accept this change, but I am not of the same opinion as the Minister that the change is merely academic.  When grain crops are practically useless as cash crops, it might in the future be good business for every farmer to conserve his second-size potatoes and export them for seed, if possible.  That is the idea I have in moving the amendment.</P>

      <P>This Bill deals with two matters.  It allows midwives who are registered to use a distinctive badge which no other person will be at liberty to use.  It also is designed to restrict the handywoman from attending women at childbirth.  That is a very necessary provision.  In the original Act, these women were allowed a certain latitude for five years.  Since <Col N="1431" /> then quite a large number of women at childbirth were attended by handy-women. This provision is intended to restrict that practice and to make it obligatory for every woman at childbirth to be attended by a midwife, if a midwife is available, or by a doctor. Both these provisions, I think, are very desirable.  Maternal mortality has been far too high, and there is a consensus of opinion in England and in other countries that it should be reduced.  At present the death rate in this respect is about five per thousand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two amendments in my name to this Bill.  The first amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 3.  To delete paragraph (c).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> The second amendment is as follows&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 3.  To delete in lines 32-33 the words &lsquo;particulars of damage so given to such railway company show that such damage,&rsquo; and to substitute therefor the words &lsquo;claim for damage in the action.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Both those amendments have the same purpose&mdash;to secure that in the case of a fire caused by sparks from a railway engine which does damage to a greater amount than £200 the person injured shall at least be able to recover the sum of £200.  Senator Johnson and others said on the last occasion the Bill was before the House that I was probably too meticulous, and that the Bill did not need amendment.  I submit that the Bill does need amendment. Section 3 of the Bill, which I propose to amend, states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Principal Act shall not apply in respect of any action for damage by fire occurring after the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>I should state that the object of the Railway Fires Act of 1905 was to allow compensation for damage caused to agricultural land or agricultural crops arising from fires caused by sparks or cinders emitted by locomotive engines. Under the common law, a man whose crops were damaged by fires caused by a railway engine could bring an action, provided he could prove that the railway company was negligent.  The object of the Act of 1905 was to allow a farmer to get damages to the amount of £100 without proving negligence. Under that Act, he could only get damages without proving negligence to the amount of £100, no matter what the amount of his loss was.  The Act of 1905 did not apply in the case of any action for damage by fire brought against any railway company unless the notice of claim was sent to the railway company within seven days from the occurrence of the damage and particulars of the damage within fourteen days.  If a farmer had a rick of hay valued £500, then within seven days he would have to send to the railway company the notice of claim, and within fourteen days he would have to send <Col N="1433" /> particulars of the damage.  If he did those two things, he was entitled to sue for £100, and to succeed without proof of negligence.  Here is how he was limited in the section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This section&rdquo;&mdash;that was the section giving him compensation&mdash;&ldquo;shall not apply in the case of any action for damage unless the claim for damage in the action does not exceed £100.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Take the case of a man whose rick of hay was burned by a spark from a railway engine.  Under the Act of 1905, he would have to send in notice of his claim and then particulars of the damage.  He would have to claim the sum of £100 and no more, and without proof of negligence he could get up to £100 in damages.  I am sorry that Senator Barrington is not here at the moment.  It was in connection with an action arising under this Railway Fires Act that I first met Senator Barrington and learned to appreciate his splendour as a witness.  Not alone was his evidence good, but it was given in a style which I have never forgotten.  I think the action was in respect of cinders which fell from an engine on the famous West Clare railway.  The fire-box was out of order, but the evidence was good.</P>
    <P>Under the Act of 1905, whatever the amount of your damage, you were entitled to £100 injury to crops, without proving negligence.  The first impression one gets from the new Bill is that it increases that amount to £200.  Section 2 of the Bill says: &ldquo;Sub-section (3) of Section 1 of the Principal Act shall have effect in relation to actions for damage caused by fires occurring after the passing of this Act as if the words &lsquo;two hundred pounds&rsquo; were substituted for the words &lsquo;one hundred pounds&rsquo; in that sub-section.&rdquo;  The Bill applies the limit of £200 where £100 was the limit before.  Section 3 of the Bill provides that the notice of the occurrence must be sent in writing to the railway company within seven days, and that particulars of the damage shall be sent within twenty-one days.  The times there are different from those in the original Act, but otherwise the <Col N="1434" /> provisions are the same.  The third requirement under this Bill is, as given in paragraph (c): &ldquo;The particulars of damage so given to such railway company show that such damage does not exceed the sum of two hundred pounds.&rdquo;  If, for instance, a rick of hay was destroyed, the person affected would not come within the terms of the Bill if the particulars showed the damage to exceed £200, whereas under the old Act, no matter what the amount of the damage, he could claim up to £100.  This Act deprives every person who has sustained damage exceeding £200 of the benefits of the Act of 1905.  That is absolutely clear on the construction of the Bill, and I do not rely on my own judgment in that.  I submitted this question to other lawyers for whose judgment I have respect.  Under this Bill, if the particulars show the damage to exceed £200, the claimant is outside the limitation contained here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must have had some intention other than that which we understood he had when he introduced this measure.  I have put down the two amendments which I have read.  The first amendment is to delete sub-section (c) because it is unnecessary, seeing that Section 2 limits the amount recoverable to £200.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Under my second amendment the farmer would be left generally in the same position in which he was under the Act of 1905, but the amount he could claim would be increased to £200.  I understood that <Col N="1435" /> that was the intention of the Bill, but from the enlightenment that the Minister has given us to-day it does not appear to be.  It appears that the intention of the Bill is that if the damage is less than £200 the farmer shall have the benefit of the Act, but if it is greater he shall not have the benefit of it.  That is a retrograde step, and is quite wrong in my opinion.  It is unnecessary, because railway engines have been so much improved that damage by fire from them is not as great or as frequent now as it used to be.  If a man whose crops are damaged to the extent of £20, or up to £200, is to get compensation, I think there is no justice in depriving of compensation a man whose rick of hay, value £500, is destroyed by fire.  That is the effect of this Bill as it stands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister and I are at cross-purposes.  If he says that that is not the effect of the Bill, then I am at loss to understand his line of reasoning.  I submit, after full consideration, that that is the effect of the Bill.  Under my amendment it will be quite clear that the farmer will be entitled at least to £200, even though his damage exceeds £200.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephODoherty" hpid="Mr. O'Doherty Mr. O'Doherty">

    <Speaker pid="WalterNugentBart" hpid="Sir Walter Nugent Sir Walter Nugent">
      <NameTxt>Sir Walter Nugent</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, as far as I understand, is that a person whose property is injured in this way can proceed at common law against a railway company, irrespective of the amount of the damage, provided that he shows it was due to negligence. Paragraph (c) of this section, which the Senator seeks to after, provides that in the case of damage not exceeding £200 the person claiming will be relieved of the obligation of proving that the damage was caused by negligence.  If that is right, I am sure the Senator will agree that it is far better to let paragraph (c) remain. In my opinion, it will be much better for the railway company and for the community at large.  I hope the Minister will not accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered this measure carefully, and it would seem to me that, under its provisions, if a person proves that his hay-stack or oat-stack, or whatever it may be, is damaged to the extent of £220, he cannot get any relief at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not dealing with that particular question.  We are dealing with a case where it is not necessary to prove negligence.  In this instance, it is not necessary to prove negligence on the part of the railway company.  I quite agree with the Minister so far as cases are concerned in which it is necessary to prove negligence. My point is that if a man's rick of hay, value for £220, is lost, he cannot get any compensation.  If the valuers say that it is value for £190, the man may get the £190.  That appears to me to be a most astounding proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If the amount of damage reaches £250 or £300, the man can still claim for £200.  No one suggests that a man would claim £500, or even £1,000, when the damage would not actually reach that figure.  I have given my interpretation of this measure, and I really think that it is a most astonishing piece of legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the law is wrong and it should be remedied.  In the case of a railway train destroying property, it would be a very difficult thing for any farmer to prove that the railway company was negligent.  In my opinion, the change which Senator Comyn seeks to make will give some semblance of fair play.  Even if a man's claim is £1,000, it will give him £200 without proving negligence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>If this Bill were worded in a somewhat similar fashion to the original Act there would be no difficulty.  The present Bill, to my mind, works out like this: If a man's property is damaged to a greater extent than £200, and if he proves that the extent of the damage is fully £500, he cannot even make a claim for the £200.  Under the original Act a man could bring forward his statement of damage and claim £100.  If a man loses property to the extent of more than £200, and if he truthfully states the extent of the damage, he loses the whole lot under this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>He does not lose the whole lot.  The situation before <Col N="1438" /> the Railway Fires (Amendment) Bill was introduced was that if a person trespassed or committed a nuisance and caused damage, his liability was absolute and there need be no negligence proved.  Where the law imposed an obligation upon a company or a corporation to do certain acts, if, in the performance of those acts, damage was done, the onus of proving the damage was not placed on the company or corporation but upon the person who suffered the damage.  That was the law.  The railway company is compulsorily obliged by a statute to run trains.  If hay or anything of that sort was damaged by a passing train, even to the extent of £5, negligence had to be proved against the railway company.</P>
      <P>It was considered that, in the case of small men, men with property worth about £100-not men with a big amount of property who might suffer £100 of damage&mdash;if there was a claim of £100 or less, then the onus would again be shifted and the railway company's liability would become absolute.  That was the law as we got it.  Money having altered in value, we intend to change the limit from £100 to £200.  Under this Bill the situation is: Will the man say that his damage is £200 or that it exceeds that amount? If it is more than £200, then he has the ordinary remedies of the law.  In the ordinary process of trying to establish a claim he will have to prove negligence.  If the damage is less than £200, then without proving negligence he gets £200. That is the position we want.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill is going to place the farmer who may suffer loss in a worse position than he is to-day.  I have read through this proposed legislation and, reading it as a layman, I think the point made by Senator Comyn is a correct one. I think I am fortified in that attitude by the amending British Act, of which the present Bill is almost a copy.  The amending British Act was passed in 1923 and it provides exactly what Senator Comyn would like to provide. Section 2 of that Act sets out:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Principal Act shall not apply in the case of any action for damage <Col N="1439" /> by fire brought against any railway company unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) Notice in writing of the fire having occurred and of intention to claim in respect thereof shall have been sent to the said railway company within seven days of the occurrence of the damage and</P>
    <P>(2) Particulars in writing of the damage showing the amount of the claim in money not exceeding the said sum of £200 shall have been sent to the said railway company within twenty-one days of the occurrence of the damage.</P>
    <P>We are asked to modify that and to make a change of considerable moment.  The Minister has defended that change.  There is an essential difference and it would seem to me that, if we pass this Bill as it stands, we are depriving the farmer even of the security he had on amounts up to £100.  He will be deprived of the right he holds at the present moment if we pass this Bill in its present form.</P>
    <P>The farmer is going to be damnified by this legislation unless it is amended in the direction that Senators desire. Unfortunately, that seems to be the intention of the Minister, judging by what he said here to-day.  If we desire the Minister's intentions to be put into effect, then let the Bill go through unamended, but if we desire to keep the farmer in the position he has occupied up to the present in respect of damage through fire then we ought to accept the amendment submitted by Senator Comyn or some other amendment drafted on similar lines.</P>

      <P>As my name has been dragged into this question by my friend Senator Comyn, perhaps I will be allowed to say a few words.  I regret that I must vote against Senator Comyn's amendment.  Like the Senator, I have had lifelong experience of the working of these Acts and of the claims that are made under them.  I might say that fraudulent and bogus claims are perpetually being made under them.  I cannot follow Senator Comyn or Senator Johnson through the intricacies of <Col N="1440" /> legal argument.  The amendment seems to me to be devised with the intention of making claims easier.  I could, if I so wished, delay the Seanad a very long time giving instances of the types of claim that are made. Anything that would facilitate the making of these claims would, in my opinion, be very injurious indeed.  I have known dozens of cases where claims were made without the slightest reference to justice or to facts.  If we do anything to facilitate the submission of cases of this sort we will be doing something that is very wrong.</P>

      <P>I am one of those who would be the very last to try to impose any unreasonable commitment on the railway company.  I suggest, however, that if we pass this Bill as it stands, it will be looked upon more or less as a joke from a legislative point of view.  I would like to know why the Minister, having copied the British Act almost line for line, departed from it in this one particular. It is really very significant that he did so.  The reference made by Senator Barrington have nothing to do with the principle involved here. The Senator talks about facilitating bogus claims.  Surely you are more likely to have a lot of bogus claims where the amount is less than £200 than you would have in cases where the damage is in excess of £200?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take it that a spark from a railway engine sets fire to a farmer's haggard, and possibly his house, and damage is done to the extent of £500. It is most unlikely that in order to establish a claim the farmer will be able to prove negligence on the part of the railway company.  Undoubtedly, most of the fires are not due to negligence at all; they cannot be avoided. The farmer knows that if he proceeds with his claim and has to prove negligence, he cannot succeed.  He certainly will like to avail of the relief which will be given him in this Bill and he will claim up to the amount of £200. In order to bring himself within the Bill, according to what the Minister said, he has to tell a deliberate lie. He has to say that the damage is only <Col N="1441" /> £200, and certainly is not in excess of that amount.  If he goes into court he has to swear that the damage is only £200 when, in fact, it may be £500.</P>
    <P>Is it suggested that we should make that a condition upon a man who is seeking compensation?  The farmer may say that the damage is only £200. It is up to the railway company to prove, through their witnesses who have examined the scene of the fire, that the damage is in excess of £200 and, if their case succeeds, no compensation is payable.  Is not the position a preposterous one?</P>

It will really mean that damage to the extent of £1,000 can be done and a man can get only £200 compensation if he is not prepared to prove negligence.  If there is damage done to the extent of £200 he can get that amount without proving negligence.  If the Minister wants the Oireachtas to enact that sort of legislation he is welcome; but I certainly will strongly object to being a party to enacting any such preposterous legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to the insurance in a moment.  The history of the thing is that originally there was no action against a railway company which had power to run trains, except one was able to prove negligence.  The question of negligence in a case like that was a very difficult one, because it was held that if the railway company had taken all reasonable care in having their engines constructed on the latest improved lines of constructing engines, so as not to emit sparks, and if the company's servants had not been guilty of negligence, then they were free.  It was really practically impossible to succeed in a case of negligence against the railway company, particularly in the matter of sparks.  For that reason the 1905 Act was passed. It was passed for the purpose of giving <Col N="1443" /> relief to small farmers&mdash;it applied only in the case of agricultural land and produce&mdash;largely on the ground that they were people who did not insure. It practically made the railway company the insurers to the extent of £100.</P>
      <P>It was never intended by that legislation that it should insure up to £100 in the case of people who suffered damage to a larger extent than £100. They really ought to insure for themselves. Owing to the way the 1905 Act was drafted, it did not carry out that idea.  It did make the railway company insure up to £100, although the actual damage might have been greater.  The insured farmer could always claim £100, waiving the rest of the damage.  He would get the money from the railway company as a sort of insurance.  The Act was worked badly in one sense.  It wants amendment in the matter of amount.  Under the present Bill the amount is being raised to £200.  It would not be right to give a man the benefit of this Act where the damage was more than £200, because the man who has agricultural produce value for more than £200 is a reasonably sensible citizen, and he ought to insure.</P>
      <P>If you adopt Senator Comyn's amendment you will be relieving the insurance company because the man with £1,000 worth of hay is not going to trust to this Bill; he is going to insure his hay.  This will relieve the insurance company of the first £200 of the insurance money; it will have to be paid out of the coffers of the railway company.  That will be the effect of the amendment in cases where the damage is over £200.  In small cases it is right that compensation should be paid without any question of negligence.  The difference in the value of money has brought about the increase to £200.  It is quite right that this Bill should have been introduced in order to relieve the small farmer with a claim for compensation up to £200, but not beyond it.  It ought not to apply to the case of a sensible farmer who will do his own insurance and who will not have a claim against the railway company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is rather an interesting legal discussion.  Senators are at a disadvantage in that they have no books before them.  If Senators had the Act of 1905 before them they would at once see that the arguments I have put forward are entirely correct.  Indeed, Senator Brown agrees with me.  He says that my construction of the 1905 Act is the correct construction.  He says my construction of the Bill, as it stands, is the correct construction.  Therefore, on the law now there is no difference of opinion.  It then comes down to a question of policy.  Senator Brown says the 1905 Act does mean what I say it means, but the legislature never intended that.  Did you ever hear such an expression as that from an eminent, distinguished lawyer ? He says they never intended what is the plain meaning of the Act of Parliament. Of course they intended it.</P>
      <P>I want to give Senators the reason why that Act was passed.  It is extremely difficult to prove negligence in a case of damage caused by sparks from railway engines.  It is extremely expensive to the plaintiff and extremely inconvenient, and expensive, too, to the railway company.  I have done it twice, although there was a most distinguished witness against me.  He had to produce his fireboxes and they were burned out.  The fire-box of an engine is a contrivance that goes into the funnel.  It is made of iron.  Through the effects of fire it is corroded.  Sometimes a bar is worn away and a rather large spark gets through that and, in a high wind, it is carried sometimes fifty, sixty or seventy yards.  That happened on one or two occasions to the fireboxes in the engines on the West Clare Railway, with which Senator Barrington and I are so well acquainted.  That was the reason why the Act of 1905 was passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of that Act is very clearly expressed in the Act itself.  The intention was to give up to £100 compensation, whatever the amount of the loss.  When I looked at this Bill first I considered that it was a generous thing for the Minister to do.  I believed that he was going to increase <Col N="1445" /> the amount to £200 on account of the depreciation in the value of money. On the last day I thought that the Minister had, perhaps, overlooked the little matter that I have referred to, but apparently he has not.  Apparently he now wants to compel farmers at terrific expense to prove negligence before they can get the sum of £200. As Senator Colonel Moore pointed out, if the loss amounts to £220, the farmer gets no compensation at all.  The farmers are very honest people, and if they suffer damage to the extent of £220 and send in particulars of a claim to, say, Senator Barrington, Senator Sir Walter Nugent or Senator Bagwell, they will be told they are not entitled to any compensation at all.</P>
    <P>I may say that there is a tremendous lot of knowledge about this matter in this Assembly, and we have not heard certain Senators dealing with it yet. Certain Senators have a tremendous lot of information about this little point.  We would, I am sure, like to hear from them about it.  If a farmer is dishonest and declares that the amount of damage is only £199, Senator Barrington will at once investigate the hay-rick, and he will come to the conclusion that the damage is at least £250.  He will be of opinion that the hay was of very good quality; he probably might know the land where it was grown&mdash;magnificent land; in fact the Senator might say that he actually helped to reclaim the land.  He might actually declare it to be portion of the famous slobland on the Fergus.  I can rather visualise the evidence the Senator would give.  The farmer would give all the particulars relating to his claim, but if the amount exceeded £200 he would get no compensation under this measure.</P>
    <P>I will ask Senators to consider this matter very carefully.  We have in this House three or four of the ablest men in the country, and we would certainly <Col N="1446" /> like to hear them upon this particular point.  The discovery is not mine.  It was my friend Senator Robinson who, when reading the Bill, found out this blemish.  I hope Senators will express their opinions about this whole matter, and I trust they will accept the amendment I have brought forward.</P>

      <P>I have had the advantage of seeing the documents relating to this hospital which Senator Linehan kindly sent me.  It appears to me that, from the point of view of the hospital, there is practically no advantage in including it specially in this Bill.  The hospital appears to me to be one which would come under the Bill in the same way as an ordinary general hospital. It does a great deal of work for the poor, and it would come under the ordinary voluntary scheme.  It would not require to be named specially in the Bill at all.  I think it would be better for the hospital if it were not mentioned in the Bill.  The hospitals mentioned in the Bill do not do the necessary amount of charitable works to bring them within the scheme.  This particular hospital does the necessary amount of charitable work, and, from its point of view, I think it would be better if it were not included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>There are two amendments down in my name.  The first of these amendments reads:</P>
      <P>Section 3, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in line 35, to insert the words &ldquo;after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The second amendment is as follows:</P>
      <P>Section 6, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;he,&rdquo; in line 4, to insert the words &ldquo;in consultation with the committee of reference.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first amendment is really consequential on the second amendment, and I presume the proper course is to discuss the second amendment first.  If the second amendment is not carried, the need for the first amendment will not arise.  I shall now deal with the second amendment.  On the Second Stage of this Bill I protested against the absolute powers given to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to decide as to the distribution of the one-third surplus arising on this sweep and subsequent sweeps.  I put forward my arguments then, and I think that a great number of Senators agreed with me.  It is not desirable, from the point <Col N="1451" /> of view of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, from the point of view of the House, or from the point of view of the Minister, that this power should be placed absolutely in the hands of an individual Minister.  I think it will involve the Minister in serious conflict with the different bodies throughout the country.  Divisions on the question of the needs of the various hospitals and county homes, and as to the proportions which they should receive, will lead to dissatisfaction.  I suggested on the Second Stage that if the distribution was to be made on the basis of population or valuation, or on any similar basis, we should know exactly what we were legislating for. Failing that, I feel that the safest course is that the committee of reference should act with the Minister in deciding the amounts to be distributed, and to whom they are to be distributed. The committee of reference already provided for would probably be willing to co-operate with the Minister and to advise him as regards the distribution. I take it that there will be a considerable number of medical men on the committee of reference.</P>

      <P>These three medical men would see that an equitable distribution would take place, and would advise the Minister as to how best that distribution should be made.  That is the purpose of my amendment, and I think it ought to appeal to the Seanad.  No departmental Minister should have such absolute power in his hands as is given in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment.  On the Committee Stage of this Bill I made it as clear as I could that I considered the Minister unwise in taking on this enormous burthen, and leaving himself open to the probable political pressure which it would entail.  I think that this proposal of Senator Connolly is a protection, to a small extent, to the Minister, and will secure that the <Col N="1452" /> money will be equitably distributed and spent to the best advantage.</P>

      <P>As regards political pressure, I do not know how Ministers could live without it.  Political pressure is the breath of their nostrils. Perhaps the Minister for Justice would tell us the reason why this money is to be handed over to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health without any restriction as to its being devoted to poor law institutions?  Apparently, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has power to spend this money in any way he chooses, even in a manner outside the purview of his own office.  I cannot quite see the reason of that.  The Bill lays down carefully that certain hospitals shall come within the scheme and then certain institutions which are on the border line are mentioned specifically. But the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is given power to distribute this third part in any way he likes and not merely to hospitals under a local authority.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment but not for the same reason that Senator Connolly advanced.  I support it because I think it will bring about more uniformity. It would be almost impossible for the Minister to distribute this one-third surplus amongst institutions &ldquo;wholly or partly maintained by a local authority.&rdquo;  That applies practically to every hospital.  It would apply to the hospitals who will come in for a share of the two-thirds and to the hospitals to which it is intended to give a part of the one-third and unless you have some person to deal with the entire matter I can see nothing but confusion resulting. There is no definition in the Act of an institution &ldquo;wholly or partly maintained by a local authority&rdquo; and, if <Col N="1453" /> we interpret it logically, it will include practically all the voluntary hospitals, because these hospitals receive a certain amount from the rates either directly or indirectly.  I can see nothing but confusion resulting from the present arrangement and I support Senator Connolly's amendment.</P>

      <P>I ask the House to reject this amendment.  This question was very fully debated here on the Committee Stage of this Bill. A more moderate amendment proposed by Senators Connolly and Comyn was then rejected by the House.  That amendment proposed that the Minister should consult with the committee of reference.  Not satisfied with that rejection, Senator Connolly now wishes&mdash; this is a sort of Sibyline Book affair&mdash; to bring forward a very much stronger amendment&mdash;that the Minister, in consultation with the committee of reference, shall distribute the money.  For the reasons that I gave on the last occasion, which I shall not weary the House by repeating, I urge the Seanad to reject this amendment.  In addition I should like to ask: How on earth could this arrangement conceivably work?  The Minister is to decide &ldquo;in consultation with the committee of reference.&rdquo; Suppose the Minister has one view and the committee of reference has another, how is the question to be decided?  In another part of the Bill, there is a provision under which the Minister for Justice receives a report from the committee, and on that report he makes up his mind.  His decision is final.  Here, if two members of the committee of reference held one view and the Minister held another, how would a decision be arrived at? The whole arrangement would be completely and entirely unworkable.</P>

      <P>Apart from that, I would ask the House to reject the amendment for the reason that they rejected a similar amendment the other day.  All the committee of reference is set up to do is to consider the position of the other hospitals. Those other hospitals, as Senator Sir Edward Bigger has pointed out, may be rate-aided hospitals, but they are under the management of private hospital boards.  It is not desirable that a Government Department should interfere in their management nor is it desirable that a Government Department should have too much to do with them.  In the other part of the Bill where there are poor law hospitals catered for, where the needs of institutions are known to the Department of Local Government and Public Health and where the officials of the Department are available to make any desired inquiries, it is quite unnecessary to bring in any other persons.  If this committee of reference has&mdash;as I trust it will have&mdash;a competent architect, it seems to me that it would be completely unnecessary to send round that architect to visit every one of these local institutions before it would receive a single penny.</P>

      <P>The Minister has stated that this amendment is practically the same as an amendment rejected on Committee Stage.  If that were so, I would not have allowed the amendment to appear on the Order Paper.  I do not think the amendment is similar to the amendment moved on the last Stage.  The amendment then moved was in the following terms: &ldquo;To add at the end of the sub-section the words &lsquo;and for this purpose the Minister for Local Government and Public Health shall prepare a scheme&rsquo;&rdquo;.  The words &ldquo;shall prepare a scheme&rdquo; were put in the amendment, in my opinion, to bring it into conformity with Section 3, where the committee of reference is set up for a specific purpose.  Senator Connolly desired to have a specific <Col N="1455" /> scheme provided for the purpose of using the committee of reference. That is quite different from the present amendment.  If the Minister for Local Government is to consult with the committee of reference, he must have a scheme and there is no scheme provided for.  The appropriate Standing Order states: &ldquo;... No amendment previously rejected in Committee of the whole Seanad shall be in order except by leave of the Cathaoirleach, which leave shall only be given on the ground that the subject matter thereof has been insufficiently debated.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If you will allow me to say so, I was not in the slightest degree impugning your ruling. The amendment I had in mind was the other amendment which stated &ldquo;The committee of reference appointed under Section 3 of this Act shall, when requested by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health so to do, report to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health as to the proportions in which the said one-third of such available surplus should be divided between the institutions mentioned in such scheme.&rdquo;  I do not say that that amendment is identical with the present amendment but the principle running through it is very similar.</P>

      <P>In connection with this I do not think that the Senator fully realises the difficulties that might arise if the Seanad adopted his amendment.  The committee of reference in the first instance is appointed, as the Minister has stated, to advise him as regards the other hospitals of which there are a considerable number and which are stated fully in the scheme.  But this 33? per cent. of the total receipts is to be placed at the disposal of the Minister for Local Government and he has to administer these funds to the various public hospitals such as county infirmaries that did not come under the scheme, and hospitals in connection <Col N="1456" /> with what were the old workhouses and so on, and if the committee of reference were to go into every one of these all through the country and make a report it would delay the thing considerably, and it would be Tibb's Eve before the money was distributed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The consensus of opinion of those who have had practical experience of hospital work and administration was, on the last occasion, in the direction of emphasising the importance of some co-ordination of the work of hospitals throughout the country.  I think it was admitted that private hospitals and public hospitals are doing similar work in many cases.  There is a certain amount of overlapping and, at any rate, the dividing line between the class of work they are doing is very fine indeed. I support the amendment on the ground that it will give some grounds for hope that there will be an attempt at co-ordination of hospital work throughout the country.  For instance, there was talk about certain big undertakings in Dublin.  I wonder ought they to have any relation to the development of country hospitals and poor law institutions?  I think they ought, and I think the Minister who is administering the one-third ought to have a direct means of knowing what is being done by the other private hospitals throughout the country.  In that way there will be some way of relating the hospital needs of the country to the facilities available, whether they are poor law institutions or private hospitals, and I think this committee of reference would at least help the Minister for Local Government to administer his one-third, having regard to the requirements of and means available in the private hospitals throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator Johnson simply wishes to see is the setting up of a commission to inquire into the administration of all hospitals in this country.  I do not venture any opinion as to whether such a commission is or is not necessary.  I do not see how it can assist in deciding how much money <Col N="1457" /> should go to individual hospitals. There will be a sum available for large hospitals.  It would take a committee all its time to examine the books and the structural needs of all the voluntary hospitals, of which there are a large number.  If you double that number, as Senator Barrington has pointed out, you will never get there at all, whereas the individual needs are probably now known to the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with Senator Johnson.  I think that the requirements of the rate-aided hospitals must inevitably depend upon the development of other institutions in the area that are getting benefit under the sweepstakes.  I have in mind where such an arrangement as this would be of great benefit.  It is in reference to the town of Navan.  If my information is correct, you have a hospital there which benefits under the present sweep.  It is a voluntary hospital, but you also have in the town of Navan a county infirmary.  The voluntary hospital has been equipped with an X-ray apparatus, and I understand that provision has been made by the board of health to instal an X-ray apparatus in the county infirmary.  Speaking purely as a layman, I cannot see any necessity for two X-ray installations in the small town of Navan.  If such a committee as this were in operation, it could advise the Minister to make arrangements for the county infirmary to provide X-ray treatment for those patients who were going into the public institution.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Does the Senator think that the officials of the Department of Local Government will not ask immediately what equipment there is in the town?  If there is suitable equipment they will say: &ldquo;You do not want it; you won't get a grant for it.&rdquo;  Unless I am totally mistaken &mdash;I hate trusting my memory&mdash;no hospital in Meath has received any benefit under any scheme up to the present, nor is one even included.</P>

I should like to know what position would the committee of three be in to advise the Minister in regard to the county infirmaries?  What knowledge would they have of the condition of affairs in the rate-aided hospitals?  I should like to know what useful purpose could be served with regard to the allocation of the grant to the county infirmaries. If the case can be made that these people would be in a position to give useful information to the Minister, if these people were familiar with the work and the organisation of the charitable and voluntary hospitals, well and good; but I fail to see how they can advise the Minister as to which county infirmary would be entitled to a larger grant than the other.  For that reason, I think the amendment would not serve a useful purpose.</P>

      <P>I have no interest in the personnel of this committee, but I should imagine that the members would be selected for the judgment they would bring to bear upon the allocation of the fund for voluntary hospitals.  If that is the purpose for which they are required, I do urge that they could bring the same knowledge and judgment to bear in relation to the rate-aided hospitals.  The best argument in favour of this amendment has been put forward by Senator Johnson, because this committee of <Col N="1459" /> three will be a co-ordinating influence between the two Departments.  They will advise the Minister for Justice in relation to the voluntary hospitals, and they will advise the Minister for Local Government in relation to the other hospitals, which are wrongly called rate-aided hospitals.  All the hospitals in Ireland are rate-aided one way or the other.  It is because of the element of co-ordination that this committee will function, not by way of over-riding any of the Ministers, but by way of advising the Ministers.  That is the chief advantage of this amendment, and it is the reason I would ask Senator Farren to support it.</P>

      <P>I think that, having voted for the idea of a consultative body being associated with the Minister in regard to these county hospitals, I ought to explain the reason now why I do not think it is right to vote for this amendment.  I do not think this amendment would accomplish what I had in my mind when I voted for a scheme to be prepared by the Minister that we could have approved of.  I do not believe this committee of reference appointed to assist the Minister for Justice would be the right committee at all to deal with the counties, and for that reason I do not think it an amendment I can vote for.  I think the Seanad ought to consider its position. We did everything we could to persuade the Seanad the last day about the principle that there should be a consultative body, and we were definitely defeated.  If the Seanad were to vote for this now, I think it would be going back on a thing it had defeated. It would not be dignified or right, and <Col N="1460" /> I should not like to ask the Seanad to do a thing reversing a decision they had already arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that nearly all the points that have been raised have been answered one by one.  The Minister for Justice falls back on the fact that the officials of the Department and the Minister for Local Government have all the details and all the information necessary to guide them in the distribution of this one-third.  It surely applies to more Ministries than one, and if it is so in one Ministry and so in another Ministry, why is the Minister for Justice fortified by a committee of reference of three?  Senator Toal is, of course, perfectly happy with the Minister for Local Government, and quite content to abide by his decision so far as he is interested in county council operations.  I mentioned to the Senator yesterday that there are other county councils that would not be quite so happy to leave their fate in the hands of the Minister for Local Government.  They are, perhaps, not so satisfied as our friend from the County Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge the fact that the Seanad was defended by the Cathaoirleach against the Minister to-day.  The Minister, like a good many Ministers here, tries to put an occasional one over and it is a relief to know that the Cathaoirleach was in a position to deal with that in a proper way.  The Minister referred to architects visiting homes all through the country, and some Senators said it was practically impossible to get a committee of reference.  The committee of reference, whether it is three or five, would, it is to be presumed, be intelligent men who would analyse the merits, the rights and the interests of the various county homes and hospitals throughout the country, and would, on evidence submitted to them by the local government bodies, or any other evidence they could get, submit what would be right in the distribution of one-third of the funds.  We are giving one-third of what is charity money. We are not dealing with rates.  We do believe it will go to the alleviation <Col N="1461" /> of rates.  It is going to absolve the Minister, and the Minister's subsidiary Departments throughout the country from a certain rating.</P>
    <P>I do claim, as it is charity money, that there is no reason why a Minister, and particularly the Minister for Local Government, should be entrusted with this gigantic sum which is likely to be left entirely at his discretion.  In spite of what Senator Toal says, that his county and his area would be well looked after, I am quite certain people in other areas might not be so well looked after.  Ordinary common justice and common sense dictate that a certain advisory body should be available to advise the Minister.  Senator Johnson and Senator Bigger raised very important points which I had in mind, not so distinctly and clearly, however, as they made in their arguments.</P>
    <P>The question of the co-ordination of the work throughout the country should be dealt with by such a committee of reference.  I stress the fact that the Minister for Justice has got <Col N="1462" /> to have this committee of reference for his activities, and I do argue that it is much more vital to the distribution of this money that the Minister for Local Government should have a committee of reference which would, at least, check the distribution of it. While the Minister was out I stressed the point concerning the officials of the Local Government Board.  I am satisfied regarding the integrity of these men, but I am also satisfied that all sorts of opinions will operate with the Minister and that the official head &mdash;as in the case of all good officials&mdash; will do what he is told.</P>
    <P>I propose to go on with this amendment and I do urge on the House that it is essential for the distribution of this great amount of money, which is charitable money, not out of the Exchequer, that this committee of reference can be availed of and, accordingly, I ask the favourable consideration of the Seanad for the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not feel it would be wise to let this Bill go through without passing some comment on the matter contained in it.  I intended putting down certain amendments to it, but I came to the conclusion, after a considerable study of the Bill, that it would simply be a matter of negativing the whole clause of the agreement, particularly Section 2.  My objection to this clause has already been stated, but I doubt if it is fully appreciated by the House.  Section 2 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Agreement and notwithstanding anything contained in the Irish Free State Constitution Act, 1922, or the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1922, or the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) Act, 1922, passed by the Provisional Parliament of Ireland, or the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922, passed by the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State, or any order made under any of those Acts, the constitution of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons under the Charters and the Veterinary Surgeons Acts and the powers and duties formerly vested in or imposed on that College of holding examinations for the purpose of testing the fitness of persons to practise as veterinary surgeons and of granting as a result of such examinations diplomas qualifying for registration in the general veterinary register and other diplomas in veterinary science or any branch thereof...</P>

      <P>The section continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...shall be deemed not to have <Col N="1464" /> been affected by the establishment of the Irish Free State and, for the purpose of the preparation and keeping of the general veterinary register, the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and their officers shall, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, have and may exercise in relation to persons, colleges and matters in the Irish Free State all such powers, jurisdictions, and authorities under the Charters and the Veterinary Surgeons Acts as the said Council and their officers formerly had and might exercise under the Charters and the said Acts for that purpose in relation to persons, colleges, and matters in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am assuming, but perhaps it is a wrong assumption, that all Senators have read the Agreement.  Many Senators will be more concerned than I with the sacred nature of the Constitution of the Free State.  At the same time, I think it is a mistake to allow this measure to go through without protesting against the potential amendment of the Constitution which is contained in this clause.  At the moment I do not know that it cuts across any particular Article of the Constitution, but it is quite clear that if there is any conflict between the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and the Constitution, or any Acts of the Irish Free State, the will of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons prevails and the Constitution and enactments of the Free State Parliament have to be subordinated to the will of that College.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted that this Agreement was the best he could secure.  I submit there are certain limits beyond which the Minister, or the Oireachtas, should not be prepared to go in perfecting any Agreement.  I submit that in this Agreement we have one instance.  This Agreement does not carry out even the will of the British Parliament.  It is true the Right Honourable J. H. Thomas signed the Agreement, but he did that for a comparatively subordinate body in England, the Royal College of <Col N="1465" /> Veterinary Surgeons.  It is neither dignified nor right that our Constitution and enactments of the Oireachtas should be set aside in deference to the will of any such subordinate body as the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.</P>
    <P>There are many people in this country who have been vitally affected by reason of the altered conditions since the Treaty.  We have civil servants who might reasonably argue that, by reason of the fact that their activities are going to be confined to this country, the scope for progress for very brilliant men or women is thereby limited.  Ordinary workers could argue that by virtue of their position in the Free State as compared with the position of similarly placed persons in Northern Ireland or Britain they are deprived of certain benefits such as pensions at 65 and uncovenanted benefits, commonly known as the dole.  No doubt in comparison with workers in those other places they feel they are suffering certain hardships.  I think we cannot reasonably argue that the veterinary surgeons of this country will be suffering any greater hardships than any other people.</P>
    <P>Speaking now from the material, and not from the national or spiritual point of view, the position is that certain advantages were supposed to accrue to citizens through the creation of the Free State.  Inevitably in certain cases certain disadvantages had to be encountered because of the limitations of the country.  I do not see that a reasonable case could be made for the veterinary surgeons of this country to ensure that they will not suffer any hardship.  My own conviction is that the Bill should afford sufficient scope for the development of veterinary science so as to enable us to assimilate all the graduates who would be turned out by the College of Veterinary Surgeons in this country. I suggest it would be better for us to do without the privileges, whatever they may be, involved in membership of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  We should create, within our own State, a College in which the <Col N="1466" /> degree will be a purely Irish degree. I believe that if the educational authorities and the Irish Veterinary College established a sufficiently high standard, in a very short time the degree of the Irish College could be made equal to that of the British Royal College. Professional degrees of that type can quickly be established if it becomes generally known that the standard is high, and that in order to obtain the degree students must possess at least all the qualifications necessary for a similar degree in other countries.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that there is any justification for association with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  There is certainly no reason why such association should be made the basis of an Agreement under which the Constitution of our country and certain enactments of the Oireachtas are set aside I am not so vitally concerned with the honour and the credit of the Constitution. From a political point of view I might well argue that it would be a good thing to see the Constitution changed.  As a Party we have hope to see it very drastically changed, and we will take all possible steps to see that certain things that are in it to-day will be removed.  We would like to see going into it now such changes as would tend to lead towards national progression.  This particular measure is, in my opinion, a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>I am not sufficiently well versed in legal technicalities to be able to state the purpose of the various Constitution Amending Acts that have been passed through this House.  I know there is a considerable difference of opinion, even amongst the leading members of the Bar, with regard to them.  I do resent this clause appearing in an Agreement which is signed on behalf of Britain by the Rt. Honourable J. H. Thomas and on behalf of the Free State by the Minister because, to my mind, it automatically sets aside any Article of the Constitution, or any Act of the Oireachtas, which may run in conflict with a decisíon of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  It might be humiliating to have to bow the knee to <Col N="1467" /> eminent lawyers, and it might be humiliating to have to bow the knee to the medical profession; but certainly bowing the knee to decisions of the cow-doctors of England is something beyond my idea of what we ought to stand for in this House.  I propose to vote against this measure.</P>

      <P>I was very much interested in the speech made by Senator Connolly.  In so far as his general arguments are concerned, I may be in agreement with them.  I agree with him that the issue is simply whether we are prepared to make an Agreement with another politically independent country which we believe is of material benefit to this country as a whole.  The question is whether we are prepared, while the Agreement lasts, because the Agreement can be ended, to agree that we will act in a perfectly independent manner for the purpose of securing certain material benefits.  That is really what this Agreement means, and it is just the same in the case of the Agreement relating to the medical profession.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to Senator Connolly, and to the House, that it is because we are independent in our Constitution, and in other respects, that this matter has to be done by way of agreement.  It is because this State is absolutely independent that this matter could not be carried out either in England or here except through a specific agreement. It means that while that agreement lasts we will agree to do certain things which we would not be bound to do otherwise, constitutionally.  Whether it is worth it in the case of the veterinary surgeons is purely a matter of opinion.  If it were a matter of particular persons anxious to take out degrees in this country, persons who desired to study the science of veterinary surgery here and then go to other countries, I would be inclined to agree with Senator Connolly that that is not the material benefit that is sought through this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real aim is that, while we are doing an enormous trade with our <Col N="1468" /> friends on the other side of the water, we feel that it would be extremely dangerous for us to place ourselves in the position that they might refuse to take certain certificates relating to cattle diseases and other diseases.  I hope that the time will come when, under legislation which we are promised following this Bill, the standard here will be recognised as so highly satisfactory that agreements such as this will not be considered necessary.  I will vote for the Bill because I think the Agreement it embodies is a wise one.  I do not believe that a country such as ours, independent constitutionally and as far as Parliamentary action is concerned, making an agreement with another country in a similar position is <i>infra dig.</i>  It is because in regard to legislative matters we are completely independent that we have made this Agreement.</P>

      <P>I will support the Fifth Stage of this measure.  Candidly, I believe the Bill, as it is at the present moment, is practically useless, but I am supporting it in the hope that the amendments which were inserted here will be rejected in the Dáil and the measure will come back to us as it originally stood.  The new clauses that have been inserted in the Bill leave it absolutely useless as an effective measure.  This is a Bill to regularise the veterinary profession. As the Bill stands every man in the country holding the title of veterinary surgeon, whether he be a quack or not, can practise; nothing can be said to him.  If we want to have a proficient veterinary profession in the country we must give the legitimate practitioners every protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time the veterinary surgeons, with the exception of those who live in the big centres of population, could not possibly exist on the amount of work that they get unless, of course, they hold public appointments. I understand that recently a number of Government appointments, under the Fresh Meat and other Acts, were advertised.  We actually had to advertise in the English papers in <Col N="1469" /> order to get veterinary surgeons to fill the appointments.  We had not enough men in the country to take up the positions.  What is the reason for that? I repeat that unless a veterinary surgeon in this country has some public appointment he could not possibly exist on his practice.  What have the quacks, who have been given so much consideration by this House, done in the way of research work? What have they done to eliminate such diseases as foot and mouth and tuberculosis?</P>
    <P>I am supporting this Bill in the hope that the amendments inserted here will be rejected in the Dáil and it will be sent back to us as it stood originally. Senator Connolly suggests that the veterinary surgeons should not be subject to the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  If that were the position how would we stand?  If foot and mouth disease, or other contagious diseases, were prevalent the British Government could adopt the attitude they are adopting at the moment.  If Senator Connolly goes to the country and declares that we can carry on without England, the farmers will give him his answer.  It is all right for Senator Connolly to utter those phrases here and to speak in the strain in which he has spoken, but if he goes down to the country and repeats those statements to the farmers there he will be in a totally different atmosphere.  He might be inclined to change his expressions. <Col N="1470" /> The farmers thoroughly understand the position because they know what it means if foot and mouth disease breaks out.  They know the effect of restrictions which are imposed, justly imposed in many cases because of the seriousness of the disease.</P>

      <P>I wish to call attention to the fact that veterinary surgeons are being sent to the Gaelic-speaking districts without any knowledge of Irish.  It has been the practice for the Dáil to send measures up here without any clause making it compulsory to have a knowledge of the Irish language.  There was a time, not very long ago, when members were sufficiently independent to vote against their own Ministers on the subject of Irish being made compulsory.  I am sorry to say that attitude has been completely altered and even those whom we regarded as good Gaels have now completely succumbed in obedience to their masters and they vote against compulsory Irish, even in the Gaelic-speaking districts.  I am afraid the Seanad has also come to that low pitch because Senators will not act according to their consciences.  I hope some day that these things will be remedied and that some common sense will be used in the appointment of people who will be allocated to districts where only the language of the Gael is spoken.</P>
