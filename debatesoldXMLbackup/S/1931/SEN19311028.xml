      <P>The first item on the Orders of the day is the Heller Citizenship Bill, 1931.  Formal objection having twice been taken, the Second Stage of this Bill was fixed by me for Wednesday, 14th October.  The Minister for External Affairs was not able to be here on that day and the view was expressed that the House should not proceed with the Bill in his absence.  It was, therefore, arranged that the Second Reading should be taken on a date to be fixed by me, and by arrangement with the Minister I placed it on the Order Paper for to-day.</P>
      <P>As regards No. 2 on the Order Paper, the Apprenticeship Bill, 1930, under Standing Order 74 a Bill initiated in the Dáil, not being a Money Bill, may not be placed on the Order Paper for its Second Stage before the expiration of three clear days after it has been received from the Dáil by the Clerk.  The Apprenticeship Bill, 1930 was passed by the Dáil on Friday last, and the certified copy thereof was received by the Clerk on the same day. It was accordingly placed on the Order Paper for to-day.  It was subsequently discovered that this certified copy contained a serious error, the Bill has had to be reprinted, and the correct copy, duly certified, was only received by the Clerk this morning.  In the circumstances, we cannot take this Bill to-day, and it will appear on the Order Paper for Wednesday next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No. 3 on the Order Paper is the Second Stage of the Town Tenants Bill, 1930.  The Minister for Justice is indisposed, and he has accordingly asked for this Bill to be postponed.  It will <Col N="2058" /> appear on the Order Paper for Wednesday next.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for External Affairs will deal with Nos. 4 and 7 on the Order Paper, which would ordinarily be dealt with by the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>I gave notification that I wanted to move an objection to the consideration of this Bill by the Seanad.  I make the objection at this stage because I understand that it has been laid down almost as a practice&mdash;it has been suggested by one authority as a practice&mdash;that where there is opposition taken root and branch to the principle of a Bill, it is better to move that objection on the Second Stage rather than have the promoters put to the expense of Committee proceedings only to have the same objection in principle moved at a later stage. Therefore, in the interests of the promoters as well as everybody else, I take exception to this Bill right at the start.</P>
      <P>I will state my objections briefly. Legislation regarding the acquisition of nationality is in course of preparation. It has not yet been completed, and when it will be brought forward I cannot say.  It must yield to Bills that are more urgent.  There is no real urgency, no special urgency, with regard even to the general conditions for the acquisition of citizenship in this country.  Until the normal procedure for acquiring citizenship in the country has been laid down, it seems to me that it is premature to pass a Bill of this sort; it would be an exception to any ordinary law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the acquisition of citizenship, acquisition by way of Private Bill procedure is not known in every country.  In the countries in which it is known, it is always regarded as something of an exception&mdash;<Col N="2059" /> a diversion of ordinary law to suit the interests of some individual for reasons stated.  In this instance I have two objections.  The first is that it is premature to establish what is an exception before the normal rules have been laid down, and the second is that no case of urgency has been made either publicly or privately with regard to this particular individual.  No reason is given why, if he wants to acquire citizenship, he should move now rather than a year hence when the ordinary code will be in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that we have an assurance from the Minister that a general measure dealing with citizenship is being prepared, I think it would scarcely be proper to have a special measure dealing with an individual considered, particularly as no reason for urgency has been stated.  No reason has been given why this individual cannot wait for at least six or twelve months, the period necessary for the passing of the general measure. We have the distinct understanding that we are going to be presented with a general statute dealing with citizenship. It is a thing which has been too long delayed.  It has been a source of great difficulty to lawyers and other people.  It is a matter which, I think, ought to have been dealt with long before this.  However, as we have a promise that it will be dealt with in the immediate future, I think there can be no real objection to the course suggested by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to remedy a position that has already been made public by the Press, a position which has been brought about by a decision of the Supreme Court with regard to the case of Stokes <Col N="2060" /> and another <i>versus</i> Quinn and another. Rules with regard to the Circuit Court have been brought forward three times and, for various reasons, have failed to secure passage.  The Circuit Court since it was established has been functioning without any new Rules and without any regulated scale of costs. It had been assumed that the costs lay at the discretion of the court, and that view was acted upon until this decision, which came rather indirectly when another point was raised.  The decision has raised two rather difficult points.  One is that for the future there is no scale excepting the scale that is applicable to the old County Courts, and that is quite unsuitable when one considers the heavier jurisdiction given to the Circuit Courts. The second point is that by reason of the judgment a doubt has been cast upon awards already made.  It is considered necessary, therefore, to validate these, and that is done by a declaratory section in Section 2 of the Bill as brought forward.</P>
      <P>The proposal is that until such time as the new Rules come into operation, and that, under the motion which is down to-day, would be the 1st January, 1932, a certain procedure would be followed in those circumstances.  After that the Rules will hold.  There are two smaller points referred to&mdash;one is with regard to appeals from the Circuit Court and fixing a scale of costs there; the other is that the leading case, which has brought about this situation, is not interfered with, nor are the costs regulated by that decision dealt with at all.</P>

      <P>As regards these things that have been passed and are finished with, I suppose there is no use going on with the matter, because they cannot be rectified now, and the only thing we can do is to agree with them whether right or wrong.  I understand that that was in a separate Bill, but I am not sure.  So far as what has been passed is concerned, I have nothing to say, but there are some things to which I would like to call attention. One thing is with regard to these courts, prisoners who are to be tried or brought up before them for any offence, outrage or robbery, are not <Col N="2061" /> disposed of at once.  Those prisoners may be kept in custody for a considerable time, when they are to be brought before the court and then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think that is an extraneous matter and does not come under the purview of the Bill which we are discussing.  This is a Bill to make provision in relation to costs and expenses in certain legal proceedings.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot oppose this Bill, because it is urgently necessary, having regard to the fact that the decision referred to by the Minister would really render illegal all the decisions previously arrived at by the Circuit Courts and all the costs awarded by them since the Court of Justice Act came into operation. What happened was this.  The Oireachtas in its wisdom increased the jurisdiction of the local courts.  There used to be County Courts having jurisdiction up to £50 in contracts and up to £30 valuation with regard to lands.  In <Col N="2062" /> other respects it was limited in the same measure.</P>
      <P>You increased the jurisdiction of that local court and you changed its name to the Circuit Court.  But you did not make any provision for a scale of costs in respect of any action in the Circuit Court.  The judges, whose duty it is to administer the law, found it necessary to adopt the principle, which, I think, was a fair principle, that in cases exceeding the old limit of the County Court jurisdiction they would award costs on such a basis as would give to the parties a reasonable indemnity against the expenses that they had sustained.  The judges acted so reasonably that for many years there seemed to have been no objections.  But then a case came up to the Supreme Court from the decision of the Taxing Master in one of the actions tried in the Circuit Court.  When the matter came to be investigated it was seen at once that there was no statutory authority for awarding any costs in the court.  Certainly there was no authority for awarding any costs above the scale that was in existence with regard to the old County Court.  In that case, which did come before the Supreme Court, the costs incurred by the plaintiff were £90.  That included out-of-pocket expenses exceeding, I think, £50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the decision all the plaintiff now gets is £4.  He loses considerably.  He was the successful party and had justice on his side. Now justice has been declared, but at a very considerable loss to him.  I think it is right that the possibility of a repetition of anything like that should be put an end to.  The object of this Bill is to legalise all the assessments of costs which had been made up to the date of the passing of this Bill, and for the future and until a plenary measure is introduced to allow the courts to go on according to the principles which they have hitherto adopted.  These principles were found to work well.  I am very sorry that the Minister found it necessary in this Bill to make a special exception in the case which has been the origin of all the trouble.  That is the case <Col N="2063" /> that went to the Supreme Court.  The exception is made here in Section 3 (2), which reads:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section shall apply to any costs which before the passing of this Act were directed by the Supreme Court to be taxed on any particular principle appointed by that court in respect of those particular costs.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the plaintiff in whose case the illegality, if I may so express it, is discovered, is the one person who will have to suffer.  I think I could not make any serious objection to that, because if the plaintiff were to get more costs than the £4 which had been awarded by the decision of the Supreme Court the defendant would have to pay, and the defendant would be entitled to object.  Moreover, I think it is a very good principle that where a court has arrived at a decision between parties, that decision should not be interfered with by legislation.  I think the principle is good, but the particular individual suffers considerably.</P>
    <P>The reason I go so fully into that is with the object of making a suggestion to the Minister that the party who suffers under that exception which is here introduced should be indemnified in some way.  There is a precedent for indemnifying a litigant in these circumstances. There was a case from Bray that went to the Privy Council, the decision in which was nullified by legislation. When that case and the Bill dealing with it came before this House, I suggested that the parties should be indemnified, and the parties were in fact indemnified.  I suggest to the Minister that the same rule should be applied in this case.  This is one isolated case which has been the cause of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I have only one other observation to make.  It is a very curious and very unusual thing that Courts of Justice should be compelled to function for a great number of years without proper legislative machinery.  They should have had a scale of costs from the very moment that they started on their judicial work.  These courts have been <Col N="2064" /> working for nearly seven years, and there was no scale of costs to guide them.  No pressure of public business is sufficient to justify a fact of that description.  It may be said that you could not agree as to rules.  The Seanad was responsible once, they say, and the Dáil was responsible on another occasion.  Whoever was responsible, it is somewhat of a reproach to all parties concerned.  I hope that the larger measure, which is to be introduced as a result of the report of the Joint Committee which sat in reference to the Courts of Justice, will be introduced within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>I have another objection to make. It appears that this scale of costs in respect to the Circuit Courts has been the subject of dispute in the Dáil and in the Seanad.  Until it comes before you, I make no observation in regard to that scale of costs except this: that in my opinion the scale of costs is too high.  You may think it is a very remarkable thing for a lawyer to say that the costs are too high, but in my opinion the scale of costs is in many respects excessive and ought to be reduced. It is wrong that litigants should be compelled to pay more than reasonable costs.  It is no advantage to lawyers, because our advantage lies in allowing people to have free access to the courts and getting justice on reasonable terms.</P>

      <P>That is our opinion as lawyers.  We want to do the business which is our profession on reasonable terms.  We want to give the people an opportunity of going to the Courts of Justice; we want to familiarise them with Courts of Justice.  I think that the scale of costs which has been fixed, which was before the Dáil, and which will come before us, is excessive. I have no objection to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I only wish briefly, with no very intimate knowledge of the subject, to re-echo what Senator Comyn has just said.  I have received complaints as to the very heavy scales of costs.  I take it they are ancillary to, if not directly connected with, the <Col N="2065" /> sheriff's fees.  The sheriff's fees are levied on the nominal amount of the decree, but very often the actual collection is very small.  It is all swallowed up by these fees, and it is exceedingly hard on the creditors.  I hope, when the proper time arrives, the matter will receive consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume Senators have had circulated to them the Report of the Tariff Commission on the application for a tariff on leather.  It is out of this application that the present Bill arises.  The Irish Tanners' Association applied for a tariff on harness leather, sole and insole leather.  The matter was considered by the Tariff Commission and objections, amongst others, from the Irish Boot Manufacturers' Association were heard.  The result of the consideration was that the applicants withdrew their application for a tariff on sole and insole leather.  It became clear in the course of the investigation that the tanneries in this country could not meet the requirements of the boot manufacturers.  Apart from any other factor, there was the question of variety.  There is only one tannery really making sole and insole leather here.  It would be impossible for one tannery to supply all the varieties required by the boot manufacturers. The tanners themselves really recognised that.  They were forced to recognise that and they withdrew that part of their application.  The consideration of the matter by the Tariff Commission proceeded, and the Tariff Commission finally recommended a tariff on harness leather and a corresponding tariff on manufactured harness.  The smaller tanneries in the Free State have been working on harness leather solely, and the larger one in Limerick has been making harness leather principally. They have been making that harness leather without any tariff, and they <Col N="2066" /> have been able to maintain themselves and sell the product without the protection of any tariff.  It seems to be reasonably certain that they can supply the needs of the harness manufactures of the Saorstát at a price equivalent to the outside price, or approximately equivalent to it, and supply harness leather of the quality and of the varieties required.</P>
      <P>The tariff, in fact, is one of very little importance.  The number of hands employed is very small, as Senators will have seen from the report, and the prospects of increased employment are correspondingly small. It is really, as I have said, a matter of very little consequence. It will, however, enable these tanneries to keep going, because it secures to them a market which they have perhaps been holding with difficulty.  It may enable the bigger tannery, because its circumstances will be some what easier in this respect, to increase its trade in sole and insole leather. Anybody who has read the report will agree that the time clearly has not come when it would be possible to encourage the manufacture of leather for boots by means of a tariff.  Even if the whole of the leather required for insoles and soles were manufactured here, the tanning industry would be a very small one as compared with the boot industry.  Of course the boot industry itself is not so established that it is possible to interfere with its raw material without having the result of setting it back, if not extinguishing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I will not be accused of being a doctrinaire if I again make a protest against the extension of these tariffs.  I think the Minister rather gave the case away himself when he said that practically very little employment will be given by this, and he made no reference at all, perhaps wisely so, to the burden that it will throw on the primary industry of agriculture.  After all, horses are still the main source of power in the agricultural community.  Tractors have not come in to any great extent, but the House may be pretty well certain that now there will be an increase in the cost, roughly of the amount of the tariff, of harness required by agriculturists.  Of course that is the <Col N="2067" /> principle that runs throughout the whole of this tariff legislation.  What is one man's raw material is another man's finished article.  Harness is the raw material of the chief industry in this country, and agriculturists are going to be mulcted by this indirect tax.  I think anyone who represents the interests of agriculture should really feel very strongly about this and should protest.  I do not know whether it is the accepted policy of the Executive Council practically to follow all the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, but it is only a matter of time until we get to the state from which other countries suffer very much, owing to the burden of tariffs.  I certainly say that we are not being saved by the Tariff Commission, because the Tariff Commissioners have been responsible. In all this there is the point of view of penalising the majority, a larger industry for the benefit of smaller industries.  For that reason I have again to protest against the principle embodied in this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what Senator Sir John Keane has complained of should be listened to very carefully by the Seanad.  We have not got a voice in stopping these things, but we have a right to criticise them.  These are times when every tariff that we put on may presently be used as a weapon against us.  There is no doubt that Great Britain is going to alter her policy.  Our trade with Great Britain is of vital importance, and if the British Government when they come to settle their tariffs find out that the Irish Free State is putting sundry tariffs on small things like leather and against the importation of goods from Great Britain, this sets an example to them, and gives them an excuse for putting up tariffs against us which may be far more damaging.  If they were to protect sundry small industries which import their materials from the Free State, by putting a tariff on against the importation of raw material, Ireland would suffer to an extent that, I am sure, the Tariff Commission did not consider when recommending tariffs on little things like this.  I think our Government should be very careful about what they do at <Col N="2068" /> the present moment, and should have an eye on the future, because undoubtedly one of the things which will require most negotiations, probably in the immediate future, will be the question of tariffs that will be put on by Great Britain on sundry goods. Whether we will come into the matter or not I do not know.  Every little tariff of this description that is put on means handing over a weapon to the other side to be used against us the moment they want to put a tariff against anything that we produce. Senator Sir John Keane was quite right in his view that, although these are things of trival importance, behind them is a principle that our Government should seriously consider.  I doubt if it is a wise thing to do at the moment.  Another tariff was imposed the other day on oats, but, not being Scotchmen, I suppose we do not mind what we pay for our porridge.  All the same, it means a tax on goods that can be imported and it can easily be used against us later on.  I hope the Seanad will bear these things in mind, so that we can criticise these changes that are being made.  I hope that we will not have any more tariffs until we have to consider the taxes put on our goods going into another country.</P>

      <P>If you were there yesterday and if you were a candidate with Mr. Henderson and Mr. Clynes you would have been snowed under like them.  It is perfectly obvious that Great Britain is going to have a general tariff.  Of course it is a matter for the Executive Council what they will do in face of that general tariff.  I think there is food for thought and reflection on the part of the Executive Council, and on the part of every member of the Dáil and Seanad in the results of the elections in England which are being announced from hour to hour, but that is another <Col N="2069" /> day's work.  I am in favour of this tariff on leather, even on harness leather, and even for the reason that was so ably suggested by Senator Jameson.  If the British have a general tariff, and if we impose a tariff against England, will they use the tariff weapon against us?  Probably they will, but still, has it never occurred to Senaton Jameson that when they arm themselves with a tariff weapon it would be just as well for us to have a few tariffs to go on with, because it is easier to keep a tariff on than to put it on? When the Minister for Finance is negotiating with them about tariffs it will be much easier for him to say: &ldquo;I have a small tariff on leather.  It does not matter very much and you do not want me to take it off.&rdquo;  But if he were to say: &ldquo;I want to put on an extra duty on shoe leather&rdquo; I think he would find his task somewhat more difficult.  For that reason, in order to be first at the fair, I am in favour of this tariff, even on the argument adduced by Senator Jameson.</P>

      <P>I am not in a perpetual state of tremor as to what is going to happen to us from the people across the water.  As far as I know of them, and as far as history tells, they imposed whatever tariffs they liked on this country and took them off as they wished without the least regard to our opinions or interests.  All the industries of this country were ruined by the manipulation of the people across the water who pursued a certain line with regard to Free Trade and other matters, because it was in their own interest to do so.  Undoubtedly, they did that looking to their own interests and not to ours.  Now we are expected to be shivering and shaking.  We are told: &ldquo;You must wait and see what the people over there are going to do for fear they may stick another knife into our backs.&rdquo;  We know what is happening at the other side of the water.  The two Senators who have spoken undoubtedly take&mdash;I do not suppose they deny it&mdash;a great interest in what happens on the other side of the water.  But the people at the other side, whom we have always followed humbly and meekly, have now decided that their policy was all wrong.  I <Col N="2070" /> would have expected that these Senators would follow suit and not tell them to stick to their old policy.  A change has taken place at the other side.  The whole world is changing. We must fight our own battle as hard as ever we can without too much regard for the interests of other people, because they take no interest whatever in us.  They are no more likely to put a tax on us because we impose certain tariffs than if we did not pursue that policy.</P>

      <P>I do not see how the Oireachtas can decline to pass a recommendation of this kind as long as we have a Tariff Commission and maintain our present system of imposing tariffs after a full and careful examination of all applications has been made by that Commission.  The only grounds on which the Oireachtas could refuse to pass this would be if the Executive Council were prepared to take the responsibility of saying that there were specific reasons why this particular recommendation could not be carried out.  What brought me to my feet was the two speeches we had from the Fianna Fáil Benches. These speeches, I presume, may be taken as being more or less representative of the point of view of the Party.  I am not at all surprised that Senator Colonel Moore, a retired military gentleman, is not at all alarmed at the possibility that tariffs may injure exports from this country.  I am not for a moment suggesting that the Senator is callous, but rather that he does not appreciate the fact that a general tariff policy in Great Britain is not a matter to play with.  It is not a matter to be regarded as child's play, but is a very serious problem, perhaps the most serious which this country has had to face since the Free State was established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not convinced that the method suggested by the other Fianna Fáil spokesman of having a few little tariffs to play with is going to make any difference in dealing with the serious situation which may arise, but to my mind such a method is childish. The reason the Senator advocates this tariff on harness leather is that he could go along with a piece of harness <Col N="2071" /> and with it, no doubt, would be able to prevent, by bargaining, any tariff being placed against exports from this country.  I do not think that the question can be dealt with that way.  I do not think that we are in a position to deal with it that way.</P>
    <P>Senator Colonel Moore says that we know what is happening at the other side.  The Senator may know, but I certainly do not, and I do not think that the huge Party which apparently at the moment is being elected at the other side, knows itself what is its policy.  I believe that the Executive Council of the Free State will have to watch the situation very carefully from the point of view of this country, to see how far it may be within their power to prevent damage being done to such exports as we have.  I do not think that we have any great reason to be alarmed if there is a commonsense policy followed, but if we think that we can meet that situation either by the Fianna Fáil policy which we heard expounded here to-day of having a few little tariffs to play with, or by the other Fianna Fáil policy which we read of in this morning's paper of putting a tariff immediately on everything, and seeing what we can let in, then my opinion is, that if either policy is going to be employed to deal with the situation, we have excellent reasons to be shivering in our shoes.  The situation that may develop on the other side is, I think, bound to be reflected in this country, because although we are large purchasers from England we are also exporters to England.  As purchasers from England this Parliament is not concerned very much as to how that situation will develop, but we are concerned to maintain our trade with England, and that can only be done by making a certain amount of purchases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to discuss the very big general matters that were raised on this little tariff.  The tariff was imposed in pursuance of the general Government policy of having all proposals for tariffs investigated by the Tariff Commission.  Generally speaking, we act on the report of the Tariff Commission.  The Government are satisfied that tariffs are necessary here.  They are satisfied <Col N="2072" /> that it is necessary to develop manufacturing industry here, and that cannot be done without tariffs.  We believe, on the other hand, that there are industries in respect of which tariffs would be applied for, but in respect of which tariffs should not be granted because the industries are not suitable and cannot be economically carried on.  The Tariff Commission has been appointed to investigate all applications for tariffs, and to report whether in any particular case the granting of a tariff would be in the best interests of the community at large.  So far every recommendation of the Tariff Commission has been adopted.  We have pursued the same policy in regard to this tariff, even though the effects of it will be very small.  It cannot cause a great deal of employment.  On the other hand, I do not think that it can impose any appreciable burden on agriculture.  A great proportion of the harness requirements of the agricultural community are manufactured here, and will continue to be manufactured perhaps to a somewhat larger degree. I do not think that any appreciable burden will be thrown upon the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the near future we may very easily have very difficult negotiations to conduct with the British Government, but meantime there is no reason at all why we should not go on with our policy in the ordinary way.  If we are going to strike any bargain with Great Britain, then we can strike that bargain and abide by it, but I do not think that we need fear that anything that we may have to do, any negotiations which we may have to carry on in the future, will be prejudiced by our proceeding in the ordinary way with our tariff policy.  After all, the tariffs that exist in the Free State are very low compared with the tariffs that exist in Canada, Australia, and South Africa.  If we have reasons for desiring good commercial relations with Great Britain, I think that the British people have equally good reasons for desiring good commercial relations with us, and while I would not impose tariffs to spite any British Government or any British industry, on the other hand, until it becomes a question of striking <Col N="2073" /> a bargain, I would not refrain from imposing any tariff because of any considerations affecting the people on the other side.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to Article 12 of this Treaty.  There is part of the Article which states:</P>
      <P>In view of the licence duties which are levied in the Irish Free State on commercial travellers representing French firms trading in goods liable to excise duty in the Irish Free State, the French Government reserves the right to impose equivalent licence duties on commercial travellers representing Irish firms trading in certain goods liable to consumption taxes in France.</P>
      <P>I was not aware that there was any licence duty on French commercial travellers in this country and I was wondering whether this was put in in anticipation of such a licence being imposed or whether the Minister has any explanation to make in regard to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can deal with the point raised by the Senator in a moment. The reason for entering into negotiations for a Treaty with France at all, was that owing to certain taxes being put on French wines here&mdash;which were held by the French Government to be, if not the highest, amongst the highest <Col N="2074" /> levied on such wines in any country in the world&mdash;there was a disposition on the part of the French Government to withdraw the most favoured nation treatment which our goods were receiving on entry into France.  The fact that they did achieve that position depended on an old Anglo-French Convention of many years ago and as is the case, on any State coming into control of its resources for the first time, there is a peculiar mixed position in law with regard to old Treaties.  It really depends on the wishes of the two parties whether they should be continued or regarded as non-existent. There was, however, a fear that unless direct Treaty negotiations were opened up and concluded, the good position which we had enjoyed would disappear. Under the terms of the Treaty, we do get most favoured nation treatment on everything.  There are very few countries in the world who have achieved that position and there is none but ourselves who have achieved it in recent years.  We have also got a special exemption from the prohibition which rules in regard to imported spirits.  We have got a special exemption in regard to Irish whiskey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point raised by Senator O'Farrell is really to cover one small point of practice in this country and what is actually the practice in France.  Most commercial travellers in France must have licences.  In this country commercial travellers generally do not have licences.  A traveller who is known to have a good house behind him and who travels on ordinary business here need not have a licence, but a special exception was made with regard to travellers travelling for spirits liable to excise duty.  That is the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;trading in goods liable to excise duty.&rdquo;  The phrase is to cover what is the main practice in France and a small point of practice in this country.  I desire to call the attention of the House to an erratum which was sent out to substitute certain words in the first paragraph of Article XXIX. It really amounts to this, that the French text is the correct text. Although it is in French, it was actually our text.  The reason for the difference is that the old Convention of 1882 ruled other things <Col N="2075" /> as well as commerce and navigation and the point was raised as to whether or not this Treaty should replace that 1882 Convention in everything. Our view was that it should and that the other matters not dealt with in this Treaty will form the subject of another type of Treaty.  Pending the conclusion of that type of Treaty we have by an exchange of letters consolidated the present position in these other matters.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to raise an objection in respect of matters dealing with our relations with foreign countries about which I know very little.  I rise merely to ask for an opinion on a matter which has been touched upon but not, I think, very fully explained by the Minister.  As I understand the Minister, we now are the assignees of all Conventions arrived at between Great Britain and France before the signing of the Treaty, assignees in so far as they affect the territory of this State.  I would like to have that matter more fully explained if the Minister feels that he ought to give an explanation, because we would like to know exactly where we stand in a matter of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>While the result is the very same as the Senator describes, I would object to his wording of it. We are not assignees under the Treaty. What happens, and it happens not merely with regard to ourselves but with regard to the States which came into being, for instance, on the break away from Russia, where Treaties or Conventions had been entered into under the old <i>régime</i>, is that the new countries, provided the other party to the Treaty agrees, continue to operate as if the Treaty were in existence. There is a vast mass of Treaties and Conventions in existence all of which cannot be considered at the moment. There is no necessity to denounce, renew or remake them until some particular point arises.  The Treaties are allowed by the consent of both people to continue as ruling on a sort of <i>modus vivendi</i> arrangement, until definite Treaties can be established to take their place.</P>

      <P>I would suggest to the Seanad that as the Minister for Justice is not here it would be better to adjourn consideration of these Rules until this day week.  When the Courts of Justice (No. 2) Bill was before the House, I pointed out that some of the items in this scale of costs, which we are now about to pass, are more than they should be. Senator Gogarty thinks that a curious thing for a lawyer to say, or he may think so, but I am convinced we ought to have a discussion on this scale of costs, a discussion in which the Minister for Justice should have an opportunity in taking part.  I do not suppose that we will be able to alter the scale of costs, but I understand that the Government intend to introduce a plenary measure dealing with the Courts of Justice, and I would like to have it on record that some of us at least, including lawyers, object to the high costs set out in the scale. We consider they are too high.  As I said we do not hope to vary this scale of costs, but if they are put into operation we wish to give notice in view of the larger measure which is to be introduced that we consider them a little too high.</P>
