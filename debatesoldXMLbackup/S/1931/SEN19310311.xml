    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy) Richard (General) Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the existing legislation public expenditure in connection with the installation of new sewerage works, new waterworks or extensions of such works has to be related to a fairly wide area of charge so that there may be suitable security for the loans.  At the present moment an area of charge can be fixed for a townland, a dispensary district, a rural district or, in <Col N="426" /> certain cases where the local sanitary authority so resolves, the expenditure may be borne over the whole of the county board of health district.  The experience is that the smaller towns are the places where works of this particular nature are required and the valuations of the smaller towns are such that the area of charge has to be extended over a pretty considerable area of agricultural land.  There is a flat rate over that area and the result is that the area that immediately benefits is charged only the same rate as the hereditaments situated in the farthest part of the area of charge, which may be over either a rural district or a dispensary district.</P>
      <P>When I came into touch with this problem I thought the most desirable thing would be to get county councils to make the county board of health area the area of charge for all these works.  That was done only in one area.  The county councils are not, to a certain extent, tending to travel in that direction at the present time and, personally, I am rather inclined to change my mind as to the desirability of making this charge a county-at-large charge, a flat charge over the county board of health district, for the reason that, when the charge is over the county district, local areas, because the charge is going to be fairly wide-flung, are rather extravagant in their demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Bill makes it possible to do two things.  It makes it possible for the county council to agree that they will levy a small charge, a fraction of a penny, over the county health area as a whole with a view to contributing an annual grant towards paying off the loan charges.  That will be of considerable assistance in these matters. In the second place, it provides that where an area of charge is being set up it may be divided into an area-of-charge proper and a sub-area of charge, so that in the case of a town like Gort, where at present there are proposals to carry out a work running into £2,868, if it has to be borne entirely by the rural districts it would mean a rate of 2¾d.; if borne by the dispensary district, a rate of 6¾d., and if borne by the town itself, a rate of 5/-. <Col N="427" /> These charges for the benefit of the town of Gort would put a fairly substantial charge over a rural district which, it might be argued, did not derive even a remote advantage from the scheme.  If, on the other hand, the county council agreed to give a contribution of £300 a year towards the loan charges, involving only a fraction like one-sixth of a penny in the pound over the county health area, then it would mean ½d. on the rural district as a whole and 1/- on the town in order to give Gort the scheme it wants.  That is a sample of what the Bill sets out to do.</P>
    <P>The principle generally will be agreed upon that the area immediately benefiting ought to contribute at a higher rate than the agricultural land which happens to be in the dispensary or the rural district.  It is an advisable thing that county authorities would assist those schemes from the county at large charge.  In giving assistance of this particular kind it will be possible for any county assisting whatever number of schemes it may decide to assist to raise a rate not greater than 1½d. in the pound or, with the sanction of the Minister, not greater than 3d. in the pound.  The raising of a rate over the county area as a whole will be entirely within the discretion of the local authority.  Considering the problems that arise in the case of smaller towns we in the Department and those engaged on local government work in various parts of the country think that this will be of assistance to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Those members of the Seanad who are not conversant with the system of rating in this country and who wonder at the farmers asking for de-rating of agricultural land, will learn something from this Bill about the ramifications of the rating authorities in the past and the inspirations that will probably affect rating authorities in the future.  The areas that benefited most by those necessary services in the past have not been made pay for them.  As the Minister has explained, the charges were placed upon the dispensary district in which the town was situated, or upon the whole district area, as the case might be.  The <Col N="428" /> Minister now proposes to place the charge over the whole county.  It must be remembered that already necessary services have been established in many parts of the country.  The suggestion is now made that there should be a new tax placed upon the people who have already carried out the requirements of the law in so far as water supply schemes and sewerage schemes are concerned.  I will give the Seanad an example.  The residents of Cloughran are paying for the Malahide water supply; they will be paying also for the Swords lighting and probably for the lighting of Malahide as well.  If anybody in Rathcoole wants a drainage scheme the man in Cloughran will have to contribute to that, too, possibly to the extent of 3d. in the pound.  Surely he ought not to be held liable for the Rathcoole drainage scheme any more than a resident in Dublin City, or any resident of the State as a whole.  Take the case of Kilcoole, one of the watering places along the sea coast.  The people there want a water supply. Under the Minister's scheme Baltinglass, which lies right across the Wicklow hills, will have to pay for the Kilcoole water supply, which will largely be of benefit only to the citizens of Dublin who go down there to bathe. This is the scheme which the Minister in all seriousness asks us to adopt.</P>
      <P>We are waiting for the report of the De-rating Commission.  Senators who may be opposed to the de-rating of land will understand from what I have said that there is a good case to be made out for the farmers who want de-rating.  The Press has never yet published a single argument from the farmer's side.  The papers devote two or three columns to the speech of the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, who argued how unjustifiable de-rating would be, but they do not give a line to the other side of the case.  It has taken the Commission close upon a year to come to a decision, and probably when the report is issued it will not be unanimous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is so solicitous about the welfare of the small towns there are two ways in which he can settle the matter.  He can, for instance, double the rateable value of the towns. I will give my experience of a town in <Col N="429" /> which I was interested some years ago, the town of Rathdrum.  I am aware that three or four of the farmers living outside the town paid more in rates than the whole town of Rathdrum.  The townspeople wanted to place the cost of a water supply scheme on the farmers in the neighbourhood.  They already had one water supply scheme, and after fifteen years that scheme was paid for, but the gentlemen in the town complained that they could not get water at a sufficiently high pressure for their bathrooms.  The result was that they wanted to rope in the farmers to pay for a second scheme at a cost of £7,000.  The highest rated house in Rathdrum&mdash;a shop, public-house, grain store, and a wool-buying department; a whole corner block&mdash; had a poor law valuation of £24.  The smallest farmer outside the town was valued for that much.  The man who owned that corner house could make £10,000 a year if he liked, but all the farmer who lived outside the town could make was a living.  We opposed that scheme, and we were successful in our opposition.  The result of the whole thing was that there was 2/6 placed on the town, ½d. on the county-at-large, and ¾d. on the district area.  If we could do that under the existing law where is the necessity for this Bill?  Was it an illegal arrangement? It was done six years ago.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the rateable valuations of the houses in our towns are altogether out of date.  If the Minister does not like to increase the valuations he can give a State subsidy.  If he is so solicitous for the townspeople let him place one-eighth, one-tenth, or one-twentieth on the public-at-large, and he should not be asking the poor fellows in the country, who may be miles away from the town, to pay for schemes that benefit only the town. One farmer near Rathdrum wanted a supply of water and they tried to charge him £5 a year for ever for the supply.  I hope that the Seanad does not agree with this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with all Senator Wilson has said, and I have a great deal of sympathy with the Minister in the difficulty <Col N="430" /> he experiences in providing proper water supplies and sewerage schemes throughout the country.  It seems to me that some effort might be made on the Committee Stage, if the Minister were agreeable, to establish a definite basis for striking rates on an area of charge in such a form that the area that would immediately benefit would be taxed in proportion to its capacity.  Possibly a certain rate might be struck on the rateable occupiers in the immediate vicinity, and the balance then could be borne by the State.  The main feature of this Bill is that it sets out obviously to rectify the existing needs in relation to water supplies and sewerage schemes.  So far as I can see, the Bill will leave us practically no better off than we are to-day. I cannot see the different county councils being agreeable to strike these rates.  Failing such action on the part of the county councils I do not see how the schemes are likely to be developed. It is for that reason I think some more equitable system of rating should be arranged that would secure that what the Minister has in mind would be achieved and that there would be an inducement to the county councils to proceed with such schemes.  The alternative would seem to be that the Minister should take compulsory powers to insist on these schemes being carried out.  I do not know how we would approach that problem or whether the Minister would be inclined to take such powers and to insist that where necessary sewerage and water schemes must be carried out, and councils would be forced to inaugurate those schemes and strike a rate for the purpose.  There does not seem any likelihood otherwise of making any progress towards the establishment of proper water supply and sewerage schemes throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Senator Wilson has said might be taken into account and there might be some modification made in Committee with regard to a definite area of charge over which charges might be made.  If comprehensive schemes for an entire county were worked out, then the county-at-large might be accepted as the area of charge, but the rate for towns which would be most likely to benefit should be increased in proportion <Col N="431" /> to the advantage that would be gained by each town.  These schemes could be worked out on a county basis and they could be taken consecutively or in the order that the Minister's Department would decide.  That would ensure that the requirements in the matter of sewerage and water supply could be covered, while at the same time the ratepayers in the area would not suffer any hardship such as they might be likely to suffer under this Bill.  As Senator Wilson has pointed out, at the present time a man may be paying for benefits to a small town fifteen or twenty miles away from where he is living.  Taking the county councils as they are, it is hardly likely that they will be disposed to strike rates for one particular area.  The representatives from all the other areas will be present and their consent is necessary for the striking of the rate.  I think the most advisable course is either the taking of compulsory powers by the Minister or the setting up of comprehensive county schemes whereby the charge could be equitably distributed over the whole county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelStaines" hpid="Mr. Staines Mr. Staines">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staines</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nobody in the House who has more sympathy with the farmers than I have, but I think that they are very short-sighted on this question of waterworks and sewerage schemes.  Senator Wilson has referred to County Wicklow and County Dublin, and I will confine myself to those counties.  I will take the town of Greystones as an example.  Before the Vartry water supply was connected there, there was practically no town.  When the water supply scheme was completed houses were built and the valuations increased.  Who benefited by the increased valuations?  I say that the people all over Wicklow county benefited.  The people in Baltinglass benefited just as well as the people of Kilcoole, Newcastle, or anywhere else. They got more money in rates from Greystones than was the case before the water supply was connected there. The whole of County Wicklow would also benefit if Kilcoole or Newcastle had a water supply, and it is quite a simple thing to give those two places a water supply.  Let us take Lucan, which is eight miles from Dublin, the <Col N="432" /> capital of the Free State.  It is an absolute disgrace that there is no water supply and no sewerage scheme in Lucan.  I suppose that Lucan at the present time has one of the best tram services in the country&mdash;as good as any on the Dublin United Tramways Company's system.  If a good water supply is given to Lucan you will open up the whole district from Chapelizod to Lucan; you will have people building along there and these buildings in time will be liable to rates.  Who will benefit from such a scheme?  The whole County Dublin will benefit.</P>
      <P>There is another point that seems to be overlooked by farmers.  Suppose a town like Gort or Tuam suffered from a disease epidemic, is that epidemic going to be confined to the town?  It is not; it is going to spread and farmers may lose, perhaps, a son or a daughter.  In the last analysis the farmer will have to pay his share of the maintenance of the people in the fever hospitals.  I think this Bill should be allowed to go through.  It is largely a question of arrangement about the amount of money that should be paid by the people who will benefit.  Senator Wilson says that the people in the country will not benefit.  I say they will benefit.  I believe that where water is supplied there should be a special charge for every house that gets a water supply.  That will do away with a good deal of the cost that has to be borne by the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion this Bill supplies a long-felt want in the country. I happen to be a member of a board of health in one of the neighbouring counties and I know the difficulties we are faced with in trying to provide up-to-date sanitary and water supply schemes in the various villages of our county.  I believe if it were not for some such provision as is made in this Bill a great number of our villages would remain indefinitely without any of the ordinary amenities of civilisation. I do not agree with Senator Wilson, who represents the farming community, when he says that the farmers have no interest in the villages or towns.  I hold that they have a very intimate interest in the villages and towns.  If a town or village is lighted <Col N="433" /> up at night, the scheme of lighting facilitates the country farmer just as much as it facilitates the people of that town or village.</P>
      <P>Take any small town in the country. It is surrounded by a rural area.  The people living in that rural area find it necessary, many times during the year, to visit that small town.  It is because the people in the rural area do so that it is in existence at all.  They help to keep it going.  The farmers in the district market their produce there. They also go there perhaps to see a picture, to witness a football match, or attend some kind of amusement. Surely when people visit these small towns it is desirable that good water supplies and decent sanitary arrangements should be available.  I think it is rather a backward move on Senator Wilson's part to attempt to retard the carrying out of the improvements indicated in these small towns and villages through the country.</P>
      <P>There is another point that ought to be considered.  It is now admitted by medical authorities that diseases spring up in congested areas where you have bad sanitary arrangements.  Disease spreads out from these badly drained villages and towns to the rural parts. The tendency amongst medical authorities at the present day is to prevent infection amongst the people in a particular district.  An outbreak of disease may occur in some of the big cities on the other side and may possibly be traced back to some district here from which foodstuffs were supplied. We know that attempts in that direction used to be made in the case of foot and mouth disease.  If such a thing occurred it would be a very serious matter for the people engaged in the export of foodstuffs or farm produce. I hold it is to the interests of the farmers themselves to preserve a clean bill of health in the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides the only method I know of for enabling local authorities to raise the necessary money for the provision of water supplies and sanitary arrangements in many small villages throughout the country.  It applies also, of course, to seaside places, in one of which I am particularly concerned.  I congratulate the <Col N="434" /> Minister on having introduced the Bill, and hope it will be passed.</P>

      <P>There is no force put on any county council to raise a county-at-large charge in respect of these schemes.  We hope that may be done, but even without it the fact that we will be able to differentiate between an area immediately benefited and a contiguous area will be of great help in getting some schemes that are already proposed through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Seanad will remember that, in 1929, while outdoor relief to the able-bodied could be given throughout the Free State as a whole, it could not be given in the City or County of Dublin.  That was because neither the County Borough Council nor the County Council in Dublin had formulated a scheme under the 1923 Act.  Following on an examination of the matter by the Seanad, a Bill was introduced and passed through the Seanad in 1929 which put the City and the County of Dublin in the same position as the rest of the country in the matter of granting outdoor relief to the able-bodied. That Bill was passed through as a temporary measure, for the reason, in the first place, that a lot of people insisted that it was going to be a very expensive business for the City, and, secondly, that we anticipated the City and County of Dublin might either jointly or individually put up a scheme under the 1923 Act.  Such a scheme has not been put up.  The Seanad <Col N="435" /> may be interested to know that while it was estimated in the beginning of the present rating year that the cost of this relief in the City of Dublin&mdash; that is, the new City, including Rathmines and Pembroke&mdash;would be £120,000, the estimate is now £81,000.</P>
      <P>No scheme has yet been prepared either in the city or county.  The new bodies set up in the county following the passing of the Act dealing with local government in Dublin have not had, and perhaps will not have for a couple of years, an opportunity of making up their minds on this matter.  We are, therefore, continuing the 1929 Act for a period of five years.  In doing that the Department of Local Government hope, in the intervening period, to be able to codify the whole position with regard to outdoor relief in the country. Some progress has been made in an examination of that.  The preliminaries, so far as framing instructions for the draughtsman, have gone through the Department.  But, in view of the other work that the Department has in hands, and from the point of view of the lifetime of the present Dáil, I do not think it would be reasonable to ask the Dáil to discuss this whole question of outdoor relief in the last year or so of its life, or that a new Parliamentary Assembly, in the first year or two of its existence, should be forced to review it.  For that reason I am asking for an extension of the Act for five years.  The City and County of Dublin are now in the same position as the rest of the country. Passing this Bill for five years will mean that we can get the time necessary to have the whole question fully examined before introducing a complete comprehensive piece of legislation dealing with outdoor relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just a question I wish to put to the Minister with regard to the two years' residence qualification.  A case has been brought to my notice in which an unfortunate man who was unemployed and joined the Army is now home and can get no assistance.  He has lived all his life in Dublin.  The officers concerned in the administration of this relief hold that living in any of the Dublin barracks <Col N="436" /> does not come within the residence qualification as defined in the section. Therefore this man is debarred from getting relief.  I have debated the point with some of these officers, and I know they are giving it consideration. I would be glad if the Minister would look into that.  I think that I am expressing the view of members of this House when I say that a man who has lived all his life in the city should not be disqualified from getting assistance under the Act simply because he has been serving in the Army for the last two years.  This is the case of a young man with a wife and two children, who served in the Army and now finds himself without employment and cannot get benefit of any kind.  I do not think any authority has the right to say that a man in such a position should be disqualified.</P>
      <P>There is another point that I wish to bring to the Minister's notice.  It is that of a man getting a ticket enabling him to get a supply of food to the value of 15/-.  Perhaps something might be done with a view to giving the man four or five shillings in cash and the balance in kind.</P>
      <P>I am not urging that he should be given the handling of all money, but I think he might be given, say, 2/6 or 4/- in cash to enable him to pay for the room he resides in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>While I must support this Bill, I hope the comprehensive measure to which the Minister has alluded will be introduced at an early date, and that it will contain provisions for dealing with widows and orphans.  At present all they can get is ordinary relief.  In my opinion, and that of others, special provision should be made for them.  I trust that will be done when the comprehensive measure alluded to by the Minister is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the statement made by the Minister that the city and county of Dublin had not prepared a scheme under the 1923 Act, I just want to explain the position to members of the House who may not be familiar with it.  So far as the city is concerned the reason why no scheme was prepared was because from 1923 on there was no Corporation in existence. <Col N="437" /> Therefore, it was not quite fair for the Minister to make that statement.  The matter referred to by Senator Byrne also came under my notice.  I do not think it was ever the intention that because a man happened to be absent on Army service he should thereby be debarred from getting assistance under this Act.  Some cases in which I was interested were dealt with in a satisfactory way.  If, during the period they were on Army service, these men were voters then they had a residence qualification in Dublin, and that, I submit, clearly proves that it was never the intention that such men should be debarred from the benefits of this Act.  While they remained on the voters' list they retained their citizenship and therefore should not be refused relief when they returned to civil life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>A case brought to my notice was that of a young man who, because of unemployment, had to leave this, his native city.  He went to Glasgow or Liverpool, in the hope of finding work.  After some months' work at the other side he became disemployed, got stranded, and had to return home.  He was refused assistance under the Act.  That man was a &ldquo;trier.&rdquo;  Had he remained at home he could have obtained relief, but he did not want to do that.  He went away.  When he returned it was held that he had broken his period of residence in the city, and, therefore, could not get the benefit of the Act.  I do not think it was ever intended that people making an honest effort to find employment, people such as the man I am speaking of, should not get assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>When the original Bill was going through the Seanad I incurred some hostility, I think, from Senator Johnson, by proposing an amendment making it mandatory on the authorities to impose a work test, to set up labour yards, or have some form of test in the case of the able-bodied seeking relief under the Bill. I was told it could not be made mandatory but that it was permissive.  Could the Minister tell us what has been done in that direction?  Some of us feel very strongly that this thing is <Col N="438" /> likely to be abused: that the offer of work, even if it be of an entirely unproductive character, will be a very healthy corrective on malingering or on attempts to impose on the ratepayers through the getting of relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time that I have heard raised the point mentioned by Senator Byrne with regard to Army service.  I cannot understand how a person whose normal place of residence is the city, comes to be regarded as not belonging to the city because he joins the Army.  I do not think that any auditor could find a flaw in the granting of outdoor relief in a case like that.  There are bodies dealing with outdoor relief in the city, and it would be better, I think, if we had communications from these bodies rather than come up against cases like this in the Seanad.  That is the course I would like to see followed, because the Department is prepared to be of all the use it can in bringing such matters to a conclusion, even to the extent of introducing amplifying legislation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of kind, that was discussed here when the 1929 Bill was going through, and as far as I can hear there has been a change of mind on the part of those who then thought that the rent ought to be provided for in cash.  They are now fairly satisfied that the necessity, or the desirability of that, does not exist. These are matters which, if they are to be discussed to a satisfactory conclusion, had better be discussed between the Department administering the Act and my Department.</P>

    <P>On the question of the work test referred to by Senator Sir John Keane, I think anybody with experience realises that in the case of poor relief it is not easy to provide work even to the extent of having the kind that one could fall back on as a test.  As far as my information goes, immediately after the 1929 Bill was passed, some work was undertaken in developing ground at the back of the Home Farm Road for a housing site.  Work in one way or another was continued on that until the end of 1930.  At one particular time there may have been 300 men employed on that work.  I <Col N="439" /> do not think it was regarded in any way as an economic proposition.  As far as I know it was the only work of that particular kind that was attempted by the relief authorities in the city.  I understand that an arrangement has now been entered into with the municipal authority proper under which some men will be taken on for ordinary municipal work on the recommendation of the poor relief authorities.  How far that is going to lead to the kind of situation that the Senator, on the one hand, would like to see, and a lot of other people would not, I do not know.  While I would like to see work provided in respect of this relief, it is not always, owing to the difficulty of providing schemes, even schemes of work that are not necessarily economic, easy to do that.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That this Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney) James Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very small measure, As Senators are aware, a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad was set up to consider what alterations, if any, should be made in the present administration of the law in this country. That Joint Committee brought in a very far-reaching report that is at present under consideration.  I hope, in the fairly near future, to introduce legislation carrying out the majority, if not all, of the recommendations embodied in that report.  There was one very small alteration suggested by the Joint Committee in their report which is perhaps more urgent than the general question&mdash;that is, the retiring age of judges.  The present retiring age for Circuit Court judges is seventy, and for High Court judges seventy-two. The Committee suggest that the age of both should be raised to seventy-five. We are not satisfied that would be a good improvement.  Some men <Col N="440" /> are able to carry on with their faculties unimpaired to seventy-five; others may not.</P>
      <P>On the whole we think that seventy-five would not be a good age.  There is no reason, however, why the age of Circuit Court judges should not be raised to the same limit as High Court judges.  This Bill proposes that the age limit of Circuit Court judges should be raised to seventy-two.  If a Circuit Court judge goes out at the age of seventy he will, of course, be eligible to be reappointed under the Bill.  Section 3 of the Bill deals with the question as to how the pension should be fixed.  Shortly put, it is that he should receive his pension based on the number of years that he has actually been working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be better to make it clear to the House that the Bill before us is intended to bring a particular Circuit Court judge into office again?  That will be the effect of this Bill when passed.  I think it is rather hiding what is a palpable fact not to state that a judge who has retired recently in Cork owing to the age limit ought to be brought into office again.  The purpose of this Bill is to make that possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel disposed to oppose this Bill for a number of reasons.  One is that to make one servant of the State the subject of a Bill is to reduce legislation to a very low level.  As Senator Johnson has pointed out, the sole purpose of this Bill is to prolong the official life of a certain Circuit Court judge.  There has been a good deal of controversy on the question as to the age at which judges reach their most mature judgments.  I personally doubt very much if it can be argued that a judge, or any other person, is improving at the age of seventy, and that he is going to still further improve between that age and seventy-five.  We have had various sidelights on this question of maturity recently.  The Minister for Finance, for instance, assured the people of Skibbereen that our little party had not reached maturity yet.  It so happened that a day or two after I read that I came across a controversy in an <Col N="441" /> English magazine which went on to say something about &ldquo;not a drop under seven years old.&rdquo;  The two things linked themselves together, for some reason, in my mind, and I came to the conclusion that the Minister for Finance, being now seven years old as a Minister, might be released from the wood, so to speak, and bottled up for a period.  Maturity at the age of seventy-five&mdash;I believe that is one of the recommendations of the Joint Committee&mdash;is, I think, a very debatable question.  Personally, I feel that a man is more likely to be approaching a state of senility at seventy than to be developing the proper type of judicial mind.</P>
      <P>Civil servants retire at the age of sixty.  The maximum, I understand, is sixty-five.  I see no reason why the official life of a judge should be prolonged more than that of the average civil servant.  I have yet to learn any reason for it.  It is true that we have had some very distinguished and brilliant judges in the country who carried on until they were seventy-five and some until they were eighty years of age.  These, however, were the exceptions. I, personally, would be strongly in favour of judges being pensioned off at seventy years of age.  On the question of pensions to judges, it has been argued that judges have to be provided with very big pensions so that they will not be subject to bribes. As the gentlemen who sat on that committee were mostly legal men, I think that in expressing that view they were not paying a great tribute to their own profession.  I must say I disagree with some members of our Party on this. One member, I believe, argued in favour of adequate provision for judges so as to prevent them being subject to bribes.  One would imagine that people occupying the position of judges, even if never given a pension, would be above the temptation of bribes.  I do not think it is fair to the Oireachtas that a Bill to prolong the official life of one judge for two years should, in all seriousness, be introduced into the legislature.  For that reason I am inclined to oppose the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that we <Col N="442" /> ought to debate the recommendations of the Joint Committee on this Bill. I was a member of that Joint Committee, and because of that I am going to support the Bill.  Another reason why I am prepared to support the Bill is this, that a very strong wish has been expressed by the people in the district in which this particular Circuit Court judge served that his term of office should be extended.  The judge's name has not been mentioned, but the people who frequent his court are anxious that he should be continued in office.  He appears to have given undoubted satisfaction to the people in that area.  This Bill only deals with one matter.  When the general Bill is brought forward, then we can discuss the retiring ages of judges and all other matters dealt with in the Report of the Joint Committee. The general opinion amongst many people conversant with the work of the courts seems to be that some of the finest judgments on record were given by judges after they had reached the age of seventy-five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a notorious fact that most judges live to a good old age.  Whether or not it is the hard work that they have to perform or not, it is notorious that these men do live to a ripe old age.  We have three ex-Lord Chancellors of Ireland on the pension list at the present time&mdash;all drawing hefty pensions. We can deal with all these questions when they arise.  When I look around this House, I see some men over 75 who are in possession of all their faculties.  One of these men I have in mind particularly.  I think that his judgment is better than that of a man of 40 or 50 years of age, and I would be prepared to accept it.  You cannot legislate generally.  One man might be perfectly active and capable at 78, while a man at 48 might be a duffer.  I expect that whoever is in charge of the Department of Justice will see to it that men who are past their period of usefulness will be retired compulsorily, even if they are under 70 years of age.  I would expect that to be done.  One would expect that it would be the duty of the Government to see that the men charged <Col N="443" /> with the carrying out of the laws made by the Oireachtas would be fit for the work, and even if they were not 70 that they would, if unfit, be removed from office.</P>

The Minister happens to be a lawyer himself, and, of course, lawyers can bring in regulations when they like to suit themselves.  I shall not, therefore, attempt to argue with the Minister.  I am in favour of the Bill because I believe that the people in the area concerned desire that the Bill should be passed so that the purpose intended should be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Farren, I served on the Committee which drafted the recommendations referred to by the Minister for Justice.  They were far-reaching and numerous.  Had they not been so and had they affected only a few issues, I am sure that a Bill would have been prepared and passed by now, and that it would not be necessary to bring forward a Bill such as this.  I think I should tell Senator Connolly that the Committee which dealt with this matter was not &ldquo;mainly composed of lawyers.&rdquo;  It had, very properly, a number of lawyers on it, but it had also a number of honest and sensible men, like Senator Farren and myself.  As Senator Farren has said, we had the judge affected by this Bill before us.  He gave evidence.  Anybody who thought that his intellect was in any way impaired by the passing of the years would be disabused of that opinion in a very short time by listening to him. He is fully competent to carry on his work, and it is the wish of the area which he serves that he should be permitted to carry it on.  This was also the unanimous opinion of the Committee, and I will support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of this Committee, I should like to emphasise what Senator Dowdall has said as regards its composition.  I have been running over the names of the members of the Committee since Senator Connolly referred to the matter, and I find that it was composed half and half of lawyers and non-lawyers.  Of the lawyers, at least two were not in practice either as solicitors or barristers. Even assuming that what Senator Connolly said was correct, one would have thought that lawyers on a Committee of that kind would have been in favour of fixing the maximum age for judges at the lowest possible point.  If the lawyers on that Committee were professionally or personally interested, they surely would have done their best to open the way for promotion for themselves or their colleagues.  But the fact is that they voted for and strongly advocated the raising of the age limit.  I do not think I am betraying any confidence when I say that many of them would have been in favour of even a higher age than is proposed in the Bill.  I was anxious to clear that point up.</P>
      <P>As to the financial aspect of the matter, surely it is in the public interest that judges, if they do retain their faculties, should be allowed to function for as long a period as possible. Otherwise, they will be placed on the pension list and new men will be introduced at the salaries which they were receiving.  In that way, the State will be paying considerably more than it would have to pay if the judges were continued in office as long as they were capable of administering justice properly. I do not desire to go over any of the other grounds of argument, but, as a member of the Committee, I would ask the House to pass this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill raises the age limit, not to 75 but to 72.  It will have the effect of enabling a judge who has just retired to be reappointed. It will have that effect in fact, but it is a permanent Bill, and it will enable all other judges as well as that particular judge to retain their positions on the Bench until they are 72.  If you are going to raise the age limit to 72, and if, as is generally admitted, <Col N="445" /> a man who has been an excellent judge were to be shut out from the provisions of the Bill by a couple of weeks or a couple of months, I think it would be hard luck.</P>
      <P>The general question of an age limit of 75, I suppose, we will discuss later. I think that 72 is as high as we could reasonably go.  Although some judges carry on their functions with unimpaired ability until they reach 75, as other individuals do, still there are some men who are not physically fit to do the work of a judge at that age. The work of a judge is long and hard work to a man of 70 or 72, if he does it properly.  It has been suggested that we can always remove a judge if he is not competent.  That is impossible. We can only remove a judge for misconduct, which really means that he must have done something professionally wrong or shown himself not to be a straight man.  But who is to decide whether a judge is good or bad, whether his decisions are right or wrong?  It would be impossible for any Department to consider seriously the position of a judge and to say: &ldquo;We remove such-and-such a judge because we do not like his decision in such-and-such a case.&rdquo;  That could not be done.</P>

      <P>This Bill comes before the <Col N="446" /> Dáil and Seanad every year.  It is a formal Bill, and it has been discussed at greater or lesser length each year. I do not think that there is anything new to be said about its subject-matter. The general discussion takes place, as a rule, on the Estimates.  In the Dáil, on the Second Reading of this Bill, I gave some account of the strength of the Army at present, and I do not think it is necessary to repeat that now.  The reserve side of the Army has increased steadily, so that, as I pointed out in the Dáil, although we reduced the cost of the Army by about a third, we increased our mobilisable force by about 50 per cent. This Bill requires to be law by the 31st March, and, as it is a formal Bill which has to come before the Oireachtas annually, I do not think I need go further into the matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister or his predecessors have brought in a Bill of this kind year after year since 1923. Although the original Bill was only intended to be in operation for a few months, and although there was an assurance given that the provisions of that Bill would be thoroughly examined, they have never yet been examined for five minutes in the Dáil or Seanad.  The original Bill, consisting of I do not know how many thousand clauses, passed through the Dáil and Seanad without five minutes' discussion, on the plea of urgency and on the assurance that the Bill would have proper consideration within a few months.  So far from its having had proper consideration, it has never yet had any further discussion.  Year after year we have had the promise that a Bill&mdash;either a repetition of the original Bill or the original Bill amended&mdash; would be brought before the legislature for discussion in a formal and proper manner.  Because of the failure to implement that promise, year after year; because there is no reason why even the existing Act should not be thoroughly examined, even if there is no amendment required, I think this House should decline to pass the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the House should do <Col N="447" /> that as a protest and with the object of forcing the Minister to bring forward a Bill&mdash;even the present Act as a new Bill&mdash;and have it properly discussed. I think that the House, in duty to itself, is bound to insist on the Act at present in operation being brought into the legislative arena for discussion and examination.  It is hardly possible to conceive a Bill of such enormous importance being in operation for eight years without having had five minutes' consideration by the legislature.  No doubt it had full consideration&mdash;if full consideration was possible in the circumstances&mdash; before it was introduced.  On many occasions, when similar questions arose regarding other matters, we were reminded of the abnormal circumstances that obtained in 1922 and 1923.  We have been told, particularly in respect to the Army and to Army matters, how difficult it was in these years to give the close consideration to matters that in normal times they would have had.  This Bill of so many clauses was introduced in that abnormal period and I assume that it is possible that it contains clauses which, if they had been thoroughly examined, would not have been passed in the form which they were.  Because of these things, and because of the ease with which the Minister could bring forward a Bill of a permanent character dealing with the powers of the Army for its self-discipline, I think the House should not pass this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems a tall order to ask the House to reject a Bill which is palpably necessary to the carrying on of the present control of the Army. I thought Senator Johnson would have dealt with that point.  I was waiting for him to explain what the result of his proposal would be.  I shall certainly ask the Minister to say what the result would be if the Seanad should refuse to pass this Bill.  There was much to be said during the last few years in favour of postponing consideration of a final Army Bill.  We all know that our Army has been in a very liquid condition, that enormous changes have had to take place, and that the person who could frame a Bill during the past four years which would have dealt adequately with the final form of the Army would have been a very wonderful individual.  I think that, so far as the ordinary citizens are concerned, we have gained rather than lost by not having spent our time in trying to frame a Bill which it was practically impossible to frame.</P>
      <P>When we are going to get an Army Bill is another question.  We may abuse those who promised us a Bill for not having produced it, but the Bill under which they have been working cannot have been so very bad, because, somehow or other, things were carried on under it.  I do not think that any ordinary citizen has any reason to grumble from the point of view of his pocket as to the management of the Army under the existing Bill.  Whether or not the soldier element would regard the matter from exactly the same point of view I do not know.  So far as the ordinary citizen is concerned, I do not think he has much to grumble about.  As to the question, whether the time has arrived when a final Army Bill could be presented, it would look as if it had.  Probably, we have got to the stage when, like Senator Johnson, we ought to expect a Bill, but I think the Senator is proposing a much too drastic method of extracting that Bill and a most inappropriate method.  I do not think we have suffered a great deal by what has happened in the past, and I would ask the Minister, when replying, to tell us what would follow if Senator Johnson's advice were adopted.</P>

      <P>We would be glad to know in this House what the Minister has got to say in explanation of the extraordinary situation that arose recently when certain officers of the Reserve, and I believe certain officers of the Army&mdash;certainly in the initial stage&mdash;made public charges against the organisation of the Army, the general ineffectiveness of it as an armed force and, what is more sinister, an open and considered charge of attempting to interfere with the officers officiating at courts-martial.  I think that we are entitled to know something more about that.  It is true that the matter was raised in the other House, but the answer there was, to my mind, anything but satisfactory.  It may be that the Minister is not disposed to answer such questions.  It may be that he is quite within his rights in coming into this House and the other House in very nonchalant fashion and, with a few remarks, asking to have this Temporary Provisions Bill passed again.  I cannot say that that type of attitude appeals to me, and I do not think it will appeal to this House.</P>
      <P>There is another issue which has come to light recently, and which we should have some explanation of from the Minister, if he is in a position to explain it.  We read recently that pensions have been paid without any authority from the Oireachtas whatsoever. The Minister may not be responsible for that.  The responsibility may lie on another Department but, at all events, these two points are of sufficient importance to warrant explanation as fully as possible from the Minister.  I put these points before the Minister for consideration, and I should like to hear what satisfactory answer he has to give to both.</P>

      <P>This is only the 11th March, and existing legislation continues until the 31st March.  We have an Act under which the Army has been operating.  If the Minister says that it is not possible to amend it sufficiently within that time, or a shorter time, it is an admission that the present Act is perfectly unsuitable and is not capable of dealing with the Army situation at all. Senator Jameson seems to overlook the fact that the Army Act deals almost entirely with discipline, and has very little to do with the actual formation of the Army, or with matters of economy or the other matters to which he referred.  It is a disciplinary measure.  I do not want to criticise the Army at all because I think it is grossly improper to try to make the Army a political question&mdash;to bring politics into military affairs.  I think that if there had been a proper Army Act in operation some incidents that did occur in the Army would not have occurred, and that the Army would have been the better of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see what black magic is required for the introduction of an Army Bill for our Army more than for any other army in the world.  On all sides we have in recent years seen new States set up.  These States have set up large military forces, and some of them have set up sea forces. They have been able to bring in legislation dealing with their Armies.  Why should we take a generation, or half a generation, to bring in such legislation? This time twelve months Senator Jameson or some other Senator may get up and put the same question that was put to-day&mdash;what will happen if we do not pass this Temporary Bill?  Ten years hence, the same question can be put with exactly the same answer.  Senator Connolly has referred to an incident which possibly would not have happened if there had been a proper Army Act in operation.  I think it is gross lack of discipline and an impertinence on the part of Army Officers to issue manifestos or statements of any kind such as have been referred to.  There <Col N="451" /> is a way of dealing with matters of that kind.  Some of the officers are out of the Army now, and they have an opportunity as civilians, of drawing attention to any abuses which have existed in the Army but the method resorted to was grossly improper and one which no self-respecting community would tolerate in regard to its military forces.  I think the whole position is very nebulous, insecure and unsatisfactory, and that the excuses&mdash; they are not reasons&mdash;advanced from year to year are certainly not acceptable to any intelligent assembly. There was nothing to prevent our Government more than any other Government from having brought in proper Army legislation long before now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what Senator Johnson has said, I must assume that when the Dáil and Seanad pass a Bill, that is not an irresponsible act.  I do not remember the circumstances of the passing of the present Act in the way that Senator Johnson says he does but the consideration of a Bill is certainly not to be measured by the amount of discussion that takes place on it.  The Dail and Seanad passed the original Bill, and it became an Act.  That is how I inherited it.  In 1927, immediately on going into the Department of Defence, I had to introduce the appropriate Bill of that year and I may have, directly or by implication, promised a Bill within 12 months.  When I went into the Department of Defence, I saw that whatever proposals there were there for a Bill so circumscribed things that it would be directed towards the formation of an Army such as I had not in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that the changes we have made in the Army during the last three years or so have been experimental. In changing the formation of the Army, I wished to have an Army here of sufficient dimensions to be effective in respect of any attack that one might reasonably regard as conceivable, and, at the same time, I realised that we did not desire in any way to make the Army a great burden financially upon the country.  I worked <Col N="452" /> out a way for myself in which I thought those requirements could be met&mdash;a way that would not be feasible if the old ideas had prevailed.  During the past three or four years one has been engaged in moving from one type of Army to another, and I cannot say that we have reached our destination fully yet.  I do think that the various new branches we have started&mdash;the A and B Reserves, the Volunteer Reserve and other formations&mdash;have, each one of them in its own line, been remarkably successful.  They have justified the hopes we had of building up an Army in that way.  Roughly, in the course of twelve months, we should be able to say: &ldquo;This is approximately the form the Army will remain in,&rdquo; and within, I should say, two years we will be able to bring in a Bill which will be sufficiently elastic to allow any change of mind that may come about as a result of experience to be made effective.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson referred to this Act as containing some thousands of clauses.  He exaggerated somewhat, as he probably intended to do.  The present Act has about 300 clauses.  During the past four years the Army has been completely changed in form, to the great benefit of the Army and to the great benefit of the State, as I believe. It was suggested by Senator O'Farrell that within a period of 20 days we should produce a permanent Bill.  I think it would require a considerable amount of magic in the draughtsman's office, in the Department of Defence, in the Dáil and in the Seanad to produce a Bill of approximately 300 clauses&mdash;a very complicated Bill&mdash;and to pass it so that it would become law within 20 days.</P>
    <P>I admit there has been considerable delay, although I think the importance of that point has been exaggerated. This is not the only country where there is an annual Army Bill. Personally, I think it would be just as well to have a permanent Bill, but it is necessary to proceed on the side of caution and put into operation certain forms before I definitely bring in a Bill which commits us to one form rather than to another.  Senator Jameson and others must know that if this Bill does not <Col N="453" /> become law by the 31st there would be an extraordinary constitutional position, as the Army could exist only by the legal effectiveness of this Bill. Failing this Bill, there would be no legal sanction for the existence of the Army.</P>
    <P>Senator Connolly referred to a document issued to the newspapers, and he seemed to consider my account of that matter in the Dáil unsatisfactory.  Unfortunately, I can only give the facts, and facts are very often unsatisfactory. The Army Association was formed for the benefit of officers in the Army. There were a number of material benefits they thought they could achieve that way.  I did make it clear at that time to two officers in the standing Army that the running of such an organisation would require good judgment on their part.  That organisation consisted not only of officers in the standing Army but of officers of the Reserve and others not associated with the Army at all.  The document the Senator referred to had no signature of any member of the standing Army. One must recognise that an officer in the Reserve is only in the Army for one month out of twelve and that for eleven months he is a civilian.  I do not expect the rigidly high standard of discipline from Reserve officers that I expect from officers in the standing Army, but I expect that discipline during the period the Reserve officers are with the Army.  I have expressed satisfaction that the sense of discipline in the standing Army was such that none of them was associated with that document, and I think there were only two Reserve officers who were at the time effective officers connected with it, and the remainder were in no way associated with the Army.</P>
    <P>Senator Connolly and others have endeavoured to make a great deal out of that document.  In every country throughout Europe you find a certain amount of discontent.  We have in the Reserve and standing Army 750 or 800 officers, and the fact that two men owing to lack of judgment injudiciously put their names to a document asserting certain things which they were not in a <Col N="454" /> position to know were so or not, does not strike me as anything terrible.</P>
    <P>Senator Connolly referred to the matter of interfering with justice.  As I said in the Dáil regarding the suggestion, that I, as a Minister, endeavoured to defeat justice in the Army by interfering with courts-martial, as far as that was concerned I was in a position to assert that such a charge was without the slightest foundation of truth.  As to whether such a thing could happen in the Army, I think I have watched the Army as closely as it is possible for one man to watch it, and I know the details of its operations, and I can say that I am satisfied that this particular allegation referred to is without foundation.  I am satisfied of that, although I admit a thing could happen without my knowing of it, but no one has complained to me, and anyone in the Army has the right under Article 122 of the Act to come direct to me, but nobody has come to me with any complaint in any way or to say that a court-martial was unfair and prevented him from getting justice. I am perfectly convinced that there is no foundation for the charge in that respect, and I know that as far as the signatories to the document are concerned they are not in a position to say whether such was the case or not, for only half the signatories were associated with the Army, and to the extent of doing one month's training with the Army once a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a thing a man who comes but once a month for training to the Curragh is not in a position to speak about.  This document stated that there was no attempt to co-ordinate the various branches of the Army.  We have at present a staff course for officers for the purpose of instruction in the co-ordination of the different branches of the Army.  I am not going to say that the Army, with the short life it has had and the peculiar circumstances of its earlier years, has been completely instructed <Col N="455" /> in every branch of military science, but I am satisfied that there has been a satisfactory advance in that instruction. At the present moment we have operations on for the instruction of men, from the recruit to the staff officer and the man who commands the complete Army.  That is a fact.  As far as the document the Senator referred to is concerned, it had no weight whatever, for there was no responsibility behind it, and there was no knowledge of these matters available to the signatories to the document.</P>
      <P>I hesitate to promise a permanent Bill in less than about two years.  The preparation of a Bill of this magnitude in the Department and by the draughtsman is a lengthy thing.  We are engaged in new formations which have been successful to the point of surprising me.  I was always optimistic, but we have been successful beyond what I have expected.  I feel we must in the shortest possible time take steps to provide pensions for officers in the Army.  We must as soon as possible bring in a permanent Bill that will not require to be renewed annually and that will provide for the form of Army I have in mind, but that will allow elasticity for any changes that may be decided upon by me or my successors as a result of experience.</P>
      <P>Senator Connolly suggested that pensions were paid without the sanction of the Oireachtas.  The forms of pensions that exist in the Army are under the Army Military Service Pensions Act, the Wounds Pensions Act, and the Disability Act.  No pension has been given to any man other than in accordance with these Acts passed by the Oireachtas, and consequently in accordance with the law in this country.  There is no pension given otherwise than is provided for in the form of the law&mdash;the law provided for according to these Acts.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1) To delete paragraph (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (c) refers to &ldquo;any land situate in Saorstát Eireann which is for the time being vested in the Minister by statute, deed, contract, or otherwise&rdquo; During the discussion on this matter in Committee many questions were raised, and there was an understanding with the Minister after the discussion that he would bring in on the Report Stage a schedule to the Bill which would indicate the lands he had in mind.  That has not been done for reasons which I am sure seem good to the Minister, and is not an accidental omission.  It would appear to me that within the Bill as drafted it is conceivable&mdash;I will not say it is likely, but it is conceivable&mdash;that the Seanad would give power to the Minister to vest agricultural lands, which are at present vested in him, in the Society on such terms and conditions as may be mentioned in an Order.  It has been pointed out that <Col N="457" /> that is a dangerously wide power and goes much further than the Minister himself has any intention of asking the House to consent to.  What the Minister has in mind is certain small properties or buildings which are requisite for the carrying on of his Department and which were the property of the Congested Districts Board and which came into his possession.  It is only those lands he has in mind, but he has drafted a paragraph which would enable him as Minister to vest in the Society any land.  I think that is a power that is entirely too great and is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister told the Committee that the lands which he had in mind were handed to him by the Congested Districts Board and never came within the cognisance or province of the State Lands Act, and, therefore, he is not bound by the provision of the State Lands Act in regard to such property as he has in mind.  I take it, therefore, that the deletion of this paragraph would make no difference whatever to the power the Minister has already in respect of the lands he has in mind. We do not want to give him power over agricultural land, for instance, which may by the provision of the Land Act and other Acts become vested in him.  We do not want to give him power to hand over these to the Society or to give any powers beyond these he is seeking, and it is because he has these without the paragraph I have moved the deletion of the paragraph.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment.  As a member of the Select Committee which considered the Bill, I would like to bring before the House a report of the Committee in connection with this particular section. The discussion in the Select Committee covered all the objections to the sub-section. The main objection was that it seemed to be giving to the Minister power to vest in the Society any lands vested in him without knowing what these lands were, and it was suggested to the Minister that the case could be met in a simple way by attaching to the schedule of the Bill all the lands concerned.  The only objection put forward by the Minister to <Col N="458" /> that was that the schedule would be too long.  The Minister was reminded of the schedule attached to the Gaeltacht Housing Bill, which some members wanted to reduce, but which he was anxious to extend.  At all events the Minister said that he would deal with this matter himself on the Report Stage.  Naturally when I saw the Orders of the Day and saw no mention of a schedule after what the Minister said I was amazed.  I hope he will give some explanation of the change of front and will explain why no schedule is to be attached.</P>

      <P>Senator Johnson and Senator O'Doherty pointed out that this matter was raised at the Select Committee, and that a promise was given that a schedule would be attached to the Bill, stating the exact lands referred to.  When I tried to compile that schedule very great difficulties came in my way, very much greater than in preparing a schedule in connection with the Gaeltacht, which was only a question of putting down the electoral areas.  For the purpose of compiling the schedule under this Bill, one would have to have the title deeds available, and it was found that in many cases they were not available.  I found the thing was impossible.  I intended bringing forward an amendment to delete that particular paragraph, and I am now accepting Senator Johnson's amendment. Senator Brown who was Chairman of the Committee said with regard to specifying the lands mentioned in the schedule:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It would be a sufficient description of your vesting order afterwards, and it would be registered in the Registry of Deeds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When the Bill was being drafted we were advised that &ldquo;lands&rdquo; was a better word than &ldquo;buildings.&rdquo;  The Parliamentary draughtsman said that lands included buildings, and as there were some small areas of lands in which there were no buildings, he suggested the word &ldquo;lands&rdquo; instead.  Very great difficulties arose in compiling the schedule, and I am prepared to have the paragraph removed.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 3 to insert a new section, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>3.&mdash;Where the Society has supplied to any member thereof or has repaired or renovated for any such member any sea-fishing boat or any equipment or appliance for a sea-fishing boat or any fishing nets and a contract has been entered into between the Society and such member whereby such member agrees with the Society to pay to the Society in a particular manner specified in such contract the cost of such supply or repair or renovation and such member does any act, whether of commission or omission, which is a contravention of such agreement, such member shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall (without prejudice to any civil proceedings in respect of such act) be liable on summary conviction thereof in the case of a first offence to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds and in the case of a second or any subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding sixty pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should the Bill which we are considering to-day become law, a new and untried scheme will be brought into operation in connection with the development of sea fisheries in Ireland. I think the House will agree that this scheme should be given every opportunity of becoming a success. <Col N="460" /> There is an enormous field for development in respect of our sea fisheries, and we should make a practical attempt to put this scheme into operation and to secure a reasonable success. The procedure in the past in respect of advances made to fishermen has been that the applicant for an advance had to have two solvent securities, and in some cases it was necessary for him, where there were any doubts about the solvency of the securities, to make a deposit as well.  At present some of the energies of the Department of Lands and Fisheries are dissipated in trying to recover from the securities the amount of advances made, particularly in the years of the Great War. Their activities, to a great degree, are devoted to that work.  That is a singularly unhappy position.  The securities are going to suffer.</P>
    <P>There is the further result that an applicant who seeks a loan for the purchase of a boat or gear can get nobody to go security for him.  Thus stalemate has been reached.  Those defaulters have brought the securities into trouble and have inflicted hardships on would-be applicants for advances. That should not be the position.  As a consequence the whole industry has suffered.  The scheme that has been in operation up to the present stands condemned by its results.  It has been tried and found wanting, and it is up to the officials of the Department to formulate a scheme that would be a success.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the Fisheries Association is to provide boats, tackle, and other paraphernalia without security. For five years it may make advances for boats and equipment without any deposit whatsoever.  It is to be hoped that everyone interested in this question will see that there is a workable scheme and one which may prove a boon to the fishermen.  The Association is taking a greater risk than has heretofore been taken.  If it is taking a greater risk I think it is only logical that there should be greater safeguards. The purpose of my amendment is to safeguard the Association. Section 3 in the original Bill was removed by a majority vote of the Special Committee.  I think I am safe in saying that the attitude of the <Col N="461" /> Special Committee was not so much one of opposition to the Bill as a desire on the part of the mover of the amendment&mdash;Senator Johnson&mdash;and other members of the Committee, that before passing this Bill, including this amendment, the House should be fully aware of the import of the amendment and its implication.  I am satisfied that the House will make itself aware of the due import of the amendment and will have no hesitation whatsoever in passing it.  It can be argued, and it may be admitted, that the Association has its ordinary civil rights in regard to breach of contract.</P>
    <P>Damages can only be recovered through a civil action which at very best could only be regarded as trivial. There will probably be provision made for damages in Rule 13 under the contract for co-operative marketing, which every member has to sign.  These damages will have direct relation to the quantity of fish wrongly dealt with. There would be obvious difficulty in proving the quantity so dealt with.  If the Association had nothing but its civil rights to rely on, it is unlikely that it would function to anything like the extent to which those interested in the fishing industry would like, and I am afraid the whole scheme would prove a failure, and this attempt to provide a real solution would be abortive.</P>
    <P>In regard to the penalties, if they are to have any effect they must be adequate to meet the position.  If this scheme is successful it is more than likely that advances will be made up to several hundred pounds to individual members of the Society for the purchase of boats and gear.  If amounts to such an extent as that are advanced for the purchase of boats and gear and other equipment, and if those who are lucky enough to secure such advances from the Association gravely violated their contracts, it is fit and proper that any punishment which can be inflicted should be inflicted; otherwise there will be no deterrent on wrongdoers, and some deterrent is absolutely essential. On first examination the penalties may appear somewhat large, but I would like to point out that the penalties <Col N="462" /> mentioned in my amendment are maximum penalties, not likely to be usually inflicted.  Generally speaking, the penalties will only be inflicted at the discretion of the District Justice, and he is likely to take a considerable number of factors into account when fixing the amount.  It is not to be assumed that a prosecution will ordinarily follow the detection of any violation of the contract.</P>
    <P>The Board which will operate has been selected from men associated with the fishing industry, men actually interested in it or men who bring a certain experience and business capacity to bear upon such matters as will concern the Association.  They are likely to make a valuable contribution to the working of this Association.  It is extremely unlikely that these men will take any part in instituting prosecutions unnecessarily or too often.  It is unlikely that they will adopt a course which would incure the suspicion of the fishermen or that they will be likely to do anything which would turn the people whom this measure is intended to serve against the Association.  It is extremely unlikely that the members of the Board will do any such thing. It must be remembered that no proceedings against any defaulter can be instituted unless the permission of the Minister is sought and secured.  There is a double safeguard in that respect, and the House may rest assured that no prosecution will be embarked upon unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>This scheme is experimental; it is new and untried and, if successful, it is going to prove of inestimable value to the fisherfolk.  Under the old scheme the fishermen had to provide two sureties when seeking an advance. They had to make a half-yearly contribution in respect of the repayment of any advance.  It did not matter whether the seasons were good or bad; in the worst of seasons the borrowers were called upon to make their half-yearly repayments. In bad seasons that was certainly a hardship on the fishermen. Under the new scheme the potential borrower is relieved in respect of all these matters.  Relief in particularly bad years will be of inestimable value <Col N="463" /> to the fisherman.  There is, no doubt, a danger under this scheme that borrowers may dispose of the whole or part of their catches to persons other than the agents of the Association at the local port or at some other port, or even outside Saorstát Eireann.  There may be a very definite inducement offered to borrowers to dispose of portion of their catches in some such fashion.  If a slip is once made and if some borrowers are able to evade their responsibilities and get away with it, then, likely enough, others will follow.</P>
    <P>This amendment is intended, not so much as a punishment, but as a deterrent on those who may be disposed to violate their contracts and evade their responsibilities and obligations.  I think the House will agree that is necessary.  A new departure is being made.  According to the Minister, the members of the Board are most anxious that this section should be re-inserted. They consider it vital to a degree to the success of the scheme.  If there is a likelihood of carrying this scheme through successfully, I do not think the House will deny the powers which should be given to the Minister and to the Board.  The amendment is reasonable enough.  There will be no undue hardship on anybody.  Those who seek to evade their obligations will be punished, and, I think, no one will have any great sympathy with them.</P>
    <P>The development of the sea fisheries around Ireland is a big question, and we should not hesitate over trivial matters.  Inasmuch as we feel it is essential to the success of the scheme that this section should be re-inserted, I do not think that the House will hesitate in having that done.  I hope the House will give every facility to those who will be responsible for making this scheme a success.  In view of what I have said, I am sure that Senators will have no hesitation in having this amendment adopted and the new section inserted in the Bill. The Special Committee responsible for its deletion objected to it merely for the purpose of calling the attention of the House to its full import and implications. I am sure the House will fully realise all this and will have no <Col N="464" /> hesitation in inserting this new section.</P>

While it is true that I took that view, the more I have considered the matter the more I am convinced that in itself, quite apart from future implications, it is an undesirable proposal. What is it that we are asked to do? Let us note that we are dealing with the establishment of a new body; we are empowering a new body called the Sea Fisheries Association to do certain things.  We have no legislative control over the things that that Association is to do.  What we are considering in this proposal made by Senator O'Hanlon is the relations between the Association and its members. The Association enters into a contract with its members, and if a member breaks that contract&mdash;a contract of which we know nothing&mdash;that member is liable to be fined and, failing payment of the fine, imprisoned.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It was explained and agreed to by Senator Brown that there was consequential imprisonment if the fine were not paid.  That is the normal course of procedure in respect of an offence of that kind.  The point is, that it is a criminal offence; it becomes a criminal offence for one party to a civil contract to break that contract.  My suggestion at the Committee, and I repeat it here, is that that is a new principle and I want to draw two analogies.  We are familiar with the practice of friendly societies, building societies, public utility societies and the like, to lend money to individual members for housebuilding purposes, and certain agreements are made between the member and the Society in respect of the repayment of the loan. If we were asked to make it an offence at law for that person to break the contract of repayment, we would think we were being asked to do an outrageous thing on behalf of the Society against the member.  That is what we are doing in this case.  Some years ago&mdash;presumably it is not prevalent to-day&mdash;it was the practice of certain proprietary creameries to lend money to farmers for the purchase of stock, and a condition of those loans was that all the milk from that farmer's cows should go to that creamery.  If there was a breach of that agreement what would we say if we had been asked to enact that the farmer breaking the contract could be fined in the summary jurisdiction courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are, therefore, entering upon a system whereby private associations are to have the kind of authority over their members in respect of a contract between the member and the Association, which brings the member within the purview of the criminal law.  That is the principle we are introducing. I favour the development of responsible associations having responsibility to the community, and with a certain disciplinary authority over their members; but I think we are going far beyond that idea in this case.  We are putting the individual who makes a contract with <Col N="467" /> the Association in a specially difficult position, and we are raising the Association practically to the level of a State authority.  If we intend this Association to be a State authority we ought to have much greater control as a legislature over the conduct of that Association.  Here I come to the purport of my amendment. My amendment provides that if this section is to be re-inserted we ought at least to have some knowledge of the terms of the contract which, if broken, renders a man liable to be fined.  As it is, we are not to have any knowledge of the terms of the contract; not even the Minister officially and formally by Statute is entitled to have any knowledge of the terms of the contract which, if broken, renders the person liable to be fined in a summary jurisdiction court.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Hanlon has spoken of the change that has taken place in the conduct of the Fisheries Department, and the relations between the Department and the fishermen in respect of boats.  I am entirely in favour of the development that the Minister foresees, and intends to work for through this Bill, but I would like to point out that we have not been informed formally as a House, though we have been informed individually, of the rules of the Association.  The rule with which this particular clause is intended to deal, is the rule concerning the hiring of sea-fishing boats and gear, with the object of purchase.  I would like to draw attention to the difference in the terms of the proposal and the language of the rules.  The new section sets out:</P>
    <P>Where the Society has supplied to any member thereof or has repaired or renovated for any such member any sea-fishing boat or any equipment....</P>
    <P>I am not sure of the implication of the word &lsquo;supplied&rdquo; or whether it would include hiring.  The rule empowers the Association to make an agreement for the hiring of sea-fishing boats and, in the terms of the contract, there are certain things set out; there may be others that are not set out.  Even <Col N="468" /> those others, if broken, would bring the hirer within the provisions of the proposed section.  Leaving that aside, there are certain conditions which are to apply to the hirer.  One of the conditions is that the hiring may be determined by the Association if there is any breach of the contract.  It means that if the fisherman were to go outside the terms of his contract, and sell his catch to some body other than the Association, then the boat would revert to the Association and he would be deprived of his means of catching fish.  Surely that would be a sufficient penalty. Reference has been made to civil liabilities. There is added to the damages that the Association may claim in the courts, the loss of the fisherman's boat and gear, and I submit that is quite ample as a deterrent without the additional deterrent of the risk of a fine in the courts.  I think the House should be very wary and very careful about the line they are entering upon in regard to this kind of liability for prosecution for a breach of contract made between two individuals&mdash;the Sea Fisheries Association being for the purposes of the law an individual.  We appear to be encouraging all kinds of associations to seek monopoly powers to prevent their neighbours doing something unless they become members of the association, and so on.  If we are entering upon a course which will permit associations to make contracts with their members, unknown to the legislature, a breach of which contract makes an individual liable to a fine in the summary jurisdiction courts, then I think that is a course which is quite dangerous and perhaps even revolutionary.</P>
    <P>I ask the House not to agree to the proposal made by Senator O'Hanlon. The amendment I have moved will ensure that even though the legislature is not made aware of the contract, a breach of which may be followed by a fine, at least any contract of the kind will be subject to the supervision of the Minister, so that national authority is going to have some supervisory power in regard to a matter as to which a citizen may be fined in the criminal courts.  If we do not do that, <Col N="469" /> then we are simply legislating in such a way as to make the Association a quasi-legislative body, because it may make laws in respect to its members a breach of which will make a member liable to a fine in the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose the amendment, and at the outset I wish to put on record the fact that at the Special Committee I opposed this section on grounds of principle.  It is not correct for Senator O'Hanlon to state that the Committee generally regarded the principle embodied in the section as good.  My chief objection to the section is that it seems to me to create a new crime altogether.  The argument in favour of the acceptance of this amendment is, in a nutshell, that those people around the coast who have boats supplied to them are so poor that in civil actions no damages could be recovered. Accordingly a penal clause is to be put into the Bill to the effect that if these people break the regulations of the Association and are summarily convicted they have to pay £20 in the first instance and £60 in the case of a subsequent offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephODoherty" hpid="Mr. O'Doherty Mr. O'Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It says that in the case of a first offence the fine shall not exceed £20, and in the case of a subsequent offence the fine shall not exceed £60.  Those in favour of the section admit that the people who are convicted should be made pay, taking the maximum penalties, £20 in the first instance and £60 in the case of a subsequent offence, and yet those people, we are told, are not in a position to pay the civil damages that might be awarded against them in the courts.  If they are not able to pay civil damages how could they be expected to pay fines of £20 or £60?  The result must inevitably be imprisonment.  I object to that principle, and I do not think the House should sanction it.  If a deterrent is necessary, and I believe some deterrent is necessary, I think the suggestion put forward by Senator Johnson meets the case.  The mere threat of the confiscation of the boat and gear is sufficient to deter any man on the coast who utilises the boats <Col N="470" /> supplied by the Association from doing anything in the nature of a breach of contract, because he well knows the possession of that boat means his livelihood.</P>
      <P>I think the Association would be justified in imposing such a deterrent, but I am strongly opposed to the principle embodied in the amendment which proposes the re-insertion of Clause 3, and I hope the House will reject it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the House will do nothing of the kind.  Clause 3, in my opinion, is not only desirable, but absolutely necessary, if certain malpractices which are known to have taken place in the past are to be effectively stopped.  As I understand it, these practices constitute a particularly mean form of fraud in the making of false returns and in evading their agreements, in which it was stipulated that a certain proportion of the catch should go towards the payment of boats and gear.  Instead of doing that, these people put one-third of the catch through the salesman's books, and sold the remaining two-thirds for cash, which they put in their pockets.  This clause, I think, is not a bit too drastic if it can stop that practice.  We should remember, too, that this penal clause, as it has been called, imposes no hardship or disability whatever on the honest fisherman, with whom we all sympathise.  I do not think our sympathies should be extended to the dishonest fisherman, who generally can find means of avoiding civil proceedings. As Senators know, the gentleman who practices this form of fraud is generally a plausible rogue who can make a successful appeal to a softhearted jury.  With the aid of some unscrupulous but patriotic lawyer he will succeed in bamboozling a jury, and get out of the civil proceedings.  If the Seanad were to allow the Bill to go through without Clause 3, then they would be leaving a loophole for the practice of that class of fraud.</P>

So far as I know, no argument of the kind used by Senator MacLoughlin has been put forward either by the Minister or by Senator O'Hanlon, the mover of the amendment. If that is the reason for the amendment then we should like to hear what the evidence is to support it.  This is the first time that I, or members sitting with me, have heard of this.  In any case, the House would surely not try to legislate for a few people out of a large section.  We have to be guided by certain principles and must not allow those principles to be lost sight of because of the actions of a few people.  I would like to know if there has been any agreement of the kind referred to by Senator MacLoughlin whereby a certain amount of the proceeds from the sale of fish must go to pay for the hire of the fishing gear.</P>
      <P>I would like to know if such an agreement is in operation and whether a fisherman must make a return on each occasion to show that he is paying his proportion of what the catch realises towards the hire of the fishing gear. I do not think it proper that the House should be stampeded into adopting the very serious and revolutionary principle embodied in the amendment on the statement of Senator MacLoughlin unless it is supported by official information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement made by Senator MacLoughlin is very clear and very precise, but what the Senator calls a mean fraud can be met by the ordinary processes of the criminal law.  It is not such a case as that that is contemplated in this amendment at all.  I am opposed to this amendment on what I may call moral grounds.  Here you have a section providing for criminal proceedings against fishermen in respect of civil defaults.  These criminal proceedings are to be without prejudice to any civil proceedings.  I would like to say that I have taken the opportunity of reading over the rules and regulations of this Association. In my opinion they are very well done and give the greatest possible security to the Association.  It is not my place now to say that in some respects perhaps they give too much security to the Association and too little to the liberty of the fishermen. They are so skilfully drawn that they avoid what Senator Sir John Keane thought might have been open under these schemes: they avoid the law providing for freedom of trade and the law whereby restraint on trade is prohibited.  They are very well done.  They secure the Association. This additional remedy is wrong for two reasons.  In the first place it seeks to give to the Department an <Col N="473" /> arbitrary power.  Now departments are eternally looking for arbitrary power, power not merely to sue in respect of a civil offence, but power to convict as for a crime for breach of a civil obligation.  That is the general tendency with departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Senator what arbitrary power the Department is looking for here?  This Bill does not provide any arbitrary power for the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Not the Department here, but the creatures of the Department. They are looking for arbitrary powers.  It is an unfortunate tendency of all Departments and of the creatures of all Departments to look for arbitrary powers.  There is another reason why I say this amendment is wrong.  You must look at this from the point of view of the fishermen.  They enter into contracts. They are not to be like other people who are bound by contracts, liable to damages for breaches of contract. They are to be always kept in the petty sessions class, always subject to the jurisdiction of the magistrate and to fine and imprisonment.  I think the Ministry or the Association is wrongly advised to insist upon a clause of this description.  So long as such clauses come before this House I will oppose them, whether they apply to farmers&mdash; they have not been applied to farmers yet&mdash;or gentlemen, or noblemen, or fishermen, or beggarmen.  These are the two reasons why I am opposed to the amendment proposed by Senator O'Hanlon.  It is wrong in principle, it is contrary to civil right, and it is the duty of the Seanad to protect the civil rights of the people whether they are rich or poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>From what I have heard I am inclined to the view that there is an important principle at stake in this.  I put the matter this way: If I make a contract to supply gear for a certain consideration in cash I have, presumably, certain remedies in law.  I cannot see why this Association, because it makes a similar contract, should possess any better remedy than I possess, except this, that in the one case it is the <Col N="474" /> State that supplies the money, while in the other it is an individual.  It is, of course, a well-known principle in law that State debts receive certain privileges and priorities.  They are secured in priority to all other creditors. It may be said that you are only covering a State debt by this exceptional clause.  If that is so, it would need to be made quite clear.  I see tremendous possibilities of danger if you extend this principle to the protection of trade unions, and you are getting very near that if you start on this line.  Sooner than open the door in any degree to that, I would much rather see the amendment defeated.</P>
      <P>Are we quite sure that the special procedure laid down in this section is only to cover a State debt?  The Society at the start is financed by the State.  As it progresses it can, presumably, build up funds and reserves and pay off the State altogether.  In time you may have the Society free of any State debt.  When it becomes free of State debt it will still possess these exceptional powers as a purely corporate body.  I think it would be an exceedingly dangerous thing to give to a body, no longer under any obligation to the State, special powers that you do not give to any other individual or legal entity in the country.  Unless the Minister has some reasons to advance other than those already put forward I am not disposed to support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I feel a certain difficulty about this amendment.  Perhaps it is that all its implications have not been made sufficiently clear.  It appears to me that it suffers from this defect, that it does not differentiate between the violation of contracts that are innocent and those that are committed with intent to defraud.  As the amendment reads, a man who, for some quite innocent cause entirely beyond his control, is unable to carry out his contract with the Society may be subject to these fines.  That would seem to me to be going very far indeed in a measure of this kind.  While none of us can sympathise with people who would deliberately and fraudulently break their contracts, I think most of <Col N="475" /> us would be reluctant to put it in the hands of any Department of the Government, or of any society working under it&mdash;even one subject to the jurisdiction of a court&mdash;power of this kind. I would be glad if the Minister would deal with that point, because it seems to me that if my point has substance in it it might be met by the introduction of some words saying that the offence should be deliberate and with fraudulent intent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been pointed out, this amendment purports to reinsert clause 3, which was in the Bill originally and was deleted by the Committee. Senator O'Farrell accused Senator MacLoughlin of creating an atmosphere in connection with the amendment. I think a great many other Senators also tried to create an atmosphere. One would imagine, from a good deal that has been said, that we were taking up an attitude hostile to the whole body of fishermen.  That was the atmosphere sought to be created&mdash; that we were attempting to set up some sort of bureaucratic department which was going to crush the fishermen. For instance, Senator Johnson said that it was putting the individual who makes a contract in a particularly difficult position.  I do not see that. After all, the number of persons to whom this clause will refer will be very small, persons whose actions would, in effect, break the Society or prevent its operation.  The meaning of Clause 3 is perfectly clear.  The penalty provided is intended to be enforced only for breaches of an agreement made between the fishermen's own society and an individual member that he will repay, in a certain way, the loan which he gets.  That is to say, that instead of paying two half-yearly instalments, which was a great hardship and which he was not, in fact, able to pay&mdash;there <Col N="476" /> are arrears amounting to about £140,000&mdash;he is to repay out of his catch.  There is no security whatever required for the loan.  The penalty will be for an infringement of that agreement.  The system of repayment will be through the sale of the catch by the agent of the Association in the fisherman's particular port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea behind this is to prevent this man from dodging payment by selling his fish to somebody else, either at that port or elsewhere, thus avoiding the repayment of his loan.  If you like, it is a penalty for breach of civil contract.  I would ask the Senators, however, to consider the position that was pointed out by Senator O'Hanlon. If this thing of dodging payments went on to any great extent, and if the Association had to rely on civil proceedings, which are fairly expensive and where the damages they would get, if any, would be rather trifling&mdash;in many cases it would be very difficult to prove damages&mdash;what would happen?  The whole system of giving loans would fail, and especially the provision under Rule 23, that is, the giving of loans for a period of five years without any deposit whatever on the part of the borrower.  Under its rules the Association, during the first five years of its existence, has power to give loans without getting any deposit from the borrower.  Do Senators think that the directors of the Association, if they felt that they were not properly secured&mdash;and I know they feel they would not be without this clause&mdash; would take the risk of giving loans without security and without deposit? I am afraid not.  Therefore, that portion of the rules, which I consider the most important portion, would fall to the ground completely.  If that happened I am afraid the whole scheme would go.  I do not believe that any of the fishermen who will be looking for these loans&mdash;and fairly large amounts are required in order to get proper gear&mdash;are at the moment in a position to pay any deposit.  I believe that after five years they will be in a position to do that, but if one of the conditions is to be that before getting the loan they are to make a deposit they will not be able to do that.  If <Col N="477" /> the Association feel that they would not be justified in giving such a loan without a deposit, then of course this whole thing goes by the board.  That is an important consideration for the Seanad, whether or not the effect of rejecting this amendment will mean the destruction of the whole scheme.</P>

      <P>How in the case of credit societies are the loans they give any better secured than they would be here?  The borrowers in those cases give no security, and yet they get loans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know anything at all about those credit societies.  In many of the cases that I am dealing with, the loans will range from £200 to £400 or £500.  These are very substantial amounts.  I do not know whether credit societies give loans to that amount or not.  With regard to the point mentioned by Senator Sir John Keane, everyone is hoping that the Fisheries Association will eventually become an independent concern, and that no State money will be involved.  This Bill provides under Rule 16 that no prosecution can take place except either at the instance of, or by the consent of the Minister, so that there is always that control over the Association.  The Minister, who is responsible to the Oireachtas, must consent before a prosecution can take place.  The air has also been a bit clouded by the impression attempted to be created, that these are minimum and not maximum penalties.  I would imagine that in not one case in a thousand would the penalty imposed reach the maximum. One of course cannot forecast what a District Justice may do, but I should imagine that the penalty imposed by the Justice would be a great deal less than a quarter of the maximum in most cases.</P>
      <P>Senator Hooper made the point that this might be for breach of any portion of the contract.  I think if the amendment is read carefully, it will be seen that is not so.  It is for contravention of the agreement and not for contravention of any part of a contract.  It is for contravention of the particular agreement for repayment.</P>

      <P>Might I draw the attention of the Minister to a statement that he made before the Special Committee on this Bill?  Speaking on this particular section, Senator Johnson said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This deals with a contract &ldquo;whereby such member agrees with the Society to pay to the Society in a particular manner specified in such contract the cost of such supply or repair or renovation and such member does any act, whether of commission or omission, which is a contravention of such agreement.&rdquo;  I am not clear as to whether the agreement referred to as &ldquo;such agreement&rdquo; is the agreement <Col N="479" /> whereby such member is to pay in a particular manner, or whether the agreement is a wider agreement involving many other conditions as well as the condition as to paying in a particular manner, and whether a breach of any of these conditions of that wider agreement will make the individual liable to these penalties.</P>
    <P>The Minister's comment on that at the Special Committee was: &ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

      <P>The position then is that we are asked to pass a motion which refers to a contract which we know nothing about and which the Minister may know nothing about&mdash; that is to say, the matter is to lie between this Association and the individual member.  There is to be no authoritative supervision of the character or terms of that contract, the manner of repayment, or whether it is to deal with repayment of loans at all. Although the Minister assures us that the penalties for breach of this contract which are referred to in the Act only deal with the question of repayment, the Act says nothing at all about the rates of repayment. The Minister refers to something which he assures us is going to happen but which we have no knowledge will happen.  He refers us to rules of an Association and he says that it is intended that the Association shall make one of those rules the <Col N="482" /> basis of the contract.  Surely this House cannot take that promise of the Minister as sufficient warrant for it to say that a breach of an unknown contract is to make the culprit liable to a fine?  We ought to have the terms of the contract before us or&mdash;which is much more practicable and surely not difficult&mdash;the Minister who is responsible to the Houses should know the terms of the contract that is to be entered into between the individual member and the Association.  If we are going to make it a penal offence to break a contract, we ought to know something of the character of the contract which is liable to be broken.</P>
      <P>If we do not know officially as the Seanad, the Minister ought to know, at least, and we ought to provide that he must know the terms of the contract for the breach of which we are prescribing a penalty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 3:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 5, sub-section (1) to delete paragraph (d).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The part of the Bill we are now dealing with is entirely dissociated from the part we have just dealt with.  This part deals with the licensing of salesmen&mdash;licences to persons to sell by auction fresh fish or to act as agent for the sale by wholesale of fresh fish.  Presumably, it is intended to deal with either auctioneers or salesmen in the markets&mdash;that is to say, in the city markets or on the coast.  The Minister is empowering himself to grant licences, and it is not to be lawful for any person to endeavour to sell fish wholesale or by auction without a licence.  The Minister seeks to impose upon himself certain limitations as to whom he may grant licences. The person must apply on a prescribed form, and he must satisfy the Minister that he is a fit and proper person to hold a licence, that he is not an undischarged bankrupt, and is not employed, engaged, or otherwise concerned in the sea-fishing industry.  It appears to me that this last limitation is unnecessary, and may conceivably damage the interests of the fishermen. I have not the slightest concern with the prospective salesmen&mdash;either auctioneers or wholesale agents.  I have no interest in them at all in this matter, though I have some knowledge of the conditions under which they work, or did work some years ago. From such knowledge as I have, I am of opinion that if the Minister imposes upon himself the limitation that no person who is &ldquo;employed, engaged or otherwise concerned in the sea-fishing industry&rdquo; has any right to hold a fish sales licence, he may limit the opportunities of fishermen to get the best price they can in the market or, to put it the other way, he may limit their confidence that they are getting the best price the market could give.  I am quite sure that the Minister feels that he has reasons for imposing this limitation upon himself; that he believes that certain people, because they have an interest in the sale of fish or in the ownership of boats may not give a fair deal to other fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, he is not obliged to give any such person a licence and, by prohibiting himself from giving such person a licence, he is going much farther than the needs of the case require.  Those who know the fishing industry know how temporary it is in its activities&mdash;how in one place or another you may have a month's season or a six weeks' season, or two seasons of six weeks in a year.  I anticipate that, so far as the coast is concerned, people who are for 9 months of the year selling land or houses or goods, may also wish to put in their time as fish salesmen when the season comes along.  I think it will be admitted that, to get the best value for the fishermen out of the sale of fish, the salesman ought to have a continuing knowledge of the markets and of the conditions prevailing both in Ireland and in other countries in regard to prices, prospects and so on.  I think it is very likely, indeed, that many people will apply for fish sales licences who will not have that continuing knowledge. On the other hand, there are many people who are concerned with sea fishing who, part of the time, are engaged in auctioning.  To give an instance: you have visiting fleets and part-ownership of a boat is in the hands of a merchant who is a fish <Col N="487" /> salesman.  In one case I know of, the brother of an auctioneer-fish-salesman-fish-merchant in Scotland happens to be the skipper of the boat. It happens, too, that fleets of boats come from a particular port, and I think it is very likely that that fleet of boats would like to have a salesman in whom they would have confidence. They may choose to auction their fish through a particular auctioneer whom they know.  If that auctioneer happens to have a share in one of those boats, he is debarred from getting a fish-sales licence.  That is a kind of thing that would affect visiting fishermen.</P>
    <P>Speaking of home fishermen, I think it is unnecessary to debar a man who may have a distant association with the sea fishing industry from having a licence and more or less insist that he shall be only engaged in the auctioning of fish, say, in Dublin or Cork market or, if he happens to have nothing better to do, to go down to Buncrana or Dunmore East or Berehaven or anywhere else during the time of the herring or mackerel fishing.  I think it is not reasonable that you should confine the sale of fish to a person who has his trade in Dublin or Cork market, or to a person who only occasionally sells fish.  I think, therefore, that the provision here is narrowing unnecessarily the scope of the Minister's choice and is detrimental to the interests of the fishermen.  The Minister promised to look into this proposal, and I have no doubt that he has done so.  I feel strongly that this is an unnecessary limitation.  I shall not say positively that it will happen, but it may happen that, owing to the limitation the Minister imposes upon himself in such sweeping terms, a person may not get a licence who is distantly concerned in the sea fishing industry, the words being &ldquo;is not employed, engaged or otherwise concerned in the sea fishing industry.&rdquo;  That is to say, he must not have the remotest connection with the sea fishing industry. If he has, he has not the right to get a fish-sales licence.  That is, I think, an undesirable limitation, and I ask the Minister to accept the <Col N="488" /> amendment I move dealing with that restricting provision.</P>

      <P>The main reason for the insertion of this provision is that very many complaints have been made in the past, especially with regard to the fishermen consigning their fish from distant parts to bigger markets, that the persons selling their fish had interests in the fishing business other than the mere selling by auction of the fish that came in and that it was to the interest of the people selling the fish by auction to knock down the fish at a low price.  These complaints were made in the past, and it is to remove even the suspicion of anything like that occurring in the future that this provision is put into the Bill. The licensing of salesmen will only occur in prescribed areas.  Things will go on exactly as they are at the present moment; the present system of selling fish will continue unless a particular area is prescribed by the Minister. If an area is prescribed, then comes this provision for the licensing of fish salesmen and the cutting out of persons otherwise engaged in the fish trade.  It is unlikely that an area will be prescribed unless there is a complaint about the auctioning of fish.  I imagine I should not prescribe an area unless I were asked by some responsible persons engaged in the trade, or by the Sea Fisheries Association, which would be looking after the interests of its members.  If they complained to me that the interests of the members of the Association were being interfered with by the method of selling the fish in a given market, then I would prescribe that market and this system of licensing salesmen would apply.  If the area were not prescribed, things would go on just as they are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the question of visiting fishermen, I know the case that Senator Johnson refers to.  I imagine it is very unlikely that an area like Buncrana would be prescribed. I would be very slow to do anything that would prevent the Scotch fishermen from coming in and landing their fish at Buncrana, because they are an asset in that particular place to the fishermen.  They provide <Col N="489" /> a bigger market for our own fishermen by reason of the fact that their coming there attracts buyers.  I think there need be no fear as far as Buncrana and other areas like that are concerned. As regards the question of licensing, it might be said that if a man satisfies the Minister that he is a fit and proper person to hold a fish sales licence, that would govern the whole matter.  I feel that if you have not a provision like this in the Act I could not refuse men engaged in the fish trade without showing some good reason for my refusal.  If paragraph (d) is omitted, no test can be applied as to whether or not a man is engaged in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I feel that I would be bound to grant a licence to any applicant, whether employed in the fishing industry, or in any other way concerned, and a fisherman would probably have to rely solely on sub-section (2), paragraph (c), for his protection.  The provision there would, I believe, fall to the ground if you had not some such safeguard as this, because you can quite conceive that a man in the industry might put up as the licensed salesman some person who would have no interest in the industry.  That man might be put up as the tool of the man engaged in the fish trade, and it would be very difficult to deal with that case.  I do not believe the provision is going to interfere in any way with a fisherman getting the best price for his fish.  On the contrary, it is a safeguard for the fisherman, and it will assure him that he will get the best price in a fair market.  At any rate, it will have the effect of relieving the mind of the fisherman.  The Association will be representative of the fishermen, and its chief concern will be the conditions under which the fish are marketed. This provision is intended to assist <Col N="490" /> the fisherman.  I feel it is an extremely important provision, and it would be a great pity, indeed, if it were cut out.</P>

      <P>It seems to me the sub-section the Minister referred to meets his point about protecting the fisherman because it provides that every fish sales licence shall contain the condition that the licensee must not directly or indirectly be concerned in any transaction relating to the purchase or sale of fresh fish.  Surely the words &ldquo;directly or indirectly&rdquo; cover all that is required to meet the case of a man nominating an employee to receive a licence.  Paragraph (d) goes much wider than that, and if you prescribe a man who is not employed, engaged or otherwise concerned in the sea-fishing industry, it practically means that any person engaged in sea-fishing is prohibited; that is to say, if he knows the business he cannot be allowed to take out a licence.  I think it would be far better to have this taken out and leave in the provision prohibiting the person who is concerned directly or indirectly in the sale or purchase of fresh fish.</P>
