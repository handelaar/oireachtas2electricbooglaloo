      <P>In the absence of Senator Milroy, I beg to move the motion standing in his name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Eireann approves the Report of the Commonwealth Conference, 1930, and recommends the Executive Council to take such steps as they think fit to give effect thereto.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a pity that a subject of such national and international importance should not be discussed on its merits outside the atmosphere of mere Party politics.  If the provisions of this Report are fully implemented, it will serve as a mile-stone on the onward march of this nation, and will secure for us a friendly consideration from the other participating parties. It will bring together the members of the Commonwealth of Nations more intimately, and I hope will eliminate a sinister and baneful influence from our own national affairs.  The Minister for External Affairs will in due course explain this motion in its various details.  I wish to say a few words, however, on the work in this connection which the Minister has done at Geneva and elsewhere to give his country a high status amongst the nations of Europe.  He has given her what might be called a place in the sun.  To this object he has devoted his versatile ability, his untiring energy, his infinite capacity for work and taking pains, and his success will be judged later on.  Perhaps his efforts have not met with the appreciation to which they are entitled, but history always takes an impartial view, and I think it will accord the Minister a high position in the affairs of the world.  I think he will be acclaimed not only as a great Irishman and patriot, but as <Col N="1600" /> amongst the leading statesmen of the world.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete all after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; in line 1 and to substitute therefor the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Seanad takes note of the Report of the Conference on the operation of Dominion legislation and of Part VI of the Summary of Proceedings of the Imperial Conference, 1930;</P>
      <P>commends the efforts of the Minister for External Affairs towards procuring the full establishment and international recognition of the independence and sovereign status of Saorstát Eireann;</P>
      <P>and recommends the Executive Council to propose to the Oireachtas such legislation as may be necessary and to take such other steps as they may think fit for the accomplishment of these purposes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment explains itself fairly well in contra-distinction to the motion moved by Senator MacKean.  The amendment asks that the Report of the Conference on the operation of Dominion legislation and of Part VI of the Summary of Proceedings of the Imperial Conference, 1930, should be noted.  It goes on to commend the efforts of the Minister for External Affairs towards procuring the fulles international recognition of the independence and sovereign status of Saorstát Eireann and recommends the Executive Council to propose to the Oireachtas such legislation as may be necessary and to take such other steps as they may think fit for the accomplishment of these purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> I object to the motion for several reasons.  The first is a purely formal one, that there is no such thing as the Report of the Commonwealth Conference, 1930, before us.  No such document has been laid on the Table.  I would ask the Seanad to bear in mind that even form and verbal accuracy are required for the Journal of the Proceedings of this House, that in future it will be the Journal that will be referred to when anybody requires to know what the decisions of this House have been and not the speeches of Ministers or Senators.  When the Senator speaks in his motion of the Report of the Commonwealth Conference, I submit that that is a misnomer, that the document that is presumably referred to is designated a &ldquo;Summary of Proceedings of the Imperial Conference, 1930.&rdquo;  There is not much in it, but if we are to use the words &ldquo;Commonwealth Conference&rdquo; in the proceedings and motions that come before the House the reports that appear on the Table ought also to be designated in the same way.  We ought not to use &ldquo;Imperial Conference&rdquo; on one occasion and &ldquo;Commonwealth Conference&rdquo; on another to represent the same thing.</P>
    <P>The Report itself is a very voluminous document.  It deals with a considerable number of subjects, and the motion asks the House to approve of the Report.  I am presuming that what is meant by the Commonwealth Conference Report is the Summary of Proceedings of the Imperial Conference, 1930.  What is it we are asked to approve of?  There are 127 pages of this Report and 22 chapters, and the the Report deals with the work of the Conference upon a very large number of subjects, which are wide in their scope.  It will be necessary to have, as I submit, a great deal of information and discussion and committee discussion before this House or any other Chamber should be asked to approve of the Report.  There are, for instance, problems dealing with nationality, the question of the nationality of married women, the setting up of a Commonwealth Tribunal to arbitrate upon issues that may arise between <Col N="1602" /> various members of the British Commonwealth, and certain recommendations in that respect.  There are various recommendations on merchant shipping, there are recommendations regarding arbitration and disarmament, defence, research, standardisation of measures, an Imperial Marketing Board and a number of other subjects of considerable interest, and some of them of importance to this country.  Now, to pass a resolution approving of these things <i>en bloc</i> is, I think, a very undesirable suggestion to put before the House.</P>
    <P>Just to give one slight instance.  One of the committees of the Conference recommended &ldquo;that the Governments of the different parts of the Commonwealth should, at the first convenient opportunity, introduce such legislation as might be necessary to enable them to make reciprocal arrangements relating to old age pensions, and when the necessary powers had been obtained, to enter into negotiations with any other Government within the Commonwealth possessing similar powers with a view to the formulation of a system of reciprocal arrangements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Conference took note of that recommendation, and referred it to the several Governments for consideration, but it is noted that the Committee made that recommendation, with the exception of the representative of one Government.  It would be interesting to know which was that Government, and what were the circumstances in which this recommendation, with the one exception, was made, and whether there is any Government policy upon that particular question. That is one illustration.  There are other questions regarding the financing of research which probably will come up for consideration on another motion.  There are questions, as I said, about standardisation of weights and measures, and all these things will require examination and discussion before the House should be asked to approve of them.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Senator who moved this motion had in mind not the report of the Conference <i>en bloc,</i> but one part of the report of the Conference, <Col N="1603" /> that part being the chapter dealing with inter-Imperial relations which embodies the document known as the &ldquo;Report of the Conference on the operation of Dominion legislation and the Merchant Shipping legislation of 1929.&rdquo; Again, to ask the House to approve of that <i>en bloc</i>, without examination and discussion of the various recommendations, is a procedure that strikes me as quite undesirable for any legislative Chamber.  But very much more important than that is the objection that I think this House should level against the procedure which asks this legislature to approve of the report which, in effect, is a request to another legislature to pass certain legislation which has some effect upon this country.  The approach to this question is of importance. I think one may say that the governing consideration is that we have been encouraged to approach this question on the principle that it is by the enactments of this legislature that laws affecting this country are to be made effective.  That is to say, we stand upon the constitutional provision which was made effective in this country by the Constitution Act:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The said Constitution shall be construed with reference to the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland set forth in the Second Schedule which are hereby given the force of law,&rdquo; and Article 2 of the Constitution which declares: &ldquo;All powers of Government and all authority&mdash;legislative, executive and judicial&mdash;in Ireland are derived from the people of Ireland.&rdquo;  My main complaint against this procedure is that there is implicit in these recommendations of the 1929 Conference, as there has been implicit in nearly all the documents with which the British Government have had a great deal to do, the idea that legislation affecting this country is an emanation from the British Parliament.  Now if we are to assume that the powers of government that are exercised in this country are derived from an Act of the British Parliament, then all this is in order and perfectly satisfactory.</P>
    <P>But if we are to assume that the powers of government in this country <Col N="1604" /> are derived from the authority of the people, from the Acts of the Oireachtas and not from a British Act, then I submit that this procedure and the form of these recommendations are not satisfactory from our point of view.  I have no objection at all to the Ministers of Great Britain and the Ministers of the British Dominions meeting and examining the position of British law, the effect of that law upon the various parts of the Commonwealth, and agreeing to a procedure which means asking or recommending the British Parliament to pass certain legislation to put British law in harmony with British constitutional practice.  I think that that would be a perfectly desirable course to follow.  But I object to the proposal that it is this Parliament which has, in effect, to make a recommendation to the British Parliament to do something, the doing of which extends the powers of this State.  I quote from page 19 of the Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Conference recommends (a) that the Statute proposed to be passed by the Parliament at Westminster should contain the provisions set out in the schedule annexed.</P>
    <P>The schedule details certain clauses of the proposed new Statute.  The Conference recommended:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b)  That the 1st December, 1931, should be the date as from which the proposed Statute should become operative.</P>
    <P>(c)  That with a view to the realisation of this arrangement resolutions passed by both Houses of the Dominion Parliaments should be forwarded to the United Kingdom, if possible by 1st July, 1931, and, in any case, not later than 1st August, 1931, with a view to the enactment by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of legislation on the lines set out in the schedule annexed.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Parliaments of the Dominions and the Parliament of the Irish Free State should be required to pass a resolution of this kind with a view to the British Parliament passing an enactment which is to alter British Statute law, but is not to have any effect&mdash;I think the Minister has declared this&mdash;upon the law <Col N="1605" /> governing the affairs of this State. That is only understandable on the assumption that the powers of government in this country are derived from British legislation, and that the new Act proposed to be passed in Britain is either to have an enlarging effect upon the powers of this legislature or is to be explanatory of what the powers of this legislature are.  I should like to ask what would be the effect if this Parliament, or any of the Parliaments of the British Dominions, did not pass this resolution.  Would it mean that the British Parliament would not pass the Statute of Westminster, or would not be asked to pass it?  Is it not true to say that it is to make British law conform to the practice that these proposals have been recommended?  It is for the clarification of British law and not of Irish Free State law that this new Statute of Westminster is to be passed.  It is quite proper and reasonable that the Conference should agree upon a course of procedure and suggest to the British Government that they should promote certain legislation in the British Parliament for the purpose of amending their law.  But, to my mind, it is detracting from the equal position of this Parliament to pass a resolution requesting or recommending the British Parliament to pass such an enactment with a view to the clarification of their law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the recommendations of the Conference is that, with a view to the realisation of this arrangement and the passing of this Statute, the Dominion Parliaments should pass a certain resolution with a view to the enactment by the British Parliament of legislation set out in the schedule annexed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of these recommendations which one might criticise, but I do not propose to do that, because, as I said earlier, they should all have Committee examination before we <Col N="1606" /> should be asked formally to approve of them.  I want to direct special attention to one of the recommendations, because it seems to me to confirm my suspicion that the whole of this plan and procedure implies that the powers of legislation of this State are derived from British enactments.  We have always held that the position of the Irish Free State is not identical with, and ought not to be considered to be identical with, that of the British Dominions.  That is to say&mdash;it is no harm to repeat it, it has often been said before&mdash;that those Dominions have gradually evolved from the stage of colonisation to their present position of freedom and autonomy, whereas we have not evolved by that process, and the powers of government in this State, as stated in our Constitution, are derived from the people of Ireland, and our Constitution is given the force of law by the Act of the Parliament of this country.  One of the recommendations to which I take exception, because of its inference, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>No Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed after the commencement of this Act shall extend to or be deemed to extend to a Dominion as part of the law in force in that Dominion unless it is expressly declared in that Act that that Dominion has requested and consented to the enactment thereof.</P>
    <P>It has been said that that is a declaration that the British Parliament cannot henceforward pass an Act which will have the force of law in a Dominion without the request of that Dominion.  I draw attention to the fact that in the definition which is going to be included in this Statute of Westminster the Irish Free State is henceforward in British Statutes to be deemed to be a Dominion.  This new Act is going to contain a clause which assumes the possibility that, if a Dominion requests, the British Parliament may enact a Statute which will have the force of law in that Dominion. The words used are &ldquo;unless it is expressly declared in that Act that that Dominion has requested and consented to the enactment thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that we ought not to approve <Col N="1607" /> of any declaration or any recommendation which, by any stretch of the imagination would imply that the British Parliament, if requested by this Parliament, has the power to enact any statute having the force of law in this State.  That more or less summarises or, at least, illustrates my reasons for objecting to the form of this motion, that this Parliament approves of these recommendations which, in effect, means a request to the British Parliament to pass certain enactments.</P>
    <P>In the second paragraph of my amendment I ask the House to commend the efforts of the Minister towards procuring the full establishment and international recognition of the independence and sovereign status of Saorstát Eireann.  I quite heartily affirm that the Minister's activities during these last few years have been persistent and successful in his endeavour towards establishing the independence and securing the recognition of the sovereign status of Saorstát Eireann. Senators will probably remember, and some will be familiar with, the Report of the Conference of 1926, and certain criticisms which I levelled against it on a ground very similar to that which I am arguing against this.  The Report of that Conference did undoubtedly, as was freely acknowledged at the time by myself and others, contain certain declarations of the equality of status of the various States of the British Commonwealth.  It also contained, as we may remember, many moderating clauses which, if they had been pressed by the British Government and by other Governments with the same persistence as the governing clause has been pressed by our Minister and others, would undoubtedly have justified all my criticisms of that time.</P>
    <P>I am free, and very glad, to acknowledge that a great deal of the 1926 Report has gone by the board already, and that the governing clause of that Report has been given effect to in a manner in which many students of constitutional law of the time thought impossible. We have undoubtedly moved forward since 1926.  One can just give a small illustration of that.  There were in the 1926 Report certain references <Col N="1608" /> to the manner in which the States of the Commonwealth would keep each other informed when any proposals regarding treaties were being made and any negotiations were being entered upon.  There was a clause which said that when &ldquo;a Government has received information of the intention of any other Government to conduct negotiations it is incumbent upon it to indicate its attitude with reasonable promptitude.  So long as the initiating Government receives no adverse comments and so long as its policy involves no active operation on the part of other Governments, it may proceed on the assumption that its policy is generally acceptable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The criticism levelled at that and other clauses of the 1926 agreement was to the effect that there was an atmosphere of British Empire policy involved in it, and that clause itself was quoted as an illustration of the approval and general acceptance of a proposal for a treaty by any member of the Commonwealth which did not signify its objection.  The phrase in this report is a distinct amendment, because it says that in the absence of comment the negotiating Government should, as was indicated in the report of the 1926 Conference, be entitled to assume that no objection will be raised to its proposed policy.  There is no reference there to general assent or acceptance.  Small as that may be, it is a distinct indication of a change of mind and the approval by the British representatives of the point of view that I believe to be that of the Irish representatives at the Conference.  But it is going to take quite a considerable time, I fancy, even for the British Government, notwithstanding the agreement at the Conference, to attune themselves to the &ldquo;new position,&rdquo; which is the phrase so often used in this report.  Eighteen months after the 1926 Conference made its report&mdash;a certain understanding was presumably arrived at by the people present at that Conference&mdash;we had a state of things which allowed the British Minister and the British representative in Egypt to assume that in negotiations for a treaty between Britain and Egypt, the concurrence of the various Dominions and the Irish Free State <Col N="1609" /> was necessary.  The assertion was that that concurrence had been sought and that concurrence had been obtained.</P>
    <P>When questioned on the matter, we had the Minister explaining to the Dáil that only one communication was sent on behalf of the Executive Council to the British Government respecting this treaty.  In that communication he stated: &ldquo;I (that is, the Minister) stated on behalf of the Executive Council that they have learned with pleasure that His Majesty's Government in Great Britain and Egypt are negotiating with a view to establishing an alliance between the two countries, and that they hope that an agreement acceptable to both sides will be speedily reached.&rdquo;  On the strength of that very reasonable statement on the part of the Minister&mdash;a cordial hope that two countries who are negotiating for a treaty should arrive at an agreement acceptable to both sides&mdash; we had the Secretary of State for the Dominions in the British House of Commons stating not only that the Dominion Governments were kept informed at every stage in the negotiations with Egypt, but that &ldquo;as soon as the text of the treaty had been agreed with Sarwat Pasha, its terms were communicated to the Dominion Governments by telegraph and their concurrence was sought in the proposal to present it to the Egyptian Government, and the replies in this telegram made it clear that the policy of His Majesty's Government in Great Britain was satisfactory to all the Dominion Governments.&rdquo;  (Official Report, Vol. 23, col. 323.)</P>
    <P>Prior to that, of course, the British High Commissioner in Egypt had spoken of the necessity &ldquo;for the concurrence of His Majesty's Government in the Dominions and India,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;required concurrence has been obtained,&rdquo; and so on.  I quote that as an illustration of the necessity for very considerable watchfulness and care as to the form in which these documents are presented and as to the unwisdom of this House putting its name to a recommendation in the name of the Parliament which can, by any conceivable stretch, be deemed to be a request <Col N="1610" /> to the British Parliament to pass certain legislation for the aid of this country.  I do not think anyone who has followed these subjects will deny that it has been&mdash;I was going to say a very slow process, but perhaps not very slow considering how long a time it takes for negotiations of this kind to proceed&mdash;a slow process for British Ministers and particularly the people concerned in the internal working of diplomatic negotiations to attune themselves to the position that this State occupies.  An illustration came to us recently in the Appendix to the Veterinary Surgeons Bill, where the agreement more or less assumes that the Constitution of this State is merely an Act of the British Parliament, and to be treated as such.  I am personally aware of the fact that as late as 1925 British Ministers were assured by their legal advisers that no matter how far or in what direction the Canadian position might develop, the Free State position was fixed according to the situation that prevailed at the time of the signing of the Treaty.  That was, I say, the clearly understood position of the British Ministers as late as 1925, and it has been a comparatively slow process to disabuse the minds of those Ministers and officials as to what this State stands for and where we claim to have a right.  A document that we have been asked to approve contains two other paragraphs which embody recommendations which I would like to touch upon.  One is on page 40, dealing with defence:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The existing arrangements for consultation and co-operation (including questions of general defence such as the supply of war material and the co-ordination of defensive arrangements, as well as the staff arrangements of the respective services) which have grown up as the result of past Imperial Conferences were reviewed, and, where necessary, recommendations were submitted for their improvement in matters of detail.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there is a recommendation regarding the policy of the ultimate establishment of a defended naval base at Singapore.</P>
    <Col N="1611" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Read the opening part of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The opening sentence is: &ldquo;As a result of discussion between representatives of the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand, it was recommended&rdquo;&mdash;by whom&mdash;presumably the Committee on Defence, the Committee on Imperial relations and economic questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, by those representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's explanation that it was recommended by those concerned &ldquo;that the present policy of the ultimate establishment of a defended naval base at Singapore should be maintained.&rdquo;  That might be of the utmost importance to those particular countries, but we are asked to approve of that report.  Why should we be?  What is our concern with it? I think we ought to have a little more information regarding the discussions and the form which those discussions took, and the conclusions, if any, that were arrived at regarding &ldquo;questions of general defence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is then a paragraph dealing with the appointment of Governors-General, and I am sure that this marks a move forward.  The last paragraph on page 27 reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The manner in which the instrument containing the Governor-General's appointment should reflect the principles set forth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>that is as to the position of the Governor-General in relation to the Executive Councill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;is a matter in regard to which His Majesty is advised by his Ministers in the Dominion concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that it is very good that the Ministers in this Conference should have arrived at a certain conclusion in that respect, and I am wondering whether the time is not now opportune for the publication of this instrument, the instrument of appointment of the present Governor-General and his predecessor.  We find, for instance, that one can read books in the library <Col N="1612" /> which contain the letters patent and the commission of appointment and the instructions to the Governor-General of Canada.  They are fairly commonly quoted.  The terms of the appointment in 1926 of the Governor-General of Canada&mdash;there has been an appointment since then&mdash;are printed and published and can be read by anyone, and I think it is time that the terms of the appointment, the letters patent, and the instructions that were given to the Governor-General of the Irish Free State should also be made public.</P>
    <P>An interesting query arises from reading the terms of the Canadian appointment, inasmuch as it is provided that in the exercise of his prerogative of mercy he &ldquo;shall not in any case, except where the offence has been of a political nature, make it a condition of any pardon or remission of sentence that the offender shall be banished from or shall absent himself from our said Dominion.&rdquo;  I do not know whether by chance the letters patent and the instructions of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State were based upon the Canadian precedent, and whether it is within the power of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State to banish a person from this State in respect to a remission of sentence, but there are questions of that kind that certainly members of the Oireachtas should be in a position to inform themselves upon.  I think it is not unreasonable to ask that now in 1931 some opportunity should be given for the publication of these documents.</P>
    <P>The last clause of this amendment recommends &ldquo;the Executive Council to propose to the Oireachtas such legislation as may be necessary, and to take such other steps as they may think fit for the accomplishment of these purposes,&rdquo; these purposes being the full establishment and international recognition of the independence and sovereign status of Saorstát Eireann.  Undoubtedly, there are some steps to be taken and some enactments to be made by the Oireachtas to fulfil the work of these conferences and to fulfil the policy arising out of the Constitution. One, of course, which the Minister has dealt with quite frequently <Col N="1613" /> is in reference to appeals to the Privy Council.  One other that I think is of great importance, in view of certain other portions of this Report, is the amendment of that clause of the Treaty which gives power to Britain in time of strained relations to land troops and obtain what facilities she wishes on the territory of the Irish Free State.  There is a proposed section of this new Act which deals with questions of discipline of soldiers on the territory of another member of the Commonwealth by consent.  I am afraid while that clause remains in the Treaty it will be found it can be maintained that consent has been obtained. The second paragraph of this section dealing with defence on page 26 reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is assumed that all Governments will desire to take such action as may be necessary to secure (1) that the military discipline of any of the armed forces of the Commonwealth when present, by consent, within territory of another, rests upon a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;by consent&rdquo; there no doubt were intended to ensure that only by consent could the forces of one State be landed upon another State.  I think it cannot be denied that the provision of the Treaty which allows British troops to be landed on Free State territory, at any time that Britain may think it necessary&mdash;when they may say strained relations with other Powers exist&mdash;is sufficient authority and that they have already got consent.  I think it is time that we sought the abrogation of this clause of the Treaty.  In doing that I think we would go a very considerable distance towards the aim of having the full establishment of the independence and sovereign status of Saorstát Eireann.  I doubt very much whether we can say that the State is really independent while that clause remains. I imply the hope in this amendment that the Executive Council will move in that direction, that they will continue the work which I agree has gone a considerable distance towards the accomplishment of this aim.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to note that the mover of the motion used the phrase, <Col N="1614" />&ldquo;The march of this nation towards freedom,&rdquo; not making the affirmation that the work was completed, but that there is still some distance to go.  That is the implication in my amendment.  I do not know whether it is wise or necessary, but in view of some statements that were made in the Dáil, and possibly may be made here, and inasmuch as there will be no other chance to reply, it might be well to state my own position, and I think rightly the position of this Party since the beginning in regard to this and similar questions.  We held in 1921-22 that the conduct of the revolutionary struggle which resulted in the establishment of the Free State had been left in the hands of the Sinn Féin Party.  The leaders of that Party had reached a certain point in the pursuance of that struggle.  We believed that they had done all that was possible to be done, and, having achieved a certain position, our view was that we had to make the most of it, to use the powers that were obtained then to improve and generally defend the social and economic position of this people, to use all the powers to the full, and that if and when it ever became necessary to move further forward, to make a further change of a political nature, the time and means were to be decided by the circumstances of the moment.</P>
    <P>We believed, and we still believe, that it is of the first importance that a country that has won certain political powers should use those powers to the fullest extent.  Inasmuch as political powers are only a means by which social, national and economic growth can take place, we believe that the need for political change arises only when it is proved that there are any obstacles in the way of development. The fullest and the widest possible interpretation of the powers that we have won for ourselves should be used to the utmost.  That is the position that we hold to-day.</P>
    <P>The question of a monarchy or hereditary power gives us little concern so long as the hereditary monarch has nothing to say to the affairs of this State.  We do not see any <Col N="1615" /> real difference between an hereditary monarch and a president so long as that hereditary monarch does not interfere with the affairs of the State, and particularly so long as he does not land on the shores of the State.  We think it would be a very dangerous thing for the growth and development of democratic ideas within this State if the monarch were to attempt, or were to be encouraged, to show by his bodily presence that he has an actual and an active concern in the affairs of the State.  We think it would be dangerous for the State and would be disagreeable for him.</P>
    <P>We are inevitably against the very notion of hereditary rule; but our real objection lies, not in the fact that he is a political official, that he is a political figure, but rather that he is symbolic of a power which is not of the people.  He represents a power, a class domination, and it is because he is symbolic as being the head of a ruling class, and because that symbolism is handed down from father to son, and from son to grandson, that we object <i>in toto</i> to the very idea of an hereditary monarchy.  So long as only the name appears and there is no reality behind it, we are not going to be very much concerned.</P>
    <P>With these exceptions we believe, in regard to the relations between Great Britain and Ireland, that this part of the country which comes within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of this State, is as free from British influence as it would be with the most radical republic that could be established.  We, too, recognise, and perhaps it is important to emphasise, that no matter what political conditions may prevail, the Governor of the Bank of England, the Board of the Prudential Assurance Company, or the financiers who are able to manipulate the share and stock markets and the prices of wheat, petrol and other such things, are very much more influential in relation to the lives, the properties, and the freedom of the people of this country than either the Government or the monarchy of Great Britain.</P>

As I said once before, and perhaps the Minister may remember it, the ideal I have, and perhaps that this Party has, in regard to the political relationship between the Government of this country and the Government of Great Britain, is the relationship between the Trades Union Congress of this country and the Trades Union Congress of Great Britain&mdash;free, friendly, but entirely separate and entirely distinct. It is for these reasons that I move the amendment, the fundamental one being that one of the Houses of Parliament of this State should not take part in a request to the Parliament of another State to pass legislation intended by deliberation or by implication to affect freedom of action and, generally, the Government of this State.  It is for these reasons I ask that we should take note of the Report, commend the Minister for his activities, and ask him to bring to this Parliament such legislation as is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a very interesting speech from Senator Johnson.  The amendment, however, does not suggest anything more than a hope that the Executive Council will do its duty.  I do not think there is sufficient cause for distrust of the Executive Council.  Hitherto I think we have not had sufficient reason for distrust.  Possibly this amendment has served to ventilate a particular point of view that Senator Johnson may have entertained, but I do not think it can justly be claimed that the Executive Council have been found wanting.  I think we may trust them not to invite the monarch to invade our shores.  I think it very important to have a definite decision with regard to the word &ldquo;consent.&rdquo;  If there is any question of landing troops in this country, our consent is taken willy-nilly, whether or not we are prepared to grant it.  There are people who say <Col N="1617" /> that that is in the Treaty, and I think it would be well if we could get the position clearly defined.  Of course, the troops would not come as tourists. The point is that they could be landed here, and I think we should have a definite decision about our own position.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot about interfering with the development of this country.  We have heard it mentioned that the removal of British Jacks-in-office might constitute an international question.  All that sort of talk may be very interesting, but it leads us nowhere. I am not greatly concerned about such phrases as our sovereign status.  In the context in which the word &ldquo;consent&rdquo; appears, we get the paradox that the State has to imagine itself sovereign whether or not it can keep up a navy or an army.  I can well imagine this country heavily garrisoned if there was a war, and I can also imagine a war not too far off.</P>
      <P>The question of getting rid of the Privy Council seems to me to be not quite so important as the matter which Senator Johnson has stressed; that is, the clearing up of the meaning of the word &ldquo;consent.&rdquo;  It is very important to determine whether consent will be taken for granted without consulting us.  The Privy Council may, of course, humbug the Indians with retired judges.  It is good enough for every colony, but it is not good enough for India; they have not a Privy Council for themselves, but we have to have one.  That, however, is a matter we can deal with without an Imperial conference. The important question has relation to the landing of troops and the securing of a clear definition in regard to the word &ldquo;consent.&rdquo;  We would like to know whether consent is to be taken for granted or whether it is embodied in the Treaty.  How many troops the word &ldquo;consent&rdquo; covers ought to be made quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Johnson up to the point where he speaks about the King interfering as an hereditary monarch or as a political figurehead. The Senator's main objection is in relation to class domination.  If Senator Johnson were wise, the further <Col N="1618" /> he would keep working men away from legislation the better.  The Senator should remember what has happened in Russia.  The Russian people are nearly all workers now.  The main idea of the working man is to get work.  If he gets into power he is accused of creating slave camps.  If the working men in Russia were wise they would have got Cochran or some of those famous entertainers to rule instead of themselves.  I heard it said when they were complaining about the house of Romanoff that the Czar was knouting his subjects.  &ldquo;That is all very well,&rdquo; said someone else, &ldquo;but if he did not knout them they would do it themselves.&rdquo; The man who should be kept as far away as possible from government is the working man.  He should avoid it like the plague.  If ever working men secured power they would be well advised to call in people who are specialists.</P>

I am in favour of the amendment proposed by Senator Johnson up to the point where it bears the complexion of being a vote of want of confidence in the Executive Council.  I think the Executive Council are not so blind, when they strain at a question like the Privy Council, as that they would avoid the definition of the word &ldquo;consent.&rdquo;  That word should certainly be defined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephODoherty" hpid="Mr. O'Doherty Mr. O'Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Before entering this House I used to be considerably amused by debates on questions affecting the political status of Ireland and its relationship to independent States inside and outside the British Commonwealth. I must say that a more ludicrous speech was never uttered in connection with that status than the speech just delivered by Senator Johnson. The Senator began by decrying the fact that those who attended the Conference in London were not of one mind as to whether that Conference was an Imperial Conference or whether it <Col N="1619" /> was a Conference of Free Nations.  They even in the publication of their Report digressed in the designation of what the Conference was.  Then the Senator asserts in the course of his remarks that Ireland&mdash;in the latter part of his speech he corrected that to part of Ireland&mdash;is free and independent, and he asks us to support his amendment throwing bouquets at the Executive Council, and especially at the Minister for External Affairs, for the part they or he have played in the establishment of that freedom and that independence. I say that speech of Senator Johnson's is ludicrous, because the whole speech is based on his acceptance of fundamentals so different from mine that it is laughable to hear them put forth in this Assembly.  It is not for me to define what constitutes a free nation, but surely the basic fundamental of freedom is the right of a people to formulate its own Constitution, the Constitution under which a section of the Irish nation is living, and forced to live, by virtue of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty established in 1921, and implemented by a British Act of Parliament.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephODoherty" hpid="Mr. O'Doherty Mr. O'Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Document No. 2 can be discussed if you wish to discuss it. I say a people who depend for its freedom and its implementations of freedom on Articles of Agreement for a Treaty by an Act of a foreign Parliament in the first instance, and whose Constitution is dictated by the Executive authority of that Parliament is not and cannot be free.  If there is any other definition of freedom than that I would like to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are living in a small country, territorially one of the smallest in Europe.  We are a small nation, but from the point of view of history we are one of the oldest in Europe.  From the point of view of our claims to exercise that God-given power that rests with a people to formulate its own government, we stand up and make a claim that we have that right, and we shall continue to assert that right until that right is established in the four <Col N="1620" /> corners of Ireland.  I say that any Irishman who maintains that the Constitution under which we live at the present moment gives us freedom, is not merely insulting all dead patriots of our country, but he is endeavouring to tie up all future generations of our people.  Each and every one of us in whose veins runs Irish blood should resent such a statement.  It would be all very well to discuss the status of the so-called Free State in an academic atmosphere, but in an Assembly such as this to proclaim that we are free is something that all Irishmen should resent.</P>
    <P>The Report that is under review invites this Assembly, which is alleged to be a Sovereign Parliament, to ask the British Parliament to make laws operative in its territory.  And yet the Minister for External Affairs is asserting that this Twenty-Six Counties known as Saorstát Eireann is on an equality basis with the British Government and with the Governments of the other constituent members of the Commonwealth of Nations, or of the British Empire, whichever you like to call it. Why should one constituent self-governing unit of the Empire with co-equal status with the other members of the Empire ask a sister partner to pass a law binding the people of its territory?  The position is absurd.  The mere fact of the Report being placed before us presupposes that the British Parliament sitting in London is the supreme authority inside the British Empire.  When it is recommended that we should accept this Report and that we should throw bouquets at the Minister for External Affairs for the part he took in the deliberations which brought about the Report, I say that you are asking something that we should refuse to accept.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, speaking not as a very deep student of constitutional government and with no very great knowledge of the history of constitutional development, that it is written in pretty large letters that the tendency in the British Empire at the moment&mdash;and I give credit for sincerity to the representatives from the various constituent parts of that Empire&mdash;is to establish within the <Col N="1621" /> Empire, free States, independent States, acting in matters that concern themselves with absolute freedom and in matters of common concern in a common way.  But I feel that that development will eventuate in a retrograde step for Ireland, because it seems to me they are aiming at a gradual conception or development of an Imperial Constitution, or a Constitution governing the Commonwealth of British nations.  It seems to me that that Constitution will be of a rigid character, a written character, an unchangeable character, except that it may be changeable in such a way or under such a system or by such methods as will be very difficult to put into force.  If that rigid constitution of which I visualise the development materialises, you will have under it matters of common concern guaranteed. You will have matters of defence to which you will have to contribute. You will have, in my opinion, an Imperial judiciary to whose decision you will have to bow, and so on in matters of common concern.  You will be tried by a majority vote of the delegates representing the British Imperial interests, whether they come from the ends of the Empire or from London. In my opinion, the farther we keep away from that development the better for Ireland.  In other words, I might put my views in the form of a question in this way:</P>
    <P>Let us ask ourselves whether we stand for the present constitutional position as being free, untrammelled and sovereign?  If we deny that it is free, then are we to accept for the moment the views put forward by the protagonists of the Treaty in 1921, that it was a stepping-stone to freedom, a viewpoint which to-day was repudiated by the leader of the Labour Party, and get somewhere else?  For the sake of argument, I will grant members of the House sincerity and honesty of purpose in the matter.  I do not think there is any harm in granting that. Unfortunately some members do not even grant that to those who are opposed to them, either in this or other matters.  If you desire to march forward, will that march forward be rendered more difficult or made more <Col N="1622" /> easy by the consolidation of the present British Commonwealth of Nations?  In my opinion you are tying yourselves to the present Constitution and its limited development. Because of the dictate nature of the Constitution you are tying yourselves, as I see it, to a rigid constitution of the Imperial Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson referred to the monarchy.  So long as the monarchy remains a mere cypher Senator Johnson has no objection.  So long as the British monarch remains a shadow, or appears to be something in the nature of a shadow, Senator Johnson has no objection.  But why shadows or why cyphers at all?  Why send men to their death because of cyphers?  We do not want the British monarch either as a shadow or as a reality in the Constitution of a free Ireland, and we ask the House to take the same point of view.  Every time that we discuss inter-imperial relations or international relations we will continue to assert as men that we want Ireland free from Donegal to Cork&mdash;not cutting off the Six Counties, but including them.  I feel that I would be failing in my duty to the House if I did not call attention to what I consider the rather undignified language of Senator Gogarty in criticising adversely and making cheap jibes and jokes about the constitution and government of another country which is not under discussion.  I feel that if the Senator wanted to be in a humorous mood he could have got plenty of opportunities for levity if he kept before his mind the Constitution of the Free State, which is alleged to be free on the one hand and not free on the other.  If the Senator were to do that he would find plenty of opportunity for levity.</P>

      <P>With a great deal of what Senator Johnson said I agree, especially with what he said in the earlier part of his speech.  The Senator pointed out that the House is asked to pass a motion accepting all the statements contained in the report before us, a report of 132 pages of printed matter.  According to the motion itself we are asked to do nothing of the sort.  The Report of <Col N="1623" /> the Imperial Conference states that the British Parliament will pass what is called the Statute of Westminster. The statement relating to that points out that the articles which will be included in it are those referred to in the attached schedule.  The attached schedule consists of two and a half pages.  That is all that we have been asked to pass by the Imperial Conference, whereas the Minister, for some reason that I do not understand, is asking us to pass holus-bolus all that is in the Report before us, containing a number of statements that have no concern whatever with us.  Anyone who reads what is referred to on page 19 will see that we are not even asked to do that.  Some of the things that have been appropriately quoted by Senator Johnson we are asked to agree with.  One refers to the Antarctic, which apparently is going to be annexed by the Empire.  There are explorations to be made there.  I confess I do not know what Ireland has to do with all that.</P>

Perhaps he would like to have some penguins.  Then Singapore and India are referred to.  We have also in the report the speeches made by Parliamentarians from the Dominions about various things, some of which state one thing and some another.  We are supposed to agree with all that.  We have also in the report pages of statistics dealing with imports and exports at the other side. We are asked to approve of all that, too.  Never, in the whole of my life, have I heard anything more ridiculous than that this House should be asked to agree to a proposal such as we have before us.  I do not disapprove so much of the first paragraph in Senator Johnson's amendment, but I totally disapprove of the other paragraphs in it.  The Senator made a statement as to the position of the Labour Party. <Col N="1624" /> I cannot say that it was quite accurate as regards the past, but I am not now going into that question.  There are a great many members here who take up quite a different position to that of Senator Johnson.  As far as those members and the members of my own Party are concerned, they look on this matter that Ireland is a Dominion from a different point of view.  The idea that such a motion as the one before us is desirable is absolutely contrary to our ideas, to the ideas of everybody who has ever been in a national party in Ireland over the last hundred years or more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not repudiate me on this.  Our position is that we believe that Ireland is an independent country.  It was always an independent country.  It has only ceased now and then to be independent because of the encroachments of a foreign power.  Those encroachments have had to be thrown off by degrees, one after another.  Any that happen to remain will within a short time also be thrown off.  The Minister and our Party have an entirely different outlook on that. Ministers spend their time going to the other side asking Ministers there to pass resolutions and to make certain <Col N="1625" /> arrangements for us here which, as Senator Johnson has said, have absolutely nothing whatever to do with us. We are, as I have said, an independent nation.  The whole history of our country points that out.</P>
      <P>If the British King claims any rights in this country, or if he ever had any rights&mdash;which we say he had not&mdash;the British have lost all claim through their behaviour here, behaviour that was barbarous, that was inhuman, and an outrage on Christianity during the last 700 years.  It seems to be forgotten by a great many people who speak now that Ireland is not a Dominion.  The Treaty stated that Ireland had the status of a Dominion, but it does not state that we are a Dominion.  As far as the statement of this Conference is concerned, I regard it as being in the nature of a renunciation act.  In the time of Grattan's Parliament a resolution was passed and a demand was made that the British Parliament would pass an Act renouncing all claims to any control over this country. They passed that Act because they were satisfied they could not do anything then, and afterwards revoked it, although they pledged themselves never again to interfere.  They broke their promise, as they have always done, and established the Union.  That is how I regard this matter, and I do not think it is necessary for us to pass either Senator Johnson's amendment or the Minister's motion.  The only thing I see about this motion is that it makes it somewhat easier for us to assert our position than to come into forcible opposition with the British.</P>

      <P>It might be, but we would do it in any case.  It only saves us the trouble of coming into collision with the British.  We are not going to ask them to do that.  They make an act of renunciation in which they declare that they will not do any of these things in future, just the same as when they had to pass the Treaty because we demanded it.  Now they ask us to pass this motion on account of the Ministers and their clever management. <Col N="1626" /> It does not affect our position or any of our principles.</P>
      <P>The position of the King has been mentioned.  As far as I can see, there are four or five paragraphs in the Report which deal with that question and with the Governor-General.  The King has renounced all rights to be King of Ireland.  He is no longer King of Ireland. He is no longer King anywhere. He is King, or claims to be King, over a series of nations, and in not one of them&mdash;except in England&mdash;can he do anything or go into unless he is asked. He is in the air, a sort of stellar King who has nothing to do with anybody or with anything as far as I can see.</P>

      <P>In the old days in France there was a line of Merovingian kings who became so decrepit that nobody paid any attention to what they said or did, and they established Mayors of the Palace who did all the work.  According to paragraphs in the report I see that the Governor-General is supposed to be the Mayor of the Palace over here, and is supposed to do all the work of controlling the country. The King does not even appoint the Governor-General.  He is appointed by the Ministers here.  All they are supposed to do under this Act is to notify the King that they intend to make so-and-so Governor-General, and whether the King likes it or not the Governor-General appears.  It is a rather ludicrous position.</P>

      <P>I am not saying whether I want it so or not.  I say that the position of both the King and the Governor-General is ludicrous.  The King has abdicated his position as King of Ireland, and he has now handed over his duties to the Governor-General. Whether the Governor-General could carry out these duties is an entirely separate matter.  It is rather curious that there was an Imperial Conference a short time ago, and that Conference appointed a Committee <Col N="1627" /> to report to it.  The Committee reported, and before anything further happened, beyond the report to the Imperial Conference, the Minister brought the matter before the Dáil and got a motion passed.  Shortly afterwards, when the report came before the Imperial Conference, it was altered.  The Minister is now asking this House to pass the altered report. Both the right and the wrong reports are to be passed.  It seems a rather extraordinary way of doing business. Perhaps the Minister will explain some of these things.  I am entirely opposed either to Senator Johnson's amendment or to the Minister's proposal, that we should agree with the report wholesale, whether we like it or not.</P>

      <P>There are one or two points that seem to arise each year on this issue, and this is one of the few opportunities afforded of dealing with them.  At the outset I want to say that, in the main, I agree with what Senator O'Doherty said.  I would like the Minister to let us know what is his opinion, and what is the opinion of his Department, after their experience of the Imperial Conference?  Does the Minister not think that there is a very definite drift towards the possibility of Imperial Commonwealth control, in which we might become involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>And if that developed we might find it extremely difficult to cut out from the commitments we have already made&mdash;such agreements as the Commonwealth Conference may reach.  As I see it, I think there is a great danger and a great drift in that direction.  I can see naval estimates being prepared whereby a percentage basis will be fixed for this country; similarly a military basis, and similarly quotas as regards imports and exports.  One of Senator Gogarty's brilliant interventions into the affairs of this House was when he brought up a proposal with regard to inter-Imperial trade.  We have to forgive the Senator a good deal because we know that is one of these pleasant little interludes in his daily work.  He puts in a <Col N="1628" /> very pleasant appearance here on occasions, just the same as he visits various institutions.  Nobody with any intelligence takes him seriously.  Sometimes he saves himself by an occasional witty or brilliant remark but on most occasions he does not.  I say that for the benefit of those who may have heard him and might think that we took Senator Gogarty seriously on political matters.</P>
      <P>A good deal has been said with regard to the King, the occupation of the country, the possibility of the King's physical presence here, and various other things.  We have had enough experience of all the political controversies and all the practical problems which we are faced with to realise that the King could be shipped to Portadown instead of the Pope and that we could not prevent him; that the King could be landed in this country and we could not prevent it.  It might not be very good policy for him to land in certain parts of this island, but that is another question.</P>
      <P>The relative difference between the physical presence of the King here and his signature to the enactments of this Oireachtas is, to my mind, something that is not worth consideration. The actual presence of the King is felt in so far as we have got to recognise him and in so far as this country voluntarily recognises him.  Whether the King is fishing in County Galway or living on the Thames the actual power exercised and imposed by the King is the power that is exercised by and through the Governor-General signing for him and on his behalf.  To discuss it on any other basis is simply burying our heads in the sands.  It is that fundamental issue that has been the cause of all the trouble in Ireland, that has been the cause of the worst period that we went through, and it is going to be the cause of further trouble.  The question is, how far we are getting out of it or how far we are getting further into it?  We heard a good deal in 1921 and 1922 about the stepping-stone policy.  I should like to think, and I want to think, that we are stepping out of the Empire, but we are not.  In my opinion, each year's Report of the Imperial Conference goes to show that we are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> On that point, I want to raise another issue which I raised last year and which the Minister made great capital of in his analysis.  I think it was last year.  I refer to the right of secession.  The Minister will probably remember dealing at considerable length with the position assumed by General Hertzog on behalf of South Africa in his claim to the right of secession.  If the Minister will refer to the debates on that occasion he will find that I asked him if General Hertzog had established that right to secession did we not automatically share that as co-equal partners in the Commonwealth?  That, to my mind, is a most important decision and it is a most important fact.  But a most alarming thing has occurred, in my opinion, and I think the Minister will bear me out in this.  If he can correct me I shall be very glad to be corrected. It was anticipated that at the succeeding Imperial Conference the right of secession, as put forward by General Hertzog, was to be discussed. That was my interpretation.  I think it was the impression left on the House by the Minister.  I felt at all events that at the succeeding Imperial Conference the right of secession would be established and that each Dominion, so-called, would have the right to secede by the action of its own Parliament. If that can be established, it will eliminate a very considerable amount of difficulty from the path of any future Government of this country, whether that Government is represented by the Minister's Party or any other Party.  Let us face up to it, that we are trying to think in terms of progressive national development and not in terms of conflict and fight. This country wants to progress and wants peace to progress.  It does not want to be at enmity with any country in the world.  But there are certain things which this country cannot give away and which it is not in the power of any Ministry to give away.  If we could have the satisfaction of knowing that at the Imperial Conference it was established that the right of secession belonged to all the peoples, then we would at least see our way clear.  I think it is the Minister's point of view <Col N="1630" /> that within the Empire we are getting all the things we want.  It is, at all events, the point of view of certain members of the Executive Council. The Vice-President (Mr. Blythe) made it very clear when he said: &ldquo;With regard to the point as to whether we are aiming at the establishment of an Irish Republic, we are not.  We believe that this country, as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, can enjoy greater freedom and security than she could outside the British Commonwealth of Nations, and our policy within it is really to remove the anomalies that exist in the relationship between the members of it.&rdquo; That is not the point of view of this country.  It may be the point of view of the Vice-President in the year 1931, but it is not the point of view of this country.  If that issue is put clearly to the people of the country, I have no hesitation in saying what their decision will be.</P>
    <P>We are asked to approve of this measure.  When Senator Johnson was referring to the naval base at Singapore the Minister, I understood, nodded a disclaimer that we were embodied in that agreement&mdash;that is to say, that we were not one of the parties to that particular agreement. But surely the Minister will not contend, if we pass this Report as such here to-day, that we are not automatically committing ourselves to all that is in it?  I am not interested in Singapore or in naval bases in that sense. I am very much interested in the fact that there should not be the power to have British naval bases in this country, and I want to point out to Senator Johnson that the whole question of territorial waters around this island has not yet been settled.  If more attention were paid to such things as that we might get on better.  We do know in a realistic way that British forces, American forces, or French forces could&mdash;by virtue of the small population in this country, by virtue of the fact that we are not a heavily-armed people, that we have not a naval defence force&mdash;land any time they want here.  Nobody but a fool would shut his eyes to that fact.  What we do feel that is lacking in our position, <Col N="1631" /> as distinct from what it was, is the moral position that we claimed in the world.  It was our moral position, and not our physical activities, that dominated the situation in 1921.  We have lost that moral position.  We have lost it because we are neither fish, flesh, fowl nor good red herring.  Internationally we are known as part of the British Empire, and, at the same time, we try to make people believe that we are independent.  That confusion of thought is present in this House.  It is present all through the country, and it is naturally more present outside the country.  What we want to do is to have some definite understanding as regards our moral position.  We deny the right of England or the British Empire or any other country to come in here and occupy our territory.  We deny the right of anyone to partition the country as it has been partitioned under our present administration and Executive.  We deny the right to attempt to control our territorial waters, and I hold that we jeopardise our moral position by our activities in connection with Imperial and the Commonwealth Conferences.  We give away our position by having anything to do with the Imperial forces that combine to make up the British Empire.</P>
    <P>There is nothing more that I wish to say.  But I am very interested to know how we stand with regard to the question of secession, whether it is gone for ever, and if the Imperial Conference under some malign influence or otherwise has decided to drop the whole issue, or if there is any possibility of having it established. If we knew where we were with regard to that we would have a better idea as to how we would stand in the ultimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>We have wandered in this debate over a very considerable number of subjects.  So far, with the possible exception of the speech of Senator Gogarty's on the one side, and on which side he spoke I do not know, we have listened entirely to speeches from Senators who are of the opinion that we should not express our approval of the Report of the Commonwealth Conference.  I want to speak <Col N="1632" /> briefly on the opposite side.  Senator O'Doherty in a very able speech was good enough for the sake of argument to admit the sincerity of those opposed to him.  I do not think he really meant that, but I do not think that anyone here would question the absolute sincerity of the speech made by Senator O'Doherty.  If you take the point of view he took, then his opposition to any approval of this Report of the Commonwealth Conference is clearly and easily understandable. He made it quite clear to the House that he was opposed to any political connection with the British Commonwealth, no matter how independent we might be.  If he takes that point of view rigidly and acts upon it, then, in my opinion he is right in opposing this motion, because this Conference marks another very great step in making clear to the world the independent position of this country inside that Commonwealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connolly and I will not be at all likely to accuse each other of any want of sincerity, and I am quite sure that when he states that this country, if the issue were put fairly to them, would not be in favour of any connection with the British Commonwealth, I for my part, declare as emphatically, that I believe this country, if the issue were put fairly to them, would be in favour of a connection with it.  By having the issue put fairly I do not mean statements that this country is not independent, and references to a so-called independent Parliament.  I do not mean on every possible platform trying to make little of this independence, and suggesting that it is a Parliament that cannot do various things.  The test is: Do the things, and see what will happen.  If we believe in independence, then let this Parliament go its own way.  Let the country in accordance with the decision of the people, endeavour to make its legislation, and I, for one, am absolutely convinced that we will be in a more independent position to carry out the wishes of this country as a whole, by having connection with the British Commonwealth.  But if your opinion is that in no circumstances can there be any such connection, <Col N="1633" /> then the right thing is to oppose the reports of the Commonwealth Conferences, because these Conferences are making it more and more clear every time that this country is independent.</P>
    <P>I may say I read the other day the first speech I ever made in this House, and one of the first things I said was that I believed that this Parliament was an independent Parliament.  I still absolutely believe that.  But I believe further: we have evidence that that position is being recognised both inside the Commonwealth and outside in a way it was not recognised at the time this Parliament was set up.  Many of us believed in the Treaty not so much as a stepping-stone, but because we believed it set up a position which would eventually be recognised as independent. We have to face the fact that the mentality of many people in England is very much like the mentality of many of those in the Fianna Fáil Party: that they keep looking at various phrases here and there; they see in these potential or possible control over this country, and we have, undoubtedly, as Senator Johnson said, in the minds of many of these politicians an undoubted incapacity to appreciate the independent position not only of this country but of other independent portions in the British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>The main issue we are really discussing here is the amendment of Senator Johnson.  He objects to approval of the Report of the Commonwealth Conference because, as he says, by a stretch of the imagination a person could imagine that in doing so we were asking the British Parliament to pass legislation applicable to this Parliament and in that way weakening our position.  I missed the first few words of his speech, but I listened very carefully to the remainder, or what I might call his stretching of the imagination, in which he tried to show that if we approved of the Report we might conceivably be asking the British Parliament to legislate for us.  I fail to see any proof or any suggestion that the approval of the Report would be in any sense a request to the British Parliament. Let us be quite clear.  Let us <Col N="1634" /> forget for the moment the position of our friends who, in no circumstances, would agree to a position inside the Commonwealth, and come to the position of those of us who believe this country is independent inside the British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>What are Imperial Conferences? They are meetings of the Governments of the independent countries of the Commonwealth to discuss all kinds of matters and, when they think fit, to make a report.  What is our function here?  Our function is either to approve of the Report in so far as it is agreed to by our representatives or to disapprove of it.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson suggested a Committee Stage.  I suggested that that would be absurd.  We can have no such position here.  We sent Ministers to that Conference to represent us just as nations may send theirs to different countries, and the Parliament can refuse approval or it can approve. We cannot, at a later date, go through all the details, and say we would like this word altered or that word altered and go through it in Committee.  We have to take this as a whole and decide whether it represents progress.  I admit quite frankly so far as I am personally concerned that it would not mean anything to me whether the Statute of Westminister ever was passed by the British Parliament or not, because I believe that we in this country are strong enough, and our position is sufficiently established, for all practical purposes, to ignore anything done there.  But we must recognise that there are people in England and in this country who are misled by the fact that there are various legislative provisions which have lost all their real effect.  The fact that they still exist in law misleads people, particularly in this country.  It is difficult for many people to appreciate what the exact issue is, and for that reason it is a good thing that Great Britain should pass such an Act as the Statute of Westminister, which is proposed largely from that point of view and from the point of view of the world generally, to clear up a great many points which have not been in doubt, <Col N="1635" /> and which are not in doubt in the minds of most of us here, and which have not raised any serious doubts in the mind of the Minister.</P>
    <P>As regards the position of our Constitution here, it was passed by the Oireachtas and an Act was passed in the British Parliament which gave that Constitution the force of law in Britain.  I am of opinion that the passing of that Act in the British Parliament did not affect the legality of the Constitution here.  I am quite convinced that the passing by the British Parliament of that Act, in which they stated that this Parliament had the sole power of passing laws for the people of the Free State, was a valuable thing, not because it gave us power here but because the British Parliament renounced definitely any claims whatever to legislate for us.  I think that that disposes of one of the principal difficulties of Senator Johnson.</P>
    <P>The Senator is also perturbed regarding some words which appear in the Report of the Imperial Conference. I have not discussed the matter with the Minister and I have not gone into it very carefully but I rather think that the words to which the Senator takes exception were inserted because of a possible position in regard to the Canadian Constitution.  Because the right of certain of the independent countries of the Commonwealth to ask the Parliament of Westminister, if they think fit, to pass legislation is not precluded by the Statute of Westminister, the Senator thinks that there is a suggestion that such a position may arise in the future in regard to the Free State. In the first place, the likelihood of this Parliament, in any circumstances, asking the British Parliament to pass legislation is absurd.  Even if there was any possibility of this Parliament doing so, we would be precluded by our Constitution from taking such action, because, according to the Constitution, the sole power to legislate for this State is vested in this Parliament.  The British Parliament could not legislate for this country either, even if we asked them to do so, because in their <Col N="1636" /> own Act embodying our Constitution they state that the sole power to legislate in the Free State is vested in this Parliament.  I think that no case can be made for the wording of Senator Johnson's amendment.  I disagree with scarcely anything in it but I do not think it clarifies the position.  Unquestioned progress was made at the last Conference and unless we take up the position that Senator O'Doherty takes up &mdash; which is quite clear &mdash; our right course is to approve of the Report.</P>

      <P>A few years ago the then Minister for Foreign Affairs in Great Britain got great credit&mdash;and quite properly&mdash;for having secured the ratification of an agreement at Locarno. The matters covered by that agreement were not very specific.  It has been said of certain happenings since then that they have been in accordance with the spirit or against the spirit of Locarno.  In fact, the British Foreign Minister's achievement seems to have been that of generating an atmosphere of geniality and cordiality in international relations&mdash;an atmosphere which up to then had been absent.  I quite agree with those who have spoken here that every willing entry into Imperial Conferences, which are referred to now as Commonwealth Conferences, is more and more an acceptance of the status of the so-called Free State as outlined at the time of the Treaty.  Mr. Michael Collins and Mr. Arthur Griffith, who were the principal men who brought about that settlement&mdash;which I frankly confess was a great step forward&mdash;have time and again stated: &ldquo;This is no more a final settlement than this is the final generation.&rdquo;  I must confess that I was rather shocked by what Senator Connolly read as to the position of Mr. Blythe now&mdash;that is, an acceptance of finality, a declaration that this part of Ireland is simply an atom in the molecule called the British Commonwealth of Nations.  As regards co-equality of status, I do not pay very much attention to that, but we hear it stressed very often.  Even that claim to co-equality is untrue.  Now, as always, this country is the step-child of what is known as the British Empire. If we want a slight indication <Col N="1637" /> of that, we have only to have regard to the treatment of this country in respect of a very minor matter&mdash;the Lane pictures.  Would that treatment have been meted out to Canada, to South Africa, to Australia, or even to Newfoundland?  Of course it would not.  It is well that we should be clear on these matters.  Let us take the statement of Mr. Blythe&mdash;who, I assume, speaks for the Government&mdash; that we have accepted for good and all this status.  Why on earth have a demonstration every year at Bodenstown for the glorification of the memory of a man whose outstanding utterance was that he wished to sunder the last link which connected this country with Great Britain?  If Bodenstown is not an organised hypocrisy in view of Mr. Blythe's statement, which, I take it, represents the position of the Executive Council, I do do not know what hypocrisy is.</P>

      <P>Every Senator who has spoken up to the present spoke on behalf of some political party.  Perhaps I will be permitted to give the view of one of the most important industries of the country on the subject under discussion. I refer to the live stock industry. Ninety-five per cent. of the people engaged in that industry, and the great majority of the farmers, want the Treaty without alteration.  We want to remain a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and we do not want to go outside it.  I agree with Senator O'Doherty and Senator Colonel Moore that we have not freedom in this country.  We shall not have freedom until the minority recognise, or are compelled to recognise, the will of the majority of the elected representatives of the people.  Recently I had a communication from a tourist district in the South of Ireland, and I understand that as soon as the reports of the deplorable incidents which occurred recently in our country appeared in the British Press fifty per cent. of the tourist bookings in the County Kerry were cancelled.  That is not freedom.  That is not the freedom which we want to have under the Treaty.</P>

      <P>We are quite independent as we stand at the present time and far more important than we would ever be under an Irish Republic.  I agree with Senator Douglas that if that question were put fairly and squarely before the people of Ireland the vast majority would agree with my view. Our country stands recognised as an independent nation.  Foreign Ministers have declared that, to our great pride. For our honoured position in the world to-day we have to thank the late Minister for Justice at the first Imperial Conference, and the present Minister for External Affairs at the later Conferences. They have put Ireland into an honoured position in the world&mdash; such a position as she never occupied before.  That is the truth, no matter what balderdash may be stated to the contrary to mislead the people and to play up to the romantic flappers who want something romantic to hang on to. One of the leaders of Fianna Fáil&mdash;we do not know who is the real leader&mdash; stated on a public platform that if they come into power they would accept the Treaty and work it.  But they have to come along and trot out the Republic in order to keep in touch with a certain following in the country.  I think it was Senator O'Doherty who said that the Treaty was rammed down our throats.  It was not.  It was accepted by the vast majority of the people of the country.</P>

I think it was Senator Connolly who said that England or any foreign Power could land an army here and that there was nothing to prevent their doing so.  Will any Senator tell me how, with the longest and largest coastline in Europe, if we had an independent Republic, we could prevent an army being landed or an invasion of this country?  Are we going to build the biggest navy in the world when we are not able, according to some people, to pay our honest debts?  Are we going to build that navy?  That is the position.  I maintain that under an independent Republic we would be far more the football of the nations than we are as a member of the great society known as the Commonwealth of Nations.  We are just as free and independent as we could possibly be, and we are in a far more powerful position.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Doherty, in opening, said that Senator Johnson had made a perfectly ludicrous speech. He explained afterwards that it was ludicrous from his point of view, because he and Senator Johnson looked at fundamentals from a totally different standpoint.  Simply because they have different points of view it does not follow that Senator Johnson's remarks were ludicrous.  I subscribe to Senator Johnson's whole statement and support the amendment which he put forward.  Senator O'Doherty seemed to be under the impression and actually indicated that because these reports had to be submitted to this House, they indicated the subserviency of this State.  He might as well say that the reports from delegates to the League of Nations, which are submitted to all the Parliaments of States which are parties to the League, indicated the subserviency of any of these particular States.  I do not think that by attending these Imperial <Col N="1640" /> Conferences we are in any way indicating subserviency, any more than we indicate subserviency by attending the League of Nations.  I, too, have to admit that the whole tendency since the Free State became part of the Commonwealth of Nations has been towards the decentralisation and dismemberment of what was the British Empire.  I have no brief, good, bad or indifferent, from those who represent the State there, but I have to admit that they have assisted other members of the Commonwealth and led them in asserting their independence as coequal members of that Commonwealth. To the extent that that can be done I think we are doing good work.  I was surprised to hear the late Michael Collins, who was shot down by his opponents, quoted here to-day by the same Party.  It is very easy to quote him when he is dead, just as Wolfe Tone has been quoted, and the particular statement made by him used as a foundation for a whole inverted pyramid.</P>

      <P>Of course he did.  So did Michael Collins.  Surely people change their minds.  The Colonel has changed his mind very considerably. The Boer farmers of 1900 would be astounded if they heard his speech here to-day.  Every man of intelligence has a right to change his mind.  President Lincoln said on one occasion: &ldquo;Of course I have changed my mind; if I did not change my mind it would indicate that I am no wiser to-day than I was yesterday.&rdquo;  What right have we to assume that Wolfe Tone would not have changed his mind in accordance with circumstances?  A good practical patriot always serves his country by the means at hand, and in accordance with the circumstances of his day and time. Nations that spring to maturity very quickly are prone to die just as quickly. The flowers of the summer are just as fleeting as the heat that produces them, but the oak which is the growth of centuries survives even the decay of empires.  We find that the dominion of Alexander, which was built up in a few campaigns, was broken up in the lifetime of those who witnessed its <Col N="1641" /> birth, while the Roman Empire, which was the growth of successive ages, endured for a thousand years.</P>
      <P>This State is gradually building itself up.  It has been stated that Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith stated that the Treaty was no more the last word in the determining of the independence of Ireland than that this generation is the last of humanity. Subsequent incidents have gone to prove that.  There may have been some disimprovements, and in one respect there was a disimprovement or an improvement, according to the point of view from which you look at the financial arrangement.  There certainly have been improvements and advances on the moral side of freedom, and the moral side has been stressed here.  We have not attempted to do one single thing that was for the good of this country socially, intellectually or politically in which the Empire, or any part of it, stood in the way.  My position is that when we try to do something for the good of the country, and when any part of the Empire stands in the way, then it will be time for us to act, and not before. We are not going to create strife or trouble unnecessarily, and we are not going to go shadow-boxing with other nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Doherty asked &ldquo;Why send people to their deaths over cyphers?&rdquo;  I agree.  Why send them to their deaths either for empty formulae?  Why should we simply think that we can never go to meet an Englishman, Scotchman or Welshman, or anybody else in any part of the British Commonwealth, except with the tomahawk or the scalp knife in our hands?  A spirit of hatred never built up any great nation.  It is not by a spirit of hatred this, or any other nation, is going to become great.  I do not agree that the Irish people were stampeded by threats, or forced into accepting the Treaty in the General Election of 1922, or forced into accepting the Constitution in 1923.  You cannot intimidate the Irish people in that way, because if you could, they would have been intimidated by the ruthless terrorism of 1922 and 1923 that was tried upon them <Col N="1642" /> by their own countrymen.  It is that terrorism that has kept some Parties out of power ever since.  I do not agree with a tremendous amount of what is happening, but being a democrat, and being in a minority, I have as such to submit to the will of the majority, until such time as my Party is able to convince the majority of the electorate of the State of the wisdom of our point of view.</P>
    <P>Four elections have ratified the Constitution.  There were several Parties in the field to place their views on what the Constitution was, and what it meant, before the people. One policy has been endorsed and, although we may not agree with it, we have to submit to it until we are able to change it.  That is democracy.  The minority in some people's mind must be always right, but they have got to submit until the majority comes round to their point of view.  Infinitely more objectionable than a King, whom the people never see, and who never interferes with our affairs, would be a truculent minority who would impose its views on the majority, irrespective of their interest.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of force has been referred to as having been introduced into the Constitution.  There never was any Treaty yet made that an element of force did not enter into it. There was never a single agreement between employers and employees that an element of force did not enter into, so that our Treaty and our Constitution are no different from any other Treaty or Constitution that was ever made.  Look at the Seven-Power Conference to-day that is assembling in London.  Surely there is an element of force and coercion there being introduced amongst the great Powers of the world, and they cannot complain. It is an essential of human life.  We have heard a good deal about the landing of troops and so on, and Senatory Gogarty talked about our consent and whether that was going to be taken for granted or not.  Personally, I attach very little importance to that aspect of the case as to whether our consent is to be taken for granted or not.  Belgium gave no consent to Germany <Col N="1643" /> when she invaded her in 1914, nor did France.  Neither did Germany give consent to Russia.  When the war drum rolls, treaties, consents, and things of that sort will depend on the expediency of the Powers engaged in the conflict.  If it suits England, France or any other country to occupy this State or any part of it they will do that irrespective of any moral right or treaty that may be in existence. We will count very little in the scheme of things should a war come about, particularly in view of modern developments in warfare.</P>
    <P>As to the question in regard to the King, some people have the King as great an obsession as the Orangemen have the Pope.  I certainly cannot see that the question of a King, President or anything else in Britain matters very much to us except as merely a theoretical arrangement.  Certainly there is one thing that I would not favour, and that is the election of a President with the powers, say, of the President of the United States, who has an absolute veto over Parliament. He can declare war or make peace, and he does repeatedly veto the enactments of the legislature.  I am not sure that I did not hear Colonel Moore one time singing &ldquo;We will crown de Valera King of Ireland.&rdquo;  Certainly it was a popular song at one time.</P>

      <P>It is another change of view as to what the ideal form of government is.  Poor Wolfe Tone has been drawn into the question, and the expeditions to his grave every year. Certainly everybody says a greater display of hypocrisy has never been exhibited by any nation than when the two or three Parties go there every year to praise Wolfe Tone and denounce each other.  They are all for Ireland, but at the same time each is out for the destruction of a certain section of the present Irish generation. That is the way they are going to honour the memory of Wolfe Tone.  It is not love of Wolfe Tone, but hatred of each other, that brings them there, <Col N="1644" /> just playing up to the extremists in the various camps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dowdall was really very hard up for showing that we had not coequal status when he mentioned the Lane pictures and said that because the legal will of Sir Hugh Lane was not set aside in our favour we had not coequal status.  That certainly, from a very responsible man like Senator Dowdall, is going very far to look for another injustice to Ireland.  Senator O'Doherty certainly to-day did not agree with one of his leaders in the other House, Deputy Lemass, when he denounced the Treaty and all connected with it.  He talked about the so-called Treaty, the so-called Free State and so on.  Speaking at Cleggan this very year, Deputy Lemass said that the Fianna Fáil Party could not be described as anti-Treaty or pro-Treaty. In the speech he said that they would work the institutions set up by the Treaty of 1921.  Either Deputy Lemass is not speaking the views of the Fianna Fáil Party, or Senator O'Doherty is misinterpreting the policy of that Party.  What I would like to know is: what is to be the alternative to our Ministers attending the Commonwealth Conference?  Are they to shut their eyes, or are they to adopt a policy of the Christian Scientists and believe it is all humbug, that there is no such thing as a Commonwealth, that we are really free and independent and a thing apart altogether, and that the other sections of the Commonwealth do not exist as far as we are concerned?  Having adopted that attitude, what benefit is it suggested it is going to bring to this State?  I would like to know first of all, before I do a thing, that there is some meaning in it, and that it is going to effect some good.  If I could see that it was not going to help the State I certainly would strongly advocate our boycotting of these conferences, but I think not only are we developing without violence, force, and the generation of hatred, not only are we developing the independence of this country politically, but we are helping the other States in the Commonwealth to develop their independence also; not only are we helping ourselves, but we are helping others.  There is no alternative, <Col N="1645" /> having accepted all the implications of the Treaty, whilst that Treaty does exist, but to make use of the machinery that it provides in order to improve our position and to help others if we can.  When the people of this country alter that and put it aside, and when the war-drums beat for action and we are prepared to tell all and sundry, &ldquo;Every man to his tents, O Israel!&rdquo;  I am prepared to follow that course, but until that is done I think we should use the machinery placed at our disposal, and that is what is being done in this, and that is why I am supporting this amendment.</P>

      <P>I have always sung the little song that Senator O'Farrell has referred to, but it was slightly different from what he states.  I think it is the view of nearly everybody who is Republican that the song should be &ldquo;We will crown devil e'er a King of Ireland.&rdquo;  Republicans say we will never crown anybody King of Ireland. Senator O'Farrell talked about Mr. Lemass and said that Senator O'Doherty and he are not in agreement. He quoted Mr. Lemass as saying that he was neither anti-Treaty nor pro-Treaty and he seems to think that in that there is some contradiction. We are not pro-Treaty.  Mr. Lemass when he says he is not anti-Treaty means that we do not bother about it; it does not matter.  When he says we will make use of the Treaty he simply means that as long as it is in existence we will use it.  That does not mean to say that we are going to stop at it.  The Treaty does not worry us one way or the other.  What does worry us is getting our absolute freedom.  The Senator spoke of our Constitution as being quite legitimate, even though force was used.  He believed that there was hardly anything ever attained without a certain amount of force. Where was there force from outside used to form the English Constitution or the French Constitution?  There is all the difference in the world between the two types of Constitution.  We do not want force from outside.  He also seemed to think that the Parliament of 1922 gave recognition to the Treaty.</P>

      <P>Do you justify yourself for never having changed from being more or less an Imperial Labour man?  Senator Douglas is always very clear and easily followed, but there was one reference of his to Senator O'Doherty the meaning of which I did not quite see.  He did not put the thing very clearly.  He suggested that Senator O'Doherty was perfectly right as a rigid separatist in opposing Imperial Conventions, because they were giving us more and more freedom.  How could a separatist be opposed to these things if they were giving us more freedom?  Of course he added, and it should have been <i>sotto voce</i>, but was not, &ldquo;within the Empire,&rdquo; and that really is the whole crux of the matter. Up to the present this country has never voluntarily acknowledged a direct connection with the British Empire, and these Conferences will put this country in a position in which it never was before.  It is quite possible that the Minister may be quite sincere in his efforts to better the position of this country under the powers of the Treaty and such further powers as we have got at these different Conferences. That would be all right provided he was giving no guarantee that would bind us for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator who introduced this motion asked us not to approach this matter in a Party frame of mind.  We do not approach it in a Party spirit. We approach it just as simple Irishmen. In ordinary international negotiations a normal country can afford to have great confidence in its representatives. The English, for example, have got 1,000 years of tradition behind <Col N="1647" /> them.  Our poor men, no matter how clever they may be individually, have not got that experience.  There is also the fact, particularly in dealings between Ireland and England, that the matter for discussion is our property and there is no room for compromise as far as we are concerned.  The thing is either we have our freedom or we have not, and it is not a matter for compromise or even discussion.</P>
    <P>The British have always been regarded as people who in negotiations get a <i>quid pro quo.</i>  They never give away anything for nothing, and in these little matters they do not mind so much our having the <i>quo</i> provided they get the <i>quid.</i>  They always looked after the material end of a bargain. The unusual thing about these negotiations at the Imperial Conference is that apparently the English are letting us take the <i>quid</i> this time, and they are just wanting to have the <i>quo.</i>  I wonder what is the meaning of the change?  We are told that the connection is a mere ephemeral thing, just a gossamer connection and quite immaterial. It is so immaterial that it is hard to break it, but a spider can slip across the gossamer when the necessity arises, and he can build a nice net of web around those who are too sly to come into his web.</P>
    <P>What is the situation with regard to the King?  The King, by tradition and by the unwritten constitution, is the person who declares war, and the only advice he takes is the advice of his Privy Council.  The Prime Minister of England and the Cabinet Ministers have no executive power whatever until they are made Privy Councillors. It is the King in Council who declares war.  Suppose the King does declare war in the future, what is the position of our Ministers here?  Have they to be consulted?  It can be argued that they are not members of the Privy Council, that they are just on the same footing as the Prime Minister and his Cabinet in England. They have nothing to say to it unless and until they are made Privy Councillors. There is a little legal point that might well be gone into.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> I agree that apparently there is not very much danger in this little connection of the King in normal circumstances, but in the event of war, I maintain that we would be absolutely bound to participate in it.</P>
    <P>At any rate, we would be bound not to oppose the operations of the British in this country.  We would be bound to leave them absolute freedom to come in here and do what they like, and when a state of tension is between them and another country they can come in and remain here.  Who is to define when there is a state of tension? When once they come in, God knows how long they might stay.  There is real danger there.  Once they come in we cannot object to them.  They could say that &ldquo;you agreed, in peaceful conference, to allow the King of this country to be the man who has the right to declare war on your behalf.&rdquo; He is the man who is likely to declare war on your behalf.  As the Americans say, we will not have a kick coming to us.  If the Minister were to secure the ground, going as far as he could within the limits of the Treaty to draw this country farther out from the British Empire, he would be doing a good service, provided always that he is not giving anything in the nature of a guarantee which would tie us up. Up to the present this country can claim, quite legitimately, that we can break the connection because it is only there by force, whereas if these Conferences are to continue and if this Report is accepted, I am afraid we are quite deliberately giving our consent to the King of England, our King through these Conferences.</P>

      <P>The last speaker has raised one or two minor points which may serve as an introduction to a general discussion on both the motion and the amendment.  He queries the point made by Senator Douglas, when he said that he, Senator Douglas, could well imagine Senator O'Doherty, as a separatist, objecting to these Imperial Conferences, because these Imperial Conferences as they go on, indicate how much more <Col N="1649" /> freedom is being gained.  And he asks how can a separatist object to much more freedom being gained.  But I have been up against that distorted viewpoint already.  Last year, Deputy O'Kelly said he agreed that I was making progress at these Conferences, and went on to complain that if I continued to make much more progress of this kind people would get accustomed and used to the situation, and might end by quietly accepting it.  That was the same point of view that Senator Douglas put to Senator O'Doherty&mdash;if we increase our status there may soon be nothing to fight about. Apparently the separatist creed demands a fight.  That, at any rate, was the point of view that was taken by Deputy O'Kelly&mdash;that he thought I was making too much headway, and he was afraid that people might get used to and easily accept the present status. This he objects to, even though that present status was increasing.  Senator Robinson has, I hope, put himself for ever beyond consideration as a likely delegate to conduct negotiations with anybody.  Has there ever been such an example of the slave mind in this country as indicated in the phrase used by him to-day?  In effect, he told us &ldquo;Imagine Irishmen going over to negotiate with Englishmen when they have thousands of years of training behind them, which our poor fellows have not, no matter how clever they are.&rdquo;</P>

The British Empire has been dragged into this debate as if it were the British Empire of 100 years ago.

      <P>They are a very forgiving people if they can tolerate such a Nationalist.  We have the report of the Conference before us, based on the report of the 1929 Conference.  I do not propose to go into the details.  It has been written about at length here and outside this country, and it has been commended for the way it clarifies and regularises the whole commonwealth situation.  There are a couple of things emerging from it that need to be discussed here. One is that in its generality this is as big an act of renunciation as that which was passed at the time when the English grip was loosened upon the American Colonies. It is as clear-cut an act of renunciation as that.  It is objected to for this reason amongst others&mdash;that it is going <Col N="1652" /> to take its place on the British Statute Book.</P>
      <P>[<i>An Cathaoirleach resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
      <P>So did the Act of Renunciation with regard to America.  When that particular point was raised as an objection, as it was raised during the discussion at this Conference, General Hertzog, I think it was he, made this reply: &ldquo;If I am told to baulk at this because of the theory that what one British Parliament can do another can undo, I remind myself of the Renunciation Act of 1779 passed by the British Parliament, and if anybody tells me now that the British Parliament, by the mere exercise of legislative powers, can resume possession of the American Colonies, I am prepared to laugh at that theory.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Renunciation Act that was broken in this country in 1800?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Broken is the word. The only way in which the theory can be reduced to practice is by a breach&mdash; a breach of a solemn undertaking with all the Dominions.  On that the Commonwealth breaks up, for we join in this with the rest of the Commonwealth. One of the reasons why this Statute form was preferred by us to an agreement was that, by knitting us closely with the Dominions in this alliance, it fortifies us all against any action by way of breach on the part of the British Parliament, if that has to be considered a possible danger. We could have made a special agreement of our own.  We have a peculiar position, quite different from the position of the Dominions.  The reports and the minutes of the Imperial Conferences are crammed full with assertions by Irish Ministers from time to time that that is the position, and there is very little in the way of denial of those statements.  We could have made a special agreement if we desired, or accepted the simple scheme of a report not implemented by legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain of the Dominions insisted upon legislation, and well they might, because they had experience such as we had not of the destructive effect of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, and they knew that they must get that off <Col N="1653" /> the Statute Book.  The only way to achieve that was for the Parliament which passed it to take it off.  If we had a special agreement of our own with the British, and if any attempt were made to break it, that would be purely a matter between ourselves and Great Britain.  We joined in this Imperial Conference Report, and we, the Government, will make a request with regard to this Statute, and if there is any attempt to break it hereafter, it will be an attempt not against us alone but against the whole Dominions.  We have the whole force of the growing nationality of the Dominions behind us in our efforts to resist that.</P>
    <P>The passing of this Statute writes no new Constitution for this State. Everything that is there I claim, and have claimed, we possess already, and again I may say the minutes and records of Imperial Conferences are crammed full of that type of assertion.  But as an objection to adopting this Report the argument has been used that in effect this Parliament is asking another Parliament to pass legislation that will be binding upon this Parliament.  What is the situation? We go to an Imperial Conference in 1926 and we assert certain principles there.  We say that we believe that these principles establish the recognised position, the position recognised in fact, if not in law, of Dominions vis à vis one another and vis à vis Great Britain.  We point out certain anomalies in practice.  We get acceptance of the principle, and there is a reference of the anomalies to a committee of experts in order to see how these anomalous things can be removed and the whole structure remodelled in conformity with the principles accepted in 1926.  We were the prime movers in that matter, but we got the backing of most of the Dominions, if not all, in regard to most of what we submitted.</P>
    <P>At the 1930 Conference we said to the British: &ldquo;On your Statute Book there are certain laws once operative in practice in so far as the Dominions are concerned, but never operative in so far as this country is concerned, and it is your job to clear these off your Statute Book.&rdquo;  We asked that this <Col N="1654" /> should be done, but I cannot identify this request to the British to clear up their own Statute Book with the request, raised in objection here, that they should pass laws binding on us. Several of the Dominions were strong for the Statute.  They wanted their own judges coerced, so to speak, because some of their own judges had been brought up under the old system, under the Colonial Laws Validity Act.  They wanted to leave no room for judges so trained to indulge in speculative theories.  If the Colonial Laws Validity Act still remained, no matter what a legal man might think outside his court about that Act being null and void, he would, nevertheless, have to adopt a different attitude in court.</P>
    <P>So we came to the idea of a Statute, a Statute which the British will pass in order to take from their Statute Book certain things which are on it, which are out of conformity with present-day legislation, and altogether inconsistent with relationships that have since developed.  Senators so far have preserved themselves from the traps into which Deputies in the Dáil walked.  Certain Deputies in their zeal for objection brought themselves to this point that, if tendencies here developed and a Republic was declared eventually, the British by taking cognisance of it formally could jeopardise the new position.  For the argument ran, if and when the British recognised by legislation the new situation, then what one British Parliament could do another could undo, and therefore all would be for ever dependent on the whim of a British Parliament and the British electorate.  Those who depend on that argument put it theoretically in the power of any British Parliament, desiring to be cantankerous in the matter, to stop constitutional progress in this country for all time.  On that argument, if the British see a certain situation developing here, they can hoist Republicans with their own petard and, parodoxically, by passing a Statute recognising a certain status, they can by the very act of recognition undermine what they have recognised.  That is the type of argument to which we have had to listen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> May I call attention to the exact phrases in the report with regard to the recommendations?  A great deal has been made about this Parliament making a request to another Parliament. The formula used was changed on my own suggestion in order to meet a point that I felt was bound to be raised.  We enter into a group situation.  Our conditions are different to those in South Africa; South Africa has her circumstances entirely different to New Zealand; Australia differs from Canada.  You have to fit in your own particular circumstances into the general situation.  We found originally a phrase instead of that which is now printed on page 19, paragraph (c).  It previously read &ldquo;that resolutions should be forwarded requesting the enactment...&rdquo;  That is based upon a procedure that is common certainly in Canada and Australia, a procedure known as an humble address.  I pointed out that we had no such procedure here.  I pointed out that our procedure was to put reports before the Parliament as we were bound to do by a pledge given years ago.  We ask for approval of reports in their generality, and conclude the resolution of approval with a request that the Government take steps necessary to carry out the matter approved.  The Government then did whatever was necessary.</P>
    <P>I got the phrase changed in order to meet the situation Senator Johnson has spoken of.  I thought it better that a Parliament should not request. A Parliament of one country does not ordinarily request anything from the Parliament of another country.  But, even there, the historical background cannot be forgotten.  Certain of the Dominion Parliaments used to have the procedure of humble address requesting certain things.  The old phrase fitted quite well into their situations, but it was quite incongruous in ours.  Although we were the only people who had that point of view, that phrase was changed to this: &ldquo;Resolutions passed should be forwarded with a view to enactment by the Parliament.&rdquo;  I want the Parliament simply to express approval of what has happened.  The Parliament just <Col N="1656" /> approves generally what is done and asks us to take certain steps.  We, as usual, will shoulder the burden and take a complete and clear decision as to what ought to be done.  If the House wishes to wash its hands of this Report, to some extent it can do so; but I would ask the House to approve the recommendations, particularly those in Part VI.</P>
    <P>I ask them to approve these recommendations which bring to an end the old chapter of the legislative supremacy of the British Parliament over what used to be called the British Empire.  That old situation has, in fact, disappeared.  The moment this Statute is passed it disappears even in law with the good will of all the Dominions and of everybody included in the association known as the Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing objected to, the so-called implication in a particular part of the Report that a British Parliament has power to legislate for the Dominions.  I made our position abundantly clear on that matter.  Senator Douglas has put his finger right upon two points that were subject to many discussions at the Imperial Conference.  There is first of all the constitutional fact that if the Constitutions of some of the countries are to be changed, certain measures would have to be passed by the British Parliament.  Over and beyond that there was one, but I think only one of the Commonwealth group which said that they could conceive certain circumstances in which they might have to call upon the British Parliament to pass certain legislation for them.  I said we never would do this and I said that constitutionally we could not do it.  I said that until some Government came into power which would uproot the whole Constitution, and which would have the approval of the country behind it, such a thing never could or would happen and that position was accepted.</P>
    <P>A member of another delegation said that for the Dominion which he represented to ask the British Parliament to enact legislation for them would be to demand a national <Col N="1657" /> humiliation and so it would never be done.  Our position is that we accept the phrase which suits the group, because we are going in with the group, but our position as an individual nation was made abundantly clear in the whole record of the proceedings.</P>

      <P>Not a particle.  Remember our position is clear under this.  &ldquo;No Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed after the commencement of this Act shall extend or be deemed to extend to a Dominion as part of the law in force in that Dominion unless it is expressly declared in that Act that that Dominion has requested, and consented to, the enactment thereof.&rdquo; That is as clear as it could be, and there is no analogy whatever with the Canadian Parliament.  It must be expressly declared that we have consented to that by enactment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister misunderstood my point.  The fact that we are to some degree affected by the practice of the Canadian Constitution, taken with the exception that is declared in this report to Canada, may somewhat affect our position.  That is to say that if we ask Britain, which I think is impossible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think I understand the point the Senator is making. The difference of course is that we have the power to change our Constitution on our own, a power which the Canadians have not.  Therefore, the situation is entirely different.  We are not tied up in the phrase which relates to Canada.  Even Article 2 of our Treaty does not bring in anything there.  Our position was expressed in clear cut terms in the 1929 Report, and I think the Senator will agree that it was then clearly expressed <Col N="1658" /> that our position was different.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not in that respect.  Two points of view have been expressed on the Report, one by Senator Johnson and afterwards by Senator O'Farrell, and a different point of view expressed by Senator O'Doherty.  These points of view were as different as they could well be. Before discussing them I want to make clear my position with regard to all these Conferences. I accept what Senator Brown said at the beginning and what was said afterwards by Senator O'Farrell, that the Treaty at election after election has been ratified by the people of this country.  I have, therefore, no mandate from the people to try and break the Treaty.  Never at any time have I gone to Conferences with the idea in my mind to attempt a breach of the Treaty.  But I did go across to Conferences over and over again to make sure that the status we claimed as inherent in the Treaty settlement was definitely shown to be there. I claim to have succeeded in that. But whatever I desired to achieve at those Conferences was limited by this, that there was no question of attempting to break the Treaty.  The Treaty was accepted, but there were certain clauses subject to different interpretations founded upon the point of status which we recognised as a growing thing.  We wanted to see that the full fruit should be got from the Treaty.  Senator Johnson accepts that generally as the position. Senator O'Doherty and others do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson raised a point that I have already dealt with in a general way.  He expressed a hope that the Seanad would have the point of view that this State is bound only by such legislation as is enacted here.  I definitely take that point of view, that no legislation other than the legislation enacted here is binding on this country.  But as to what is now happening I put this analogy before the House because I think it will be present to most people's minds. <Col N="1659" /> I mentioned it earlier this year when I brought forward for ratification a trade treaty with Germany.  Consequent on that treaty I brought forward an amendment to a certain piece of law that was, or could have been presumed to be, upon our Statute Book as part of the old trading-with-the-enemy code.  When the treaty with Germany was being make disturbing deductions as to German Government said to us that even if that particular piece of law was not effective in practice in this country it had however been gripped as law by Article 73 of the Constitution.  They asked that it be taken out lest it might affect them.  They asked to have it removed so that there would then be a clear-cut situation.  They were not bothered about the implication that by repealing it we argued its previous existence, and from its presence on our Statute Book theorists might go on to make disturbing deductions as to whether or not we were one of the Allies fighting against the Central Powers.  They made little of implications&mdash;in their anxiety for practical results they asked to have it taken away and we took it away.</P>
    <P>Was that a request from the German Parliament that we should pass legislation binding them?  It certainly will affect them in the sense that we took away something that previously might have affected them. Can it be described as anything more than that?</P>
    <P>Can what we are discussing now be described as anything more than this: that the British are going to take off their Statute Book, for reasons arising out of a certain Conference, certain bits of legislation which judges might rule to be in operation against certain Dominions?  Some Senators have asked what will be the result if approval be not requested by Governments. The result will be, if this Government fails to join with the other Dominions in asking the British to take off their Statute Book certain legislation which affects certain of the Dominions, that the Statute will not be passed.  I think it is quite certain that it will not be passed.  What, then, will the situation be hereafter?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> So far in certain newspapers we have been represented as the prime movers for the disruption of the Commonwealth, the people who at every point are supposed to be leading towards the disruption of the Commonwealth of Nations.  If we do not join in this request these newspapers will have the dissatisfaction of seeing us paraded before the next Imperial Conference as the folk who prevented the other Dominions from getting something which they ardently desired.  The Parliaments of the other Dominions have debated this and made the necessary request, or are about to forward the required resolutions.  We alone remain, and failure on our part may wreck the scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson was good enough to say that he felt that a good deal of the 1926 Report had gone by the board.  I hope he will agree with the amendment that I would make to his statement, that a great deal of those parts of the Report of the 1923 Conference which he then regarded with suspicion have gone by the board. The parts which he would regard as good have remained and are being fully implemented.</P>
    <P>As regards a very small academic point concerning the negotiation of Treaties, the Senator was good enough to confess that when the 1926 Report was discussed previously he had his doubts&mdash;he felt that there was somewhere about it an atmosphere of British Empire policy in regard to Treaties. As a result of the changes since made, he says that he sees now that the suspicions he had at that time were unfounded.  In connection with either the 1926 or 1929 Report I want any Senator to point out where suspicions he may have held with regard to them have proved to be founded.  I do not at all disagree with the idea that when conventions and reports of conferences come before the House that members should be extremely vigilant in looking into them to see that nothing harmful or retrograding gets through but they might learn a little from the past.  I would expect this, that having given rein to their suspicions, and finding later that nothing had happened, they might at any rate confess, &ldquo;Our <Col N="1661" /> suspicions have proved to be unfounded, and we have more confidence in the people working on our behalf.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to a view held with regard to the status achieved under the Treaty, that the Treaty merely stereotyped the Canadian position as it stood at a particular moment.  That may be an interesting legal view, but it is a view that is of no interest to this country until people attempt to assert it and work through it against this country.  At that moment those people will realise that is not the Treaty that we passed.  A Treaty containing that limited status would never be passed in this country. We can leave that until we find that it is seriously held.</P>
    <P>The Senator has referred to other points in the Report&mdash;Defence, Singapore, Whaling, and the Antarctic.  I ask Senators not to bother about these things.  I am concentrating on Part Six, and I am asking the Seanad not to bring anything into the discussion that is not in that Part of the Report, For the rest, I ask them to read the Report carefully and to see where any recommendation is made which affects this country, and to say whether they agree or disagree with it.  Then let them find out what effect can be given to any of these recommendations without legislation.  If legislation is required they have the guardianship since nothing can be done until legislation is introduced, and on that they have the whole control.  Small points can be discussed as each piece of legislation comes before the House.  The main item that does arise in this discussion is Part Six, because that does not depend on our legislation, though on certain matters referred to in Part Six legislation of ours still to be passed will have a connection.  We would have to pass these in any event, and the inter-action of this Report on such pieces of legislation can be discussed when they are introduced.</P>
    <P>In connection with the discipline of armed forces, a point as to the meaning of consent has been raised.  May I in reply refer to the Report where it deals with this matter.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is assumed that all Governments will desire to take such action as <Col N="1662" /> may be necessary to secure (1) that the military discipline of any of the armed forces of the Commonwealth when present, by consent, within territory of another, rests upon a statutory basis, and (2) that there shall be no period of time during which the legal basis of military discipline could on any ground be impeached.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But it adds&mdash;and this should be stressed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The method by which the above two objects can best be attained must necessarily be a matter for the Governments themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senators who want to argue about what consent means will have their opportunity when legislation to give statutory effect to that particular recommendation comes along.  You are binding yourself to nothing by passing this motion except this, but you are accepting this: that if, with our consent, any forces of a part of the Commonwealth come here, they shall be governed by their own code of military discipline while here with our consent.  If we send a horse-jumping team to Olympia, so far as the members of it misconduct themselves in any way, they shall be governed by their own military code and not by the ordinary civil code of England.  That is the principle, and when it comes to be given statutory effect we will be able to discuss the incidentals.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson told us&mdash;and he was fortified by Senator O'Farrell&mdash;what their attitude on the whole Treaty position was.  I do not want to refer to what he said with regard to the past, because I think the Senator made that clear on more than one occasion.  He said that the idea of his Party was that the Treaty was accepted and should be kept until such time as either social, national, or economic growth required a change.  Can anybody say that that is limiting the march of this nation? Can anybody say that I as a member of the Government, or any other member of the Government, have by this Report set a limit to the march of this nation?  Let us hear the Opposition point of view <Col N="1663" /> as expressed by Senator O'Doherty. He felt that Senator Johnson's speech was ludicrous, because in its fundamentals it was very different from the Senator's.  He said it was laughable to hear Senator Johnson's point of view.  Then he brought us to the heart of things.  According to Senator O'Doherty, the Parliament of this country owes its existence to a British Statute because, according to him, there were Articles of Agreement implemented by a British Act of Parliament. So it is to a British Act that the Senator owes his position as a Senator.  Do all the members of the Senator's Party sit here because their positions are assured to them by a British Act of Parliament? Do they not think they are founded upon the expression of some part of the will of the people of this country?  Does their position depend entirely on the fact that there were Articles of Agreement, and that that Treaty was implemented only by a British Act of Parliament?  Do they take up the position that was taken up in the other House by members of that Party, that the true Government of this country lies outside of the Oireachtas, or what is the position? Senator O'Doherty is aghast that this &ldquo;sovereign&rdquo; Parliament invites another Parliament to make laws for it.  Not in this Report.  It invites another sovereign Parliament to take certain things off its Statute Book.  It invites it to pass no legislation for this country, and never did.  Merely putting this Report before the House, according to the Senator, indicates that the British Parliament in London is supreme in the British Empire.  If that Report can be read with any understanding by the Seanad, Senators will see that whatever might have been the position in the past, it indicates that for the future the whole idea of supremacy throughout the Empire has disappeared, and this marks the end of that epoch.  So far is the bringing of the Report of that Conference before this Parliament from arguing any subserviency to the British Parliament, that it absolutely demonstrates how completely any element of subserviency has disappeared.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1664" /> If we pass the motion the Senator is afraid that there is going to be a rigid Constitution.  He wonders are we going to be tied up with regard to matters of common concern, defence and a common judiciary? Senator Connolly let his imagination roam, and saw quotas for the Navy, quotas for the Army, and quotas of imports and exports.  I cannot attend to that sort of calculation unless I am directed to some paragraph in the Report from which it is demonstrable that this rigidity and these quotas are emerging.  Then I will deal with it.  You cannot minister to a mind diseased, and the mind diseased with bogies is the one least of all subject to any sort of cure.  Where is there anything that any of these diseased minds can lean on in the Report, to show quotas for the Navy, quotas for the Army, quotas with regard to imports or exports or a common judiciary?  They are not there, and it is only imagination that conjures them in there.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Doherty dealt with the King in relation to this country. Senator Johnson more accurately described the position of the King in this country.  &ldquo;A legislative shadow.&rdquo; One does not like using that phrase, because it will be written up as if there was a tinge of contempt in it. I do not want any contempt or slight to be read into my phrase.  I am speaking accurately of the relationship of the King to Irish affairs.  It is such that he cannot act except on the advice of Irish Ministers, and Irish Ministers cannot advise him, except on Irish affairs.  That is as clear cut as a thing can be.  If Senators like to put the phrase &ldquo;cypher&rdquo; or &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; upon that situation they can.  It is the constitutional situation.  Senator O'Doherty asked &ldquo;Why send men to their death for cyphers?&rdquo;  As between the King in that position, and the President of a Republic in exactly the same position, there is no reason why one single drop of blood should be shed.</P>
    <P>Two developments happened this year.  I call them of minor importance, but to the constitutional lawyer they indicate a certain tendency and how far that tendency goes.  In the course <Col N="1665" /> of our various discussions and examinations of the relationship between this country and Great Britain we came on several small anomalies. One of these was raised by some text book, where it was argued that because a document was sealed in a particular way, it could be said to be sealed under the authority of a British Secretary of State.  We thought it better to attack that situation. The argument ran this way: The seal is in the possession of a particular Secretary of State, and can only be released on a warrant issued in a particular way.  It could, therefore, be said that, as long as a British Secretary of State controls the stamping of certain documents, say in Treaty making, in that way a British Minister controls whether you make a Treaty or not.</P>
    <P>We know, for we had it asserted to us that there was no control in that. The seals, we know, would be released as often as required.  We thought however that as a permanent situation it was not good and we urged that we should have seals of our own, kept under our own control, and issued for the stamping of documents when we said they should be issued.  That proposition was accepted, and the seals will come into being one of these days.</P>
    <P>There was a second point raised, that because, when certain matters had to be communicated to the King, the old channel of the Dominion Office was used, it could be said the channel of communication was capable of being blocked and that a Dominion Secretary, carrying to the King the advice of an Irish Ministry, might change and distort it.  Although we knew that such a fear was fantastic and the danger most remote we claimed the right of direct access and advice, and that was granted.  All these are small things in themselves, but important from the angle of constitutional development.  Digging into history will throw up certain anomalous things from time to time. These were not of sufficient importance to raise them as extreme matters in any extreme way at an Imperial Conference, but when they <Col N="1666" /> were raised they were met at once, and have helped to establish the clearest situation with regard to the King and his attitude towards Irish affairs.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell when stating his attitude to the Treaty asked what the alternative was.  I asked that question last week of the leaders of Fianna Fáil.  I pointed out that three speeches, full of as much vehemence as Senator O'Doherty had in his to-day, had been delivered, and that, in two of them, there had been a swerving away from the use of the word &ldquo;republic,&rdquo; and that when the third speaker used it he used it in the phrase, &ldquo;The republic that was to be established ultimately if people can do it.&rdquo;  I asked what was the present attitude of that Party in respect to the republic which, we used to be told, was to be declared at once when certain people were empowered by the people of the country to act as a Government.  I pointed out that we had been told over and over again that there were certain marks of the non-existence of the republic, and that we could segregate, from speeches of the Fianna Fáil people, five items as marks of the non-existence of the republic: the oath, the King, the Governor-General, the Six-County situation, and the fact of certain troops being in certain parts of the country.  I asked if any of these was going to be advanced upon if and when the Fianna Fáil Party was empowered to form a Government, and I could get no answer.  I am wondering if I can get an answer here.  What is their policy?</P>

Senator Johnson said he will move forward, say, when national, social or economic growth requires it.  Economics do play a little part in this whole situation.  The Republic is to be declared as, and when certain people can do it ultimately.  But in the meantime, supposing the Fianna Fáil Party is empowered to act, what is going to happen to the people brought up to believe that they would act at once? What about the secret army?

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to read two paragraphs of a statement I have here:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The continued existence of the Free State Government will depend largely on the ability of the Free State leaders to improve the economic condition of the country, and to restore stability and security to its industrial life.  They cannot do this with any degree of success while there remains in the country an armed force not under their control, and hostile to their State, implying <Col N="1671" /> by its very existence a threat of armed action against them at any favourable moment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was written by Deputy Lemass when he was Minister for Defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>When?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was written by Deputy Lemass to his Cabinet when he was posing as Minister for Defence. What is the thought in it?  You can never have economic progress in this country as long as there is a secret army on the flank.  We are, we are told, to have the Fianna Fáil Party in power to form a Government, and Deputy Lemass has now the idea of a tariff a day to keep the republic away.  Will his tariffs bring economic stability to the country if there is a secret army on his flank? What will he do about the secret army? Is it to be allowed to drill and manoeurve? Is it to be put down?</P>

      <P>It can, if desired, be published to-night.  We have got to face up to this situation of the Imperial Conference Report accepted even in the spirit in which Senator Johnson accepted it and the position taken to-day by that Party who have no policy as to what they are going to do as an alternative, who have no answer as to what they are going to do with the forces they have brought into the country on a false pretence&mdash;the pretence that there is going to be established a republic when these people are empowered to do anything.  There is a situation there and they have to meet that situation.  The situation is growing worse every day, as the murders in Tipperary show, and the people who say the true Government of the country lies outside this Oireachtas have to bear responsibility for that situation; and the person in particular who at Thurles long ago made his notorious statement about the murder of an Irish Minister&mdash;you can call it either a forecast as he tried to call it or a hint&mdash;but that having been fulfilled, the author of that phrase may find himself some day facing the men whom it inspired to action.  He must at any rate make up his mind before he goes to an election as between progress through Imperial Conferences with a position in the British Commonwealth of Nations, and a hybrid, noneffective republic and, such as it may be, a republic not any longer to be established or declared straight away, but only ultimately and as and when these so-called republicans can do it.</P>

      <P>May I make a personal statement?  The Minister made the statement in which he referred to the head of the South African Government and what he said to the Minister <Col N="1673" /> about me, when he met him, I presume, at the Imperial Conference.  To start with, that is an extremely improper statement to make here in public, because it brings into this House the statement of a Prime Minister of a Dominion.</P>

Now he comes up and makes a statement here which is absolutely wrong.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of procedure and precedent, I protest against this motion.  The Standing Order is clear, that the Report Stage of a Bill shall be taken on a day subsequent to that on which the Committee Stage is taken.  I think this is a dangerous practice to begin, if this is the beginning&mdash;that we should suspend a Standing Order which was inserted for the deliberate and definite purpose of safeguarding the interests of members in considering Bills of this nature.  If it is to be possible to suspend a Standing Order, without considerable notice, in what may be a small House, it will be a dangerous procedure.  There is, I think, no urgency about this Bill.  Even if there was urgency, I think it would be unwise to adopt this procedure. This Bill can be dealt with to-morrow, if we meet to-morrow.  In any event, it can be dealt with on the first day of our meeting next week.  Unless the Senator has some urgent reasons to adduce, I would ask him not to press this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to support Senator Johnson in his protest and for the reasons stated by him.  We have had, on frequent occasions, imposed upon us in the Seanad, resolutions of the character now proposed by Senator O'Hanlon.  We have protested against these resolutions again and again. Notwithstanding our protests, these resolutions come forward.  In addition to the reasons stated by Senator Johnson, I would urge on the Seanad this further reason&mdash;that there is no urgent necessity for this Bill.  It is a Bill simply to forgive a certain number of loans which are irrecoverable and to preserve the rights as against the sureties.  It can be passed as well this day month as to-day.  As a general principle, I am against rushing Bills through the Seanad, because sometimes in the interval between one stage and another a Senator discovers a mistake in a Bill and it is remedied.  I <Col N="1676" /> suppose our chief function is that of a revising Chamber.  We should be given the opportunity to exercise that function. If Bills are rushed through without any reason whatever, we are treated with a certain amount of disrespect, and we are prevented from exercising the function which we are here to discharge.</P>

We protested repeatedly, and finally that Standing Order was drafted with the very object of preventing Bills being rushed through in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Vincent</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the debate on this Bill with great interest, and to the shafts that have been thrown at the Minister from every side.  So far I do not think there has been anything said on his behalf. I hold no brief for him, but this is a national undertaking, and everybody on this subject has got to think straightly and clearly.  Senator Johnson again, by suggesting that the inference of the Minister probably had a bad effect, seemed to think that the interference was unjustified. He ended up by saying that the body forming the Board were representatives of the Minister appointed by him, and that therefore he was responsible.  Senator Sir John Keane suggested&mdash;in fact he almost passionately regretted&mdash;that the Minister had not found money which the Minister did not possess, or which his conscience told him he could not devote to that purpose.  There were various other suggestions, like Senator Connolly's that an impartial Committee should be appointed now to do the work, or rather to superintend the work that the auditors are doing at present.  There is no other work for them to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole Shannon scheme is of the utmost importance to this country.  I do not know whether Senators here realise that it is a scheme which is being watched with the greatest attention by the big public utility corporations all over the world, because all over the world there is a fight between nationally-owned things and ones that are privately-owned&mdash;that is, public corporations.  I do not say that this scheme is bigger than some municipally and State-owned undertakings in other countries, but from its initiation it is the biggest effort I know of by a nation to exploit national resources within the country.  It is being watched very closely by what I might call the opposition corporations of the world, and any failure on its part is going to be quoted very freely in the campaigns that undoubtedly go on in these communities that are served by public corporations. <Col N="1678" /> So it is of importance not alone to this country.  Personally, I have been connected most of my time with what you might call opposing corporations.  I am entirely in favour of this effort.  I am all for it.  Within, certainly, the next year, or as soon as finances get a little settled down, there is going to be a very big fight in other parts of the world on this question of municipal or State ownership.  That is a side issue, but a great deal of this is going to arise out of the question of holding companies, and so on.  However, I want to point out that this is a very important thing.  It is not a small thing for the credit of this country.  It is not a small thing from the point of view of the taxpayer, and it cannot be looked at in a small way.</P>
    <P>I am going to take the history of the thing as it is without making any suggestions as to what I personally think should have been done or should not have been done.  This is not the time for it.  I take this question starting when the Board was put into operation, and I take only the facts that concern it.  It is no good talking about what might happen if somebody were able to say something. We have got to consider the facts before us.  The facts are that a Board was set up with the goodwill of this whole country to do a certain thing. Without question, the initiation of the Shannon scheme has been a success. Difficulties have been overcome.  As far as the construction of that scheme went it had been entirely successful, and I will go further and say at a reasonable cost.  This country then, with the goodwill of all parties&mdash;after all, this is our scheme; it is not a Party scheme; it is a national scheme &mdash;wanted to see it go successfully.  As the Minister said, it was thought best that this Board should be as far removed from political or day-to-day interference as was possible.</P>
    <P>I am not saying anything about that. I am simply stating the fact that the Act did give this power of dismissal to the Minister.  Putting the splitting of hairs aside, if a man has the power of dismissal he has the power of inquiry, because he cannot dismiss unless he is satisfied in his own mind that there is <Col N="1679" /> ground for dismissal.  I think that was a wise provision.  I am not saying anything about the formation of the Board.  The Minister says that very early he began to consider his position as regards the Board, and I do not blame him.  As a matter of fact, possibly he might not have got to that pitch of being really anxious if it had not been for a fortuitous incident in connection with his side of the work. He was employed by the Shannon Board to complete some work which naturally brought him into much closer touch with the organisation than he otherwise might have had the temerity to insist upon.</P>
    <P>Looking at the whole history of this thing, I might say here and now that I think the Minister has behaved with the most extraordinary self-restraint and level-headedness throughout these proceedings.  It is frightfully easy, when there is a thing that you fear greatly, to lose your head.  Senator Comyn has said that in 1929, when this agreement was made, the Minister should have come to the Dáil.  If at that immature stage he had come to the representatives of this country and suggested anything, he would have been met with derision and with the cry of panic legislation.  He represented the Government, who wanted this thing to be independent as far as it was humanly possible.  He went to the greatest length in securing their independence.  As regards that agreement, the only thing I want to say about it is that there was a difference between the Minister and the Shannon Board as to the reading of an Act, and the Minister quite frankly said to them: &ldquo;If you do not agree with my reading of it I will bring in an amending Bill.&rdquo;  They said: &ldquo;We will agree with you.&rdquo;  That is the fact.  They agreed to his reading of the Act, and by that agreement they were bound to his reading of it.  I am not going to say now whether I think it is the right reading of it or not, but I am perfectly certain that if he came in 1929 to either of the Houses and said that beyond the sum of £2,500,000 there was an unknown quantity which they were going to be liable for, he would not get a blank cheque.  The thing is <Col N="1680" /> impossible.  Time went on and the Minister demanded what he was entitled to demand.  Not only was he entitled to demand it, but if he acted up to the letter of the law he would have said in what form those accounts were to come.  Section 7 clearly lays it down.  The intention clearly was that the accounts of this concern were to be absolutely at the disposal of the representatives of the Government.  I think it would have been crazy legislation if anything else had been suggested. A Board was set up.  There is a lot to be said about the constitution of that Board, but that is not the question here.  The country had to keep control of the accounts, and I think, so far from the Minister having unduly interfered, he showed the greatest patience.</P>
    <P>I will say that these resignations should not have been accepted until these men who were responsible for the governing of this Board had furnished, as they were bound under the Act to do, a report showing exactly how they dealt with public money which had been entrusted to them.  You have got the position now that the men responsible have got no onus on them to produce that report that you and the Dáil and the people of this country might consider.  Why did they not produce it?  You have only got to look at the history of these two years.  They could not possibly produce it!  The Minister is going to produce it somewhere about next Easter.  It is all nonsense to say, as they have said, that they could not have produced the report in time.</P>
    <P>There has been a publication in the Press by one of the gentlemen concerned. Let me tell you my experience of this sort of scheme: there is not a construction work that ever succeeded in the world, there is not a public utility that exists in the world that could exist unless it were backed by State money under conditions under which this Shannon scheme existed for two years.  I have some knowledge of public utilities, because I am engaged in a number of them.  There is not a public utility in the world, whether nationally or municipally owned, whether publicly owned or privately owned, that could not say to its board <Col N="1681" /> of directors at the end of every month &mdash;say, on the first Monday of every month&mdash;what the expenses and outgoings for the month before were.  It would be inconceivable otherwise. Every such public utility would insist on its management producing these figures at the end of the month.  Otherwise it could not carry on.</P>
    <P>Here we are in the position that we have no accounts for a period of two years.  There are seventeen auditors working at the present moment reconstructing those accounts. We have the admission of the man who was at the head of this thing in which he says: &ldquo;The accounts for the year ending March, 1930, were completed about June last and are at present under audit; that is, they were produced fifteen months after the close of the year, and any man who has experience of the initiation of such a huge concern as the Electricity Supply Board cannot agree that this fact is anything very alarming.  I agree that if the accountancy department had been under the guidance of an accountant with wide experience in the electrical industry matters might have gone better and quicker; but, rightly or wrongly, it was decided that a well-qualified Irish accountant of ordinary business experience would meet our needs, and the salary offered did not in fact attract any applicant with a previous specialised knowledge of the industry.&rdquo;  When a man at the head of a ten million corporation writes a thing like that, there is no comment necessary. If you are dealing with money in large or small sums there is one picture that you and everybody concerned must have before you.  That is, the picture of the accounts of that particular concern must be seen month by month.  Anybody who is accustomed to dealing with public utilities of this magnitude knows that.  No such public utility could carry on unless they had this data before them.</P>
    <P>It is idle for a man to say that he was overwhelmed on the production side, overwhelmed with the fine frenzy of production.  That is not what he is there for.  It is idle for a man to say that he has not got an amount of money sufficient to get the brains <Col N="1682" /> necessary.  That is a perfectly nonsensical statement in a scheme like this, a big national scheme.  The accountant on that scheme should be a big man.  What is more, there is no engineer in the world who should be in charge of a scheme like that.  It is a man on the financial side that is always put at the head of such a scheme&mdash;the man who has got control of the experts.  The expert has always got to be controlled, because he has to cut his cloth according to his measure.  A very curious thing is that they agreed to cut their cloth according to the £2,500,000.  I am not saying that £2,500,000 was sufficient for the proper development of the Shannon scheme to its ultimate end.  It was sufficient for the time being.  It is a large sum in any country to be given for development.  If I have got the facts right they agreed that they would cut their cloth; in April they were written to, and they wrote back to say that they were well within the sum.  In June they wrote to say that they could not do with the sum, and in July they wrote to say that they had over-stepped it.  I do not think that there is any comment necessary on that.</P>
    <P>This is a public concern, and very full power was given to these men.  The publicity about the accounting was for the purpose of counteracting the lack of control. There is no question about that.  Yet they have gone out of office without giving that report.  That is the only stick I throw at the Minister&mdash;that he did accept the resignations of these men before they had given him a report on the data that they themselves had at the moment.  If they were not able to give a report on those data to satisfy the Oireachtas and the country, then people would form their own opinion.  I do not think the Minister could have done anything other than he has done.  As regards the retention on the Board of what one might call the business men, I must say that I am glad that the Minister has retained them.  I do not know that these men realised while on the Board the possibilities that were before them, or the responsibilities that were upon them. <Col N="1683" /> I have been on public utility concerns and I have the greatest respect for the ordinary straight, honest business men that run those Boards. They are always an asset, especially in restraining the exuberance of the experts.  I am very glad that beyond question these men are of that character.  And I am very glad that the Minister has retained them, because they are the only liaison he has with the Board.  The whole thing will have to be reconstituted and gone into thoroughly, if this scheme is going to be made a success.  I do not want to strike anything but a note of optimism in connection with the Shannon scheme.  I think it is a wonderful experiment and I am for it in every way.</P>
    <P>At the present moment I do not think we can do otherwise than give power to the Government to carry on until we know exactly where we are. I do not think that the sum they ask for is excessive.  Their position must be made safe until the Easter of next year.  At the moment they have not the facts before them.  We must have the facts placed before us, too; we must investigate them closely, and the Board must be reconstituted on a totally different basis.  This little storm does not affect the Shannon scheme.  That is a sound proposition as I see it.  It is a great experiment, and I hope it will be successful.  If it is, it will have repercussions all over the world.  We must consider seriously the best method of reconstituting the Board.  I am not sure that this country, in spite of its pride in its own people, will not have to go outside for one or two of the most important executive officers.</P>
    <P>In this country at the present time nobody has had an opportunity of being trained in the business of a big utility company such as this.  If you go through the lanes and by-ways of Ireland you will see any amount of men who are potential managers of huge companies.  It is clearly proved on the other side of the water that Irishmen can hold prominent positions in connection with the biggest undertakings. Most of the executive officers of the big utility companies across the <Col N="1684" /> water are from this country, but of course they had to be trained.  We must regard the Shannon scheme not alone as a great national undertaking, but as a method of training quite a lot of our young people to be efficient in certain directions.</P>
    <P>I say that we must give the Minister the money he requires.  Right from the start he has had an appreciation of the difficulties of this situation.  He has a clarity of vision that I regard as marvellous. It is absolutely necessary that he should be granted the money he requires.  At the same time we want, as soon as it can be given us, a very clear statement as to what has been done, what is being done, and what is going to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephODoherty" hpid="Mr. O'Doherty Mr. O'Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the speech delivered by the Minister yesterday in connection with this scheme.  I could not help comparing that speech with another speech delivered by him in this House in July, 1929.  On that occasion, following the Minister's speech, several members of the Seanad met and we all agreed that the statement was one which gave great hope for the success of the Shannon scheme.  Yesterday the sum total of the Minister's remarks was that he could not be optimistic, would not be pessimistic, but would rather, to use a hackneyed expression, wait and see. Yesterday his remarks were confined to indicting the Board that was placed in charge of the electricity supply.  His indictment commenced practically with the first transaction that the Board had with the Executive Council.  He alleged that they requisitioned their first moneys under a wrong sub-section of the original Act.  The insinuation was that they had not sufficient brains to do that simple transaction correctly. He went through the whole period from the selection of the Board and their institution until the time when he accepted their resignations and it was one continued indictment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that the Minister agreed he could not shirk responsibility to a certain extent in connection with the Board's affairs.  It would be very unwise for us to assume the right to whitewash the Minister for the responsibility which he must share for the <Col N="1685" /> delinquencies of the Board.  If the allegations made by the Minister are correct, he himself stands indicted by his own remarks.  I do not accept that indictment.  In connection with that I would like to correct what I believe to be a misinterpretation of what Senator Connolly suggested yesterday in connection with a joint committee of the Dáil and Seanad.  I believe that Senator Connolly suggested the establishment of such a committee, which would exercise judicial functions, merely to ascertain the facts of the situation in so far as they could be ascertained from those members of the Board who have been indicted by the Minister and to give them an opportunity of replying to the Minister's charges.</P>
    <P>I believe that Senator Johnson accepted that suggestion.  Two speakers followed Senator Connolly.  One was Senator Sir John Keane.  To-day we had Senator Vincent, and both Senators suggested that Senator Connolly desired to set up a joint committee to manage the Electricity Supply Board.  Senator Vincent took up somewhat the same attitude to-day. He was very anxious to ascertain the facts of the situation.  In my opinion, the facts of the situation cannot be ascertained in any way other than by the way suggested by Senator Connolly&mdash;the setting up of a joint committee to act in a judicial capacity as between the Board on the one hand and the Minister on the other.  When Senator Vincent proceeded to demonstrate his anxiety for facts he more or less assumed that the indictment was just.  I do not think there is any justification for that attitude whatsoever.</P>
    <P>It is alleged that there were no accounts presented.  In my opinion, the non-submission of accounts in connection with a scheme on which such huge sums of money were expended was a matter that should have been reported to the highest authority in the land, namely, the Oireachtas.  Not only were we not notified that such accounts were not in being, but now we are informed that the invoices from which they could be formulated have at this stage been lost.  From the <Col N="1686" /> statement made by the Minister, the position is a very serious one.  If the allegation made is correct, it is questionable if a true valuation of the accounts can now be arrived at.  This is a question not merely of the justification of the Board or of the Minister, or a question even of the prestige or consolidation of the credit of the country as far as the Electricity Supply Board goes.  Those questions are undoubtedly involved by the manner in which it is proposed to meet the situation&mdash;that is by the provisions embodied in the Bill the Minister has brought before the House.  I believe the principle adopted was a bad one&mdash; that was to set up an independent Board to be, to use the Minister's expression, flung as far as possible from governmental control and from the day-to-day criticism of the Oireachtas. I believe the present state of the Electricity Supply Board proves that to be a bad principle.  I am going to suggest that we need to be very wary about other babies of the present Executive for the same reasons.  I refer now to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and to the Fisheries Board.</P>

      <P>At any rate, I will pass from that.  I am convinced that when national undertakings of this magnitude are set up that the Executive, in view of the experience they have had of the Shannon Board, should keep the closest possible control on the expenditure of public moneys until such time as they are satisfied that that control can be handed over to an independent body. I am of opinion that the Minister should get certain moneys to take the <Col N="1687" /> Electricity Supply Board out of the present hole.  I think the Minister should give the House more details than he has given as to what it is proposed to do with the £2,000,000 asked for.  As well as I recollect, he has already accounted for £850,000.  As it was wrong to give a blank cheque in the first instance, I think, in view of the circumstances that have arisen, it would be a very serious thing indeed to give a blank cheque now.  I certainly would like to get an explanation as to what it is proposed to do with the balance of the money.  I would like to know what constructional work will be undertaken, and to have details in regard to it.  I think we should have all that information before we are asked to come to a decision on this.</P>
      <P>The Minister has certain information in his possession.  He states that for national reasons that information will not be divulged at present, but I hold strongly to the view that all that information should be placed at the disposal of the Select Committee, which Senator Connolly has suggested should be set up, at the earliest possible moment.  The Oireachtas should not be asked to take a decision until all that information has been placed at its disposal, as well as any submission of evidence which the outgoing Board may desire to offer.  We all want to see the Shannon scheme a success, the success that in the initial stages was prophesied for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. Barrington Mr. Barrington">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrington</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say a few words in connection with this Bill. I do not propose to detain the House very long.  From the beginning I have been a consistent supporter of the Shannon scheme.  I have been an equally consistent critic of the methods by which it was proposed to carry out the work.  Those methods departed from the well-defined lines which experience had suggested were the best.  I think that our criticisms have been justified by what has since occurred, and that in all probability, if those well-defined lines had not been departed from, the introduction of the present Bill might have been avoided. Be that as it may, we were not <Col N="1688" /> listened to.  The fire and energy of youth carried the scheme through.  The State has got, within a record time, an electrical installation of which any nation might be proud.  I know it intimately.  I come from that district. I have seen the scheme through its various periods of construction, and it is as I have just described it&mdash;a project of which any nation might be proud.  At the same time, the prosperity of this State and its reputation are inextricably involved in the success of the scheme, and I believe that the future prosperity of the country largely depends upon it.</P>
      <P>I, therefore, deprecate in the strongest manner the proposal made that a Parliamentary Committee should be set up to inquire into this question.  If it is to deal with it, it will naturally be composed of members of different parties, and possibly political considerations might interfere with a correct decision.  In any case the Minister, who has been responsible from the beginning, shows no desire to shirk his responsibilities, and I think the only way out of the difficulty is to give him the money he asks for to enable the work to be carried on.  At the same time I would like to make a suggestion.  During the Minister's speech the other day I think I took him down correctly as saying that he intended and instructed the Electricity Supply Board to provide a sinking fund which would repay the entire money involved in the Shannon scheme&mdash;I suppose we might take it that it amounts to ten or eleven millions&mdash;in forty years.  I would suggest to the Seanad, and to the Minister, that that is placing a wholly unnecessary burden upon the consumers of electricity. In forty years time we will be all dead, buried, and forgotten and it would simply mean that this ten or eleven million would be placed at the disposal of some future Minister for Finance, who might dispose of it, perhaps, unwisely for the benefit of our grandchildren.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is idle to suppose that any machinery will last for forty years. We all know that machinery will not last for anything like that time, but <Col N="1689" /> will have to be renewed.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be much wiser to provide sufficient money to maintain the machinery at its full efficiency&mdash;if possible to better it&mdash;and at the end of the forty years the country will be possessed not of an installation which is worth ten or eleven millions, but one which if properly worked, would be worth perhaps three or four times that amount.  The only amount with which the scheme ought to be saddled would be the amount necessary to maintain it at the highest degree of efficiency.  The idea which underlay this whole proposition was that industries might be established, and these industries, no doubt, during their infant years, would require assistance in the shape of cheap power.  If such a heavy charge is imposed upon them, in order to repay the entire capital involved, as well as to maintain the efficiency of the undertaking, I think the House would be putting a charge upon such industries that would be too great for them to bear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House asks it to make provision for two million pounds to be placed to the credit of the Electricity Supply Board under certain conditions.  In the Principal Act money was placed in the hands of the Minister for Finance to be paid on demand to the Electricity Supply Board.  I think I am right in saying that there are already over eight million pounds belonging to the people of this State sunk in the electricity undertaking.  There is a new departure in this Bill with regard to the two million pounds.  The Minister is coming into the Bill as a safeguard, so that the money to be voted by the Oireachtas can only be paid to the Board by the Minister for Finance, on the certificate of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  When we realise the departure that has been made we must consider the causes that have led up to it.  I do not intend to go into all the matters that have been mentioned, but my mind goes back to 1925 when the Principal Act was before the House.  I think I can claim that I was one of the supporters of the scheme.  I supported it because I believed that <Col N="1690" /> such an essential service as electricity should be owned and controlled by the State.  During the progress of the Bill through the House we had all kinds of warnings and complaints from what I might term the business interests.  I was getting tired listening to all I heard about Government interference in business, and warnings that the less Government interference the better for business.  Apparently, the Minister and the Executive Council were carried away with these shibboleths that came from the business and the financial interests. Consequently the Minister put into the Bill certain ideas that constituted this Board almost entirely free of Government interference.  The result has not been a very happy one for the handling of this wonderful national undertaking, of which we are all proud. Anything that we may say or do ought to be done in order to make this great undertaking the success that it can be made.</P>
      <P>As far as my information goes, it has been a wonderful success from the engineering point of view.  The scheme has produced a great quantity of electrical current in a very short space of time, so that from the engineering standpoint it has accomplished everything that was claimed for it, and even more than that.  But the point of view of the man in the street is that while the engineering side of the undertaking has been a huge success it has been hopelessly bungled on the commercial side.  The man in the street is satisfied that there has been bungling on the commercial side, although there was no Government interference.  The undertaking was left in the hands of the expert business people, and the result is that the Minister has to come before Parliament to ask for an additional grant of two millions to save it from the bungling, I might say, of the business people.  I have no doubt that the scheme can be made a success, but if it is necessary that this money should be voted we have no alternative but to vote it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a slight experience of a similar undertaking that was run, not by the State, but by a municipality.  I heard all kinds of discreditable and ugly things said about the old Dublin <Col N="1691" /> Corporation.  I heard certain members of this House say awful things about the people who composed the Dublin Corporation.  I was associated with the Dublin Corporation for a number of years.  More than twenty-five years ago the Corporation had the foresight to see that it was essential that the municipality should set up a municipal enterprise for the purpose of providing a supply of electric current, and a considerable sum belonging to the ratepayers of the city was put into that undertaking.</P>
    <P>I am proud to say that it was made a great success.  It did not cost the ratepayers of Dublin a single penny. The electricity undertaking in Dublin has been admitted by everybody to have been a great success.  It was not handed over to the business community with all the great brains.  What was done was this: One man who was an expert was put in charge of the engineering side of it, and another man, a good accountant, was put in charge of the commercial end of it, with the result that it was made a success.  The extraordinary thing about this national undertaking has been that from the commencement the people in control had not the foresight to appoint a competent accountant to take charge of the accountancy end of the business.  If they did that, I am satisfied that we would not have the story that has been told to us about the accounts being so much in arrear.  As far as the story goes, the people in control could not afford to pay a decent accountant to take charge of the accountancy end of it.  I heard another story in connection with the matter.  It is just as well to have it all out.  When the Dublin electricity undertaking was taken over by the Electricity Supply Board they took over a staff in charge of the commercial end of it that had twenty-five years' experience; a staff that did its work well, and that knew how to do its work.  You could imagine what business people would do if they took over that staff <i>en bloc.</i> They would use it as the nucleus for spreading out the commercial end of <Col N="1692" /> it.  But this competent staff, which was in charge of the commercial end of the Dublin undertaking was split up and scattered in different Departments. I would not expect that from good business people.  I do not claim to have business experience, but I think it is commonsense to say that if you took over a staff with twenty-five years' experience of the commercial end of a certain line of business that it would be good policy to use it as a nucleus for spreading out.</P>
    <P>I hope anything I say will not be taken as meaning that I am opposed to the undertaking.  I am sincerely anxious that the undertaking shall be made a success.  I am prepared to vote this two million pounds, although with other people I must say that I think we ought to have an explanation as to what the second million is required for.  The Minister has made a case for one million pounds.  He says that there is nearly one million pounds required to pay off the liabilities that have been incurred.  But I think we ought to get some information as to what the second million is required for.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say this: Some people will not be sorry that a change has taken place.  I read in the newspapers this morning that at long last an arrangement has been made between the trade union that caters for the electricians and the Electricity Supply Board.  For the past few years, these people could not get the ordinary trade union standard rate and conditions from the Board.  I am perfectly satisfied that with the departure of the people who stood in the way the electricians' trade union will be satisfied that some good has been accomplished in that respect.  We have heard a good deal in the discussion that has taken place on this matter. It has occurred to me that as a result of the activities of the past few months anyhow, there has been more heat than light generated.  We have had plenty of heat over the difficulties of the Electricity Supply Board.  Let us hope that in the very near future light will be thrown on what has transpired, and that the people who <Col N="1693" /> are responsible will be made responsible for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose we look on this question without the resignations. If the Minister could answer a question I think the problem would resolve itself into this.  As far as my memory goes without figures, I think that three or four years ago when the Shannon scheme was discussed the available consumption in the country was about 45 million units.  They looked as a desideratum to 70 million units to make it pay.  The question I should like to ask is this: Is not the extra vote required to fulfil an undertaking that the Board may possibly have made?  In other words, has the Board promised or undertaken to supply 130,000,000 units or 140,000,000 units?  As far as I remember, the maximum output of the first Shannon scheme, that is the lesser of the two schemes, was round about 140,000,000 units.  That possibly would resolve itself into this: A public utility board, having gone to the maximum of its capacity, is asking for a vote of money and no utility board with an earning capacity such as the Shannon Board has can be expected to get on without being voted that money.  That is the experience of one of the most accomplished electricians in America who was lately in this country.  He is a man who is over a Board with a capital of 250,000,000 dollars.  His story is that it must be kept supplied with funds if it is to earn, and it must be separated as far as possible from politics.  I think it would be an optimistic thing if the Minister could reassure us that the first proposal of the Shannon output has been reached, and that some of the moneys are required to plan developments and put them in a position to carry them out, and also for maintenance.  One can see how possibly the publicity clause as to publishing the figures may have been mooted, because the contractors who had finished the Shannon works were actually employed on electricity supply, which is a separate thing.  In that way publicity may not have appertained to that as much as it would if it were merely a question of figures.  If it resolves itself into this, <Col N="1694" /> that the first scheme has fructified in two years, I think we may look upon this as merely a vote in aid of a scheme that within two years has come to a most creditable success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill we are considering is a very short one.  It is practically a Bill of one clause to make an additional advance of £2,000,000 to the Electricity Supply Board.  When the Minister opened the debate he took great pains to tell us that when the Board was originally constituted he had Estimates framed for the amount of money that would be required.  These Estimates amounted to two-and-a-half million pounds.  He told us that he had experts in to traverse these figures, to correct them and to criticise them in so far as they could.  As a result of his investigations he satisfied himself that the amount of two-and-a-half millions would be amply sufficient to cover the capital expenditure of the Electricity Supply Board.  Two years, I think, have now elapsed, and he now tells us that the two-and-a-half millions have been spent, and that, in addition to that, there is a sum of £750,000, roughly speaking, three-quarters of a million, of debts now due, which will have to be paid.  Further, he goes on to say, that in his opinion, to complete the activities of the work of the Board, another million and a quarter will be required.  In all, then the sum of four-and-a-half millions will be necessary for the completion of the work that was originally contemplated and undertaken by the Electricity Supply Board. That is a very large increase on the Estimate, and so far we have had no indication from the Minister as to how it came about that the original Estimate which he satisfied himself was apparently right and proper, has been so much exceeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are only two ways as a rule in which it comes about that Estimates are exceeded.  One is that the Estimate is very much under what it should be.  The Minister has more or less answered that question by saying that he has taken very great care in the first instance to satisfy himself as to the adequacy of the amount, so one is rather precluded from putting that down as the cause.  The only other is <Col N="1695" /> that the money was wasted.  As the greater portion of this money was used for the purchase and taking over of undertakings of that description, I would feel inclined to think that it may have been that bad bargains were really the cause of this large overspending of the money.  That is a point that it is possible the Minister may not yet be able to answer, but if he can answer it I think the House will be glad to know his own views as to the reason why this large sum of money is now required.</P>
    <P>There is another matter.  The Board, I believe, are in receipt of revenue of about £800,000 a year.  The first year I think it was something like £700,000, and he told us, I think, that for the current year he anticipated about £900,000.  Take it as £800,000 a year. Where is that money gone to?  Has it been used in the same way as the two-and-a-half millions?  Has it been used for the general purposes of the Electricity Supply Board?  If so, that should be added to the four-and-a-quarter millions apparently now required.  There are two other questions in connection with the financial aspect about which I would also like to obtain information.</P>
    <P>The loan that was obtained for the Shannon Works was in the region of ten millions.  I do not say that all this was spent.  It has not been all spent but I suppose some five or six millions have been spent and the interest on that ought to have been paid. I should like to know from the Minister whether that has been paid.  I take it that the issuing of it would be by the Government and that the Government are responsible for it.  I want to know has the interest on the capital sum expended been paid.  Secondly, has the sinking fund which, under the Act, is required to be kept up, also been met, and is that in a flourishing condition?  I attempted to put all I had to say more or less in the form of questions.  I am not going to criticise speeches but I would like to have these points answered if the Minister can possibly reply to them.</P>

      <P>The last speaker has put to me the type of questions that <Col N="1696" /> go right to the root of the whole matter.  If I could give answers to these questions I would be in a much better position than I find myself in at present.  If I had the information upon which to answer Senator Guinness's three or four questions accurately instead of provisionally&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Provisionally would suit me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Answering them provisionally, unfortunately, has this defect, that my words are taken down, often turned without the provisions, and always used against me.  I can answer the Senator in a very provisional way.  I may just stress the limited answer I am making for this reason, that it exactly shows the position in which the Board have left me.  I should be in the position of coming to the House and saying, &ldquo;There is a definite stage of the Shannon development, in terms of unit consumption, power generated, amount sold, and such-and-such returns upon it,&rdquo; so that people could see everything: interest being paid, sinking fund of a particular type being paid, renewals, obsolescence and everything provided.  I cannot give any indication of that because the Board have not put me in a position to do so.  They ran on, and I am now trying to catch them in mid-course, trying to stop the calculations short at a particular point and make out an answer for myself.  The Senator put two or three things to me.  He asked if the capital sums we have to consider are the sum of two and a half million pounds now increased by two millions.  First of all, it depends upon your point of view as to whether or not the two and a half million pounds is being increased by two million pounds.  Even from my point of view, to a certain extent it is, and to a certain extent it is not.  If you take the two and a half million pounds as being two and a half million pounds that was to be expended clear of the undischarged liabilities of the municipal undertakings, then we are not now in the position of saying that that two and a half million pounds has been spent; that in addition there are the outstanding liabilities, and we are <Col N="1697" /> now asking for another two millions. There has been a mix-up there.  Stressing this again as a provisional statement, and therefore subject to change, the position with regard to finance on the Board's side is this:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Board have got advanced to them £1,900,000.  They took over capital liabilities which at the date of their vesting in the Board amounted to about £800,000.  They paid off £200,000 of that.  So that you may say that there is outstanding £600,000. They have therefore capital liabilities to the State of £1,900,000 and to lenders to local authorities of £600,000. We are now asking to add two millions to that.  This is a mixed statement but it is the best I can get. The Senator next remarked that whether it is a question of two million pounds, or one million one hundred thousand pounds, or whatever it is, it is at any rate something surplus to the two and a half million pounds I talked of, and the Senator asked me a question that should be asked in these circumstances: What happened the original estimate? What has happened the Board's works?  Where has the money gone? To that I reply in this way.  First that I hope I have not been taken as saying that the two and a half million pounds was an exact estimate.  I think I said it was a rough and ready calculation. It did seem to me on the information then given to me to be a sum amply sufficient for what the Board had to do, but I never put it up to the Board or to anybody that it was the last sum of money I would have to ask for on the distribution side of the electricity business.  I never suggested that.  It was really the managing director who put these estimates to me.  He did put estimates to me that may have to be carefully dissected hereafter, but I think that the only judgment to be passed upon those estimates of his is that a less sum than two and a half million pounds would have been sufficient counting in the capitalised value of the undischarged liabilities of the municipal undertakings.  I said I had another test, a test by thirds&mdash;it applies this way: you should put into distribution one-third of the total sum <Col N="1698" /> that you put into everything, generation, transmission and distribution. But that calculation relates to a particular generating capacity.  If your generating capacity is added to and your transmission expenditure is added to, you will require more money for distribution. In fact, what is now happening is that the two million pounds I am asking for, envisages not merely the generation of, say, 150,000,000 units, which is about Ardnacrushna's maximum production in a dry season, but it envisages the development of nearly 200,000,000 units.  In other words, we are allowing for an increase on the generating side. I thought I expressed all that in a remote way by saying that if this two million pounds had to be added on to the distribution side of the present stage of development of the partial Shannon scheme it could not possibly be remunerated.  What we have to see will we see this extra money remunerated if we get extra units generated for a third time then you will have a bigger distribution system and can put more money into it.</P>
    <P>The Senator asked another question. I have to make a qualified answer. He asked, if we, as the people who stand for the public in this, receive from the Board the interest on the money we have put into it, and if we receive anything by way of sinking fund payments.  I refer him to the Act in regard to the latter.  The sinking fund payments do not start until after the Appointed Day.  But the charges, according to another portion of the Act, ought to be such before the Appointed Day as to conduce to certain things, including the sinking fund being met afterwards.  It would seem to me to have been elementary prudence for the Board to see that even in the years in which sinking fund payments had not definitely to be handed over some provision by way of sinking fund was being made.  A prudent Board would not come to the end of the year 1931 paying nothing by way of sinking fund, and then jump suddenly into a full year's payment.  They might have taken two years' payments ahead and spread them over four years, but, as a matter of fact, no sinking fund payments have <Col N="1699" /> been made.  As regards the other question, as the Board operated its finances, it did not pay us our interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest is not paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but may I restrict that answer somewhat?  It is not fully paid.  I am not going to be led into a discussion as to what &ldquo;fully&rdquo; covers.  As the Board used its finances, certain things did not happen. Whether they could have happened with another use of its finances is another question to be examined at another time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">

      <P>There is then the question of the revenue of the Board. Where has that £800,000 a year gone? That amount has been received as revenue. It has been paid for a variety of other things.  Has that money been used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been used&mdash; entirely used up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>How has it been used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of it has been used as capital.  I think that is what it comes to.  When I said that the Board was using its money in a certain way, that is what I meant.  I ask the forbearance of the House in this matter, because if it is pursued I shall be made to speak upon certain information which I have, and that information and certain statements which I have cannot be described as fully considered.  They have not been fully considered by me, at all events. I do not know whether or not they have been fully and finally considered even by the people who brought them forward.  There will have to be discussions upon them.  I would be bound to mislead the House, one way or another, if I said anything more as regards these figures.  The fact that I am in this embarrassed position with regard to these questions shows how I have been left by the Board, instead of having, as I should have, a clear-cut statement with regard to all the revenue the Board enjoyed, how it spent it, and a division between capital moneys and other moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1700" /> Reference has been made constantly in this debate to &ldquo;attacks&rdquo; and &ldquo;one-sided attacks.&rdquo;  I never set out in connection with this matter to attack anybody as the phrase is ordinarily used.  If I had called for the resignation of certain people or had dismissed certain people, I would be in a totally different position before this House.  I would then have to justify myself for the course I had taken, and that would probably amount to an attack upon certain people.  If one enforces the dismissal of others and attempts to justify that dismissal, looking at it from another angle that constitutes an attack on certain people.  What have I been doing in this and the other House? Explaining the reasons why the Government accepted certain resignations. I do not ask the House to say that they believe one word of what I say on this matter.  All I say is that that is the best information they can get, and that that is all they are going to get at present.  What is the House asked to do?  Holding a threat over me with regard to an exposure, a tremendous exposure, if I am not speaking the truth&mdash;holding that threat over me for the future, they are asked to give me a certain amount of money which I say, with a full sense of responsibility, I want for the Board's purposes during the interim period. Nobody is asked to pass judgment on this matter at present.  I do not even ask the House to decide at this moment whether I was right in receiving those resignations or not.  That is not in the text of the Bill.  I brought it into the discussion because people were clamouring for certain information, and I wanted to satisfy that demand as far as I could.</P>
    <P>The phrase has also been used that there is a &ldquo;conflict&rdquo;&mdash;some people have descended to the use of the word &ldquo;squabble&rdquo;&mdash;between myself and one or two others.  As far as I am concerned what has happened is this: A certain amount of anxiety on my part with regard to how the Board was going, a certain viewpoint on the part of certain members of the Board as to what the Board should do, and, in the end, certain resignations <Col N="1701" /> handed in, which I accepted.  If anybody likes to say hereafter that some of these people should not have handed in their resignations, or that I should not have accepted them, they can make that case.  They will only be able to make that case, if at all, when the facts are before them, and they will get the facts eventually.  Does anybody think, taking my statement as being entirely and completely <i>ex parte</i>, taking it that I am picking out the titbits from this correspondence and choosing the portions that suit myself, but remembering that what I am quoting from are the Board's letters&mdash; does anybody think that the situation revealed by these quotations is to be thrust aside as a squabble between myself and two other persons?  Surely a great deal more is involved than that?  There is the question of policy. On policy I may have taken a very bad lesson for the future from the discussion here, because it seems that there is an unusually lenient point of view displayed in this House on this question&mdash;not the point of view that a Minister expects to be displayed in regard to himself in relation to his Department. If, hereafter, there are other boards set up, and I find myself in peculiarly mixed circumstances with regard to one of these boards&mdash;I may feel that there is a certain responsibility on me to make revelations and to give information, but thinking back what has been said here, I would feel very reluctant to come before this House until the damage had in fact been done.  There has been no stimulus given to any Minister to relate to this House a dangerous state of affairs at the moment that the danger is impending.  There has been almost a whitewashing&mdash;I am sorry Senator Sir John Keane is not here because he is a man who is a stalwart for accounts.  He has previously revealed himself as one who would prefer a bankrupt business with well kept accounts to a good business without accounts.  His attitude on this question is: &ldquo;Accounts&mdash;what are they?&rdquo;  Senator Vincent has put the other point of view: How can a business be run properly if you have not the picture which accounts represent?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1702" /> To speak of &ldquo;squabbles&rdquo; and &ldquo;personalities clashing&rdquo; or any of these things suggests a very limited view of what has happened.  If that were all that was in question, is it to be imagined that two persons who had banked so much on the complete success of the Shannon scheme in its entirety would not have found some means of reconciling their views if there was only a difference of opinion? There is a great deal more at stake than that.  I might have let this thing drift a great deal further, and what position would I then have been in?  I would have had to come here with less information if I had not reconstructed the Board.  Even a year hence, I would be coming here with less information than I have now, and it would not be a question of over-spending to the extent of £600,000 with a quarter of a million as debts, but it might well be a question of over-spending to the extent of a million with debts possibly amounting to another million. I do believe that if there is any criticism hereafter of my efforts to have certain members of the Board brought to a proper sense of their responsibility, it will be that I allowed things to go on a few months too long.  When I say that against myself, I should like to add, in my defence, that it was late in February or early in March of this year that I got the first revelation from the Board that its accounts were in complete disorder and the agreement broken, that over-spending and debts had accumulated to such a point.</P>
    <P>Senator Connolly says the Board's word stands against mine as to whether the agreement bound them or not.  No member of the Board, in all the lengthy correspondence that took place, ever questioned that that agreement was binding.  Nobody ever even raised the point which was raised in the other House and raised here, that the agreement was illegal or <i>ultra vires.</i>  This much is to be said for the Board&mdash;that they accepted this as an honourable undertaking, and that they raised no question or quibble of that kind to try to get out of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you call it a quibble?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would call it a quibble, viewing the circumstances. What were the circumstances? There was a disagreement as to what a certain sum of money was intended to cover.  We got away from the point as to what it, in fact, covered to what it was intended to cover.  I said: &ldquo;I have a certain view-point.  I left the two Houses of the Oireachtas under the impression that £2,500,000 was to cover certain things.  I shall go back and make that clear to them.&rdquo; The Board said to me in those circumstances: &ldquo;Do not do that.  We will keep within that sum, admitting your point of view.&rdquo;  If the Board were to turn round and tell me now that this agreement was illegal or <i>ultra vires</i>, they would be definitely quibbling, because they did not make that case in correspondence.  If they had made that case any time since autumn of 1929, they would have been at once up against what they tried to avoid in the beginning&mdash;my coming to the two Houses.</P>
      <P>A question was asked as to what &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; I put on the Board. The word &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; was also introduced. The &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; and &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; consisted of this&mdash; that I was going to present myself before the Dáil and Seanad, and say: &ldquo;This £2,500,000, I think, includes the undischarged liabilities of the acquired undertakings, and I want the Oireachtas to put that beyond doubt.&rdquo; That was the &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; that was used.  If the Board had said: &ldquo;We made an agreement with you, but we are advised that it is <i>ultra vires</i> and illegal,&rdquo; I would have said: &ldquo;Very well; I shall bring it within your powers and make it legal by coming to the place that can rectify and legalise the whole matter&mdash;the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point has been dragged in from outside, and I think I know the source from which it comes, that I am looking in this two millions for a sum of money to be handed secretly to myself, in order to meet a bill for extras which may fall due.  Under the Bill as it stands, no sum of money can <Col N="1704" /> be paid for extras on the construction work, and the people who demand an assurance from me that it will not be so used, ought to point out a phrase in the Bill or in the original Act under which I am enabled to pay out extra moneys on the construction side.  It is not possible, and it is not intended that I should pay moneys in that way.  In my opening speech I referred to the £5,200,000, increased later to an effective sum of £5,700,000, and said that this Bill had nothing to do with that sum, and I now say that any addition that was to be made to that total would be a separate item.  If there is any item to be met on the construction side, there will be a special Bill to provide for it, and a special Vote will be brought in for it.  Extras do not come in here, and the extras are very far from being a concrete difficulty at the moment.</P>
    <P>I was asked about interest and sinking fund.  I have talked about readjustments that may have to be made in the whole financial lay-out of the scheme.  There are easements that can be given, but the moment we give any of these easements, it argues that the Board set up to operate under certain conditions, has failed in its duty.  As far as the first scheme was concerned, they got that, with the original Siemens-Schuckert proposition, and the expert's modification. They could see from the documents that interest was to be paid at certain rates, repayments stretching over a particular period of years.  If we now have to make an easement in the period&mdash;I do not think it would be a wrong thing to do on the grounds stated to Senator Johnson on the accounts discussion last year or possibly earlier&mdash;that can be done, but I feel bound to complain that we did not get a chance to consider that when the prospects were still good and we were not under the compulsion of a bad situation. Just because the Board got into difficulties we are being driven, in order to meet these difficulties, to weaken the very strong structure of the old Shannon scheme.  I used the word &ldquo;weaken&rdquo; in relation to the Shannon scheme, joining it to the description of &ldquo;very strong structure.&rdquo;  We must <Col N="1705" /> weaken it without weakening it to the point of danger and that I think it is possible to do.  But the moment we start making easements, at that moment we make a confession that the original Electricity Supply Board did not carry out the duties imposed on them.</P>
    <P>It is also alleged against me that in July, 1929, I knew there were certain difficulties and yet I made a speech there which engendered a feeling of confidence in the whole scheme.  Why should I not make that speech in July, 1929?  I had doubts, a little bit of suspicion and uneasiness.  I knew one thing was in question.  I got agreement on that thing.  The two points about which I was concerned were met by a denite agreement.  The money was to include the undischarged liabilities of the acquired undertakings.  I got a definite statement from them that they would give me freely and frankly the information I desired.  There was no doubt about the agreement at that time.  It was made with me on the 1st July, 1929, but though it was not reduced to writing, I think, until August, there was no question about it.  As a matter of fact for the first time, just previous to the debate, I got from the Board a number of figures which up to that time I had failed to get.  I got from them an assurance that 142,000,000 units would be sold in this country by a certain time.  I stated that, perfacing it with the remark that that represented the assurance of the Board.  I tied myself fast to that.  If I made any speech at that time, saying that the Board had told me that 142,000,000 units would be sold by a certain date, they were the people I had to rely on.  The two questions about which I had trouble with the Board had been ended to my satisfaction.</P>

      <P>The mentality revealed by these interjections is very peculiar&mdash;that I was in some way intimidating the Board by saying to them &ldquo;I am going to the people who created you to inquire from them what were the circumstances attending your creation, what were the moneys placed at <Col N="1707" /> your disposal, and what were they supposed to cover.&rdquo;  The Board shirked that position, and shirked it by saying, &ldquo;We will accept your view.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If it was wrong, it only meant that they felt I was going to get that wrong interpretation from the Dáil and the Seanad.  I had no reason to have any lack of confidence in July, 1929.  I had two points of difficulty, and the two points of difficulty had been resolved.  I had got for the first time early in July a statement from the Board indicating what the likely unit consumption in the country was going to be at a particular period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very little indeed in July, 1929.  The proof of that is that up to the end of April, 1930, they proceeded to write me letters to prove that they were still within the agreement&mdash;a year later.  Even in later letters the worst charge they make against themselves is that they broke that agreement at the earliest in December, 1929.  It is quite clear that their programme had not committed them to more than that at that particular date.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnson joined by Senator O'Farrell are confident with regard to the success of this scheme; so am I within limits, but Senator O'Farrell and Senator Johnson both said they realised that it was a success on the engineering side, with which, of course, the Electricity Supply Board had nothing to do, and they believed that it would be a success from the point of view of revenue.  That we all hope for, and we want to do more than merely hope for success.  We want to see that that particular success is achieved, but as to how it is to be achieved I want to answer that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson, joined by Senator <Col N="1708" /> Comyn, later got on to the point of an independent board and the possibility of continuing such a board.  I have said that I do not want to yield up that idea of an independent board yet.  If I am asked to go deeper into it I am bound to say at this moment I am not convinced that it can be carried out. That is, present-day circumstances are such that I cannot see the Board operating clearly and independently for some years.  It may be possible when we get to the point that some stage of the Shannon scheme has been rounded off when revenue is coming in, when all liabilities are met and when accounts stereotyped in a prescribed form are being regularly presented. It may then be possible once more to fling the Board at arm's length from the Government, but it seems to me in the particular position in which we find ourselves that we have to keep that Board somewhat under supervision and continue it under definite control for a few years.</P>
    <P>Senator Comyn used a cogent phrase with regard to its budgetary system and finance.  It does seem to me if you want to relax full control now you may have to think of some such system as that in which the Dublin City Manager operates in relation to the Corporation at the moment.  There should be freedom to act in particular things, but so long as the operations of the Board can have such violent repercussions as they can have now upon the national finances then I think it would be wrong to lessen control of the Board and to get back to the old position.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson made a point with regard to the units that are being sold, and made a comparison between the 84,000,000 units I referred to in answer to a question, and the 134,000,000 units mentioned by me in opening.  Remember, these two tots do not relate to the same thing.  The 84,000,000 units refer to units sold to the consumer, and the 134,000,000 units I spoke of&mdash;even a greater sum in units, about 140,000,000 units&mdash;referred to generation, and, of course, there are losses first on the transmission system and losses again in the process of distributing locally to the consumer. The full capacity of the present <Col N="1709" /> development resolved in sales at consumers' premises amounts to 110,000,000 units; so that even if the full capacity is being generated and sold, it is a comparison as between 84,000,000 units and 110,000,000 units.</P>

      <P>The standby then comes in.  We may get the equivalent of an extra turbine at Ardnacrusha for ordinary purposes by using the Pigeon House as a standby.  Senator Johnson, and I think also Senator O'Farrell, criticised the remarks that have been made with regard to the Managing Director in this way.  They said, so far as they could see, the gravamen of the whole charge of the moment is the lack of proper accounts.  In my mind that is not the serious point The serious point is the policy which the Board pursued, and the serious point is the tariff system which was decided without any proper appreciation of what the capital commitments were and the revenue necessary to meet these commitments.  But even taking the accounts as one item, is it suggested that you can conceive of Managing Director of a big business like the Electricity Supply Board, who has not an intimate connection with the accounts?  I cannot conceive it. cannot conceive a system under which the Managing Director of a big business like that would not be supposed to have a most intimate connection with the accounts side.  And, aside from that remember what I have said over and over again that it is not a question of the system of accounts that is in debate here, but that the material upon which any accounts can be based is missing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have an opportunity to decide hereafter as to the different departments of the Electricity Supply Board where material is conspicuous by its absence.  There is the stores end, the contracts, the wiring end and a variety of other departments.  We will have to see who was in charge of the departments and who is to be held responsible because certain material that should be there is unquestionably missing. At that point I want to say <Col N="1710" /> that the worst feature to my mind of the discussion that has ranged round this business is this, that there has been an attempt made, I do not say here, although it has been quoted a little here, to put the blame for what has happened on to the Board's accountant.  That is an outrage, unless there is complete justification for the charge.  A man was allowed to pick his own staff, and if he wanted a £10,000 a year man he had the £10,000 at his disposal to get him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  The Board had the money to secure a good man.  When we get a statement made that the Board, in its wisdom, decided to get a native and also decided that they would only offer a certain sum for the native, a sum so low that a first-class man did not offer, then I agree with Senator Vincent that they declared themselves to that extent incompetent, for they had not a proper appreciation of what the accountancy side of a ten million corporation meant, and so limited themselves by the salary they offered that they could not get a good man. I am not agreeing that they did not get a good man, because as far as I can learn, the unfortunate accountant was asked to make finance bricks, and had not even the financial straw given to him with which to make them.  The records were missing, the accounts could not be prepared; the accountant as been asked to prepare accounts though the records are not there.  In extenuation we are told that the Board decided to get a native, and that they would only pay a certain sum, and that they did not get a suitable man.  That is a question I want to leave in abeyance until we get the whole thing properly revealed, because it is not right that an individual's reputation should be challenged in that way.  But I may glance at another side of it.  If that individual were responsible, clearly responsible for the absence of the records or the non-production of the accounts and the Board knew it, why did the Board retain him?  Why did the Board keep him on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> Senator Johnson asked me would I give figures to show that without adding to the consumers' cost all the money spent would be remunerative. The Senator says he is optimistic; so is Senator O'Farrell.  Now, I am in this difficult position.  It has been complained that my statements to date have destroyed public confidence, that they have destroyed the Board's credit.  What am I to answer to this? Will I give figures to show that without adding to the consumer's cost the money will be remunerative?  If I could give them here and now, there would be no happier man alive.  I cannot give them.  I do not know whether the figures are there to show this, but I do know that such figures are not with me.  Whether it will be possible to get them, we will have to wait and judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not know the charges to be set against the revenue for a particular year.  I know the revenue for some years.  But we are now driven to the point that the whole scheme has to be probed into to see what rate of interest is to be demanded, what sinking fund payments are considered proper, and what rates of depreciation with regard to all the accounts we are going insist upon.  That has all to be examined into in detail, and only then can a proper answer be given.  So I cannot answer at the moment. Remember I am speaking without certain figures.  I have figures which are not thoroughly considered by myself or the people who should have considered them, and I cannot say anything on this question.  If I were to give any such answer at the moment, it would be bound to be misleading one way or another.  We simply have to leave it as it is for the time being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Comyn thinks that have been too lenient with the Board in the matter of accounts and too severe otherwise.  I was hoping that would have been detailed.  I wonder at what point did Senator Comyn think I had got too lenient with the Board as far as the accounts are concerned?  It is not <Col N="1712" /> a question of leniency.  I did what I could to get the accounts.  I pressed for them repeatedly.  I was pressed myself for them in the Dáil, and I pressed the Board for them.  I prescribed the forms and I assented to the Chairman's proposal that a firm of auditors be brought in to re-make the records.  It was one thing to prescribe the forms and to ask for the accounts, and another thing to get them.  I have not been able to get them.  That is not a question of leniency.  If I had seen a chance of getting even provisional accounts earlier, I would have insisted on them.  There was no question of a mild attitude. There are certain things that I had to demand.  We gave that Board independence as far as we could, and what we demanded in return, was publicity.  We wanted the production of certain accounts at certain times.  There was no question of being lenient or harsh.  It was a question of asking at the proper time and of keeping up continuous pressure to get things at the proper time.  The complaint, if any, that is going to be made is that I allowed them a little bit too much rope.  My defence on that is that prior to late March of this year, I did not get a revelation that really warranted me in taking certain action.  Certain action was taken then, and certain things followed. After that I had to wait in the hopes that I would get some decent financial statement on which I could base my claims for two millions, or whatever sum of money was wanted.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane had various remarks to make.  In his absence possibly it is not right to allude to them, but I want to say this, as people other than Senator Sir John Keane have said it.  He has referred to the dead hand of Finance in all this.  Credit can be apportioned hereafter for what has been done.  As far as responsibility is concerned, I take the fullest responsibility for everything that Finance did. I take it for this reason: that I had my experience of what is called the dead hand of Finance on the £5,200,000 scheme, and I knew that that was a success worked under the supervision of Finance.  I had members of the Ministry of Finance associated with <Col N="1713" /> me in all the dealings that I had in connection with that scheme.  Tributes have been paid to the engineering success of the scheme, and I think tributes ought to be paid to the financial success it has been, and that success was achieved in the closest co-operation with what is called the dead hand of Finance.  Certainly in his criticism of the expenditure of money on the Shannon scheme, Senator Sir John Keane never alleged conservatism against myself. So far as responsibility is concerned, it was myself who was operating throughout in this matter of the Electricity Supply Board, and there is no question of the dead hand of Finance. It has been suggested that the officials wanted to get a grip on this particular scheme.  Nothing has been better recognised in the whole history of this scheme in later years than that the scheme had been taken definitely and clearly away from ordinary control.  It has been appreciated that that was so, and I have seen no evidence whatever to justify the use of any phrase that officials wanted to get this into their grip, and that as the Board went along in its operations the dead hand of Finance came down upon it at any point.  The hand that came down upon it at any point was my own, and I can set aside as ridiculous the suggestion that in the matter of the Shannon Electricity Scheme, I was operating in a conservative way or in a way to stop development.</P>
    <P>Senator Vincent brought in the point of the views that would be taken of this outside.  I referred in 1927 to discussions I had in the United States of America and in Canada on this whole business, and told the Dáil in the introductory speech I made that I found that this scheme was the centre of interest, as Senator Vincent said, to people who were fighting out the question of public ownership versus some type of private ownership.  I said that we had been warned over and over again that if we were going to venture into anything except the clearest type of private ownership we were doomed to failure.  It went so far that one of the firms who were thinking at one time of looking for the electricity <Col N="1714" /> concession in this country said to us, &ldquo;No, we will wait a bit; in a year or two, when you have made a mess of it it will be a cheaper thing to buy.&rdquo; That was a very clear cut view.  There will be tremendous interest taken in this, and tremendous interest in whatever scheme we eventually decide upon.  There has been considerable interest already displayed in the scheme of this Board which aimed at putting the benefits of Government credit at the disposal of this Board while taking away the handicaps and impediments of complete Government control.  We have got to find a new system, as Senator Vincent said, more or less under the searchlight of a great many eyes, some looking anxiously to see us making a mess of it, others hoping that we will make a complete success of it.</P>
    <P>We have experience in other countries of operations like this and of upsets in the smooth progress of schemes like this.  Senator Sir John Keane, in a debate some years ago referred to a book called &ldquo;Niagra in Politics,&rdquo; written by a man called Mavor.  I remember, in reply, saying that in addition to quoting from that book he should have given us quotations from the Report of the Commission which sat to investigate the working of the Ontario hydro-electric system.  It is funny how suitable some of the conclusions of that Commission are to the circumstances of the present situation.  Here are some of the faults indicated by the Gregory Commission in the operation of that hydro-electric system.</P>
    <P>1.  That a sinking fund sufficient to redeem the debt in 30 years should have been included in the cost of power.</P>
    <P>2.  That the Hydro should await the approval of the Government in certain matters, but that instead of the Government controlling the Hydro the Hydro controls the Government.</P>
    <P>3.  It is of prime importance that the Government of the day should be kept fully in touch with matters relating to the operations of the Hydro, but this has not been done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1715" /> 4.  The auditor should be appointed and his remuneration fixed by the Government.</P>
    <P>5.  Accurate estimates of costs should be insisted upon before beginning new works, and the Government should be in a position to check these costs if necessary.</P>
    <P>We are not in a position to do that.</P>
    <P>In answer to the people who asked: &ldquo;Is this sound?  Will it be sound and a success?&rdquo; they say:</P>
    <P>6.  &ldquo;That the organisation administered by the Commission is financially sound, there is not the slightest doubt.  The Commission has to a large degree a monopoly of something everybody wants.  Any organisation that has such a monopoly should have no difficulty in paying its way provided this method of administration is sound.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think we could apply that here also. They wind up by saying&mdash;and I read this with considerable reserve, because I make no charges of the type referred to here&mdash;</P>
    <P>7.  &ldquo;While there did not appear to be any evidence of misappropriation of moneys by the Hydro, the Gregory Commission reported that it handled the funds that came into its hands with incredible looseness.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I knew it was a dangerous way that I was treading, and I tried to build up the Board into a harmonious team that would avoid the difficulties.  Some of the people who went on the Board knew of those difficulties.  Senator Vincent has declared that there is possibly one criticism that might be applied to me, namely, that I should not have accepted certain resignations until I had secured from the people, who brought about a particular situation, a full statement as to what had happened.  In other words, I <Col N="1716" /> should have retained them until I had obtained a clear picture of the situation that developed under their control. To a certain extent, that was allowed to happen.  My leniency will be found to amount to this, that I tried to get from the people responsible an accurate statement of what happened in their time.  I agree that it might have been a wise thing to retain some of the people in order to get from them, after the event, a true statement of what happened, since they were responsible; but, on the other hand, there was the difficulty that if you retained these people in power you might not have any way of stopping certain things that were happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Vincent also commented upon the importance of the accounts. The accounts are important, and the fact that people have not the accounts argues a very bad and loose state of affairs.  Let us for the moment leave the accounts out of the question.  The word &ldquo;accounts&rdquo; may cover a multitude of matters.  What is one to think of a Board that declares, three years after it is set up, that with regard to its operations for at least two and a half years it could not at points even state its capital commitments with any reasonable degree of accuracy?  That is not the full measure of the information that one would expect from such an institution.  One would expect returns on much beside their capital commitments&mdash;they did not even know their capital commitments.  How could anyone arrange tariff systems or charges under such circumstances?  And it is to be noted in this connection that the Board, in the Report it brought before the House, together with the 1928-1929 accounts, set out two fundamental principles which guided it on the lighting and domestic convenience side, and not the power side.  The Report sets out: &ldquo;In approaching the problem of tariffs the Board felt that it should keep in mind two fundamental principles, the first one being that the rates of charge should be such as to make it possible for the maximum number of consumers to utilise to the fullest degree the abundant supply of electricity for all purposes which the hydro-electric development of the River Shannon and the <Col N="1717" /> building of the national network placed at their disposal, and the second, that the rates of charge for electricity to be utilised for each particular purpose should be such as to correspond as closely as possible to the cost of supplying it for that purpose.&rdquo;  The Board that wrote that as to the second of the two fundamental principles it had to keep in mind could tell me one or two years afterwards that they did not know what their capital commitments amounted to.  How could they set out that one of the fundamental principles that had to be observed was that the rates of charge for electricity to be utilised for each particular purpose should be such as to correspond as closely as possible to the cost of supplying current for that purpose, when they did not know what their costs were?</P>
    <P>I am asked to get in experts of different types.  A committee of the two Houses has been suggested, but that was pretty decisively rejected by the majority of those who spoke.  There are certain points on which the Dáil and Seanad, not as a committee, but in full House, will later have to pass judgment.  My proposal is that after that certain people may have to be brought in, experts in the system of accounts of electrical undertakings, experts in particular things connected with electricity, and so on.  There is no demand from outside for experts, but such a demand has been made by the late managing director.  He says that the material is now present upon which experts could form their judgment. If that is so, I am left in a state of bewilderment as to what has been happening.  I have been pressing the Electricity Supply Board up to late April of this year for a statement to the effect that everything was all right, for a statement showing the actual revenue for certain years, and the estimated revenue for other years, for a statement showing capital charges and other charges, but I could not get it.  Now I am told that the material is there on which experts could form a judgment and that if experts are brought in they could certify that everything is all right.  Why did the Board not call in experts to their <Col N="1718" /> aid and procure such a statement for me?  That would have satisfied me, and would have satisfied this House.  I could have come to the House fully armed with a statement from the Board that their experts had material upon which to form a judgment, and that their judgment was in favour of the whole undertaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement is not an accurate statement.  I do not use the word &ldquo;untrue.&rdquo;  Why did not the late managing director bring in these experts?  He could thereby have justified his whole conduct and he could have justified the expenditure to date and so avoided all the embarrassing circumstances that have since arisen. The experts we are asked to bring in are of two different types.  Some of the experts we are asked to call in would be quite useless.  Some of them may have a part to play, but not at the moment.  What the magic word &ldquo;expert&rdquo; conjures up before people's minds is ludicrous in the present circumstances of the Board.  There used to be in the old days a series of articles in the &ldquo;How to Make&rdquo; series, published in some of the newspapers.  I recall a parody of that series, giving instructions on how to make a bookcase.  First, you ring up a firm of furniture people and ask them to turn out boards of such a type as an ordinary bookcase would be made from.  You then would ask the firm where you could obtain nails.  You next ask a manufacturer of nails to supply a certain quantity to you.  Then you would send out your chauffeur to collect the lot.  Finally you advertise for a carpenter.  That is somewhat similar to what we are being asked to do at the moment in regard to the Electricity Supply Board.  We gave them the people to get the boards and the nails, and now they ask us to advertise for a carpenter for them.  There were people put in as experts to run this thing.  They found themselves in a position of difficulty.  They left, and now, from outside, they cry out that the material is there, and if experts <Col N="1719" /> were brought in they could give an opinion.  If that is so, why didn't they bring in expert opinion in their own time?</P>
      <P>I come now to the question of failure that has been spoken about.  I read certain passages from the report of the Gregory Commission.  I do not know that there can be any question of failure in this matter.  The word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; in connection with this subject is a relative term.  The distribution side of this scheme could have been a great success.  Whether it can still be the great success that it was at one time tending to be, I do not know.</P>

      <P>All that has happened so far has shown that if we have prudence and experience in connection with the Board the scheme can be made self-supporting, and that is what I would call a success.  The taxpayer ought not to be asked to pay one penny for this and consumers should get current as cheaply as possible.  What we have learned is that we cannot do without prudence and experience; we must have them. What we have to find out eventually is what are the adjustments that prudence and experience will dictate to us as necessary to be made at this stage, and we cannot get judgment based either upon prudence or experience until the material for prudence and experience to work upon is ready.  At the moment the material is not there.  As soon as it is I will see that this House is informed and the House can pass judgment as to whether or not we ought to fee people of prudence and experience to tell us where we are going and how far we have progressed.</P>

      <P>I would ask the members of the Seanad to listen to this very short section, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1925 (No. 28 of 1925), shall be construed and have effect and be deemed always to have had effect as if after the figures 1918 now contained therein there were inserted the words and figures &ldquo;or under Rule 18 of the General Rules applicable to Schedules A, B, C, D and E of the said Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not a reading of hieroglyphics. It is not an algebraic equation.  It is intended to be the ordinary English in an Act of Parliament which people are supposed to understand.  In order to understand what that sub-section means you have to tread your way first through the Act of 1925 passed in the Oireachtas, and then you have to go back to the English Finance Act of 1918, and after treading your way around that English Finance Act of 1918, you have to go through the rules and regulations passed under the 1918 Act, and then if you are a first-rate lawyer you will understand something <Col N="1721" /> of what is meant here.  I do not pretend to be a first-rate lawyer, but this matter has come under the purview of some first-rate lawyers, and I now venture to tell the House what is really the meaning of that mysterious section. The point is this: the English Act of 1918 authorised assessments to be made, returns to be made, and inquiries to be made for a period of three years.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1918 said nothing in relation to the case of a man who died within the three year period, but the rules and regulations passed under that Act authorised assessments to be made on the personal representatives of persons who were dead.  That is done under Regulation 18.  After that there came along the Act of 1925.  The revenue officials, who I had occasion to say on one or two occasions in this House, are men of the very greatest ability, and the best of officials&mdash;that is my definite opinion&mdash;are very ruthless and hard-hearted, but thoroughly efficient.  The three year period was not enough for them, and in 1925 you passed an Act here whereby you authorised an inquiry to be pursued over a period of six years.  But in 1925 you forgot to provide, just as in the Act of 1918, they had forgotten to provide, that the inquiry should be made in the case of a man who was dead as against his personal representatives. That was forgotten.  But though it was forgotten in the Act of Parliament the very efficient revenue men continued to make their assessments against the personal representatives of dead men.  They have succeeded in getting £100,000 to which they were not entitled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The dead hand of Finance has been mentioned here to-night but this was a pretty lively living hand; it was a light hand and it got into the pockets of the executors and administrators to the extent of £100,000 and they are looking for more.  Some executors in the case of a man named Hogan resisted the claim and it came before the Courts.  The Revenue officials found that they had no law for it, and unless they passed <Col N="1722" /> an <i>ex post facto</i> Act of the Oireachtas they could not succeed in their action in the Hogan case which is now before the Courts.  Not alone that but they would have to give back £100,000 which they should pay back if they were going to be honest.  They are absolutely honest when they are found out.  I do not say now that they may not have thought that they were right I should withdraw what I said about being found out, because I do believe that in their enthusiasm and in their natural desire to get money for public purposes, they, of course, looked at the Act of Parliament according to their own way.  There is a plausible way of looking at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not say exactly that they were wrong.  What I do say is that they could not legally sustain their point of view.  The balance was against them, and they could not legally sustain their point of view.  Their present position is that under the law as it stands they have £100,000, and probably more, to which they are not entitled.  They have been resisted.  In my judgment, and, I think, in the judgment of a judge of the Circuit Court, they will fail in their contention, but in order to obviate the consequences of failure they have come forward with Section 2 of this Bill, with this <i>ex post facto</i> legislation.  The meaning of the section is that they shall be entitled to go into the accounts for six years in the case of a man who is dead&mdash;that is as against his executors.  If the Minister needs money, if the Dáil, which is the financial authority, considers that it requires money and that this is a good way of getting it, I do not object to their saying that henceforth we shall be entitled to inquire for six years, to assess and collect in the case of men who are dead as against their personal representatives; but, as a member of the Seanad what I think I have reasonable grounds for objecting to is this: they say not alone shall it be the law henceforth but it shall be deemed to have been the law since 1925.  I believe I have a right to object to that, and that the Seanad as a revising Chamber has the right to object to it&mdash;the Chamber that in an especial degree is the <Col N="1723" /> guardian of constitutional principle and constitutional liberty.</P>
    <P>Here is a Bill which <i>ex post facto</i> creates an offence.  Why do I say that? Because the section declares that it shall be deemed always to have been the law, that is from 1925, that the personal representative of a dead man must make a six-year return if called upon.  Now, if he does not make that return, I say confidently that he exposes himself to a penalty.  I have not the section before me at the moment, but it provides that a man shall make a return under a penalty.  I know something about revenue law, and I challenge the Minister to say if that is not so&mdash;that under the section you are creating <i>ex post facto</i> a liability involving a penalty.  If that is so, this is a little piece of revenue legislation that is a breach of constitutional principle. It is for that reason that I rise to object to it as strongly as I can.</P>
    <P>We, as Senators, have really no interest, or, at least, very little interest, in matters of revenue.  These are matters that are within the peculiar province of the Dáil, but we have an interest in seeing that legislation is just, that it is constitutional, and that the liberties of the people are preserved. You certainly can never have public liberty properly guarded if you have legislation introduced which can now declare that to have been an offence which yesterday was not an offence.  That is my objection to this kind of legislation.  The Minister, of course, may say that this money is needed for public purposes.  He may say, &ldquo;I have collected £100,000 on a certain reading of an Act of Parliament. I have been advised by the ablest officials in the service and no objection has been raised to it for the last seven or eight years.  Now objection has been raised to it.  The judges say that I have been wrong, that I have collected this money unlawfully. I do not want to give it back.  An action has been brought against me in the case of Hogan for a declaration that I am not entitled to collect this money.  I have no answer to that action, and I want to get the Dáil and the Seanad to pass a law which will afford me a good defence to that <Col N="1724" /> action which is now under trial.&rdquo;  That really is what the Minister is going to do under this section.  I do not wish to be hypercritical in these revenue matters, because it is not within my province, but I think some other way should have been found for dealing with a question of this kind.  Speaking for myself, I would rather pay back the £100,000 than stand over legislation of this character.  That is all I have to say in regard to this section.</P>

I do not wish to state anything that is not absolutely and entirely fair.  I have stated that the Minister's proposal is to create a penalty <i>ex post facto.</i>  I have not found any legal authority for that.  If I am contradicted I cannot produce the section at the moment, but in the revenue legislation such a section must exist.  I ask the Seanad to express their disapproval of the section.  As Senators we have no power to amend this Bill, but we have the power to make a recommendation.  I think that members of the House ought not allow this to pass without at least calling attention to it.  If my advice is taken, I think that we ought to express our disapproval of this kind of legislation.</P>

      <P>There is no creation retrospectively of an offence, and there is no question whatever of any penalty involved in this.  Even if it did propose to create <i>ex post facto</i> an offence it would be unconstitutional and void.  In fact nothing of the sort is proposed.  What happened was this: that by the Act of 1918, so far as a person still living was concerned, the revenue could go back three years, and in respect of a person who <Col N="1725" /> is dead, under Rule 18, the revenue could go back three years.  Rule 18 of the General Rules, Income Tax Act, 1918, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>18.  Where any person dies without having delivered a statement of all his profits or gains chargeable to tax, with a view to an assessment thereon in due course, an assessment in respect of the profits or gains which arose or accrued to him before his death may be made at any time within the year of assessment, or within three years after the expiration thereof, upon his executors or administrators, and the amount of the tax thereon shall be a debt due from and payable out of his estate.</P>
      <P>In 1923 the British passed an Act extending the period to six years.  In 1925 a section in our Act extended the period to six years, and that section was meant to cover both the liability of people who were living and the liability falling on the estates of those who had died.  A Circuit Court Judge held that that was not so.  We could appeal from that decision, but we were not prepared to endure all the expense, all the delay and loss to the revenue that would be involved by litigation, and we propose to make clear here what was undoubtedly the intention of the Oireachtas, and what has not been challenged in England since 1923.  In England an estate has been held to be liable for six years.  A case has actually come before us where a man returned an income of a few hundred pounds per annum, and when he died it was found that he had an estate worth £80,000.  We are going back for six years for income tax. Remember there is no penalty there. If the person is alive he would have to pay a heavy penalty, but no penalty will be taken from the estate, merely the six years' income tax.  Why should people who have paid income tax year by year have to find more money in order that the successors of a man who had £80,000 should get that money undiminished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will read the fourth sub-section of Section 8 of our Act of 1925; to show that the intention of the Oireachtas was that this six years' period should <Col N="1726" /> apply in the case of deceased people as well as in the case of people who are still alive.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the charge of income tax or super tax on the executors or administrators of a deceased person in respect of the profits or gains or income which arose or accrued to him before his death, none of the several acts and things mentioned in the foregoing sub-sections of this section may be done later&mdash;</P>
    <P>These foregoing sub-sections extended the period to six years.</P>
    <P>&mdash;than the end of the third year after the year of assessment in which the deceased person died.</P>
    <P>That is, when a person dies the Revenue Commissioners should make whatever claim they were going to make within three years.  That was the old position.  Whether it was carried out by the section or not the intention of the Oireachtas can be seen.  I am advised that we have a very good chance of winning if we fought this matter in the courts.  Remember that it has been only before a Circuit Court Judge, and that on the one side you had counsel&mdash;cases in the Circuit Court are held <i>in camera</i>&mdash;and on the other side, merely a revenue officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash; No case has been before the High Court; only in the Circuit Court.  It would be ridiculous to have the position that would be there if this was not put right, and if the decision of the Circuit Court Judge was upheld.  It would mean that if a man were alive to-day, who had concealed his income and had not paid the due tax, the revenue could claim six years back, and if they failed <Col N="1727" /> to make an assessment, and if the man died to-night, the Revenue authorities could only claim three years.  That would be an utterly ridiculous position.  It seems only fair and reasonable that the law should be what everybody believed it to be, and as the section shows it was intended it should be.  It was intended to prevent people who hid their income from escaping while other people who had paid their full amount would have to pay again for them.  It seems to me that this is not only justifiable, but is the only fair line to take.  There is no question of any offence being created.  There is no question of any penalty being taken from the man's estate.  If a man is caught to-day, having concealed his income, he will have to pay for six years and a penalty as well.  If he dies before the fraud is discovered all that will be taken is the six years' tax.  I believe there is no injustice in that.  There is no question of anything unconstitutional being done.  In England, where the practice has been going on for two years longer than here, it has not been challenged.</P>

Dealing with the Corporation Profits Tax the sub-section says: &ldquo;... it is hereby declared that the said sub-section shall be construed and have effect and be deemed always to have had effect accordingly.&rdquo;  In respect of the Church Temporalities Fund it says: &ldquo;this section shall be deemed to have come into force on and had effect as on and from the 1st day of April, 1930.&rdquo;  I did not find very much earnestness on the part of those who argued this case on the question of principle that they were being given something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Finance Bill is intended to be a guide to people as to how they will act in the payment of the taxes mentioned therein, and it is well that it should be clear to them what they should do, and what they should pay, because they are dealing <Col N="1729" /> with income tax officials who are very well posted in the law.  We find, as has been already stated in the Dáil and also by Senator Comyn, that what would be an offence after the passing of this Bill was not an offence before that.  I think it is very bad policy on the part of the Government not to encourage people to obey the law as it stands, and if they wish to make any change that the change should only be operative from the time of the passing of the Act.  I have some little experience of the action of the Minister's officials.  I daresay they are doing their duty, but I know that in several cases people have paid what has been demanded of them, and which I am sure was more than they should have paid, rather than incur the risk of having to come to Dublin and defend a case.  I refer especially to widows who are not people who would contest cases of that kind where the amount is not too large.</P>
      <P>It has been stated that a certain amount is being collected by the revenue authorities which they could not obtain if the cases had been contested. The amount has been stated to be £100,000.  Even at that cost, I think it is a mistake to provide for this retrospective legislation, because it will deprive people of the confidence which they have in the law.  It will prevent them from defending themselves from excessive charges because they will know from the precedent which will be established by the passing of this section that even if they succeed in their case it is possible that legislation may be brought forward to reverse the decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which imposes an additional duty on sugar.  I think the Seanad ought not to agree to any section which adds a charge of this nature upon the weekly expenditure of the poorest section of the population.  On previous occasions, both here and in the Dáil, the Minister pointed out that the poorer sections of the community, the poorer farming section of the community, <Col N="1730" /> would not be mulcted very heavily by virtue of this additional sugar tax, because they were too poor to use many sweetmeats or to have more than sugar for their tea.  Therefore, they would not be bearing a heavy tax. To the extent that they do use sugar, they are going to bear a tax which would not have been imposed on them but for the insertion of this section in the Bill.  We have been told that sugar is much cheaper than it was and therefore there is not an additional outgoing from the weekly finances of the housekeeper.  The Minister is trying to ensure that these poor housekeepers are not going to get the benefit of the reduction in prices, and he is imposing an additional tax upon these people, who are too poor to enjoy pleasures that the better-off sections of the community are able to enjoy.  I have no doubt that the answer will come that you cannot discriminate between a tax of this kind borne by the poor and a similar tax borne by the rich.  Undoubtedly that is true.  But here is a commodity which is of universal use, and I think probably used to a much greater extent in the homes of the poor than the Minister will admit. The Minister is throwing this additional burden upon the consumers of that particular article.  It is undoubtedly a tax which is going to be felt most by the poorest section of the community, whether in the towns or in the country districts, and certainly in the towns and I believe also in the country districts the consumption of sugar is larger than the Minister would have us believe.  The figures which have been published indicate a consumption of 6¼ lbs. or 6½ lbs. per week on the average group of five persons.  It may be said that the richer and better-off sections consume more than the average, because the poor consume less.  But the number of people who are poor is greater than those who are rich, and I do not think one would be very far wrong in saying that the average consumption of sugar, even in the homes of the poor, is not much less than from 4 to 5 lbs. per week, and an additional duty of ½d. per lb. will be a very <Col N="1731" /> appreciable addition to the burden which falls upon that family budget. I ask the Seanad to join in protesting against this method of raising revenue, which is to be to a very large extent used for the purpose of relieving the better-off section of the community. On that account I think the House should vote against the section.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of supporting Senator Johnson on this question of imposing an additional tax of a halfpenny per pound on the sugar of the poor.  Senator Johnson spoke of the hardship this would be on the small farmer.  It will be great hardship on the small farmer.  It will mean a little over twopence on the quarter stone of sugar which the farmer's wife sends for to the local shopkeeper when getting her half-pound of tea.  A half-pound of tea and a quarter-stone of sugar&mdash;that is the &ldquo;go.&rdquo;  That means 3d. more to the small farmer's wife.  But I am not thinking particularly of the small farmer's wife, because she has something.  She has eggs, butter, potatoes, turnips, and, perhaps, even a yearling.  But what about the farm labourer's wife who has three or four children?  Where will she get the price of the quarter-stone of sugar?  Where will she get the additional 3d., with the present lack of employment?  I do not like to say very severe things in this House, or elsewhere, but, in my opinion, in the circumstances of the times, and seeing that sugar, with tea, is one of the staple articles of food in the rural districts, I do think this is a barbarous tax.</P>

      <P>This tax, together with the petrol tax, which is mentioned in another section of the Bill, is imposed for the purpose of providing a sum of £750,000 for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  There was a general feeling throughout the country that agriculture required relief.  There is a general view that agriculture is passing through a period of great depression, and that relief is required.  Relief might be given in various ways.  Some of these ways would be theoretically better than this method of relief, by <Col N="1732" /> reduction of rates.  On the other hand, reduction of rates can be made to take effect this year and to reach every farmer.  Despite theoretical disadvantages, we decided that we should proceed to assist agriculture by relief of rates.  It is impossible to provide money for the relief of agriculture without imposing a tax, and I believe that it is impossible to impose a tax without casting, one way or another, some share of the burden upon the poor.  Arguing on other sections of the Bill, members of the other House attempted to prove that the petrol tax was going to be a tremendous burden on the poor.  That, however, was not urged so very far.  If relief of agriculture is really going to encourage production and to enable the farmer to keep going, then the agricultural labourer will get some benefit out of it.  His prospects of employment will be improved.  At all events, if the assistance given the farmers enables them to keep going, the agricultural labourer will be prevented from having worse prospects of employment than he had.</P>
      <P>In choosing sugar as one of the articles for tax, we were influenced by the fact that sugar is exceptionally cheap at the present time.  In any case, we should have had to choose some article of general consumption. You cannot get large sums of revenue out of luxury taxes.  People are always writing to me suggesting luxury taxes, but on examination, you find that twenty luxury taxes would hardly yield £20,000 in revenue.  If revenue is to be obtained, it must be obtained from some article of general consumption. The only thing we can do in these circumstances is not to impose greater burdens on the people than it is possible for them to bear.  It will be remembered that far larger sums than £750,000 were advocated in relief of agriculture.  We felt that if we gave a larger sum than that it would mean imposing wider burdens and introducing many new taxes, with consequent disturbance of the economic balance and the infliction of hardship.</P>

    <P>(4)  The provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duties continued by sub-section (1)  of this section and the duty imposed by sub-section (2) of this section with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 10, sub-section (4).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Whenever it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that any cinematograph film imported into Saorstát Eireann has not been exhibited in public, a drawback equal to the duty paid shall be allowed on the exportation of such cinematograph film, provided such film is exported within ten clear days from the date on which it was imported.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall state the reasons for putting down this recommendation as briefly as possible.  It was put down in the hope that some method might be found to achieve what I have in mind; and the Minister for Finance and his officials know quite well what I have in mind, quite apart from whether the method of carrying it out as proposed by me is the best one or not.  Some time ago an effort was made by a number of persons in Dublin to form a society known as the Dublin Film Society in order to try and bring into this country a number of well-known international films which were not regarded by the ordinary picture-house owner as a commercial proposition.  I shall not waste time by mentioning, at any great length, the names of these films, but I shall mention one or two of them: &ldquo;The Battleship&rdquo;&ldquo;The Mother,&rdquo;&ldquo;The Vision of Joan of Arc,&rdquo; a French film, and several others.  My interest in the matter is not that of a cinema-goer, because I have not been to a picture-house for the past five or six months, and, indeed, I very seldom go.  My interest is international, because I believe it is a distinct loss to a small country like ours that it cannot get films that represent the best of the leading nations.  I see no prospect of getting these films into the country while the position is as it is, unless some kind of concession is given by the Minister for Finance.  The position is this: that if a society were formed it could not expect to have more than 500 members. The cost of the hiring of one of those films, sufficient to make one performance, <Col N="1735" /> would be approximately £20, and the duty upon the same films, assuming that they were not talking films, would be £46.  It is quite obvious that for one performance only, such a rental would be impracticable.  Members would not be prepared, and could not pay sufficiently high fees to have seven or eight performances in a year, which would be approximately what would be required by the society.  I should say when an effort was made to form a society, counsel's opinion was taken, and I may say also that independently I submitted a statement to a leading lawyer, and his opinion was to the effect that if performances were confined wholly to members of the society, and if no money was taken at the door, the performance would be a private performance, and not regarded legally as a public performance.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is that when films are brought in and not exhibited in public, and provided they are sent out again within ten days, the same kind of benefit of drawback should be accorded to them as is accorded to a motor car which is brought into the country, and sent out again, and upon which the duty paid is returned to the owner.  That is my suggestion. Exactly how it is done I do not know. At the present, if you are a member of the film trade you are allowed to bring in a film and show it in private to the members of the trade in bond, and you are allowed, if you do not like it, and if it is not kept for the purpose of exhibition, to send it out again without paying any duty.  But if you are a member of a private film society and want to bring in pictures of the widest international interest you cannot get that concession.  My suggestion is that if a society is formed it should be given the same right as the trade, provided it pays the expenses of the officials of the Ministry of Finance who have to be present to see that matters are properly carried out in bond.  That was the original suggestion of the society, but the Revenue Commissioners rightly, no doubt, thought they could not legally do that.  My object in moving this recommendation is that <Col N="1736" /> the necessary legal powers might be given to that particular society, if formed, or that some concession might be made to the society if an effort is again made to exhibit these pictures. The suggestion I make is that even if the duty is paid by the society, and provided the film is not exhibited in public and is exported within ten days, the duty should be returned.</P>
    <P>I believe there are certain difficulties. I cannot see that if a private film is not exhibited in public there would be any real danger.  A public exhibition is public and if there was anything objectionable proceedings would be taken.  I move the amendment for the reasons I have given.  I promised some time ago on the part of people who were forming a private film society that the next time the Finance Bill was before the Seanad I would raise the matter and so I am only doing my duty.</P>

      <P>I would be very sorry that anybody should be under the impression that what Senator Douglas has said is the unanimous opinion of the Seanad.  I certainly wish to express my strong opposition to the nice little arrangement that has been suggested by Senator Douglas whereby <i>recherché</i> films should come in for nothing, to be seen by the best people. Let the best people who want <i>recherché</i> films pay for them as other people pay.  I want, also, to say that it is very difficult to get past this Seanad with anything that is not fair and above board ordinarily.  <i>Recherché</i> fare for the best people will not do for us, because some of us represent the ordinary people, and if there was nobody else to vote against this kind of thing I would vote against it.  I want to state another objection I have to Senator Douglas's recommendation. It is this.  If it were accepted it would enable gentlemen on the other side of the Irish Sea to send objectionable films over here, and to try them on our people, and in case they were not exhibited to the public to take them back&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They can under certain restrictions and with certain limitations. But this I submit to the Seanad is a most dangerous suggestion.  What about these films?  What kind of films are they?  I call them <i>recherché</i> films for the best people.  The best people are to form themselves into a society, and when they form themselves into a society they are not to be the public. Are they to be private?  I was tempted to use an expression that would not be exactly Parliamentary.  If the poor formed themselves into a society of three or four hundred people they are to be public.  But if the best people formed themselves into a society, no matter whether they be five or six hundred in number, they are not to be public.  I ask the Seanad to consider this recommendation very carefully before they accept it.</P>

      <P>The object of Senator Douglas as described, would, if accepted, require certainly very much more extended and complex legislation than is suggested here, if it were to be effected, and nothing more were to be effected.  If this particular amendment were to become law the position would be this: We would cease to have any picture houses at all, and we would have nothing but picture house owners letting themselves out as private societies, because by labelling themselves as members of societies they would escape altogether the censorship and the tax.  I do not care to mention any particular names, but say if a St. Stephen's Green Film Society and Picture House formed a society and put out a notice saying, &ldquo;Join the St. Stephen's Green Film Society, and see what spicy films we will have next week,&rdquo; we would have film societies formed every day.  I have examined the amendment moved by Senator Douglas in the last three or four days more closely than I examined it at first, and I am satisfied that by it both the censorship and the tax could be largely defeated.  You could have a member of the committee of the society in the booking office.  Anyone could hand in his name and could be given a membership card which would <Col N="1738" /> entitle him to admission for the next week.  If we were to accept this it would be very difficult to carry it out, and it could not be carried out by a simple amendment at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to press the recommendation.  At the same time I am not at all surprised at the attitude of Senator Comyn, but I am rather surprised at the Minister's reference to spicy pictures, because I think he knows very much better the type of film to which I referred. Senator Comyn does not know.  I would not expect that in his attempt to be humorous he would have paid much regard to the facts or to have much appreciation of the type of film I suggested.  I expected to hear from some section of the House that the films were Bolshevik.  I was surprised that we did not hear that.  Some of them may be, but I am of opinion that it is a pity that no way can be found by which the type of films of international interest which I have in mind, and which do not easily reach people, could be made available for a society the majority of whose members are not nearly as rich as Senator Comyn. I say it is a pity, and I urge the Minister to consider whether it may not be possible to make some concession of the kind which I suggest. Otherwise you rule out everything that is not purely and simply a commercial proposition.  I think it is obvious to any reasonable person, that while we have had very good films shown here, the general standard, in spite of the best efforts of the Censor, is not in many cases what we would like it to be.</P>
