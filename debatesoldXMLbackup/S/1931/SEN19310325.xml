      <P>Since we met last week the death has occurred of Lord Glenavy, my immediate predecessor in office and the first Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  His life had been spent in Irish politics opposed to the establishment of an Irish legislature, but at the age of 70, when any man not of exceptional mental calibre and adaptability might well think he had earned his rest, he gave his life a new orientation, completely divorced from his somewhat stormy past, and, as first Chairman of this Assembly, left upon it the impress of his powerful personality in a manner which is fresh in the memory of us all.</P>
      <P>I take it to be the wish of this House that I should express to his family our sympathy with them in their bereavement.  As an indication of their sympathy, I will ask Senators to rise.</P>

      <P>The Second Stage of the Hairdressers Registration Bill, 1931, was fixed for to-day.  It is a Bill entitled an Act to make provision for the registration and control of persons practising hairdressing, and for other purposes relating to the practice of hairdressing and the persons engaged in such practice. Senator Douglas is, unfortunately, ill, but I take it that his amendment is a formal opposition to the Bill.  That being so, it is incumbent on me to fix another day for the Second Reading, and accordingly I shall fix Wednesday, 15th April.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimates have been circulated, and, looking through them, one finds very little sign, if any, of any change of policy, any variation in policy, on the part of the Government respecting industry, commerce, and agriculture from that which has been prevalent within the last few years.  We ought to have some declaration from the Minister as to what the Government is proposing to do to meet the situation that is developing, and that has arisen out of the depression in agriculture, the fall in prices, and the very slow increase in industrial production.  It is important that we should face the fact that there is no general improvement, and it cannot be expected that there will be any general improvement in <Col N="591" /> the economic situation of this country on present lines.</P>
      <P>We ought to have some sign, particularly in the coming year, that the Government is aware of the need for definite action.  Various papers and documents have been circulated, and they are helpful in enabling us to arrive at some appreciation of the economic position.  The &ldquo;Trade Journal&rdquo; issued in February contains a summary of the crop returns for 1929 and 1930, and it also gives the yield of produce of agricultural crops.  The returns do not indicate a state of things agriculturally which would foreshadow anything but a further depression in the general prosperity of the country during the coming year.  We find that as compared with 1929 there was a fall of about 100,000 acres of land under tillage.  What is much more ominous is that owing to the bad season there was a very considerable fall in the yield of produce of various crops.  Only in one case was there any appreciable improvement, and that was with regard to the tonnage of sugar beet as distinct from the sugar content.  There was a very serious decline in the total produce.  In some cases, too, as farmers will tell us, there was a deterioration in quality.  In respect to those things, they could have been counter-balanced if there had been an increase in price, but concurrent with a decline in the tillage area and a decline in yield there has been a fall in price.  So far as I can see, that has not yet been arrested; at least, there is no sign of a rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those three or four facts dealing with a basic industry rather warn us that the amount of wealth available for distribution and expenditure within the country during the coming year will be smaller than it has been. One could look at the situation with a certain amount of equanimity if one could see that there was a steady and rapidly increasing output of industrial wealth.  It is because of the absence of any rapidly increasing output of productive wealth in industry that I think the Government is failing in its duty towards us by not foreshadowing <Col N="592" /> some economic policy which would balance the inevitable fall in agricultural values following upon the weather conditions of last year.  The situation, of course, is much worsened by the fall in prices.</P>
    <P>We have had circulated some figures showing the productive output of industry in 1929 as compared with 1926.  So far as they have gone they undoubtedly show an improvement between those years, but the improvement is so slight and, in the main productive industries, which are of importance to the masses of the people, the development is so slight that it will take a very long time for development in industrial production to recover and to make the balance as between agricultural and industrial production anything like fair or reasonable.  The complaint I have to make is that Ministers, as indicated by the book of Estimates and by their declarations of policy, are not showing that they are aware of the slow development.  They are continuing to hope that by the mere development of private industrial activity and private enterprise in profit-seeking activities the country will eventually arrive at a state of prosperity.</P>
    <P>If one looks at some of the industries that have been fostered, or in regard to which attempts to foster have been made, it will be found that the growth is slow and the rate of overtaking the importation of commodities has been entirely unsatisfactory. We have instances of the boot and shoe trade and the hosiery and clothing trades.  It is not at all hopeful that the slow development of private industries is going to do for these industries and, incidentally, for national prosperity what has been hoped for and expected by exponents, more particularly the chief opponents of the Government, when they relied upon protective tariffs.  I have supported protective tariffs, and I do still support protective tariffs, but I am entirely averse to the notion that by merely increasing the rate of duty you are going to make certain that the industry is going to progress.</P>
    <P>There ought to be some expression from the Minister as to what is the general trend of economic policy.  On <Col N="593" /> what are the Government relying to promote industrial prosperity and how do they propose to meet the decline in wealth production as related to the agricultural industry?  I think the Minister for Finance is with me in this, that agriculture cannot be and ought not to be the sole support of the population.  It ought not to be even the predominating support of the population in the way it has been hitherto if we are to expect a growth in general prosperity and an increase of population.  The development of industrial production is essential, but there is a failure on the part of the Government to indicate what is being done to meet the necessity for a general increase in productive industry.  I merely make these remarks as a preface to something that will have to be said at a later stage.  I want to indicate that we are not satisfied with the economic policy of the Government as indicated by the Vote on Account and the Estimates that have been prepared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the occasions during the year when Senators are allowed to express their opinions about the various Government Departments and about the policy of the Government.  This is one of the occasions when we can criticise, if necessary, such things as seem to afford food for criticism, following an analysis of the Estimates.  I was interested in what the last speaker said with regard to the Government's lack of policy in relation to industry. My views with regard to industrial development are well known to the Seanad.  I think one thing must be admitted.  The policy of the Government has in the main been based upon a price factor; that is to say, they have based their policy on the competitive element that exists in the world to-day and the prices at which industrial productions can be landed in this country.  At the danger of being boring in repetition I want to make it clear&mdash;and I think it cannot be too clearly understood in this country&mdash; that when it comes to a question of industrial production in competition with a mass-producing country we simply are not in the running.  If the Ministerial policy is to be based upon <Col N="594" /> the competitive powers of industrialists in this country as against the competitive powers of industrialists in other countries, then we ought to make up our minds definitely that we cannot possibly compete against big organisations.  We have arrayed against us large trusts and amalgamations of companies with huge outputs. We have either to admit defeat or else attune the policy of the country to an industrialism that we can develop and make economic for the people.</P>
      <P>This question of price is agitating not only us, but many other peoples. We have ample evidence that the price factor is one that has to be considered upon definite lines.  I understand that at the present moment Russian chocolates are being dumped into this country at a price below the sugar content cost.  If that is the case we might have to consider the immediate abandonment of the production of chocolates or other sweetmeats.  We passed a resolution here some time ago.  I think it was a rather foolish resolution, although it was proposed by a distinguished Senator.  That resolution condemned in no unmeasured terms the attitude of Russia. I think it was an absurd and stupid resolution, but nevertheless it was passed by the Seanad.  I suggest it would be much more practicable if, instead of passing pious aspirations as regards the religious outlook in Russia, we made up our minds not to have any Russian products here, whether sweets, oats or anything else that might come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to convey that my attitude towards Russia is any different than it would be towards any other country.  I have as much appreciation of the Russian sociological position as I have of the sociological position of any other country. I want to emphasise that my fundamental economic view is that until this country makes up its mind that its workers ought to be maintained on a decent standard of living, and that we must produce here the goods required for home consumption, there will not be any appreciable national progress.  The alternative is <Col N="595" /> to go on drifting; to go on exporting the remnants of our resources, developing an unemployed population, a population that will be maintained below the ordinary standard of living.</P>
      <P>We have had on various occasions in this House to consider foreign enterprises of various sorts.  We had the question of the foreign control of flour not very long ago, and the Seanad, rightly or wrongly, wisely or unwisely, consciously or unconsciously, rejected the proposal that it was time the Minister responsible for that development should take a hand and see what could be done to protect one of the vital industries of the country.  So far nothing has been done, and from what I can see I do not believe there is much hope of anything being done.</P>
      <P>There was another example of industrial policy given in the recent decision of the Tariff Commission.  There was a majority report, qualified by a minority report, on the subject of a coach-building tariff.  The decision in respect of that tariff is well known to the Seanad.  The general industrial policy of the Government is to sit tight, to let the trade disappear and to let our workers be unemployed.  Speaking as one who has some experience of industrial affairs I want to say that, in spite of the comparison made by Senator Johnson, we are at present going through one of the worst periods that we have ever gone through industrially. We are living in a falling market.  Nobody wants to buy.  There are certain commodities in this country which it is impossible to sell even if you quote them at cost price or below it.  That applies to a very considerable number of commodities. Some of our factories are attempting to carry on, and that state of affairs cannot last long.  I am satisfied that some of our factories are losing a great deal of money, and they are merely preparing the way for closing down. That is all I have to say with regard to the industrial point raised by Senator Johnson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to refer to Section 3 of the Bill, and I want to emphasise that any suggestions I may make will not be made in any carping spirit, but in <Col N="596" /> the hope that those suggestions will be adopted with a view to bringing about better economy in the country.  Section 3 deals with the borrowing powers entrusted to the Minister for Finance in respect of sums that he will require within the amounts stipulated in the Bill.  Can the Minister give us any information with regard to the rates of interest that he will be charged by the Bank of Ireland on these loans?  We know the condition of the financial market; we know at what rate short term loans are available.  We would like to know if, in view of the financially prosperous state of this country, which is so much boosted by bankers and others, we will get any resultant benefit in respect of any loans that may be borrowed by the State.  I need hardly point out to the Minister that we bought money very dearly last year.  We bought money at 93½ per cent., and to-day it stands at 100?. First 5 per cent.  Nationals are 105½ and seconds are 104.  This is a matter for satisfaction with all of us.  I am not speaking on party lines, and I do not think that any party would object to the position which the National Loan occupies on the market.  On the contrary, all parties would rejoice to see the national credit high.  These figures, however, are evidence of buying money dearly.  Our stock at par is gone up five points, and our other stock, Third Nationals, have advanced by over 6½ per cent.  I would like to know that the Minister, in making his financial deals&mdash;money which he is going to borrow&mdash;will be assisted by expressions of opinion in this House. Perhaps he is in a position to give us some indication of what price he will pay the Bank of Ireland for this money.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a matter connected with the Department of Finance.  I wish to call attention to the payment of £216,403 in excess of the Vote under the heading of Gratuities to Army Officers.  The Seanad will remember that I raised this question on the Army Bill and it was suggested to me that it more properly belonged to the Bill we are discussing to-day.  I have read the Minutes of Evidence taken before the <Col N="597" /> Committee of Public Accounts and it seems to me that if the thing were not actually irregular, regulations were certainly strained to a point when the Minister decided that the sum of £216,403 in excess of the Vote should be paid by way of gratuity without allowing any opportunity for the Oireachtas to discuss the matter.  Apparently from the Minutes of Evidence the Department of Finance understood that the money would be voted by way of a Supplementary Estimate, but the extraordinary thing about it is that the Secretary of the Department said that the Minister decided that it would be injudicious or unwise to have this matter submitted as a Supplementary Estimate in the Dáil.  It seems to me that the Minister was acting on that occasion more as a party politician than as the Minister for Finance for the whole State.  I think the attention of the House should be directed to that matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the beet sugar industry, I find in the Estimates that last year the Vote by way of subsidy was £108,334.  The amount for this year is put down at £162,500.  I would like to know if the Government have any jurisdiction over this subsidy. Can they, for instance, ensure that the price given to beet growers will be an economic price?  What is the position if the beet growers refuse to grow any beet?  Has the Minister any power to intervene and withhold the subsidy if the price given to the beet growers is not fair or equitable? Apparently there has been a difference of opinion between the growers and the controlling element in the factory. It was interesting to read in to-day's &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; a letter setting out the comparative position between the beet growing in Ireland and the beet growing in England.  We find that the foreign company operating in Ireland has a total capital liability of £400,000.  During the course of four years' trading it has distributed £350,625 in addition to writing off £167,000 in depreciation and providing liberally for every imaginary contingency.  In view of that and in view of the continued subsidy it seems to me that it is the duty of <Col N="598" /> the Minister and his Department to ensure that a fair economic price should be given to the beet growers by the company.  In view of the refusal on their part to do so there should be a curtailment of the subsidy.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the Vote concerned with Fisheries and Gaeltacht Services.  Has the housing scheme which was passed here in December, 1929, made much progress?  Senators will remember that a sum of £250,000 was voted for housing in the Gaeltacht. I do not know what amount of money has been spent.  I remember there was a good deal of controversy about the Bill and we wanted certain alterations made.  There were many amendments, most of which were defeated. We were under the impression that the work was urgent, and I believe it really is urgent.  I understand that there were 11,000 applications for grants to build houses, improve existing dwellings, or erect out-houses.  In the present condition of things it would be eminently desirable to have this money distributed.  The houses are very badly needed, and if we are to spend the money on housing the sooner it is done the better, because the people require shelter.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the Tariff Commission.  I notice that the Chairman of the Tariff Commission has an allowance of £300.  One of the Commissioners has £1,500, and another has an allowance of £300.  I would like to know if the Commissioner who is paid £1,500 is attached to any other Department or is his whole time devoted to the work of the Tariff Commission.  If he is attached to another Department, will the Minister say what his duties are and what functions he is fulfilling?  Those are the only matters to which I propose to draw attention.  I have raised them here in the hope that we may get some guidance from the Minister.  I trust my suggestions will be accepted as helpful and intelligent suggestions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has no cause for complaint in the two speeches which have been delivered. They have been delivered from a truly national standpoint, and the Minister <Col N="599" /> cannot say that there was any party flavour whatever in the comments and criticisms made.  I hope in the observations which I will make that I will keep in line with the spirit displayed by the last two speakers.  Like Senator Johnson, I sincerely regret that there is no indication of a change of policy on the part of the Government. The Minister must know that the times have changed.  He must know that the months and the years in front of him are likely to be difficult and trying.  He seems to have made no provision to guard against possible dangers&mdash;I hope not evils&mdash;that are ahead.  The farmer who pays for all is in a somewhat worse position than he was in 1914.  As far as I can judge, the prices of the commodities which he sells are about the same, or a little less, than the prices he received in 1914.  The profits of the farmer are much less than they were in 1914.  Speaking in large terms the farmer's income is the only resource of this State; yet there is no curtailment of expenditure.  There seems to be no diminution whatever in the large unproductive expenditure which is represented by this Bill and by other Bills which have passed through the Seanad.  There seems to be no lessening of speed in the race we have been running the last eight or nine years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a little experience of various walks of life in this country, and it seems to me the really productive people are in somewhat the same position as they were in 1879, 1880, and 1881.  Of course I have not the same intimate knowledge of those trying years as I have of the years we have just left behind us, nor had I then the same foresight that I now have.  The feeling amongst the farmers at the moment is, that while they were obliged to pay rack-rents in 1879 and 1880, they are obliged to pay rack taxation in 1931.  I can tell the Minister in all sincerity that we have in the country a seething mass of young men and young women who will be a danger unless employment is found for them.  I speak from wide experience, and I say that in all sincerity.  Two or three days ago I <Col N="600" /> saw in the criminal courts of this city farmers' sons who were tried and convicted for crimes of violence.  As I saw those young men I came to the conclusion that there is only one solution.  Employment must be found for the youth of our country, and it can only be found by a reduction in the unproductive expenditure which is going on.</P>
    <P>In the matter of expenditure we are endeavouring to run parallel with the British Government, the Government of a great Empire.  I suggest to the Minister that he must take a bold course, and take it soon.  He must scale down his expenditure, and the savings which will result from that scaling down must go towards the stopping of the decay in agriculture and the revival of other industry.  I mention agriculture because it is the one industry which is capable of absorbing quickly the greatest number of young people.  I suppose the Minister has heard comments of this description both in public and private, and no doubt he must be weary of them; but I hope that by constant repetition they will have some effect upon his mind.  I do not make these observations from any party point of view, and I do not make them for the purpose of obtaining a party advantage. I am not speaking for the purpose of criticising the Minister.  I am speaking purely from the point of view that, in my judgment, it is absolutely essential that we should cut our coat according to our cloth.  Nobody can deny that the price of the products of agriculture has in the past twelve months gone down by at least 20 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The official returns, comparing the years 1929 and 1930, show that the fall was 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad my friend Senator Johnson has corrected me and I am accepting his figure of 10 per cent.  I am very sceptical about returns. I do not go by returns.  I form my judgment on what I see.  I know the farmers have fed their cattle since last October for nothing and you must remember that the farmer is your main source of income. We are living on a scale that could <Col N="601" /> only be justified if our great industry of agriculture and our other industries were in a highly flourishing condition. In 1879 and 1880 the landlords lived just as the English landlords lived; they ran parallel with the English landlords.  They broke themselves in the process and as the older Senators amongst us know we had the terrible scenes of the Land War. Our Government to-day is collecting more than ever the landlords collected. They are trying to run on lines equal to the British Government.  They are endeavouring to equal the British Government in everything and even to exceed the British Government where possible.  We are working on a grand scale but I may tell the Minister confidently that this thing cannot last.  I have gone to the country and met people and I assure the Minister that the existing condition of things will not last.  Something must be done in order to find employment for the young men and women and I suggest it can only be done by making big savings in our existing extravagant system of administration.</P>

      <P>This is hardly a Bill that one can discuss except in a very general way because to answer many of the relevant points that could be raised would necessitate the attendance of probably most of the Ministers and at the moment that is not practicable. I do not know of any subject on which there are more platitudes talked than on this question of industrial development in Ireland, the finding of employment and the stopping of emigration.  Platitudes are turned out on this question just like sausages out of a machine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not referring to the Senator at all.  We are told what has been an established fact for the last seventy or eighty years, that we are exporting a huge population every year&mdash;the cream of our population; we are told that the country is poor and that unemployment is rife.  All these are well-known facts and our great problem is to find the solution. <Col N="602" /> Senator Connolly, and, I think his Party generally, have one form of solution and that is by erecting a tariff wall which cannot be scaled. They look upon industrial development merely from the view-point of those who have things to sell without any regard whatever to the capacity of the people who have to buy.  The tariff policy of the Government comes under review here.  The Government go upon what they choose to call selective tariffs and I do not know that they have been a very brilliant success.  By some people they are said to have gone too quickly and by others they are said to have gone too slowly. In my opinion the mere imposition of tariffs without constructive action on the part of the Government with a view to seeing that the industries tariffed make effective use of that tariff is a sheer waste of time and simply means an imposition on the public.</P>
      <P>Senator Connolly knows something about the furniture industry.  Before that industry can ever be developed, Irish furniture manufacturers will have to develop some sense of honesty and some sense of the fitness of things.  I think the Senator will agree that there is a general complaint about furniture manufacturers in this country working fresh timber and selling furniture in that condition.  I have Irish furniture in my own house, and I would be ashamed to admit to any foreigner that it was a product of Ireland.  It is cracked and split.  I am living in that house only four years, and the Irish-made doors and windows are falling to pieces, simply because they were constructed of fresh timber.  That is not the fault of the workmen, but it is the fault of the manufacturers.  The Irish manufacturer who sells furniture of the type I have described, and who has the advantage of a tariff of 33? per cent., which was given by the Government to Irish producers, is guilty of a gross act of dishonesty, and is guilty of sabotaging the Irish furniture industry.  Moreover, the finish, except in cases where you pay the most prohibitive prices, is in the main very crude, and is certainly very inartistic.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, I think the Senator's <Col N="603" /> speech is developing more or less into an attack on the furniture trade.  I think I can answer the Senator by stating that, from my experience of the furniture trade in the Free State, he is talking nothing but absolute nonsense both as regards unseasoned timber, and the make, design and finish of Irish furniture.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to put up with that, but I think the sooner some of us see our own shortcomings the better.  There is no virtue in praising up a particular item and trying to shove it over simply because it is Irish.  My aspiration is to make Irish industrialists turn out as good material as can be found in any part of the world and not develop what may be referred to as the inferiority complex.  Let us not place ourselves in the position that because we are Irish we must be prepared to put up with articles manufactured in our own country which are inferior to what is manufactured in other parts of the world.</P>
      <P>With regard to boots, on another occasion I described how I went into a shop belonging to a very big firm of boot and shoe manufacturers and I mentioned that I was anxious to buy a pair of shoes.  I expected that I would be shown nothing but Irish shoes.  I was shown at least six pairs of shoes before I was five minutes in the shop.  I asked if the shoes were of Irish manufacture.  I was told they were not but that if I wanted Irish manufactured shoes I could have them.  It was only then that I was shown Irish manufactured shoes.  The shop I entered was the property of boot and shoe manufacturers who were working behind a tariff.  That shop and I dare say many other shops of a similar type were selling British made shoes because they were evidently making a better profit or were working on a rebate or bonus system of some kind.  That is the way some of our industries are availing of the tariffs that have been put on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe a tariff should never be put on unless there is a condition imposed that the tariff should be utilised to build up the industry for the benefit of the community.  It should be the business of the Government to see to it that proper machinery <Col N="605" /> is installed, that there is a compulsory amalgamation of manufacturing firms and that there is generally the adoption of up-to-date manufacturing and marketing methods; otherwise all you will be doing by imposing a tariff is to protect inefficiency.  As it is you give a greater profit to the manufacturer who takes advantage of the tariff and you get no greater output and very little extra employment.  We know that there are more boots and shoes being imported than was the case before the tariff was imposed.  In some of the tariffed industries while there are more workers there are less wages being paid.  That is an example of how the tariff has worked in the case of certain industries.</P>
    <P>Senator Comyn proposes to solve the unemployment question by cutting down expenditure.  That is one of the most fallacious arguments I have ever heard, yet it is bleated about by newspapers and bankers and people who should know better, down to the common, pot-house politician.  We are told that if our taxation is lower we are bound to have prosperity.  If one follows that statement to its logical conclusion it can be argued that the savage who pays no taxes at all should really be the most prosperous person on earth.  In the countries where you have a high taxation you frequently find the most prosperity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator now quotes Australia as an example to be avoided, but he cannot have it both ways.  We have heard a lot spoken about the farmer.  The Irish farmer seems to be the general handyman for every politician when it comes to making a speech.  I know some shadow ministers who are farmers and who <Col N="606" /> are proposing to teach the farmers what to do; but I must say that they themselves have made a sorry mess of their own farms.  Not only have they not tilled but they have actually advertised for the cutting of the hay they grew.</P>
      <P>We are told that because the price of farm produce has come down everything else should come down in proportion. That suggestion has been made by a lawyer.  Can anybody here say that lawyers' fees have been reduced in proportion to the reduction in the price of agricultural produce?  Those who have experience of the law will probably know that the lawyers' fees have gone up and that it is more expensive to go to law now than ever it was. What is the use of saying that civil servants and the other workers must take smaller wages and that there must be a cut all round when lawyers will fleece the unfortunate farmer to the same tune as when his prices were high?  There is a tremendous amount of hypocrisy in all those speeches and it is hard to stand that.  There are misfortunes in this country to be counteracted, wrongs to be righted and problems to be solved, but these matters are not going to be met by playing the part of the doleful Jeremiah, making things out to be infinitely worse than they are and putting forward preposterous solutions. We have got to have some sense of responsibility and the people of the country as a whole are not being helped by the sort of speeches that are being made both here and throughout the country.</P>
      <P>There are many matters that would come under this Bill in the normal course.  But it is only a Vote on Account and when the Appropriation Bill proper comes before us it will be opportune to raise these matters and to require the attendance of Ministers to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to deal with the last speech except to remark that the Senator's references to Australia were amusing.  It is well known that Australia has been governed for the most part by the <Col N="607" /> Labour Party, which has built up those duties in order to raise wages to an extraordinary extent.  They profited by that up to a short time ago and, finally, the system broke down. It is not to be taken that always and under all circumstances these duties are of advantage.  They must be used properly and not in an extravagant way, as the Labour Party in Australia has used them.  I say that in passing.</P>
      <P>I should like to call the Minister's attention, as I have done before, to certain very contradictory statements made by him.  Some time ago, in the Seanad, I dealt with the taxation of the Free State, according to the Minister's own statement of the relative taxable capacity of Great Britain and the Free State.  The Minister put that taxable capacity at 1.5 to 100.  He made that statement in the Dáil on returning from England, where these matters had been discussed, and, according to him, adjusted.  I pointed out that if the taxable capacity of the Free State and Great Britain was 1.5 to 100, that would reduce our taxation to something like £12,000,000, against the £700,000,000 for which the British have to budget.  When I made these remarks the Minister said&mdash;I made not say incorrectly&mdash;that you cannot judge the taxable capacity of two countries without considering the social services provided by each country to its own population.  That may be a very correct statement in a general way, but shortly after that the Minister goes over to the Dáil and says, &ldquo;You cannot expect as great social advantages in this country as in Great Britain, which is much richer.&rdquo;  In that we are all the more to the bad. Not only are we to the bad as regards the expenditure here, but we are to the bad, if the Minister is correct, as regards the social services rendered. That aggravates the position.  These are statements made by the Minister, and it is he that is responsible for them.  I think the Minister ought not to make statements in one House which contradict statements made in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of duties and protective taxes, they <Col N="608" /> indicate the revolutionary change which is coming in mercantile affairs from the practice in the past.  I believe that every country in the future is going to protect its own manufactures against the hostile incursions of other countries, and that the country that does not do so, but, as Senator Connolly said, allows rich and powerful countries to compare with it internally, will be swept out of competition altogether.  The people will have to leave that country, because there will be no labour for them in agriculture, manufactures, or anything else.  Our country, having already had its population decreased from 7,000,000 to about 4,000,000 or 5,000,000, will suffer a further great sweep, and there will be left merely a few shepherds.  I think you must base the population of a country on its agriculture and what it can produce.  That is to be the standard of each country in the future, as far as possible.  Of course, countries will have to import things that they cannot produce themselves, but when they can produce things themselves they will prevent other people coming in and destroying their factories.  These are all difficult matters, and I do not intend to enlarge on them.  I should like, however, to direct the Minister's attention to the contradictory statement he has made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Moore examines the statements to which he referred, he will find that there is no inconsistency in them.  Senator Johnson complained that the Estimates did not indicate any change of policy on the part of the Government.  If there were a great change of policy, it might not be reflected in the Estimates.  Two financial measures come before the Oireachtas&mdash;the Estimates, which represent expenditure, and the legislation implementing the Budget&mdash;so that there might be changes of policy which would not necessarily appear in the Estimates.  I do not want, however, to go into that question.  I may say this with regard to the policy pursued heretofore, that if it has not been responsible for the fact that this country has, to some extent, escaped <Col N="609" /> the evils which are besetting other countries, at any rate it is true to say that if we had pursued a different policy&mdash;a policy which many people urged upon us&mdash;we might have brought many of these evils down upon us before now.  Everything is not as we would like it to be in the country, but we are certainly much better off than a large number of other countries.  I think it might be said that we have fewer difficulties and less distress than almost any country at the present time.  Even countries which have no great apparent problem of unemployment, like France, have really a more serious problem in that respect&mdash;a problem which does not show itself so plainly because of different conditions and different systems, but which, nevertheless, is very acute and manifests itself more perhaps in partial employment and seriously underpaid employment than in absolute unemployment as in countries like Germany and the United States.  We have not the financial difficulties, present and prospective, that they have in many other countries.  In countries where you had active Government interference in one direction and another, the difficulties are just beginning to accrue.  The policy we have pursued here has not led us into great difficulties, and I believe that the fact that we have carried out our policy in the way we have has been responsible for our escaping some of the acute difficulties and some of the types of acute distress which are experienced elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not refrained from economic activities in many directions. It is unnecessary to go over the list, because it is well known to Senators, but if I were to go over it I could point out the enormous amount of work done for economic development.  We do take the line that it is not for the Government to make the country prosperous; that if we were to try to make the country prosperous by Governmental action, it would mean changes for which no Government in this country would receive a mandate&mdash;extreme changes, political and industrial.  Unless you <Col N="610" /> had very great political changes, you could not successfully have the Government taking a direct part in industry.  Quite recently, we have had debates in the Dáil, and even in the Seanad, which indicated that with the machinery of Government that we have and which, I think, everybody in the country wishes to continue, we could not carry on industry to any great extent except along the ordinarily accepted lines of public utility services.  You cannot carry industry along to any great extent by Government and, therefore, we are driven to have the work of developing the country carried on by private individuals and by private enterprise.  Too much Government interference in that direction is not going to give us very satisfactory results.  Any of us who has observed the effects of efforts which have been made in this direction must be more and more convinced that the role which can be played by Government in this respect is rather limited.  A Government can undoubtedly give assistance and stimulation in a variety of ways, but when a Government goes on to interfere more directly, it is up against great difficulties. A great many people, for instance, have alleged in the past that one of the principal needs of industry in this country was capital.  We had the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act passed to supply capital.  Every care that it was possible to take was taken in connection with the administration of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act. A good deal of money will be lost as the result of the operation of that Act and I am satisfied that we would be really better off if we had not attempted to do anything in that direction at all, because we have been driven to bolster up a lot of lame dogs in industry which it would have been better to let disappear.  One or two industries which have been helped by the Act are tied down by so many restrictions that it would have been better for them to take in partners or make some sacrifice to get capital, as they probably would have been able to do, in other directions.  I give that as an illustration of the extreme difficulties of a Government when it <Col N="611" /> begins to interfere too directly with a view to protecting or developing industry.</P>
    <P>Tariffs are one of the measures that we have employed in this regard. I have no apology to make for the policy that the Government has pursued in respect of tariffs.  I think that we have clearly pursued the correct line.  There were one or two tariffs imposed in the beginning which, I think, ought not to have been imposed; they were mistakes.  But we discovered relatively early all the snags with regard to tariffs.  We discovered the difficulty there is in believing all the claims manufacturers put up when they want a tariff, and the way it is possible to be deceived by people who have much to gain by getting a tariff imposed.  We discovered the extent to which manufacturers who wanted tariffs would go in the way of lobbying&mdash;the trouble they would take, the energy they would put into their efforts, the agitations they would produce for their own benefit, though nominally for the benefit of the country; in many cases the granting of the tariff would, of course, be for the benefit of the country, but primarily it was for the benefit of the group who were endeavouring to obtain the tariff.  We set up our Tariff Commision machinery, and I believe the work of that Tariff Commission has amply justified our action.  Tariffs have been given to many industries.  Other tariffs will be given as the case is made for them, when it seems to be possible to develop the industry concerned, without imposing undue burdens on the general community.  Now, we are urged to take steps to see that those who get tariffs take proper advantage of them. I think we cannot do that.  The administrative difficulties involved there would be such as could not be overcome.  We have been urged to regulate prices that might be charged by those who have control of tariffed industries.  My view is that it is best to make the tariff only so high as will enable the industry to fight its way upward, and that will leave no great room for overcharging.  If we try to regulate prices we will hamper manufacturers, <Col N="612" /> and impose so many new burdens of one kind or another on them that the effect of the tariff will be lost and administrative expenses will go up.  The only thing that can be done is to put the tariff at a right level and allow whatever prospects of extra profits that tariff may give the manufacturer to be the incentive.</P>
    <P>As to compulsory rationalisation of industry, all sorts of difficulties exist. There is, undoubtedly, room in many directions for rationalisation of industries, for the combination of factories, or for one factory taking a particular end of industry and another taking the other end.  I think, again, that those must be left with a certain amount of encouragement to the owners to carry out.  If it is attempted by the State, you will have compensation all round.  You will have workers put on pension, because it will be urged that they were thrown out of employment by Government interference.  You will have manufacturing owners claiming compensation in all directions, and you will have an expensive and badly-done job, because pressure may be put on which will cause action to be taken precipitately and so on.  Generally, in the matter of tariffs, I think there is really nothing to be done except put the tariffs on and allow effects to manifest themselves.</P>
    <P>If there is any gross abuse, if there is a setting up of a monopoly or undue raising of prices&mdash;in an exceptional case of that kind the Government might take action.  But so far as general policy is concerned, there is nothing to be done except pursue the course that has been adopted, and adjust it as circumstances may require or opportunity offer.  We have never set out on a five, ten, or fifteen years plan.  We have never attempted to say: &ldquo;We are going to do this thing this year and some other thing next year.&rdquo;  As opportunity offers, we have been prepared to adjust our policy to suit.  We did not say, three years before the proposal for the Shannon Scheme was offered, that we were going to have a great scheme of hydroelectric development.  What happened was: proposals were made for hydroelectric development; we had them examined and we decided to go ahead <Col N="613" /> with them.  I think that is the only policy that can be pursued.  We may think that certain services are beneficial or necessary to the community, but yet if there were a change in prices sufficient to justify us, we might conclude that those services, in the new circumstances, were no longer necessary, or, at any rate, that the benefit obtainable from them would not be commensurate with the cost.</P>
    <P>With reference to the remarks by Senator Comyn, I should like to say, as I said in the Dáil, that remarks such as these make no impression at all on me.  They seem to me not to be really characterised by complete sincerity, because the question of reducing expenditure really resolves itself into curtailment of services, and my experience has been that practically all round the demand is not for curtailment of services, but for increase of services.  Individual Deputies and Senators may be in favour of curtailment of services, but they are a minority.  The general demand is: &ldquo;We want more services; we want the State to interfere in new directions and to undertake new tasks.&rdquo;  I do not think that that is unnatural.  To some extent, I think it is inevitable because of the circumstances of the times.  The economic structure of the world is becoming more complex and, because of that increasing complexity, there is, broadly speaking, a need for gradual increase of State activity.  I see no way out of that.  At the same time, the question of reducing expenditure in any particular State resolves itself into a question of curtailing services in that State.  You may save in certain directions, as we saved in the case of the Civil Service owing to the reduction of the bonus consequent on the fall in prices.  As prices go down there may be savings in other directions, but the area of total expenditure that they will cover will not be so large as some Deputies and Senators talk about, and talk about in a sort of tub-thumping way and not in a way that would make a serious contribution to any problems we have to face.</P>

      <P>Senator Connolly dealt with a number of questions which I need hardly go into, because, as Senator O'Farrell pointed out, this is a Central Fund Bill and not an Appropriation Bill.  There is no reference to any particular vote in the Bill before the Seanad, and it is when the Appropriation Bill is before the House that the questions to which Senator Connolly refers would probably arise.  I should like to say a few words, however, regarding one point raised&mdash;the subsidy on sugar beet.  That is a question between the factory and the growers.  When the factory was being established, the Government was very strongly of the view that they should not have shares in it.  There was a proposal that the Government should take shares in the factory.  We said we did not want to have shares or to be party to any dispute or negotiations between growers and factory regarding the question of price.  If the farmers do not grow beet, the factory cannot work.  If a small area of beet is grown, the factory will have to work with its overhead expenses greatly increased and, with that small quantity of beet, cannot make any profits. On the other hand, if the price offered by the factory is one which will really pay the growers, then they will lose if they refrain from growing. I think that we could never hope to have an industry establish itself on the basis that the Government was going to interfere to fix prices.  The prices will have to be fixed by the two sides weighing up the advantages&mdash;the farmers weighing up their position if they decide not to grow and the factory weighing up its position if it takes the risk that the farmers will not grow, or only grow an insufficient quantity of beet. No other position is possible.  The Government's obligation is to pay a subsidy when sugar is manufactured. If there is no sugar manufactured, there is no subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connolly, I think, advocated something like wholesale tariffs. At any rate, he referred to the fact that we could not compete with huge organisations elsewhere, and he <Col N="615" /> seemed to me to propose that we should have tariffs on everything.  I think the answer to that is that there are many industries here for which, taking everything into account, conditions are relatively suitable.  It may not be possible in some of them to compete with firms outside, but in others, with some initial assistance, it should be possible to compete, and in still others, it should be possible to continue with some relatively small preference in the way of a tariff.  Whatever one may think of tariffs in the abstract, the position at the moment is that the farmer cannot be protected.  Nothing can be done that will improve the prices he gets. If tariffs are put on which put up the cost of living on him, then those tariffs are a direct injury, and it becomes a question, in the case of every tariff, of trying to ascertain and weigh the advantages and disadvantages. The Senator said that we should decide to have no Russian products imported here.  It is easy to say that.  Would he decide to have nothing produced in any part of the Saorstát exported to Russia?</P>

      <P>I want to put a question to the Minister regarding the working of the Poor Law Relief Act. The point I desire to have elucidated is with regard to the activities of the Department in respect of the provision of relief in the case of persons receiving National Health Insurance benefit.  It is the law that Guardians shall not take into account any moneys received by the applicant under the heading of National Health Insurance benefit, provided such benefit does not exceed 7s. 6d. per week.  I am informed that it is becoming the practice&mdash;if it has not been established as the practice&mdash; in Dublin for the guardians to take no notice of that provision of the National Health Insurance Act, and, in fact, to take into account the amount of benefit being received under that Act by sick persons.  I think the position of the Minister, and our position in regard to this Bill, preclude me from going into the details of local administration. But it is opportune and right that I should try to find out from the Minister whether his Department has indicated to the Guardians and Boards of Assistance throughout the country, by any regulation or order, that this provision of the National Health Insurance Act should not operate, and, if not, will he state here, for the benefit of those concerned, that this is the law and must be obeyed by the people con cerned in the administration of poor law relief?  The provision I refer to is <Col N="617" /> in the Schedule to the National Health Insurance Act, 1920, and it is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the granting of outdoor relief to a person in receipt of, or entitled to receive, any benefit from this Act, the Board of Guardians shall not take into consideration any such benefits except in so far as such benefits exceed 7/6 per week.</P>
      <P>If I am rightly informed, the Guardians in Dublin, and perhaps boards elsewhere, are taking this National Health Insurance benefit into account and thus clearly disobeying the law.  It is obviously the right of the applicant to require that such law is obeyed.  I am sure the Minister will inform the House and, through the House, the Guardians and the public whether or not there has been anything done by his Department to indicate to the Guardians that this law is inoperative or that it should in any way be suspended.  That is the sole purpose of my intervention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The law referred to by Senator Johnson is operative and, in my opinion, is properly operative. It is provided for under Section 109 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1911, as amended by the Schedule which the Senator has referred to, that Boards of Guardians, in granting outdoor relief, are not to take into consideration the amount received by the person applying for relief under the National Health Insurance Act in so far as that sum exceeds 7s. 6d. per week.  Firstly, I should like to say that no regulation suggesting that that law should in any way be evaded, has been issued by my Department, and I would be very much surprised to know that the Guardians in Dublin would inadvertently, or after their attention had been drawn to the matter, endeavour to evade that law.  I have had no approach from any injured party in the matter suggesting that they had been unable to obtain redress from Guardians.  I should not like to be brought into the matter until the Dublin Union Committee has received the complaint directly and has had an opportunity of considering it. <Col N="618" /> The position of the Minister for Local Government is that he keeps as far away as possible from interference with the discretion of the poor law authorities in dealing with outdoor relief.  That is the position and I hesitate to think that the law is being offended against in the City of Dublin.  There may be cases in which relief has been refused where persons have been in receipt of National Health Insurance benefit but in those cases there may have been other factors as well.</P>
      <P>I think Senators may be assured that that is the law, that the Dublin Union authorities are hardly ignorant of the fact that it is the law, and that if there be any misunderstanding as to the law being offended against, if the matter is brought to the notice of the Dublin Union authorities, I feel sure they will bow to the law and bow willingly.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad views with concern the growing want of harmony between the Department of Local Government and Public Health and the various local bodies, and, in the belief that the cause lies in the method of financial control, requests the Executive Council to institute an inquiry into the procedure by which grants in aid of rates are allocated.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judging from a source of information <Col N="622" /> that is not very reliable&mdash;I mean that is always reliable&mdash;the public Press, I understand that a certain element of heat is expected in this debate.  In fact, I met a prominent Deputy the other day after I had tabled this motion and he said that he had heard that I had a motion down which amounted to a vote of censure on the Minister.  Senators can read the motion for themselves.  I cannot read into it anything in the nature of a vote of censure.  I suggest that it is a plain and a very innocent motion, although I hope to show that it does involve some very fundamental and important points of principle.  As regards my information, I am under a handicap.  I have not the inner knowledge the Minister possesses, and I have to go largely by what I hear and read.  I do claim that it is common knowledge that there is a very considerable element of friction&mdash;or perhaps I should say, in the words of the motion, &ldquo;want of harmony&rdquo;&mdash;between the central authority and the local authorities.  I shall develop in detail the instances upon which I rely. I will only mention now cases that are common knowledge which have arisen in County Wexford, County Carlow, County Galway, County Mayo and King's County.  As one illustration, taken at random, I would quote the words uttered by the Chairman of the County Council of Wexford, who was once a respected member of the Dáil. He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>He did not know what was the idea of electing councils at all. They came there to do the business of the people and he did not understand why they should be overruled by the Department.  The whole thing is a farce.  The County Council might as well not be in existence.</P>
    <P>I do not dwell further on that point except to claim that there is a lack of harmony manifested and I suggest that that in itself is to be deplored. We do not expect harmony in all relations in life.  We do not expect harmony, possibly, between the law and the criminal.  I do not think that we can expect harmony between a Government and an Opposition. <Col N="623" /> but I think we have every right to expect harmony between two bodies in the relationship of central and local authority.  They should be working on parallel lines to a common object and be in no way concerned with questions of policy which create conflict.  I claim that you might apply the ordinary business test in this case&mdash;that where harmony does not exist things are wrong.  The rough-and-ready method in business, if you do not get harmony, is to hold your manager responsible.  There is a lack of tact and the aim is to get a man who will have smooth relations with the others and who can eliminate internal friction.  It is this element of internal friction that I think is so bad and so unwholesome between two services like the central and the local authority.  It is our duty to take cognisance of this fact and to try to provide a remedy.</P>
    <P>Turning to the cases where there is a lack of harmony, I take the County Wexford.  I hope it will be clearly understood that I do not want to involve the Seanad in a discussion as to the merits or demerits of any of these cases.  I am merely giving them as illustrating certain conclusions that I wish to draw, and as giving me a basis for certain remedies that I wish to suggest.  You have the case in the County Wexford of elected councillors, with whatever mandate you like, saying, &ldquo;We can only afford £40,000 for roads.&rdquo;  The Department say, &ldquo;Unless you strike a rate to give £50,000, we will not give you a grant of £10,000, because we do not think that £40,000 will provide adequately for the service.&rdquo;  In the same way, we have the appointment by mandate of a medical officer.  The appointment was made by mandate and there was a further mandate that the council was to accept the scheme put up by the medical officer, it being implicit in the appointment that his schemes were also to be accepted.  The Council protested against that attitude.</P>
    <P>In Carlow, we have some medical services imposed, and in retaliation, scholarships extinguished.  There is a sort of vendetta between the two <Col N="624" /> bodies.  I suggest that that position is not right.  In the case of Galway, the salary of the County Secretary was imposed on the Council.  I speak under correction, but I think the local authority wanted to give the man £600, and the central authority said, &ldquo;You must pay him £800.&rdquo;  I am not going to suggest whether or not a man could be got at £600.  You can draw your own conclusions.  You have then the case of the Mayo library.  I am not going to get you involved in that except to remind you that leading members of the laity and hierarchy and other distinguished people, resigned in protest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister allow me to put the matter in my own way?  I think I am entitled to say that considerable lack of harmony was engendered in connection with the Mayo question.  I am not going any further into the question than that.  I am not going into the rights and wrongs of it.  It is only an illustration of the main point in my motion that there is lack of harmony between the central body and the local authority, which lack of harmony this House should take notice of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Passing from that, I wish to ask the House to examine the action of the local authorities under two heads &mdash;firstly, under their statutory obligations and, secondly, under their non-statutory obligations.  I know perfectly well that statutory obligations rest upon the Minister.  The law has set up an Appointments Commission, and much as anybody <Col N="625" /> may think that the law is not exactly right, nevertheless it is the law.  But if the law creates fundamental elements of discord throughout the country the amendment of the law should be considered.  I admit, absolutely&mdash;I am sure the House will admit too&mdash;that as long as the law is there it must be enforced by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>As regards medical services, the same thing arises, but not in such a positive form.  The Local Government Act of 1925 makes it mandatory on the county council to appoint local officers when called upon.  I understand that it rests with the Minister to choose the time when these appointments should be insisted upon.  In some cases, councils have not been called upon yet to make these appointments. In cases where they have been called upon, I think you will agree that there has been a considerable amount of protest.  Whether or not the Minister was wise in forcing these appointments in some cases where he has done so, remains for the House to say.  I do not think he was.</P>
    <P>There are then non-statutory obligations. One of these obligations is in respect of salaries.  I stand on the principle that wider discretion should be allowed to the local authority in the matter of salaries.  It will be said, &ldquo;You cannot get good men for less.&rdquo; As long as county councils are elected and given responsibility, they should be given a wider margin of discretion as regards the salaries they are to pay and the salaries that they think they can afford to pay.  These people, rightly or wrongly&mdash;I am not going into the matter&mdash;believe that they cannot afford to pay these salaries, and that they can get equally good men for lower salaries.  As regards roads, surely councils should be allowed to say what sums they can afford for this work, and surely grants should not be used as a lever to force them to impose higher rates than they, as responsible, elected bodies, wish to impose.  May I go back for just one moment to the origin of this local government system?  The origin of the local government idea was that people with local knowledge should be elected on a wide, local franchise to <Col N="626" /> accept the responsibility for local administration.  For many years that was undoubtedly the predominant factor in the local government structure. They had special knowledge not only of local conditions, but of the paying power of the ratepayers, and, rightly or wrongly, they were entrusted with that responsibility.</P>
    <P>As time went on, it because necessary to direct and co-ordinate to an increasing extent the functions of the local authorities.  It also became clear that certain services ceased to carry a purely local complexion and became national.  From that emerged grants-in-aid, with corresponding conditions attached. I think now that the whole balance has shifted to the other side and that these local bodies have become almost instruments or creatures of the central body, with very little power, little or no responsibility, with their functions and powers almost limited to signing as directed on the dotted line.  I do not think that we realise how we have altogether departed from our original idea and got into that reversed state.  When we come to examine the motion, we will find, I think, that it has a very distinct bearing on that fact.</P>
    <P>These grants-in-aid were originally permissive and they were given for the purpose of efficiency.  They were given on an understanding that the local body would pay half the salaries of certain doctors or midwives or in relation to certain specified services. As time went on the original purpose was lost sight of and these grants became general.  They are now, in effect, almost entirely general with the exception of certain grants in relation to medical services.  The report of the Poor Law Commission sets out that these grants have now become almost general in character.  In relation to these grants I should like to quote the evidence given by one witness.  That witness stated that it is open to some doubt if the method of allocation is equitable to-day having regard to the time that has elapsed and the varying needs of the local authorities assisted. We have gradually grown into the system where the grants are used as a <Col N="627" /> lever to force the local authorities to strike rates or, even further, where the grants are used almost as a penal instrument to extract rates.  I do not think that can be justified in equity or in accordance with the original purpose.  It is no argument because you pick a man's pocket to say to him that you will give him twice as much back to spend on a service of which you approve.  Just as that man is a free citizen so also the local authority is a freely elected body and it should be allowed discretion to spend the money it raises in rates.  These grants should not take the form of something like a sugared pill.</P>
    <P>I will now pass to an examination of the differences of mentality which have produced this lack of close association and harmony between the central authority and the local authority.  I may say that I have full sympathy with both points of view.  The members of a local authority are naturally in touch with the feeling in their respective districts.  The civil servant, on the other hand, who is attached to the central authority, quite naturally regards efficiency, progress, and better management in a totally different light from that of the member of the local authority.  With the official in the central authority progress appears to be placed on a pedestal; it is the be-all and end-all of his existence.  The very fact that he may possess a superior education gives him a superior point of view in regard to these matters.  Living in an atmosphere of science and higher thought, one begins to say of the members of local authorities: &ldquo;Those people should not be like that; they should not have this obstinate and crass resistance to progress. We know what is good for them far better than they do themselves. We know that they are living on a volcano, as it were, without modern sewers, sanitation or water supplies.  They are content to have their drains and cess-pools, but we consider that that sort of thing should stop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Roughly speaking, that is the attitude of the advisers of the central authority.  I do not blame them.  They <Col N="628" /> have been educated and they read text-books; they can use long words and, naturally, they are quite irksome of the slow and rather stubborn mentality of the countryman who is quite content to let well alone.  I can recollect one councillor saying: &ldquo;It is too healthy we are; leave us alone.&rdquo;  I am forcibly reminded in this connection of the words of a Conservative and an honest man.  It was Lord Salisbury who said: &ldquo;According to the doctors nothing is wholesome; according to the clergymen nothing is right; according to the soldier nothing is safe.  They all want to be diluted with a strong admixture of commonsense.&rdquo; I think that could well be applied to a lot of those people who pour out these theories from public offices.</P>
    <P>The outlook of the local man is something quite different to that of the man attached to a central department. The local men are elected on their own councils and they do not want to spend money.  Sometimes, perhaps, they have got a mediæval mentality, but I do not say they are wrong because of that.  They merely want to be left alone and to go ahead in their own peculiar way.  They possess the local knowledge and, moreover, they have a pretty shrewd understanding that all these things mean expense and that they are very hard pressed.  The ordinary farmer who is struggling to make ends meet, who has to pay rates and annuities and who is hard put to it to give his children a little money when they marry, has his own particular viewpoint on local matters.  His attitude towards all these reforms is totally different to that adopted by the official of the central authority.  I do not think we can properly realise these two extremes and the danger there is in the superior person with the higher training and with his zeal for progress imposing forcibly his views upon these plainer and more unsophisticated people.</P>
    <P>Who is right?  I am not prepared to say who is right.  He would be a brave man indeed who would say which attitude is the right attitude. I might suggest that neither attitude <Col N="629" /> is right.  What are the tests to be applied?  Is progress to be a test; is it the aim and object to have very advanced medical services, to have the most up-to-date sanitation, or is it right to be free and happy, to be allowed to live your own life in your own way according to your local traditions?  I am not going to say which attitude is right; I am not going to say where real wisdom lies.  I do say that right lies in liberty of choice; right is to let the people themselves decide and that is what we are getting away from more and more.  We are allowing the civil servant to decide.  The civil servants put on these schemes.  We are getting to the position now where a civil servant may be added to those who claim as their prerogative power without responsibility.  It is a real danger that more and more as Government becomes centralised the wishes of the smaller people become overlooked and real happiness is being lost.  Real happiness is liberty; it is not materialism. Do not imagine that the five years' plan in Russia has brought about real happiness.  Real happiness is to be allowed to do within very wide limits what one would like.  Progress is undoubtedly desirable, but progress must come from below.</P>
    <P>When the locally elected representatives of the people demand progress I would be prepared to give them all the progress they want.  If they demand it let them have all the sanitation reforms and doctors that they want, and let them pay as much as they like. It is for them to decide, and not for the theorists or those in the positions higher up.  That is the fundamental point where I join issue with the present tendency.  Assuming that that basic idea is right&mdash;that the people should decide&mdash;how are we going to apply that in practice to our present structure of local government?  I suggest it can be done by dividing functions as far as possible and by creating a unified responsibility.</P>
    <P>A large sum of money comes to these councils in the way of grants&mdash;about one-third.  There are nine millions spent by the local authorities in various ways, and about one-third of that <Col N="630" /> amount is provided by grants in various forms.  Would it not be possible for the State to take over certain services completely, say, main roads or mental hospitals, and run them as State services?  With regard to the roads, the the actual work could be done by the county surveyor and his staff, but it would be paid for entirely out of grants.  The people could then have as good roads as they liked.  In the same way let the bye-roads be left to the local authority.  If they want bad bye-roads, let them have them.  I do not suggest that they would be stupid enough to have bad bye-roads.  They will be in a position to decide the type of road they require, and they will not be subject to the suggestions of the man higher up who, whatever academic qualifications he might possess, might say: &ldquo;I know better than you what sort of road you ought to have.&rdquo;  By a more equitable distribution of those grants you could get over a lot of your existing difficulties. Of course it is quite possible abuses would have to be checked.  I hope the Minister will not suggest that I am advocating unlicensed liberty for the local authorities.  They want a watchful eye kept upon them, and wherever definite action is necessary it should be taken.  I was glad to see that definite action was taken the other day in the criminal courts.  That is the type of definite action which is quite understandable.</P>
    <P>With regard to the re-allocation of the grants, I have here the evidence given by the Secretary to the Local Government Department, Mr. McCarron. He said, in reply to the Chairman: &ldquo;I think you have had evidence of the purpose of all these grants.  Anyone who goes into it will see that they no longer have any definite aims.  They present no character other than the simple one of being a subvention from the taxpayers to the ratepayers.&rdquo;  The Chairman asked: &ldquo;I agree with you, but still the fact that they are earmarked for a particular expenditure does in itself create a certain amount of trouble in the return and checking of forms that possibly might be done without?&rdquo; Mr. McCarron replied: &ldquo;Certainly, <Col N="631" /> and ought to be done without.  It is, unfortunately, a meaningless process which is a waste of time and an irritation to everybody.&rdquo;  In another place Mr. McCarron says: &ldquo;I would be prepared with anyone to resist any encroachment on our existing public grants, but what I want is a better allocation of them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps I will be allowed to read an extract from the Minority Report of the Poor Law Commission:</P>
    <P>I realise that the grants in aid of rates from the Central Fund justify some measure of regulation and control.  The central authority might well refuse to assist local councils unconditionally, yet I consider the objections to divided control so strong that means should be sought to obtain the fullest possible degree of financial separation.  This might be done by making certain services representing the total of existing grants entirely State services, and allowing the remaining services to be entirely local services. This would entail an examination of the entire field of local expenditure which was not within our terms of reference, and I recommend the enquiry to be carried out.</P>
    <P>Those were the words I wrote five years ago.  I had forgotten all about them until a few days ago, but they read to me as fresh to-day as they did five years ago.  I still absolutely believe that that is the right method of procedure.  If the House accepts that as a general principle the whole matter can be carried out by way of inquiry.  Of course it involves a difficult, detailed and complex examination of the whole thing.  It is the sort of inquiry that I ask the House to claim&mdash;an inquiry into the allocation of grants so that they may be more equitably divided.</P>
    <P>There are certain services that could become entirely central services and that could be paid for out of grants, and then there are services that should remain local services.  It is by investigating the whole matter in the manner I suggest that you will recapture <Col N="632" /> the harmony and the goodwill which are now badly lacking between the local and the central authorities. It is unwholesome that such conditions should exist between two important services in the State.  The House may wish something different; Senators may wish a centralisation of all services. It may be that the people in the country also may wish to abolish in effect all local councils and centralise all administration.  If that is the general view, then by all means let that be done, but the all-important question is to eliminate as far as possible bickering and bad feeling, because any lack of harmony is really bad for the country as a whole and for the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>There are really two sections in the motion.  The first is a criticism of central control of finance, and the second is a plea for the revision of grants in aid of rates.  That is a plea which has been made several times in this House. I find myself at variance with the first section of the motion.  From my own personal experience, and judging by what I have read in the papers, I believe that local bodies in this country, as at present constituted, are an extravagant form of government. Although I do not quarrel with the principles of democracy, I think that in certain countries and under certain circumstances their development must be somewhat slower than is their development in other places.  I believe that applies to this country.  I have had at least two years' experience as a member of a local authority.  Speaking generally, under our system of local government representatives are elected to positions in which they are responsible for the control and the administration of public funds.  Very many councillors have been elected without any regard whatsoever to their general <Col N="633" /> experience in the handling and distribution of money, and without any regard for their experience in the important matter of local administration. Indeed, there are instances where councillors are elected without any thought of their educational qualifications.</P>
      <P>I believe that if it were not for this system of central control of finance there would in many instances be a regular orgy of expenditure.  Senator Sir John Keane has given us an instance of control by a central authority in one county.  In another county I have witnessed a humorous episode in relation to the division of the road estimate between new works and maintenance.  I have seen the rate increased to two shillings and following that I have seen excited councillors anxious to ask the Minister to allow them to revise the rates.  Finally, I have seen where it was suggested that new works should be constructed out of the maintenance fund.  The result of the whole thing was that the roads were a mass of pot holes and it was almost impossible to travel over them.  I have seen estimates passed in three minutes and I have also witnessed a two hours' haggle over the salary of a subordinate clerk.  I really believe that some sort of central control is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to appointments, Senator Sir John Keane mentioned that the local people should have the making of their own appointments. The Appointments Commissioners were brought in because it was found that in the case of local appointments there was a great deal of local influence brought to bear and the system of parochialism was too prevalent in the country.  I believe one of our greatest drawbacks is the parochial idea that the county man should have the county appointment.  The fact of the matter is that this country is really composed of twenty-six states and not one State.  This system of division is not to the advantage of the country.  If we want to avoid friction we must have a very large measure of central control.  Lately we have had <Col N="634" /> indications that I am not the only person who thinks on these lines.  I think a great number of the public are beginning to remember Disraeli's famous warning that with the establishment of democracy you will have an increase in public burdens; you will have great impatience with public burdens and you will have a great increase in the cost of administration. I think it is a fact that wherever we have departed from the extreme of democracy there has been a reduction in the cost of administration to the public advantage.</P>
    <P>With the second part of Senator Sir John Keane's motion I entirely agree. Let us take County Mayo as an example.  There, on the basis of the population, you have one person to seven acres of land, and relief is given at the rate of 1/9.  There are vast areas in the county that cannot be dug with a spade and cannot be cultivated. In the case of County Meath, you have one person to ten acres of vastly different land, and yet the relief given in County Meath is at the rate of 6/8. That the people in Meath should be relieved to the extent of 6/8 surely looks like administration very much to the advantage of the man with the larger area of richer land.  In the West of Ireland we see this inequality very much reflected in the existing condition of things.  In many areas hospitals are required, and in a good many places water and sewerage schemes are badly needed.  There are many small holdings which are not economic and which are in consequence non-productive units of the State.  Such places as Mayo require a very large measure of relief.  As I have intimated on other occasions, I think the scale should be weighted in favour of these areas rather than weighted against them.  Senator Sir John Keane stated that the Commission reported upon this question in 1927.  Only last summer a frank admission was made by a responsible Minister in this House when he said there was a want of logic in the distribution of grants.  Whatever the reason may be, I think it is a matter for regret that so important a matter <Col N="635" /> as this should be allowed to remain uninvestigated.</P>

      <P>The Senator has deplored the quality of representatives elected to local authorities.  I cannot understand why such a deplorable type of councillor should be elected on a local government franchise, and, presumably, such a superior type of person should be elected on a parliamentary franchise.  That is absolutely beyond me.  If anything, I think the local government franchise is more restricted.  I cannot understand if the Dáil, for instance, is fit to do its business, why the people similarly elected on local authorities are not fit to do their business.</P>

      <P>My position here is that I come in order to be of assistance to the Seanad in making up its mind on any matter that might be put before it, but the limited extent of this discussion would seem to relieve me of any responsibility in dealing with this particular matter here.  I feel that the Seanad does not want my assistance in order to make up its mind as to what it should say to this resolution.  If harmony as between the Department of Local Government and Public Health and local bodies is what is sought, I think I should finish now, because in so far as any question has been raised with regard to the financing of local bodies&mdash;whether that should be continued as it is now; whether a rearrangement should take place of one kind or another, or whether the State should take over and centralise certain services&mdash;I think Senators must be aware that, if not all, at any rate very considerable aspects of that question have been under review by the Commission which has come to be known as the De-rating Commission.  I do not know whether it is seriously suggested by Senator Sir John Keane, and the seconder of his motion, that the Executive Council should now set up another Committee to examine into this question of the re-allocation of such grants as local bodies have or the taking over of certain services or, as is certainly implied, the <Col N="636" /> provision of more money from central funds.  Senator Sir John Keane shakes his head.  How we are to overcome the inequalities that Senator the McGillycuddy of the Reeks suggests exist between Mayo and Meath without taking some money from the farmers of Meath, who to-day appear to want a lot more, and sending it to Mayo, or providing further moneys from the Central Fund for making up in Mayo the inequalities that are said to exist, I do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure as far as existing grants are allocated is, that there are definite moneys allocated by statute in a definite way to particular local bodies, and most of them have arisen out of historical circumstances.  I am not concerned with the history of local government; I am concerned with the local government problems of to-day, and I do not know how the latter part of the motion connects itself with the first part of the motion, because, as far as any of the statutory grants paid over to local authorities are concerned, they go in automatically.  They may be, because of the way they are segregated into excise and licence duty grants, applicable to particular services.  There may be some little extra pen and paper work done in the offices; but I do not see how it affects the spirit of harmony or anything like that between local bodies and the central authority.  In so far as there were injustices of any particular kind, and in so far as these were intra-county, they have been wiped out by our legislation.</P>
      <P>As far as there is any confusion in the matter of allocating them, that has been reduced considerably by reason of the fact that these grants are now applicable to the county health area. In so far as there are other grants-in-aid, they are 50 per cent. grants-in-aid towards maternity, child welfare, school meals, tuberculosis, and matters of that kind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Road Fund is a very different matter.  The Senator attempts to make a great case that the Department of Local Government squeezes expenditure out of local authorities by threatening to withhold their grants.  He makes the whole of that case, as far as I can see, on the Road Fund.  The position with regard to the expenditure from the Road Fund is that we pay 40 per cent. of the total cost of the maintenance of main roads and that we apply whatever else is available to improvements.  I do not know of any better way of administering the Road Fund than that.</P>

      <P>I think that we could dig up a lawyer who would argue that we could give grants from the Road Fund towards the maintenance of the roads by the county councils without breaking the law to which the Senator alludes.  I see no confusion in the present method of administering the grants that we give to local bodies. The Senator quotes the opinion of a civil servant that it is confusing.  There may be a certain amount of confusion in it, but from the point of view of the Civil Service and the point of view of the Minister, it is much simpler to leave things as they are than to attempt to tackle the problem of taking money from Meath to send to Mayo, or of raising extra taxation to fill in the crevices that were left by the circumstances of other times.  I do not understand to what the figures of the <Col N="638" /> McGillycuddy of the Reeks relate.  I do not know that the injustices are so great at all.

The Senator suggests that a great deal more is known about Government Departments than can be proved and he asks us to consider that there is friction and want of harmony between the Department of Local Government and local bodies.  The Department deals with about 400 local bodies, great and small.  He asks us to believe that friction exists and want of harmony exists because the Chairman of the Wexford County Council asks what the dickens were they elected for at all.

      <P>I propose to carry out my statutory duties in regard to the appointment of county medical officers.  To use another phrase of the Senator, &ldquo;efficiency is the handmaid of economy,&rdquo; and, as far as the health of the growing citizens of this State is concerned, I want to use all the powers I possess regarding school medical services to see that these services are instituted throughout the country.  If we have been moving only in this county now and in another county again, I have been doing that in my own wisdom and in the wisdom of the Department.  I do not want to see county medical officers of health appointed except they are the right men.  We have appointed about 16 or 17 county medical officers of health within the past few years. We get an idea, by the type of man who appears before a selection board for a particular appointment, whether there is good material in the market <Col N="641" /> or not.  If there is good material in the market, I have no hesitation in pressing those counties which I think are best able to bear the expense and most want the service, to make the appointment.  Where I did not feel assured of that, I have not been pressing. I am sure that neither the Seanad nor the Dáil would question the wisdom of my administration in that respect. We deal with 400 odd bodies&mdash; 27 county councils, 27 boards of health and a large number of urban district councils.  Five bodies are mentioned whose appearance in the public Press would suggest friction and want of harmony with all that the Senator says that that would mean in public administration, but we get very little information about these bodies.  The Mayo Library, the salary of the Galway County Secretary!  It is a fact that only very limited economies can be further brought about in central administration.  Anyone who looks around and who is in close touch with things will certainly feel that greater economies can be effected by the proper management of the business that falls to local authorities&mdash;that there is a greater amount of scope for harmony there.  There is a greater reason for seeing that if a certain amount of money is spent we should get good and proper value for it.  The Senator, I think, has given expression to the opinion that it is only in proper management that the Government can secure economies.  If we squabble with local bodies over the salaries that are to be paid to a secretary, and if we force local bodies to go to the Appointments Commission for an accountant or a county surveyor or engineer, it is because we want to be assured that those who are elected to local bodies will have efficient officials to serve them in the work that they are called upon to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The description of the civil servants who handle these matters as people who read text-books and who can use big words is very unfair. Anybody who is connected with local government in any way, and who has had to deal with the Department will be emphatically of the opinion that that remark is very unfair to the <Col N="642" /> civil servants who are the persons upon whom the Minister has to rely and by whom local bodies are guided and helped in hundreds of different ways.  In the first place, it is a false description, and in the second place, it is a very unworthy description of men whom many people connected with the Oireachtas besides myself know to be amongst the most earnest, most practical and most hard-working citizens in the country.  I have a difficulty in dealing with this motion, because I do not really think the Senator's representations are worth taking into consideration at all.  I feel grateful that the Seanad has shown itself to be unprepared to discuss or even incapable of discussing the motion, because I think it is a motion that should never have come before it.</P>

      <P>Wexford County Council has been mentioned.  I am not a member of the County Council, but, like everybody else, I read the papers.  A certain amount of friction occurred there recently, but, by negotiation with the Minister for Local Government, that friction was got over.  It concerned the County Medical Officer of Health and his scheme.  I suppose newly-appointed officers occasionally act as new brooms, and local people might be inclined to resent that.  However, any differences that occurred have been amicably arranged.  I should like to ask Senator Sir John Keane&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have achieved my purpose.  I have said what I had got to say, and, as the Seanad is incapable of discussing, and unprepared to discuss, the motion, I shall certainly withdraw it.</P>
