      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise one or two points in connection with the Appropriation Bill.  Last year on the Appropriation Bill I raised a question with regard to the Forestry Department, Vote No. 53.  I called attention at that time to the continued export of round timber, that is, timber in the rough, and suggested that some steps ought to be taken to prevent its export.  Timber in the round in Ireland is diminishing very quickly, and we are approaching a very real shortage of certain timbers that are very valuable in giving employment and supplying necessary commodities.  I alluded then particularly to the export of ash, elm and sycamore.  At the rate we are going in a very few years there will be none of these timbers left. That might not be so bad if these were providing real employment in this country, but the fact is that the best of the material is going out, and the labour involved does not amount to more than 16/- or 18/- per day.  All this timber <Col N="1742" /> is used for the manufacture of commodities, the wage value alone of which would run to £5 or £6, according to the purpose for which the material is used. I would suggest that the Forestry Department ought to consider the advisability of putting an embargo on the export of all round timbers, and also that they should go into the question of the export of plank timber, that is, straight sawn timber, without any other work than sawing having been done on it.</P>
      <P>Relevant to the same thing the question as to the planting of timbers suitable in the future for certain needs in this country should be considered.  At the present time, I think, the main planting is being done in soft woods such as Douglas fir.  It is argued, I think, by the Forestry Department that it is difficult to get suitable land for planting the slower growth timbers, such as oak, ash and elm, but I think we should take the long view about this, and try to secure territory for the planting of these.  It is certain that in ten or twenty years we will have none of these timbers, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to get them.  We shall not get the benefit of these slow-growing timbers in our time, but I think the future generation will condemn us unless we show some foresight about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other item I want to bring forward is in connection with Vote 46. In all this I am really looking for information more than anything else. The Minister may be able to assure me that the matter has been already dealt with.  If so, I shall be very glad to hear it.  Away back in 1921 and 1922 certain Northern teachers were approached and appealed to that they should not recognise the Six-County Government.  Acting on instructions received from the Provisional Government or the Free State Government, or both, they refused to recognise the Six-County Government, and during that period their salaries were paid by the administration here.  These people took very considerable risk indeed in following that line of action.  They were subject to dismissal, and there was also the possibility in many cases <Col N="1743" /> of losing their pension rights.  The matter was afterwards adjusted by the Department of Finance, I presume. Whatever adjustment took place there was a deficiency, or there was owing to the teachers the amount of pension money retained out of the salaries that were paid to them by the administration here.  I understand that money has never been paid.  That was the last information I had about it.  I would be glad to know if that amount has yet been paid.  I understand the total amount would be about £10,000, but undoubtedly it is money which, if held here, is being held under false pretences, or, at all events, money that the administration here is not entitled to retain, as it was a direct deduction from their salaries for which they afterwards received no compensation. I say this matter may have been adjusted, but my last information was that it was not, and I would be glad to know how the situation stands.</P>
    <P>These are the only two points I wish to bring up.  Previously, I raised the question of beet and the subsidy that is being paid to the Beet Company. That matter, I understand, is now being adjusted.  I think at the time the Minister for Finance repudiated any responsibility and refused to intervene.  I, therefore, prefer to leave that aside for the negotiations that I understand are going on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Connolly has spoken of the teachers in the Six Counties. I am sure what he said will receive full attention from the Minister, and that the claims of these teachers will be satisfied.  I wish to speak on behalf of another class of teachers, namely, those who are called the transition period teachers, teachers who went on pension during the years from 1920 to 1925.  I believe that originally there were about 1,000 of these.  Of course, with the advance of years their number has been considerably diminished, but the grievances of those who survive have not been met, although they might be met without any great burden on the public funds. Even a little burden, if it secured justice, is in the end a great advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1744" /> In order that their cases might be understood, I would like to say that immediately before 1920 there was a considerable rise in the salaries of teachers.  The miserable stipends which they had been receiving before that date were increased, in three instalments, to a reasonable sum.  Some people may say that they are getting too much at present, but in 1920-21 there was a proposal for an increase in the salaries of teachers.  That increase was to come about by one-third the first year, one-third the second year, and another one-third in the third year. So that it really would be four years when the ultimate increase of salary would be reached.  In that period some of the teachers had to resign owing to having reached the age limit.  The practice in Ireland before 1920 was this: when a teacher came to the age of 65, which was the limit, he was allowed a certain concession; he was kept in office until such time as he reached his maximum.  It might be six months or twelve months, but an opportunity was given him of going out on pension on his maximum salary.  That was a practice sanctioned by usage which had almost attained to the force of law.  It was a practice to which there had been no exception taken.</P>
    <P>In regard to these transition teachers what happened was this: Their salaries were, as I have said, increased in the first year by one-third of the amount by which it was proposed to increase them; in the second year by another one-third, and in the third year the full increase had taken place.  Some teachers attained the age of 65 before the full increase was due. One or two whom I know attained to the age of 65 some months before they would have become entitled to their full increase.  The practice here has been to give them no sort of extension of time, but to fix their pension on the salary which they were receiving on the date on which they attained the age of 65.  No chance was given to them to remain in office until they reached the ultimate increase of salary to which they were entitled.  The result of that practice has been that some of these transition teachers are now on pensions of one-third of the salary to which they would be entitled. <Col N="1745" /> Take one example of a teacher whose salary on 31st March, 1920, was £268. On 31st March, 1921, his salary was £296, on 31st March, 1922, £386, and on 31st March, 1923, he would have been entitled to £417 which with capitations would bring his salary up to £445.  That would be the finance of the matter.  If the teacher was allowed to remain in office until March, 1923, his salary would have been £445. According to the system which obtained before 1920 he would have been entitled to go out on a pension of £220, but what was done in that case was: before he became entitled to his last increase he had to go out and he got a pension based on the average of the three years preceding. The result is that his pension is now only £130.  That is a great reduction and having regard to the position of the men who are in office as teachers it is I submit to the House a great injustice.  It is a matter, I think, that ought to be remedied.  These teachers were entitled to the same consideration as the teachers who are at present in office.  It was they who won for the teachers the advantages which they now enjoy and as always happens to people who fight battles for others they have been the sufferers and they have been sufferers to a very great degree.</P>
    <P>I do submit to the Minister for Finance that they are entitled to special consideration and I ask that he should go into their case.  I am sure if he does he will find that these teachers are entitled to an increase in their pensions of at least fifty per cent. It is only bare justice that this should be done.  It would cost very little and of course it will be a great advantage to a very deserving class of men, these teachers who have been pensioned and who have given long service to the State.</P>

      <P>I hope what I am going to mention is not going to be a hardy annual.  In connection with Vote 31 I desire to make the protest that no funds under this head seem to have been allocated towards the organisation of the game industry in this country.  Some 50,000 licence holders in the past year have <Col N="1746" /> paid into the Exchequer very nearly £39,000.  The figure is something like that.  In the last eight years that must amount to close on £320,000.  The whole of this money in previous years and this year has been kept by the Minister, not for his own purpose, but in order to utilise it for purposes other than the propagation and preservation of game in this country.  Every other national asset has been worked up by every possible means, but here we have a potential income which might be got from this game industry.  That income might be got for our people by the proper organisation of this industry, but owing to causes which arise from our particular agricultural circumstances that industry has been neglected.  It has been stated&mdash;not argued in any way&mdash;that this is a matter entirely for private enterprise, that the small farmer should combine with the man next to him and organise for the protection of game on their lands.  I do not think that that is possible.  I do, however, think that this is the only form of national agricultural industry which has not been pushed along as it can be pushed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to remind the House of the assistance that has been given to agriculture in the way of instruction, subsidies and propaganda. As a result it has been brought to a very high state of efficiency in recent years.  Take the case of the inland fisheries, which provide the country with an income of £270,000 this year. Now that industry has the advantage of utilising the fishery rate and the licences paid for the purpose of the preservation of the fisheries.  It has the advantage of utilising these things for increasing the stock of fish in the river. People concerned with game do not get this advantage.  I think the actual amount of the fishing rates and licences amount to another £39,000.  That is a very considerable sum, and I suggest that if development in one direction is necessary and is fruitful of results, it should be justified and desirable in another, and I think this principle should be applied to the game industry as well.  To give an instance, up to last year Scotland used to get directly and indirectly £3,000,000 per annum from the letting of its various shootings. <Col N="1747" /> We at the moment are getting only 400 visitors, all told, who come to this country to shoot game on their own. I do not think they leave very much behind them as things are now, because they do not get good game when they come.  We get very few wealthy people who are prepared to pay for shooting. It has always been the argument that our circumstances are different from Scotland.  I admit it.  Climatically and otherwise we are different.  I want to make that clear, and I do not think we are any worse off for being a populated country instead of being a mountainy waste, as a great part of the Highlands are as a result of the Highland clearances.</P>
    <P>What I do think is that we could get by a proper organisation such a quantity of game in this country as would attract a large number of people. There are to-day, owing to financial conditions elsewhere, not so many people who can afford to go to Scotland, but there are large numbers of people who would be prepared to come over here and take small shootings from such farmers as would preserve their lands.  These people would be prepared to pay a very good rent for the game rights.  I really think that this would mean a considerable increase in the income of the Irish farmers, not £3,000,000, but possibly £500,000, that is double what is derived from the inland fisheries, and it would mean a considerable increase in the national income.  All this money would go into the pockets of the farmers who would be prepared to organise and preserve their lands.</P>
    <P>To do all this we would require some organisation, and at the present time there is practically none.  The Department of Justice deals with the Game Laws and sees that they are in working order.  Since this was started we have had reports from the Gárda Síochána which show that they are interested in the matter of the preservation. The Land Commission disposes of the letting of any lands they have in their hands so far as shooting is concerned.  They advertise the shooting. The Minister for Finance grabs the licence money and holds it for other <Col N="1748" /> purposes.  There is no link whatever between those Departments directly and the farmers who are interested in game rights.  I suggest, therefore, that it should be considered whether an association could not be got up whereby a branch of some Department would be empowered to take charge of these matters.  Preferably it would be Lands and Fisheries, because they are always dealing with the fishery question, which is pretty much the same kind of question.  That Department should be given the task of dealing with all matters connected with game. The Consultative Council suggested in last year's Game Act should be brought into being to advise the Department as to what steps should be taken.  I think the Department of Fisheries has been distributing grants throughout the country through the Fishery Conservators, and some Department like that, not in its present form but in a reorganised form, should be given power to organise the different game associations or farmers' associations for the preservation of game.  It is in that way that they could be organised.</P>
    <P>These associations could be made responsible for the destruction of vermin.  They should destroy the vermin.  When these various bodies could show certificates for the amount of vermin destroyed, then we could go one step further and give them grants for the re-stocking of their lands, and publish schedules of associations of the various farmers who are prepared to hold their land for re-letting.  I think there is an organisation on those lines in France.  It works well.  If started here, even in a small way, it would go a long way to solve the derating problem by means other than an unproductive subsidy.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of the Finance Bill Senator O'Farrell and Senator Sir Walter Nugent gave us two very excellent examples of the vicious circle.  Generally I maintain that assistance to industry for the production of articles which can be produced more cheaply elsewhere is not wise, for although they give employment to one section of our people they create a lot more unemployment elsewhere.  That in turn <Col N="1749" /> reacts on agriculture.  But if we stimulate an industry such as this which does not exist elsewhere in the same form there is no friction, there is no conflict and what is more there is no over-production.  We will get a great deal more money in that way at less cost than could be got in any other way.  I hope that during the coming year the Minister will consider whether in this way he could not help the country, help the national income, help the tourist season and make it longer.  All this would help the farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to an item in Vote 21.  There is a grant-in-aid of £250 given to the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland. I never got a satisfactory explanation as to why the State should pay a subsidy every year to one trade union, particularly a trade union composed of people who earn fairly decent salaries.  Why should this grant be paid?  I see that according to this year's Vote the amount has been reduced by £75.  Is this reduction due to the decrease in the cost of living bonus, or how is it arrived at?  I am quite serious about this.  The amount of money involved is not tremendous, but it is really the principle to which I object.  I object to a subsidy being given to this trade union, one of the finest trade unions in the world.  Why should they be given a State subsidy to carry on the business of their trade union?  They call it an Incorporated Law Society, or an Association, but it is, nevertheless, a trade union, and I cannot see why there should be any discrimination.  Unless I get a satisfactory answer I will make an application that the trade union to which I belong should get a subsidy, because I believe we are doing just as good work for the community as this particular trade union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know on what basis the amount is fixed&mdash;whether it is <Col N="1750" /> on the cost of living bonus or not.  In connection with Vote 40, I see there is a sum of £200,000 for housing purposes. I would like to know if that £200,000 is intended to cover the Housing Bill that I understand is to be introduced next autumn.  In my opinion the sum of £200,000 is entirely too small, considering the problem that has to be confronted.  That amount as a subsidy towards house building will not do any real work in the way of solving this tremendous problem.  I would like to be assured by the Minister that the £200,000 is just a continuation of the last Housing Act finance and that it is not intended to cover the new measure the Minister for Local Government and Public Health mentioned would be introduced next autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture is not here because there are a few items upon which I would like to have some information. I cannot understand why there should be State subsidies in regard to some creameries and no subsidies in regard to others.  There is a Vote of £34,000 for the purchase of creameries in Clare. I am not sure that all that money is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. MacEllin Mr. MacEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied, having a fair experience of what it costs to erect creameries, that that enormous sum is not necessary. Knowing the record of Cleeves, I am inclined to believe that they have had more losses than ever during the last year or two and these losses are due to very keen competition against other creameries.  I am inclined to think that, not alone will this money be devoted towards making up the losses, but it will be also utilised to help them to hold their butter in cold storage in order to make use of the tariff of four-pence. This is hitting the poorer creameries that are not able to afford this thing.  I am anxious to know more about this Vote of £34,000 before we definitely pass it.  This thing is very unfair to the poorer creameries that are struggling to maintain themselves in the present depressed conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> Another very important matter is the result of the operation of the Fresh Meat Act.  I could not get any definite information in connection with the results accruing from this measure, but from what I hear I believe that the results are very startling, particularly in connection with the dreaded disease of tuberculosis.  I understand that disease is very much more severe in the creamery districts than in other areas.  I went to the trouble of finding out what was being done in connection with counteracting this disease in other countries.  In Denmark they issued an order to pasteurise all separated milk before sending it back to the suppliers.  After operating for twelve months the result was that there was a reduction of 50 per cent. in the cases affected by the disease. If so much can be achieved under a simple process of that sort, I think it is highly desirable to issue a similar order in this country.  In Denmark, by pasteurising the separated milk, they reduced the number of animals suffering from tuberculosis by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the Free State we have 123,000 sows and 1,098,000 ordinary pigs.  I am given to understand that there is a net loss of sixpence a pig as a result of tubercular disease.  That would mean a total loss of about £25,000 in relation to pigs all over the country. Taking animals such as cattle and other livestock, and excepting sheep, the loss must be really very serious. If we can gain such a great advantage merely by pasteurising separated milk, very serious consideration should be immediately devoted to the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanePower" hpid="Mrs. Wyse Power Mrs. Wyse Power">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Wyse Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I again call the Minister's attention to the steady annual increase in the amount required for industrial schools?  There is an increase this year of £1,133. That amount may seem small, but the total is really enormous; it comes to very nearly £119,000 for the three institutions, Borstal, reformatory and industrial.  The bulk of the money is for the industrial schools.  Added to this you have two-thirds from the local authorities and that makes a really enormous total.  Parents, when <Col N="1752" /> they can do so, give contributions to these schools.  Probably the increase is due to poverty, but it is very extraordinary all the same.  The Manager for the Corporation of Dublin, in his Budget this year, called attention to the fact that there was an increase of about £4,000&mdash;I think that was the figure.  At all events, it must have been a very large sum when the manager thought fit to call attention to it.  The Minister, when this matter was mentioned on another occasion, said that very often the people who run the industrial schools are not paid. We know one thing definitely, and that is that the State does not repudiate its debts to them; they pay 7s. 6d. per head.  As far as I am aware, only one local authority in the midlands declared that they would have to decrease the allowance.  I have no idea how many children are in these schools and we have no record of the number.  We do know, however, that the amount of money required in connection with those schools is really enormous and it is time that some effort was made to reduce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to deal, without notice, with the various questions that may be raised on this Bill. As some of them affect other Departments I do not think I could attempt to deal with them.  Senator Connolly raised a question about the export of round timber.  I certainly should be very reluctant to place an embargo upon the export of any product.  One could argue just as strongly for embargoes on other things that cannot be used here.  The position is that persons own certain products.  They are ready for sale&mdash;ripe as it were&mdash;and are we to say that these persons are not to sell them, or are we to say definitely that they must sell them at some knock-down price?  That is what the case put up amounts to.  Timber may not have to be cut in the way that grain has to be cut, within a very limited period.  But when timber gets ripe it ought to be cut, and if it has to be kept for a substantial period beyond that it tends to deteriorate.  If we were to put an embargo on the export of round timber it would mean that the people who had the timber would be <Col N="1753" /> forced to allow it to continue growing. The result would be that it would decrease in value.  People ought to be allowed to cut the timber when it is ripe and when they need the money. It seems to me a serious thing to say that when the owners do cut that they should be obliged to sell in a market which is very much more limited than the supply, and therefore be obliged to take a smaller price than they might otherwise be able to obtain.  As to the general questions raised with regard to afforestation, I am afraid I could not deal with them.  There has been some forestry legislation before the Seanad, and I am sure that Senators have had opportunities of putting forward their views on that.  If any Senator wishes to raise a question on that a motion can be put down, and the Minister for Agriculture will attend to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Senator Connolly raised another question with regard to payments to national teachers.  My view is that the first action taken with regard to the national teachers in the North should never have been taken; that once the Treaty was accepted no attempt ought to have been made to induce any people in the Six Counties to refuse to recognise the jurisdiction of the Six-County Government.  I do not know myself any of the circumstances with regard to the decision that was taken to make certain suggestions to the teachers in the North.  I think that action was taken largely on advice that came from the Six Counties.  In my opinion that advice was foolish and mistaken.  If some money was paid to the teachers of the North out of the Saorstát Exchequer, it was money that should not have been paid.  It was money contributed by the taxpayers in the Free State, and should have been used only for Free State purposes.</P>

      <P>There was a good deal of confusion of mind, I am afraid, in connection with various incidental matters at the time.  Senator Comyn asked about certain teachers who had reached the retiring age during what he called the transition period.  I think that a stronger plea could be made for increasing the pensions of people who retired before the new scale came into operation at all.  I am astonished that the Senator did not make that plea, because certainly their case is a harder case than the case of those who, if they did not get the full increase, at least got some increase in their pensions.  I think it would be quite impossible at the present stage, in view of the effect which falling prices tend to have on the revenue, to contemplate increasing pensions which were given in the year 1925 or earlier. If these people are suffering now, then they are suffering less hardship than when the pensions were granted, because in the meantime there has been a fall in the price of commodities and a consequent increase in the value of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be glad if Senator The McGillycuddy developed in greater detail his proposal with regard to the preservation of game.  On the face of <Col N="1755" /> it, it seems possible to make as strong an argument for the taking of some steps for the preservation of game as for the preservation of fisheries.  I am afraid, however, that the administration of any scheme to deal with the matter would present many difficulties. I would like to correct the Senator on one point.  He indicated that the money derived from game licences was retained for general Exchequer purposes. As a matter of fact, it is paid into the Local Taxation Account, and goes back to the local authorities.  If we were to divert that money to meet the cost of some general scheme of game preservation it would mean the withholding of £39,000 or £40,000 a year from the local authorities.  It strikes me as a matter worthy of consideration, and as the Senator seems to have given some attention to it, I think he ought to put his views in greater detail before the Department of Fisheries.  With regard to the point raised by Senator Farren, the position as to the grant to the Incorporated Law Society is this: Prior to the passing of the Solicitors Act of 1898, a number of duties in connection with solicitors were discharged by an officer of the Supreme Court.  These duties included the keeping of the Roll of solicitors and of seeing that solicitors guilty of malpractices had their faults brought before the court and were struck off the Roll.</P>
    <P>This Act of 1898 transferred the duties to the Incorporated Law Society.  It provided that a grant equal to two-thirds of the cost of discharging these duties should be paid to the Incorporated Law Society.  Previous to that a similar arrangement had been made with regard to the English and Scotch Societies.  The reason we have reduced the amount by £75 this year is simply because the cost of doing this particular work was found on examination of the accounts of the Incorporated Law Society to have fallen.  I do not know how the Senator would support a case for a grant to his particular trade union.  In any event, if he sends in an application we will promise to read it whether we take any further steps or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>We have done a little more in connection with it than that. The amount provided in the Estimates for housing is for activities carried on under existing legislation.  There is no provision for anything that may be done under the Bill which it is hoped to have in the autumn.  The matters to which Senator MacEllin referred are matters that I could not deal with personally in the absence of notice.  I know that the provision made in connection with creameries in West Clare includes not merely the purchase of the central creamery which has been effected, but also the erection of quite a number of auxiliaries in an area in which heretofore creameries have not been established, and in which in fact the old system of home butter-making is going on.  It is an area in which there are big milk supplies, where there ought to be creameries, and where there is none.  It is an area in which substantial benefits should accrue to the farming community as the result of the establishment of creameries, in the way of better prices being obtained for creamery butter as compared with home-made butter.  The provision is not merely for a central but for quite a number of auxiliaries.  I am speaking from memory, as this matter only came indirectly before me, but there are to be quite a number of auxiliaries together with some trading capital.</P>
      <P>I do not believe there is any intention to hold butter in cold store. The Senator is aware that if more than a limited quantity of butter is held in cold store, the possibility is that those who hold it will lose, because they will have the expense of cold storing it, and, in the winter there will be no possibility of getting more. The 4d. that the Senator mentioned&mdash; the amount of the tariff&mdash;can only be obtained if there is less put into cold store than is needed for winter consumption here.</P>

      <P>On the consideration of the Finance Bill a few years ago I drew the Minister's attention to the alarming spread of faked and medicated wines, which depend for their sale on persistent and flamboyant advertisements.  One of these wine advertisements states that it is recommended by 17,000 doctors, though no doctor who has any knowledge of the stimulating and curative properties of good wine would ever recommend such a wine.  When I drew attention to this matter previously the Minister received my remarks rather favourably and promised to have something done. From that time to the present nothing has been done, and that is why I am calling attention to it again&mdash;so that something may be done.</P>

      <P>I made an effort through Senator Comyn to have a recommendation introduced on this stage of this Bill.  I do not know why it was not accepted or if it was not in order.  At any rate, it is not before the House.  I would like to know what the Minister will have to say in connection with the matter I wished to deal with, that transport lorries should be allowed to be used on Sunday afternoons.  In outlying districts, I do not think it would be any harm to allow these lorries to convey players to football matches, without the owners incurring any liability or committing any breach of the regulations, for which they might be summoned. The reason I was anxious to move such a recommendation is that in these outlying districts no transport is available as a rule.  Where there are no cars or buses lorries can be had, and my idea was that if such a procedure were allowed, it would give the young people opportunities that they would not otherwise have of being conveyed twenty, thirty or forty miles from the southern or western sea-boards to areas where football matches take place.</P>

      <P>With regard to the transport of passengers by lorries to which the last Senator referred, there is nothing to prevent passengers being conveyed if a charge is not made.  Any man who has a lorry, and who wishes to convey young men to play a football <Col N="1759" /> match, has a right to do so, so long as he does not make a charge.</P>
      <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to a fact in favour of the Free State which has not been adverted to by critics of this Bill.  The fact is that of all the people in Europe who took part in the Great War, the Irish Free State has no war debt.  We should congratulate ourselves, and congratulate the Government that brought about the state of affairs, that we, alone of all the participants in the war, are free from war debts, and we are liable for neither munition nor reparation payments.  It would be well, owing to the present condition of Europe, that a fact of that sort should be made known.  If the Ministry, instead of apologising for their action in connection with the settlement, would take the other course and proclaim the virtue of their action in regard to that matter it would be a good feather in their cap for political purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if they were to do that it would be a feather off their tail.  I want to speak on another subject, however.  On Second Reading I objected to Section 2 of this Bill on the ground that it created penalties <i>ex post facto.</i>  I was informed that there is no penalty involved in an executor or an administrator failing to make a return.  If that were so, of course, as I admitted on the last occasion, my entire argument would go by the board.  I accepted the statement made by the Minister.  It is right for me to say that when the Minister made the statement the matter which was under discussion was income tax, and in regard to income tax I do admit, having looked into the matter, that there is no penalty on an executor or an administrator who fails to make a return.  But I think the Seanad understood that the Minister's disclaimer involved a much wider question, that it involved every obligation on executors and administrators under this Section 2.  As I was bound to, I accepted the statement which had been made, and I admitted that my argument had no foundation if that categorical statement of fact were <Col N="1760" /> true, but I reserved to myself the right to verify it.  I now find that under Section 7 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, dealing with super-tax, there is a regulation in sub-section (2) providing: &ldquo;Every person upon whom notice is served, in manner prescribed by regulations under this section, by the special commissioners, requiring him to make a return of his total income from all sources, or in the case of a notice served upon any person who is chargeable with or liable to be assessed to income tax, as representing an incapacitated, non-resident, or deceased person, of the total income from all sources of the incapacitated, non-resident, or deceased person, shall, whether he is or is not chargeable with super-tax, make such return in the form and within the time required by the notice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>You may say that that is not for income tax, that it is for super-tax, but I say that Section 2 covers income tax and super-tax.  Here is sub-section (4) of this Section 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If any person without reasonable excuse fails to make any return or to give any notice required by this section, he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £50, and after judgment has been given for that penalty to a further penalty of the like amount for every day during which the failure continues.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There you have clearly a penalty, and a retrospective penalty, imposed by this new Section 2.  It is quite right that it is not in respect to income tax, but it is in respect to super-tax.  Still my point is sustained that here you have an <i>ex post facto</i> law which provides a penalty for something which will be an offence to-day, although it was not an offence yesterday.  I do not like to get into a discussion or to make charges against Ministers, but I certainly am in the habit of accepting absolutely what a Minister says in regard to a matter of fact.  All I say now is that I stated in my speech that I had not had an opportunity of looking into the law to see if there were penalties imposed.  I stated in the speech that I believed from my knowledge of the revenue law that there could be no obligation without a <Col N="1761" /> penalty.  I certainly did accept the statement of the Minister in the fullest sense.  I do not say that the Minister, or anybody else, deliberately stated what he knew to be wide of the fact, but at the same time I wish to point out that we expect and require and will insist upon absolutely frank statements&mdash;<i>uberrima fides</i>&mdash;in this House and in these debates, and nothing else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to what Senator Comyn has referred to, the position is perfectly clear, and I still state that no question of a penalty of any sort is involved, and for this reason: that it is a well-known rule of interpretation that no statute with retrospective effect shall be construed in such a way as to have greater retrospective operation than it renders necessary.  Cases have been decided to that effect more than once. It is a well recognised rule that the Senator should be aware of. Therefore this cannot have the effect that the Senator says.  You cannot by implication say that one thing involves another, that another thing involves another, and consequently that the passing of this retrospective section will involve penalties. That is not so.  There is no penalty.  Senator Douglas is quite right, of course, that if this section did operate to impose a penalty retrospectively it would be void as being unconstitutional. It is not so, because, as a matter of fact, it cannot be construed to have a retrospective effect in the direction that the Senator suggests because of this rule of interpretation. A retrospective section is simply retrospective so far as appears plainly on the face of it, and no further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator MacKean has called attention <Col N="1762" /> to the question of the importation of medicated wines.  I sympathise a good deal with the Senator.  I do not think that the matter could be disposed of by anything that we could do in the Finance Bill, not readily.  We might if we decided to do so impose very heavy duties upon the importation of medicated wine, something much higher than the ordinary wine duty, but if that were to take place I think an arrangement would be made by certain people to carry out the process of medication here.  I understand it would be a very simple process and would not give any employment in the country so that the mere imposition of a heavy tax on medicated wine imported into the country would not have the effect that the Senator desires.</P>

      <P>Without necessarily accepting that view I agree that probably these medicated wines are a peril to the pockets of those who use them, in that they are alleged to have properties and values which, in fact, they have not got.  I think Senator MacEllin was answered by Senator Wilson.  Anyone who wants to take people to football matches on lorries can do so if he is sufficiently sportsmanlike to do so without payment, but if he wants to make a trade of it he must pay the tax.  The matter will come before the Seanad when the Traffic Bill, introduced in the Dáil, comes up here, and the Senator will have an opportunity of challenging it, because there will be definite legislation against the particular thing he wants done.</P>

      <P>Section 3, sub-section (1).  To delete in lines 22-23 the words &ldquo;the Minister for Industry and Commerce shall from time to time certify to be reasonably and properly&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;are from time to time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When we were dealing with this Bill last week the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to the disagreeable nature of his duties in dealing with this measure.  I think the sense of disagreeableness is equally felt by those of us who have interested ourselves in this Bill and by the Seanad generally. I think the one outstanding feeling is that we are not much further on than we were prior to the Minister's analysis and statement last week.  In other words we really do not know where we are.  We have not yet got down to the facts of the trouble or the cure for the trouble or the position as to the future of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
      <P>The form that the amendment has taken may be interpreted as a sort of vote of censure on the Minister.  Last week we dealt with the Bill in what I think the Minister called a very lenient manner, and we do not propose to deal with it to-day other than in the spirit of trying to find out what are the facts, what can be done about the position and also of trying to ensure that the future of the Electricity Supply Board and the Shannon electrical undertaking shall be safeguarded.  On that occasion we suggested to the Minister that his attitude was a one-sided attitude, that the people whom he criticised and more or less condemned had no opportunity of making their case, and that the Seanad therefore was not in the position to judge as between him and the Electricity Supply Board or the members of the Board.  I think that is still the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will, I hope, realise that we are only interested in one thing, <Col N="1765" /> and that is to find out what is the real truth.  I think that in the interests of the House, and in the interests of the Minister and the E.S.B., a committee such as I suggested last week, representative of both Houses and of all sections in them, should have been appointed, to give us the truth and to let us know exactly what the differences were and what steps we ought to take to put matters right. The Minister does not, apparently, agree with the suggestion that such a joint committee could do anything.  He does not agree that at this stage experts could be of any help.  Still we are satisfied that a committee could sift the real position, find out what the real facts were, what it is that has caused the trouble and, moreover, find out what experts, if any, are needed to ensure the stabilisation of the whole scheme and put it upon an economic basis.  Last week I referred to the position, and pointed out that the Minister, in this House, had given a reassuring statement with regard to the whole Electricity Supply Board in July, 1929, while at the same time, in July, 1929, the Minister was having a very serious conflict indeed with the Board and was threatening at the time to introduce two amendments to a Bill in order to have his point of view carried and clarified in the Dáil itself.  All through the debates in this House and the other House, the Minister has stressed that he was left without information, that he could not get the facts, that he really did not know where he was in the matter and could get no documents.  He qualified that, to some extent, by stating that he got certain documents later.  He mentioned the times that he got them, but said that the documents were not in such form that he could use them, that they were inaccurate.  I want to bring home to the Seanad that if the Minister was without information he ought to be able to explain to us why he was without information, because we find that, in spite of the complete independence of the Board, the Executive was represented on the Electricity Supply Board from, practically, September, 1929.  Mr. Leyden, of the Department of Finance, joined the <Col N="1766" /> Board in September, 1929, and remained a member until 1930.  We find that he was given for his services a gratuity of £125 out of the Vote for the Department of Finance.  Incidentally, though I do not want to make any debating point about it, the law was that all the members of the Electricity Supply Board were to be paid out of the Board's funds.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us why Mr. Leyden was appointed?  Will he tell us if he was put on the Board as an expert in anything but finance? It is to be assumed that he had no electrical experience and that he was not wanted on the constructional side. It is, therefore, reasonable to suggest that he was put on the Board to look after financial matters &mdash; to examine the balance sheets and the monthly or weekly reports that would come before the Board.  I want to know from the Minister if Mr. Leyden carried out the functions which he was sent to discharge. Would it be reasonable to assume that part of his duties would be to see that the work of the Board was carried out, particularly in regard to statements of accounts and the furnishing of such information as the Executive, represented by the Minister, ought to get through their representatives on the Board?</P>
    <P>We find that Mr. Fay was appointed to the Board at the same time.  The Minister intimated in the course of the Dáil debate that prior to September, 1929, Mr. Fay was liasion officer between the Shannon Board and the Electricity Supply Board.  In other words, he was liaison officer between the two Boards prior to September, 1929, and in September, 1929, he was appointed a member of the Electricity Supply Board, an office which he has held since.  I want the Seanad to remember that from September, 1929, two members of the Board were appointed by the Executive or by the Minister.  Mr. Browne came on the Board in February, 1930.  I take it that Mr. Leyden was retiring at that time.  At all events, Mr. Browne, of the Revenue Department, then became a member of the Board and is there still.  I mentioned these dates specifically in order to bring home to the <Col N="1767" /> Seanad that if the Minister were not informed, he was neglectful of his duties, or his representatives, or the representatives of the Executive on the Board were neglectful of their duties.  Either that, or they did not know what their duties were.</P>
    <P>It is customary at the Board meetings of any company&mdash;I presume the same thing applied in the case of the Electricity Supply Board &mdash; to submit a statement of accounts showing the financial position of the company. Will the Minister tell us specifically and definitely that during the period he mentions as not having got information Mr. Leyden, Mr. Fay, and Mr. Browne &mdash; two of whom were selected because of their competence in financial matters &mdash; did not furnish him with returns on the financial position of the Board?  Did he allow these people to continue for from a year and a half to two years sitting at the monthly, fortnightly, or weekly meetings without asking for financial reports and analyses of the various activities of the Board?</P>
    <P>One of two things must emerge from that.  Either these people were incompetent and not fit to represent the Minister or the Minister did not know what he should get from his representatives on the Board.  Does he say seriously to intelligent men in this House that up to this time he could not get figures or facts?  I for one cannot swallow that.  I cannot believe it.  I do not think any reasonable man should be asked to believe it.  Two of these representatives were specialists in finance or, at any rate, were sent there because of their experience in finance, and the Minister in July, 1931, tells us that he knew nothing about the finances of the Board at that time.  I think that is incredible.  One of my reasons for suggesting a Committee such as I suggested last week was that without having to drag all these matters into the open and use the names of civil servants and other people, a responsible Committee, representative of both Houses and possessing the full confidence of the people, could go into the question and deal with these matters &mdash; matters that it is absolutely <Col N="1768" /> repugnant to have to deal with openly in the House and before the Press. The Minister has taken the line that he will not have a Committee and we have no alternative but to face up to the position.  Moreover, an inquiry will have to take place in spite of the Minister and of the Executive, because the truth we must have and we are not getting any help to obtain it here.</P>
    <P>I now come to Mr. Browne's appointment. Mr. Browne was appointed in February, 1930.  That is sixteen months ago.  I know nothing about Mr. Browne.  I would not know him if I met him in this House.  I know nothing of his qualifications, but I am perfectly sure he is a fully competent and reliable man.  Is it reasonable to think that the Chairman of the Board since 1930 allowed things to drift and did nothing about them &mdash; that he did not, above all, inform the Minister as regards the position?  I have said that I did not accept the statement that the Minister did not know and was not informed of the position.  I want now definitely to ask the Minister whether financial statements were presented at the Board's meetings.  That is a very definite question.  I want to ask him the further question&mdash;did his representatives examine those papers; did these people who were put on the Board following the initial trouble with Mr. Murphy &mdash; Mr. Leyden, Mr. Fay, and Mr. Browne &mdash; examine these reports and were they satisfied?  Did they report any dissatisfaction to the Minister?  Remember that Mr. Browne has been Chairman of the Board since February, 1930, and we are in July, 1931.  The Minister discovered in March or April of this year that everything was wrong.</P>
    <P>What was Mr. Browne doing?  Did the Minister hear from any of these three gentlemen any reports which would induce him or encourage him to intervene himself and find out what the position was on the Board?  Did he examine the balance sheets of the Board or analyses or returns such as are ordinarily presented at Board meetings?  I think we should be definitely informed on these facts because these are the cardinal facts which will guide us as to who has <Col N="1769" /> fallen, whether that person is the Minister, Mr. Browne, or the other members of the Board.  We have got to know and we will readily know when we have got an answer to the questions I have asked.  I regret to have to mention these gentlemen's names.  I am passing no criticism on them.  I am quite satisfied in my own mind that these gentlemen fulfilled all the functions expected of them as members of the Board.  I am also satisfied that Mr. Browne and Mr. Leydon particularly would have the interest of seeing the financial statements. I do not know about Mr. Fay, as I understand he is more on the engineering side, but, at all events, Mr. Browne and Mr. Leydon, being men connected with Finance, would I am satisfied have got all this information. What I want to know now is this: If they got it, how it is that the Minister is in such a state of completely innocent ignorance as he represented to us last week here?</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he had been pressing the Electricity Supply Board for revenue estimates, capital charges, etc., and that he could not get them.  Dr. MacLaughlin in the Press makes a statement quite contrary to that.  This is the statement of Dr. MacLaughlin:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that there is no material to put before such experts.  Very full and complete technical records are available, as is also the financial information necessary for experts to form a definite and prompt judgment.</P>
    <P>I want to know is that true.  I raised that issue by way of intervention last week and the Minister said that he would not say that it was untrue, but that he would say it was inaccurate.</P>
    <P>Well what does inaccuracy mean? An estimate for £2,000,000, wrong by 11d., would be inaccurate.  I submit that we ought to know what that estimate was and that we should form an opinion before condemning people as to whether that was a reasonable estimate in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I want to know first of all if the Minister admits getting that estimate. It has been specifically stated in the public Press that that financial information is available.  If we knew what <Col N="1770" /> that financial information was, it would not only let us know whether it was reasonable in all the circumstances, but it would give us an idea as to the solvency of the future of the Shannon scheme itself and the operations of the Electricity Supply Board. I suggest that we cannot and we ought not condemn the Board on the word of a Minister when a statement like that is made in the public Press, pointing out that the financial information is there while it is not shown to the House.  I think ordinary Christianity, ordinary justice demands that it be produced.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the other House &mdash; I am not sure whether he said it here or not&mdash;made a statement that he could not table the documents or the correspondence because it would not be in the public interest.  Could the Minister or any of us conceive anything worse in the public interest than what has happened?  An atmosphere has been created by the very mention of the sum of two million pounds &mdash; that somehow or other the Electricity Supply Board has gone wrong to the extent of two million pounds.  I tried to deal with that last week.  I tried to point out that loose thinking and loose talk were common in this and in other countries.  I say that, in the public interest and the interest of the Electricity Supply Board, it is absolutely imperative that all the truth be known.  The Minister, perhaps, does not realise, as those who travel through the country realise, the terrible upset this has been in the minds of the people who had felt and who had thought that the whole scheme was a success.  I am satisfied that even if it takes this two million pounds which the Minister wants, or even with another two millions, the scheme is quite sound and that it can be made pay.  It is generally rumoured through the city that in a very short time the income from the Shannon scheme &mdash; I do not know what the justification is for the rumour as the Minister refuses to supply us with information &mdash; will in a couple of years be upwards of one and a quarter million.  If that is the case we have a reasonable proposition, a proposition that will pay what the Minister has <Col N="1771" /> implicated us in up to the present and more.  But we do want to face up to the position and we do want to know what is the truth.  I suggest that nothing could be less in the public interest &mdash; no matter how damaging the papers are, whether against the Minister or the Board &mdash; nothing could be more damaging than this hush-hush policy adopted by the Minister, the little that has been said and the reticence about all the rest.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion the Minister analysed the various amounts for constructional purposes.  These worked out at about £1,300,000. Constructional work will of course be necessary, but we do not know what that constructional work will be.  I would like to ask the Minister a question which is rather important &mdash; over what period does he expect that constructional work will extend?  Will it be twelve months, two, three, four or five years?  I think that is important because we might be assuming that this two millions, out of which £1,200,000 will be wanted for constructional purposes, will all be wanted this year.  I think we want some information on that point to guide us, because it would have a considerable bearing on any analysis we are trying to make as regards the economy of the scheme and the working of the Board generally.  These are the only points that I propose to make.  I made a reasonable, quiet and guarded speech last week.  The Minister felt, I think, that it was lenient.  We do not want anything but leniency.  We want to know what the truth is.  I submit in view of the atmosphere that has been created, in view of the cross-firing in the Press and the public debates, the time has come when all the cards should be put on the table if the confidence of the country is to be restored.  I stressed this matter of the members of the Board and the time they went on to the Board merely because I think they ought to have something to say about the activities of the Board since September, 1929. When we remember that these gentlemen have been there since 1929, it seems extraordinary that the Minister <Col N="1772" /> is so short of information, and that he cannot give us satisfactory information here when he states that he has no analysis that he could look upon as accurate.  I submit, in view of Dr. MacLaughlin's letters in the newspapers and everything else, that somebody has got to decide other than the Minister, because after all the Minister is one party in this thing and the Electricity Supply Board is the other party.  It has been argued that there is not any need for any public inquiry and that there is not any need for investigation.  It has also been stated that the material is not ready for tabling.  I think the matter is one of urgency.  I think all the information the Minister has and all the Board has ought to be put before someone who would be able to deal with it and adjudicate upon it.</P>
    <P>One rather disturbing thing has been mentioned.  I do not know whether it is a fact or not.  I would be interested to know what the Minister has got to say on it.  One of the leading trade journals contains an article by an eminent Irish engineer. I refer to the &ldquo;Electrical Review.&rdquo; This statement which he made is rather alarming.  It is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Electricity Supply Board now has no electrical engineer amongst its five members.  Three of them are business men who have been explicitly absolved by the Minister from blame in the present muddle because they were not expected to do much more than is done by &lsquo;guinea pig&rsquo; directors; the Chairman is a Civil Servant in grain, and Mr. Fay, the only member of the Board now that Mr. Murphy and Dr. MacLaughlin have gone, was Secretary to the Shannon Development Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very serious state of affairs if we have an Electricity Supply Board without one electrical engineer.  I suggest that has got to be met, not only by the statement that it is true or that it is false, but we have got to have the qualifications of the electrical engineer, if any, that is on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1773" /> I would appeal to the Seanad to express themselves on this amendment and that they do not, until the Minister gives us some reason to think that an investigation will be made possible for this House and the other House, show him confidence by retaining him within that Bill.  I submit that the situation has been ill-handled, that the situation is one of urgency and that above all things it is up to the Seanad to see that fair play is given to the Board as such.  If condemnation is to come from the Seanad then let it come on evidence and fact and not on the one-sided statement of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the amendment proposed by Senator Connolly.  I think it is the only logical attitude to take up in view of the fact that I supported his original suggestion regarding the setting up of a judicial committee to inquire into this conflict between the Minister and the Electricity Supply Board.  I am not going to detain the House very long, but it seems to me that the case in a nutshell is this: there is a dispute between two parties regarding the interpretation of the original Act and secondly the administration of the Act. One party is the Minister and the other is the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicted the Electricity Supply Board and it seems to me that this section in this Bill asks us to agree to that indictment and to give the Minister a clean bill of health without hearing what the Electricity Supply Board has got to say in the matter.  I think the House should not do such a thing.  If the Electricity Supply Board is to be kept out the Minister also should be kept out of the dispute, at least so far as certifying accounts are concerned, until the full facts are placed before the Oireachtas.</P>

Examining the amendment on its merits and apart from all contingent considerations and personalities, I cannot see that the position which is, admittedly, in certain respects not a satisfactory one, would be improved.  The Board have <Col N="1774" /> to do the business of electricity supply, but the taxpayers' money is involved and that is what we have got to consider. How can it improve the position to cut out the safeguard of the certification of the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  That is what the amendment does.  It cuts that out altogether.  It leaves the Board direct to deal with the Minister for Finance.  It would simply authorise the Minister for Finance to advance to the Board whatever money they asked him for, if and when it is required. I cannot see that that is going to improve the position, and therefore considering the amendment strictly on its own merits the effect that it is going to have on the position is one that I cannot vote for.</P>

The feelings of the country are feelings of gratitude towards the Minister for having stepped in at the time he did. Of course there is a certain amount of confusion and all kinds of worry, but from what I have heard and can find out that is the feeling, and this amendment will certainly not help matters in the least.  I hope it will be rejected.</P>

      <P>I am surprised to know that Senator Connolly is so full of gratitude to and confidence in the Minister for Finance.  It is a new view of Senator Connolly so far as I can see.  It really touches a more vital question, and on this vital question of principle I part company with the Senator at once.  I do not think it is a good thing to give to the Board the powers to spend another two million pounds, or even another million pounds <Col N="1775" /> as is proposed in a later amendment, simply by making requisitions to the Minister for Finance without giving the Minister for Finance some kind of technical warrant that the money ought to be spent, especially in view of the criticism that is implied if not deliberately directed against the composition of the present Board.  You have to bear in mind that the Board at present consists in fact of two persons, with three advisers who are, from all accounts, not in regular attendance and not in regular active work in connection with the Board itself.  So that the Board who are going to make the requisition would be the present Chairman, who is a civil servant, and Mr. Fay, whom we are told is not an electrical engineer.  If they are to make a requisition to the Minister for Finance, he then may advance a million pounds.  It seems to me that confidence is being expressed in the Board and in the Minister for Finance which is denied to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not think that this Board or any future Board of the kind ought to be as independent as the Minister, as this House and the Dáil said in 1927 that they ought to be, and as even the Opposition in the Dáil in this year, 1931, said they ought to be. I do not think that a Board that is going to spend two and a half millions and two millions in addition of public money ought to be as independent as the 1927 Act said they ought to be. The deduction that one can draw from Senator Connolly's amendment is that he would desire even that the new Board, with its present composition, ought to be in that practically independent position.  I would much rather that the Board should be subject to the check of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in respect of the expenditure that it is proposed should be made out of this two million pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Simply as a matter of procedure, of which, of course, the Senator who moved the amendment is as good a judge as I am, it seems to me that all he has said in regard to this particular amendment would be much more appropriate on the amendment to reduce <Col N="1776" /> the sum from two to one million pounds.  Quite apart from that, and touching the general question which he raised, I am of opinion, having heard the Minister make his speeches last week, that there is still a necessity for satisfying the public and this House of the merits of the dispute between the Minister and the late Board.  It is not quite satisfactory to think of the Board simply as a private body set up by the Minister and dismissible by the Minister in consequence of a sudden disputation or of differences of policy, major or minor. They had been raised to a certain level in the estimation of the public as being a semi-public body who had been given extraordinary powers.  One has to assume that the Ministry, in appointing that Board, had regard to special qualifications.  They had a certain prestige given to them, and even right up to very recent months that prestige had been enhanced by the testimonies to their success that had been publicly represented by the Minister.  Having raised their prestige in that way, it seems to me to be reasonable and fair that an opportunity should be provided for that Board to make its defence in regard to the charges that have been levelled against it by the responsible Minister.  Differences quite openly have occurred between the Minister on the one hand and the Board on the other.  The Minister has had the fullest opportunity to make his case.  He has gone into great detail, and one would think he has made a convincing case in his attack upon and criticism of the activities of the Board and the failure of the Board in certain respects in carrying out the duties which the Seanad and the Dáil placed upon them.  One member of the Board has to some extent come into the public Press, but I do not think that is satisfactory.  There is undoubtedly an issue raised between the Board as it was up to a few months ago and the Ministry, and, whether we like it or not, this Bill is taken to be a method of adjudicating as to the merits of the dispute between the two parties.  It is not in fact so, but that is more or less how it is viewed in the public mind, and I still feel, notwithstanding <Col N="1777" /> what has been said about the undesirability and the inopportuneness of an inquiry at the present time, that what is required is not an expert inquiry as to the future policy of the Board, or even the past policy of the Board, so much as an opportunity for the Board to present the House with the facts, to confirm the statements of fact made by the Minister or to refute them, so that there can be some adjudication on the charges that have been made against the Board.</P>
    <P>If only for this reason it may be that the Government in this country in the near future or the distant future may want to use the services of men whom the present Ministry thought at one time were exceptionally competent.  It seems to me reasonable and right that the public should be able to have the facts, the merits or the demerits of the case made against the Board, adjudicated upon in something like a fair manner.  As to the amendment that is before the House, I shall certainly vote against it, because I would desire to see the check that this section implies placed upon the Board in respect of this further two million expenditure, just as I would like to have seen in the 1927 Act a check placed upon the Board in the spending of two and a half million pounds given to them to spend by this House and the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Senator Johnson has said that the Ministry has made a convincing case in connection with the Board.  Of course, we practically heard only one side of the story.  Senator Johnson outlined some sort of scheme by which members of the Board can put up their case.  A very nice position it will put the members of the Board in.  The members of the Board were selected, I presume, by the Minister.  From his speeches in the Dáil and here, anybody would come to the conclusion that he had picked a lot of commercial imbeciles.  I know all the members of the original Electricity Board, three of them very casually and two of them intimately.  I have been in constant and intimate commercial association with two members of that Board, Mr. Murphy and Mr. J.C. <Col N="1778" /> Foley.  Both of these gentlemen are extremely competent, careful and able business men, and I cannot, from my knowledge, accept the view that the Minister's speeches would lead one to take.  Truth is the child of time.  I do hope that when all the details are published &mdash; perhaps publication may now injure this great scheme, though I have no misgiving at all as to its success &mdash; the public will see where the convincing case lies.</P>

      <P>The Seanad has been asked to decide only two questions&mdash;whether they will give me a certain number of millions for the purposes of the Electricity Supply Board and whether they will give me £2,000 for Dr. MacLaughlin.  The Seanad is not being asked to condemn anybody or to pass judgment on anybody except to this limited extent that, in so far as they give me £2,000 for Dr. MacLaughlin they will be passing something in the nature of favourable judgment thereby on him.  There is no question of a dispute as between me and the Electricity Supply Board.  Two members of that Board resigned.  I accepted their resignations and I have already stated why I did so.  I did so in answer to a public demand as to what was the difficulty about the Board.  I gave the reasons, mainly contained in quotations from the Board's own letters.  All that is within the memory of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a Bill here the main clause of which asks that two millions should be placed at the disposal of the Board, subject to two limitations&mdash;(1) that the Minister for Finance &ldquo;may&rdquo; give it, and (2) that he may give it only if the Minister for Industry and Commerce certifies that the sums are reasonably and properly required. The amendment seeks to leave in the Minister for Finance and to take me out.  Through loose thought, but not, I think, by intention, it seeks to keep in the Minister for Finance leaving him only empowered to give, but not obliged to give.  It seeks to leave me out and, if I am right in interpreting the real purpose of the proposer of the <Col N="1779" /> amendment, it seeks to give to a Board, of which obviously Senator Connolly has not very much regard, two millions as and when they require it.  The Board in question is not the old Board, but the present Board.  As Senator Johnson pointed out, by the amendment as phrased the Minister for Finance would be empowered to grant, but not obliged to grant.  I am glad to see that in this House the contention is dropped that it was the Minister for Finance and his officials who tried to interfere; that they were the hidden hand and that I was merely acting as the Ministry's agent.  That apparently will now have to go by the board, because it is I who am to be taken out.</P>
    <P>I hope that Senators admire the cogency of the arguments of Senator Connolly with regard to taking out the Minister for Industry and Commerce. There has been a one-sided account of the dispute, declares the Senator, and therefore he seeks to take out the Minister for Industry and Commerce and leave in the Minister for Finance. There has been no information given to the House, he says, and therefore &mdash; I do not know why the argument should flow but apparently it does, according to Senator Connolly's logic &mdash; the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be removed and the Minister for Finance left in.  There has been a refusal to set up a committee &mdash; it was described by Senator Connolly as a committee of both Houses, and by Senator O'Doherty as a judicial committee, and there is a big difference between the two &mdash; and therefore the Senator says that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be removed, leaving the Board to demand and the Minister for Finance still there to refuse.  The logic is rather peculiar but, nevertheless, that is the argument.  There was a dispute in 1929 and, the Senator declares: I came here in July of that year, and made a statement which engendered confidence in the Board.</P>
    <P>The Senator is not quite accurate in his facts.  There was no dispute at that date.  There had been one, but it was finished.  Because I made some <Col N="1780" /> statement in 1929 which the Senator does not precisely appreciate, and the relationship of which to this amendment is to me very remote, he says: &ldquo;Remove the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but leave the Board to demand and the Minister for Finance to give if he likes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that I said I had no information.  The fact is that even yet I cannot give the information I feel I ought to give to the House. The Senator asked what were the duties of Mr. Fay, Mr. Leydon and Mr. Browne on the Board.  There were two of them on the Board since September, 1929, and Mr. Browne was there since February, 1930.  The Senator placed them in this dilemma, that they either did not know what they should look for or that they were inefficient in the gathering of what they should have sought.  There is another situation.  It is clear from the Board's own letters that, no matter how those officials tried, they could not get the information they required. In regard to Mr. Browne, he has done this much: he has revealed very quickly, and he has got the Board to agree to his revelation, that there was a very bad state of things with regard to the accounts, with regard to a financial plan, with regard to the system, or rather lack of system, upon which the tariffs of the Board were based. I consider that that was very good work.  The Senator cannot understand the failure to secure the information regarded as essential.  He presumes that the Board had weekly or monthly financial statements before it.  That is a criterion by which one might judge the Board.  Judged by that, the Board fails.  So far as I am informed, there may have been financial statements occasionally put before the Board, but they were afterwards found to be inaccurate. A well-known example has already been placed before the House. The Board entered on the purchase of the Cork undertaking in the belief that it could be completed with the sum of two and a half millions.  They told us in February and April of this year that at that date they realised that that purchase drove them over the edge.  If they had realised it in time they said this year they would <Col N="1781" /> have approached the Executive Council, so that the situation might then have been remedied.  They entered on the purchase of half a million pounds' worth of property believing that they could keep within a certain sum, and they discovered about a year later that their action had driven them completely beyond the limits imposed upon them.  If the financial statement on which the purchase of Cork was based is the sort of financial statement that was ordinarily made to the Board, or that was called for by the Board from its servants, it will indicate the value of the type of information upon which they were relying.  I take a second example.  They wrote to me this year to say that the agreement made in August, 1929 was broken in December, 1929, or at the latest in January, 1930. They admit in a series of statements that they spent half a million in the year 1930.  In March of this year they said to me that they were not precisely able to ascertain with even approximate accuracy what the real position in respect of capital commitments was.  That was to excuse an excess expenditure of £270,000 prior to June, 1930.  Their excuse for the expenditure after June, 1930 was that it was consequential on the money previously spent in excess but in ignorance of their position.  You have a Board capitalised to the extent of two and a half millions on this side of their work, and in the year 1930 they did not know to the nearest quarter of a million what their capital commitments were.  Notwithstanding this, the Senator still thinks that, being a good Board, they must have had a financial statement before them at each fortnightly or monthly meeting. They did not get such a statement on their own showing, and that is the reason why I am in my present position. I have referred to the fact that five, seven, and later seventeen members of an outside staff of auditors are endeavouring to remake records that should have been there &mdash; records absolutely essential if proper accounts were to be presented to anybody, even to the members of the Board.  If I am asked why Mr. Browne has not done more since he was appointed, I say in reply that five members of an outside <Col N="1782" /> staff of auditors were employed in June last; there were seven employed since September, and there were seventeen from some other period of this year, and they have not been able to get the matter right yet.  Let me refer to the sort of information I got after the event.</P>
    <P>I heard towards the end of last year that the position of the Board was one of chaos; that every department needed reorganisation &mdash; that the accounts side, the contracts side, the house-wiring side, the collection and other departments were disorganised, that invoices were thousands in arrears, that the costings department could not produce costings and that there was no co-ordination between the different branches.  I got a letter towards the end of last year referring to specific dates by which promises had been made to give me accounts.  This letter said that owing to the arrears which it was necessary to undertake these particulars could not be furnished until certain later dates which were set out. I was told in February of this year that in June, 1930 the Board approved the suggestion that the auditors should supply their staff in bringing the accounts up to date; that since then five, and later seven, had been engaged on the work.  I was told later in February of this year that the position was that the purchase side was disorganised, that invoices were in arrear, having been overlooked, mislaid or destroyed, that the whole business had to be reorganised. I was told the contracts and wiring sides, and stores, owing to loose and incomplete recording, had to be subject to a complete overhaul.  I was told that stock had not been taken at any proper date and that most of the recording work was in arrear and would soon reach a dangerous position. I was told, again, that an outside auditors' staff had been engaged to clear up the arrears and had since June, 1930 been continuously engaged on this, so that in February, 1931 arrears had been cleared to a degree which caused much less anxiety.</P>

      <P>Except the statement I first referred to to-day, which was an interview with the Chairman of the Board.  In March the Board wrote expressing regret that they had broken the agreement made with the Executive Council and pointing out in extenuation that information was not available, owing to imperfections in the Board's organisation, to enable the Board to ascertain, with even approximate accuracy, what the real position was.  The recording system had fallen so much into arrears that figures could not be produced.  Later in that letter they said that the agreement made in August, 1929 was broken in December of that year, because up to June, 1930 the Board was not in a position to know what the capital expenditure incurred was.  The records were in arrear, figures were incomplete and unreliable. They added &mdash; all this, remember, in March, 1931 &mdash; that when they wrote in June, 1930 they expected that they would be released from the agreement as soon as reliable information was forthcoming.  They go on to state &mdash; still it is their letter of March, 1931 to which I refer:&mdash;&ldquo;The arrears have turned out to be more serious than it was thought, and it is not therefore possible to produce the accounts up to 31st March, 1930.&rdquo;  I wrote to the Board myself in March of this year, following the receipt of that letter, saying that my position in regard to that was this: That while they were sanctioning huge sums that they had not provided themselves with machinery to ascertain even approximately what their commitments were, and would not be able to state that with any precision for months.</P>
      <P>This, I said, seemed to me to be an admitted fault in elementary finance and in prudence.  I added that I concluded from their letter that their accounting departments were in chaos, and pointed out that the Board had, by June, 1930, been in existence for two and a half years; yet the records were not out of chaos in March 1931, after nearly three and a half years had elapsed since the Board had been founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April, still in the year 1931, the <Col N="1784" /> Board returned again to say that the agreement was rendered impossible by the acquisition of Cork, which was entered upon in the belief that it would be kept within that agreement. Otherwise there would have been an approach to the Excutive Council to secure release from the agreement. They had hoped to be able to give the detailed information required by me to entertain the idea of release from the agreement, but their hopes had been frustrated by the delay in preparing final accounts.</P>
    <P>That is the Board's record from their own letters.  Senator Connolly, despite all this, and despite what has been already said, after a preamble about loose talk and a preamble about loose thinking in the country, goes on to say that he is satisfied that the scheme is sound, and can be made pay, even if this £2,000,000 and another £2,000,000 have to be added to it.</P>
    <P>I would like to get writing a series of letters to the Senator, in order to find out on what he bases that hope. I asked the Board two or three years ago if they were optimistic as to certain important points, and if they could supply me with figures upon which they based their optimism.  I now ask the Senator a similar question, as I do not want futile optimism in any part of this.  The Senator at any rate is satisfied about the matter, and one of the reasons for his satisfaction is that there is a rumour about the town that the income of the Electricity Supply Board will soon be a million and a quarter.  If that income is released, everything, he concludes, is going to be right.  He is satisfied with his conclusion, and satisfied with this rumour, even after the preamble about loose talk and loose thinking.  I wonder does the rumour detail what capital expenditure there has to be to earn one and a quarter million, and what system of charges must there be in order to bring in a revenue of one and a quarter million.  It is only when we get answers to question like that that we will know where we are.  But to return to the Bill and the amendment, apparently the Senator's optimism and his preamble about loose talk and <Col N="1785" /> loose thinking are the reasons which induced him to put down the amendment to remove the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and to hand over two and a half million pounds to the Board, with or without the control of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There are only two other points to which I wish to refer.  Senator Johnson said that I have had the fullest opportunity to make my case. I have already said I had not.  If I had had to dismiss people, and was put in the position of coming here to tell the House why I had dismissed them, I could make my real case.  The case has not yet been fully made. It may be made much more fully yet. Senator Dowdall says that only one side has been heard.  I deny that. Referring to two people who spoke in the Dáil, I said that one of the two speeches had been made in the Dáil on information supplied by the Managing Director.</P>
    <P>I said so at the time, and it was not denied.  I pointed out then that, apart from other remarks, one phrase had been used in that speech which clearly indicated peculiar jealousy towards my liaison officer, and said that, to me, that clearly demonstrated that the speech had been made on the information supplied by the Managing Director. I pointed out that another Deputy's speech contained all the thought of the Managing Director, and I know that that Deputy had been in close association with the Managing Director nights before that speech was made.  Therefore I submit that what is called the other side has been heard as well.</P>
    <P>Senator Dowdall referred to commercial imbeciles.  I hope the House will accept it that I never used that phrase.  That phrase is of the Senator's own coining.  I have read letters from the Board, but I have not passed such a judgment in regard to them.  I am now asking this House for £2,000,000. I ask that there ought to be two checks: (1) the Minister for Finance, and (2) the certificate of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that certain things are reasonably and properly required.  Finally, I would ask this House, when deciding on this matter, not to act on this point as the Dáil did, <Col N="1786" /> but to have a division on the point.  The point, and the point raised by the amendment, is who wants this Board left to carry on without check or control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better explain my difficulty with regard to putting down an amendment to this Bill at all. There was very little, if anything, that one could amend in it except the amount of the Vote, and even that would not be meeting exactly what I wanted to convey, namely, a vote of no confidence in the Minister.  That is frankly what I wanted.  What I would have preferred, if I had an opportunity, was to make certain recommendations, or to ask the House to accept certain recommendations, to have this Committee established and to define what it was going to do.  My idea is that that Committee should, first of all, go into the question of the rights and wrongs of this regrettable and miserable conflict of opinion and then to find out what experts, if any, were needed and report to the House anything that the House and the Dáil might want to know.  My amendment does not mean anything except what was said &mdash; a vote of no confidence in the Minister.  I do not think that we have heard anything which will restore our confidence in the Minister.  Senator Johnson put his finger on one of the big issues, and that is the great necessity that still exists for satisfying the public.  There is only one thing that will satisfy the public, and that is a full statement of all that has occurred.  The Minister has, on numerous occasions, read extracts from letters and reports from the Board.  I frankly am not satisfied.  If letters and statements are to be quoted we ought to get the full letters and the full statements and not extracts from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, of course, has no use for the logic that we use in making our case.  I have no particular reason for asking that the Minister for Finance should be the sole Minister responsible, except the reason that I have given. I think it is not unreasonable that one should feel uncomfortable about the position in the future &mdash; that the Minister will still be handling the Board &mdash; particularly when one realises what work the Board did <Col N="1787" /> up to a certain point.  Senators have to realise how enamoured the Minister was of the Board at one time, then his sudden change of front, and now his condemnation, particularly of the engineer that was on the Board.  I am still dissatisfied.  The Minister had representatives on the Electricity Supply Board since September, 1929.  When making my case.  I asked very definitely and specifically what information or details these people had given him. The Minister did not reply to that.  I asked if they had made complaints and if they had presented reports to him, and if not, why not?  I asked, as the Minister was responsible to this House and to the other House, why he was not informed by the representatives he had on the Board, and if informed why he did not take these steps at an earlier date?  The Minister said that Messrs. Fay, Browne or Leyden could not get any information.  Does anyone think that a man will sit on a Board for a year or a year and a half if he cannot get information, and particularly if he is there representing the Executive or a Department?  Is it reasonable to assume that he will sit on a Board from September, 1929, to March or April, 1931, if he cannot get information?  I do not want to be too severe about this, but I cannot conceive any ordinary individual, not to speak of a man who is supposed to be competent, remaining on a Board if he cannot get information, and particularly when that information relates to financial matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Cork purchase and to the fact that an agreement was broken.  We know how it was broken.  We know that the Board at no time admitted the practicability of the agreement.  Under cross-examination last week, the Minister admitted that it was because of his threat to bring two amendments to the Dáil that the Board yielded.  That sort of agreement is no good to anyone. It is simply holding a pistol at the head of a man or a Board and saying: &ldquo;You have got to do this according to what I think or I will bring in two amendments which will deal with you.&rdquo;  The Minister admitted that it was a threat.  I suggest that a technical <Col N="1788" /> blunder was made and that the Minister did not face up to it when it was realised that possibly more money was going to be needed.  I am not condoning or excusing the accounts or the absence of accounts or documents, or the chaotic condition into which these have got.  There is one fact that I want to point out, that on the financial side the Minister had representation from a certain date, and that he should have been able to take action earlier than he did.</P>
    <P>As a result of this financial chaos, it seems to me that we run the risk of losing the most brilliant engineer that Ireland has got.  I do not know the gentleman, but his work stands.  I have spoken to people from different parts of the world who, looking on the Shannon scheme, say that it is a wonderful job: one of the most wonderful jobs that has ever been done.  We cannot get away from the fact that one of the things that is happening now is that we are losing the founder and the inspiration of the Shannon scheme. What I am protesting against &mdash; I want to have this on the records &mdash; is that we are losing him without trial, without giving him an opportunity of being heard, apart from the statements published over his own name in the newspapers, and from these it is quite obvious that he has not let himself go!</P>
    <P>We have had read for us certain extracts from letters and from reports. Why are we not given the whole story? Why not have all the cards put on the table so that we may see where we are?  I do not presume for a moment that the Minister has anything to be afraid of.  I do not presume that any member of the Board has anything to be afraid of.  If that be the position, why not put all the cards on the table and let us know where we are?  There is one other factor to be considered. I discussed this matter with a friend who is in the electrical business &mdash; the question of increased expenditure for capital purposes.  He said to me: &ldquo;There is one thing you have always got to remember with regard to electricity supply, and that is that if you are going to get a customer for electricity you are going to have to pay a capital charge on every new customer <Col N="1789" /> you get.&rdquo;  I confess that is an aspect of the question that I had not adverted to before, but it is obviously so. The question, therefore, is: Was the Board trying to get consumption for an enormous quantity of electric current so as to make the scheme ultimately economic; and, if so, did that entail capital expenditure beyond even what had been estimated?  All these things, I feel, might be ironed out and straightened out, and the pessimism that has been created, mainly by the Minister's attitude, can be dispelled perhaps very quickly.</P>
    <P>The Minister asks me, in a loose way, why I conclude that the Shannon Scheme can be made economic?  I so conclude for one reason.  Last week I raised a question with regard to the sinking fund and interest.  I did not get any information on that any more than I got information on the various points that I raised to-day.  For instance, I asked was it true that we had not an electrical engineer on the Board?  I have got no answer to that. There was another question that I asked last week on which I got no information.  With the two millions now being voted, I stated that the amount of money that will have been sunk in the Shannon Scheme is ten and one-third million pounds.  At 5 per cent.  I figure it out that the interest on that will be £517,800.  If, <Col N="1790" /> as I have been informed, the total revenue coming in from the sale of electric current will in a year or so amount to £1,250,000, I feel that we are on a reasonable basis even within our present capital, or even with another million or two millions.  But that is beside the point.  The point is, is confidence going to be restored in the country?  The House may do what it likes with this amendment &mdash; it may turn it down or it may pass it &mdash; but the point is, unless all the facts are made public, we are not going to restore confidence.  It is a matter for the House to consider what it will do. Other people may be, and perhaps are, more interested than we are.  I put the amendment down for the deliberate purpose of moving a vote of no confidence in the Minister.  It was the only way in which I could convey what I felt.  I still have no confidence, but in view of the position I am anxious to withdraw the amendment, as it has served the purpose that I wanted it to serve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;Section 3, Sub-section (2).  To delete in line 27 the word &lsquo;two&rsquo; and to substitute therefor the word &lsquo;one.&rsquo;&rdquo;  The meaning of the amendment is to reduce from two millions to one million the total amount of money which may be advanced under this Bill.  I am sure Senators must have felt, as a result of the discussions which have taken place in regard to the Shannon Scheme, and in regard to the operations of the Board, that there has been created in the public mind a feeling of uneasiness, a feeling that two million pounds of the money of the public has been lost or has strayed &mdash; I will not say stolen, but I will use the phrase of the old advertisement, &ldquo;lost, stolen or strayed.&rdquo;  The people of the country have an idea that £2,000,000 is gone wrong.  I do not think any person listening to these debates will come to that conclusion, but I think that any Senator who has followed the statements of the Minister will be satisfied that the Minister does not require £2,000,000 at present. He himself says that £850,000 would be sufficient to meet existing liabilities. Of course, there would be capital charges in respect of each new customer and perhaps £250,000 more would be required.  The total sum which, even on his own showing, he requires at present would be less than £1,000,000.  It would ease the public mind very much if he could accept this amendment and say that in the existing conditions of the country he would be able to get along with £1,000,000.  In the times which are before us it seems to me that £1,000,000 would be of great consequence in the coming autumn, and particularly in the coming winter, and that the people of the country are not at all satisfied to spend £2,000,000 on an undertaking which, in one sense at least, is a luxury undertaking.  If the Minister has £1,000,000 to spare, I think he and the Cabinet will find in the next winter that it would be advisable for them to spend that money in ways which will give direct employment to working men.  This £2,000,000 is not intended to give direct employment.  It will probably be expended on machinery <Col N="1792" /> and appliances of various kinds which will be imported.</P>
      <P>Listening to the Minister to-day, and to some of those who spoke in favour of his point of view, it must be obvious to everybody that there has been a thoroughfare of chaos in connection with this Board.  Accounting, invoices, orders, books, the engineering section, the administrative section, all in arrears, all wrong, all uncoordinated. What surprises me is this, that the Minister, finding that the very able men whom he appointed to the Board some twelve or eighteen months ago have been unable to set the accounts right in that period, has not come to the Oireachtas for further powers to enable him to collect the money.  He has a revenue man on that Board.  A fool can see that a lot of the goods have gone wrong; that goods have been supplied to people and that there is no record of them; that services have been rendered and that there are no records of them.  The obvious thing to do is to come here for legislation and to compel every user of electricity to make a statutory return, just as people are required to make statutory returns for income tax. I am sure that although a large sum of money is outstanding a lot of goods have not yet been paid for and that if vigour and energy and skill are even now applied to the conduct of this Shannon Scheme almost every penny of that money will be recovered and that there is no necessity for a further panicky application for £2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1927 the Minister applied for £2,500,000 to provide for the expenses of distribution of electricity.  He was asked to give some sort of budget, some sort of particulars.  At that time, of course, they were all on the high horse; they were all great men with a great scheme and nothing before them but rosy prospects of success. No particulars were to be given. Four years afterwards we ask for particulars of how that £2,500,000 has been spent, or £2,000,000 of it, and we can get no particulars.  That is the position in which we are.  Of that £2,500,000 which has been voted, in respect <Col N="1793" /> of which £2,000,000 has been spent in the last four years, we have no account whatever of how it has been spent.  The Minister comes forward now, having stated then that £2,500,000 was enough, and he asks in this bad year for £2,000,000 and he will not tell you what he wants it for.  You have no particulars, no estimates, no accounts; you are simply asked for £2,000,000 on your allegiance to the Party machine.</P>
    <P>I really did feel humiliated for our country when I heard some of the statements made by the Minister in reference to transactions carried on by this Board.  Accounts wrong, invoices wrong, everything wrong.  I felt that the young supermen were, after all, common clay like ourselves, and I felt the most intense regret that men were not selected for practical commercial and scientific knowledge and wide business experience, including that of electricity supply.  These are the qualifications required by an older Government than ours from the members of an Electricity Board.  If these qualifications had been insisted upon in 1927, probably the 2½ millions would have been sufficient, probably it would never be necessary for the Minister to do what he will have to do, namely, pass a law requiring every person who has any electrical machinery or who has got any current to make a declaration under penalty.  He will have to do that in the end, because, of course, this country cannot stand over public property, public goods and public services going wrong in the way which has been admitted here.  Why did not the Minister do that?  I do not know why he did not do it.  I think he ought to be much more modest in his demands to-day. He has made no case for any sum of money exceeding £850,000.  I am willing to concede him another £250,000 to give him elbow room to carry on. But he has very little appreciation of the anger of the people of the country when he asks, without any reason whatever, for an additional £1,000,000. I wish somebody had said something to allay the annoyance and alarm which people feel.</P>
    <P>The Cork enterprise has been mentioned. That was purchased for <Col N="1794" /> £500,000.  There were unlooked-for further expenses.  Why did not the Minister or somebody tell us the reason for this increased expenditure? It was perfectly obvious it was due to the necessity for machinery, resulting from the change-over from direct current to alternating current.  I believe that is the case.  Of course probably the Board ought to have seen to that, but, whether they should or not, that expenditure has been incurred, and I think that money has been paid.  Now I am very curious to know what the Minister requires this additional million for.  Does he require it for constructional work?  Does he want to put up new plant for power?  Because if he does I think he is unwise at the present time.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Shannon in its present state of construction is capable of running three turbines of 30,000 horsepower each on a full flood.  It is also well known to people who reside in the West that in some years the waters of the Shannon run low and may not be able to supply power for more than one turbine.  In that state of affairs there must be, of course, auxiliary power.  The Minister has already sufficient auxiliary power.  He has it at the Pigeon House, Dublin; he has it in Cork, he has it in Limerick, and he has it in Dundalk.  He has auxiliary power at four different stations.  And unless he has the most urgent reason for requiring this extra million I think he ought to be satisfied with one million.</P>
    <P>He told us on Second Reading that this was a Committee point, and that he would give us some idea in the Committee Stage of the purposes for which he required this second million. He has not done so yet.  I hope he will do so before he requires you, upon your allegiance to the Party, and upon his own good looks, to give him the other extra million of money which this country cannot afford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot support this amendment.  The Minister all through has made it definitely clear that the sum of £2,500,000, which was the estimated figure granted to the Board in the first instance, was not a fixed maximum. Very frankly he told us that <Col N="1795" /> and gave some details on which the figure was founded, and the Board seemed to agree.  But nevertheless it was quite clear that that was not a maximum figure in all the eventualities that might arise.  He told us in his speech the day he introduced this matter that in this current year the number of units of electricity which he estimated would be sold, in the first instance at 83 of a penny per unit of supply, and subsequently changed to 9 of a penny per unit, would give such a revenue as would meet all the charges &mdash; expenses, sinking fund and interest.  It seems to me when this entanglement of the Electricity Board is worked out that then it is quite possible that if the Board is at fault it is because they developed more rapidly and sold current more rapidly than they had budgeted for.  If that is the case, any limitation of the money asked for now might thwart them rather than help to forward the scheme.  In addition to that, we have decided that there shall be two checks upon the disbursement of the money.  And whether we vote two millions or twenty millions, by the time it has passed through the net of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and gets his fiat and certificate, and is then subsequently dealt with by the Minister for Finance, we may feel sure that no expenditure will be allowed to get through that is not amply justified by the merits of the expenditure itself.  In these circumstances the moneys expended will not be lost, and I think it is safer not in any way to limit the rapid development of the scheme by limiting the money to one million.</P>

      <P>After listening to this debate and other debates on this subject, I ask myself what have we accomplished or what do we expect to accomplish by the debate we are prolonging here to-day.  Senator Comyn, I know, always wants to accomplish something.  He told us that the country is angered and alarmed at what has been occurring.  But what is it that is creating anger and alarm in the country?  Is it not debates like this? If every amendment which has been <Col N="1796" /> moved here were accepted, what would be accomplished?  What does Senator Comyn think would be accomplished if the Minister told us that he could get on with one million when he knew he could not get on with less than two millions?  Would it lead to anger and alarm in the country?  Why, of course not.</P>
      <P>We are creating an amount of suspicion and doubt all over the country, about the greatest enterprise that was ever carried through in any country. Everybody who was called in to see the Shannon Scheme was proud of its success, and we all glory in its success. Experts from all parts of the world who examined the scheme bore testimony to the work done, and to the way in which it had been done.  It is quite true, as the Minister said, that when it came to the secondary stage dealing with the supply of electricity, things did not turn out as was expected. There has been talk of a vote of censure, and complaints that explanations asked for were not given. The Minister gave as much explanation as he could at present, and he has promised that later on he will give fuller explanations.  Surely if anyone wants to move a vote of censure, that would be the proper time to do it, and not on this occasion.  I appeal to the Seanad to bring this discussion to a close.  I know Senator Comyn does not attach much importance to this amendment.  I know that he realises and other Senators realise that when he says the Minister could do with one million, he knows he could not.  The Senator is doing what he has a perfect right to do, and that is to give us his views, which are always welcome.  I think we have had a fair expression of views from Senators, and I appeal to them now that it is time to bring this debate to a close. I appeal to Senator Comyn to withdraw his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>In my remarks on the Second Reading, I referred to the question of the second million.  The Minister on that occasion explained that it was a committee point with which he had already dealt in the Dáil.  I have since taken pains to <Col N="1797" /> read up the discussion in the Dáil, and I am perfectly satisfied that the Minister has made a case for this second million.  The Minister gave the figures in the Dáil with regard to the second million.  The first million, it is understood, is to be provided for the purpose of making up the deficiency in the Board's accounts at the present moment, and the bulk of the figures constituting the second million were given in the Dáil.  I am perfectly satisfied that if Senator Comyn had read the discussion in the Dáil, and the Minister's statement, he would not have moved the amendment to-day because the Minister certainly did give the figures there.  Any person who desires that this great national undertaking shall be made a success certainly would not refuse to grant this money, because if the second million is not granted it means that you are going to starve the Board of money that is actually required to enable it to carry on, and to make this great national undertaking the success it should be.  Looking up the figures, I see that a sum of £150,000 is required for the reconstruction of networks and a sum of £133,000 for safeguarding the supplies of Dublin and Rathmines, and, I think, of Limerick and Cork.  I have gone into the various items as they appear in the Official Report of the Minister's speech and I am satisfied that if we agree to give one million we must agree to give two millions.  If we agree that the Board should get £1,000,000 to make up the deficiency in its accounts, we must agree to give the second million for the purpose of completing the work that has been taken in hand to make this great national undertaking a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to two or three statements that have been made.  Senator Comyn brought into his Second Reading speech on this Bill the same point which he laboured to-day on this matter of the amount of money which is being asked &mdash; that a better use might be made of that money in the peculiar circumstances likely to attend upon the coming autumn or winter than will be made of it if voted for this special purpose. <Col N="1798" /> Two things ought to be kept separate. If it is shown that the people of this country want electricity to replace other forms of heat or illumination, and if the sum of £3,000,000 or £5,000,000 were required for this purpose, it would be easy to get that money if it could be shown that it would be remunerated. It should be easier, on the basis on which we started, to get that money than to get money for the telephone system, because the telephone system admits certain deficiencies, whereas we set out originally with the aim that the scheme was not going to cost the taxpayer anything, and we still have that aim.  I often put it to the Board that there was that analogy with capital required for telephone extension, and if they wanted more money, so long as I had a case to put before the Dáil and Seanad, I had no doubt about getting the money.  But I had to be able to show that it would be remunerated.  If there is money wanted for other capital developments, or developments of a business type, there is no doubt that our credit is so high that we can get any amount of money.  That, however, is entirely different from money for relief works or charity money.  I am not asking for this money on the supposition that there are, say, £3,000,000 in the Exchequer, of which £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 were to be devoted to charity, leaving only £1,000,000 for business development.  We can get any amount of money for capital development so long as we can show a business case for it and, particularly, we can get it for water power, since the first stage development of the Shannon scheme proper and the long distance transmission side has been so successful.</P>
      <P>The Senator has asked me why I did not put on the Board men who &mdash; I took down this portion of the phrase&mdash;&ldquo;had wide practical experience and commercial experience and some experience of electrical undertakings.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to have that foot-rule run over the five or six or seven people who were on that Board from time to time and find how many would have been precluded by that test, if adopted as part of the legislation.  None.  But within the terms stated by the Senator <Col N="1799" /> I could get as complete a set of duds as I might get under a Bill that allowed me to appoint men without qualifications precisely stated.  The Senator also said that we find now that &ldquo;the young supermen have feet of common clay.&rdquo;  If that is by way of reference to a certain group &mdash; the Executive Council&mdash;I pass it over for the moment.  If it is supposed to have reference to the people who engineered this scheme, I object vigorously to the use of such a phrase.  I join that phrase with another used by the Senator&mdash;that this scheme has excited universal admiration.  If it has excited admiration, that admiration has been excited mainly in quarters where there used to be apprehension, and in respect of the side about which there was the greatest measure of anxiety &mdash; the constructional side.  Many people warned me when we were entering upon the £5,200,000 expenditure that the cost of that side of the work was going to run to double that figure &mdash; not an increase arising from extra generation, but simply that the cost would mount up roughly to £11,000,000 instead of £5,000,000.  That part of the scheme has been carried out successfully, and, as Senator Farren pointed out, in conjunction with two Government Departments and without any great touch with the commercial side of life in this country.  The work of the people who did carry out that scheme, the engineers &mdash; I am not going to apply the phrase &ldquo;supermen&rdquo; to them &mdash; and the administrative people who went with them &mdash; the work of these people, professional engineers, civil servants, and everybody else connected with that section of the scheme, must be properly commended and acknowledged at some time.  Some time or other it will be possible to disengage the names and apportion praise, as praise should be apportioned, to the people concerned with that part of the work.  Any laudatory return which this country makes them will be richly deserved &mdash; and all this without talking of supermen.</P>
    <P>So far as the other side of the scheme is concerned, I have not yet said anything derogatory to the <Col N="1800" /> capacity of the numerous people engaged on that side.  Certain things were allowed to get into a particular state by those whose duty it was to direct, and excuses are made even for that.  One thing I have objected to &mdash; that any attempt should be made to put blame upon the staff.  That has been done, and done very unfairly. Some of the staff employed on that particular work were the staff employed on the constructional work when that was going on, and I have no doubt that such of the staff are as good as ever they were.  The other people got in on the Board's work are as good, I have equally no doubt, as the people who preceded them on the constructional side, but there was, I think, a lack of direction.  I have even said, with regard to individuals in this direction whose names have been mentioned here, that they, if they pursued a policy which was wrong and mistaken &mdash; and to my mind it was wrong and mistaken &mdash; they pursued it honestly.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to new plant for development of extra power. There is no money being looked for in this Bill precisely for new power, but I explained in the Dáil that we may get extra power by making such adjustments in the stations retained by way of stand-by that these will enable us to run, not two turbines at Ardnacrusha, but three.  The ordinary process would be to keep one turbine as  stand-by.  With the adjustments that. I have referred to, we may be able to run the whole three.  The Senator expressed doubt that we would get sufficient water to run three turbines, and said the people along the Shannon banks say the levels vary.  They do, of course, but the plant was built out for the driest year over the series of years for which we have records, and those extended over a period of forty years. We may, therefore, get extra power.  I look to getting extra power, but not by way of going on with a second Shannon scheme and so enlarging the Shannon works.  Under a provision of the Electricity Supply legislation, the Board have power to make certain experiments, trial borings, and so on. That work may result in providing extra power, but we do not aim at a <Col N="1801" /> development of Shannon power by additional works.  If there is any additional power secured it will be by reason of the stand-by arrangements to which I have referred.  A certain portion of this money is required for improvements in the stand-by stations, and that, we hope, will enable us to throw in a third turbine at Ardnacrusha and to keep it pretty constantly in use.  That is the plan.  How far it will be pursued remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>Senator Dowdall referred to the estimates of .83d. and to .9d.  I said the difference between those figures corresponds to the difference in the estimate of £5,200,000 and the second and better estimate of £5,700,000, plus the sum of £156,0000 for certain deficiencies. I said that that larger sum of money will be remunerated by the sale at the end of the long distance transmission lines of 148,000,000 units at .9d.  But I must stress that this has nothing to do with the distribution system&mdash;the local distribution networks for which the Board were granted two and a half million pounds as necessary or likely expenditure on a certain plan, for their purposes.  The Senator says that I gave an account of how this calculation of two and a half million pounds was arrived at and he made the remark incidently &ldquo;with which calculation the Board seemed to agree.&rdquo;  The Board did not agree with that calculation.  The Board never had that calculation before them. The managing director had.  It was the managing director's calculation given to me before the Board was established.  Lest anybody should think, if I allowed the observation to pass, that the Board had details of this calculation before them and agreed with it, I wish to say that that is not the case.  The Board had not details of that calculation before them but the managing director had.</P>
    <P>The Senator went on to say: &ldquo;It may be, however, that the Board has sold current more rapidly than they budgeted for.&rdquo;  I must complain of one word in that statement.  No word like &ldquo;budgeting&rdquo; could be applied to any part of the Board's operations, as I know them.  What I read to-day about their accounts shows that.  How could <Col N="1802" /> anybody say that they budgeted when they did not know at certain stages how their accounts stood?  They went on to sell a certain amount of current. They had very little information&mdash;the correspondence reveals this&mdash;as to what it was costing them to produce that current.  How they arrived at their charges, I do not know.</P>
    <P>Senator Farren has pointed out that I gave the figures as regards the sum now sought in the Dáil.  I did.  They are contained in the report of the 15th July from column 2130 onwards for three columns.  They are there given in as much detail as I could give them at present.  I gave them subject to a number of reservations.  One was that I do not know over what period this money will fall to be expended.  A second is that I do not bind myself to them as precisely as a Minister does in his Departmental estimates, in which he gives heads and sub-heads.  I take this money subject to the right to change from one heading to another.  I may say that we are probably dealing with a fairly prolonged period.  The necessary accounts&mdash;the accounts for the year ended last March&mdash;will not be in my possession until the beginning of next year.  They cannot come before this House with the necessary reports until, I think, round about Easter of next year.  Certain legislation may have to be passed arising out of that. People may say: &ldquo;Tie down to that.&rdquo; I do not think you can.  Works which will have to be operating in the summer or autumn of 1932 must have orders placed for them by the end of this year, possibly.  I do take this limitation upon myself.  I am keeping more or less clearly before me work which has to be started by the summer or autumn of 1932.  I put also the check upon that, that the money will not be spent unless it is going to be remunerated&mdash;the main part of it. There are two checks, as Senator Dowdall stated&mdash;that the money is necessary and is likely to be remuneratively spent.  There is one part for which I take no responsibility&mdash;not £1,000,000, but about £750,000, representing debts accrued.  For that I take no responsibility.  As regards these debts, we will see that the money goes <Col N="1803" /> to the proper persons.  Outside these debts I take responsibility until I come to the House and get myself relieved of it.  The knowledge that I am so far responsible is the stimulus to me to come to the House as soon as possible to get relieved of it.</P>

      <P>The section states that two millions shall be advanced in addition to the sums already authorised, making four and a half millions in all.

      <P>The sums I have in my consideration are the new two millions plus the two and a half millions of the 1927 Act, but less the undischarged liabilities of the municipal undertakings in so far as those have not been paid off.  In other words, I am taking it that the two and a half millions of the 1927 Act have been exhausted by advances already made to the Board to an amount of £1,900,000. In fact there may have been over-advances, but I am not asking for two millions additional to the original two and a half millions discharged of the undertaking.  I am still counting that the undertaking is in force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister an important question.  Is the capital account of the Shannon scheme to be regarded as closed?  Has the account in respect of the original scheme put up by Siemens-Schuckert been closed?  Is the money which we are now voting entirely for supply purposes or will some of it be supplied, if necessary, for the further extension of the Shannon scheme as a scheme, because we have not yet completed what was in the mind of the Government when the Shannon development scheme was started&mdash;extensions round Lough Derg?  There has been talk of bringing in other places which, I take it, would mean capital expenditure.  We do not know whether any of the money which we are now voting will be available for capital expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>None of this money <Col N="1804" /> is intended to be available for capital expenditure direct on extra generation. But I have explained that we will apply some of the money to the Pigeon House.  By applying it to the Pigeon House we may release another turbine at Ardnacrusha and get extra power generated there.  In that sense it may be said we are getting extra power from this money.  There is no new work, however, going to be done along the Shannon except in so far as the Board may have power under the legislation already passed to make experiments, trial borings, and other minor works along the upper loughs.  If I want new power I will make a definite approach to the House.</P>

      <P>The members of the Seanad seem to be willing to vote this money, but I would like to make one observation in reference to the statement of Senator Dowdall.  He said that there are to be two checks on this money.  There is to be the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance; therefore it is all right.  If reasoning of that kind had any weight in a legislative assembly I would be very much surprised, because, if it is true, there is no necessity for a legislative assembly at all.  I wish to say that people having associations with the country are not at all enamoured of any further expenditure on luxury undertakings. Ten million pounds have been spent, or will be spent, on the Shannon scheme.  That is enough for the present. I think it will be many a long day before a Board such as this is given money and a free hand.  It will be many a long day before that happens in this country again.  I think now, having got our lesson, that we ought to give no money to any Board or any organisation except that Board or organisation is under the control of a Minister responsible to Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Seanad is of opinion that better provision should be made for the encouragement and organisation of scientific and industrial research.&rdquo;  The subject is one of importance, and my object in putting it down was to direct attention to its importance, to give an opportunity to the Minister to state the views of his Department and of the Government generally upon the subject, and if the Seanad were favourable to give him, as Minister, the strength that he probably needs in putting his case to the Minister for Finance in preparation for next year's Estimates.  The position in regard to scientific and industrial research is that in 1915, during the war, there was established in Great Britain an organisation with this <Col N="1806" /> specific object.  Ireland was then under the jurisdiction of the British Parliament and, of course, participated as such in any work that was done by that organisation in scientific or industrial research.  The immediate purpose of that organisation had regard to the situation arising out of the war, the possibility of war production and more permanently the situation that would face British industry after the war was over.  It was felt that rival industrial countries had advanced very much further than Britain had done, and if Britain were to keep her trade and maintain the advantageous position she had it was necessary to promote industrial research on scientific lines, and generally to keep ahead in that particular struggle and competition.  Since the change in political relations there has been no organisation of the kind set up in this country.  Looking through the Estimates, taking all the Estimates that one can, the utmost I can find as even being within the remote possibility of being brought under this head is that we are voting about £10,700.  Of that, £8,000 is mainly agricultural, and a good part of the remainder is very doubtfully regarded under this heading, and, in fact, it may be said that there is very little State money going to the financing of research. There is, so far as one can gather, no organisation and co-ordination of that research, and as a consequence such progress as is being made in other countries in this respect is being made at the expense, in the world competition, of this country.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, of very great importance that whatever can be done to stimulate the research work, to organise and direct it into right lines and useful channels, should be done and that it should be taken in hands as early as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could go into a great deal of detail, but I do not want to detain the House too long.  The sum of £700 was voted in this year's Estimates as research grants to students.  I think that sum is probably in the main not wholly devoted to research in pure science and probably not much of it is being devoted to that particular kind <Col N="1807" /> of work that is necessary to bring scientific discovery into direct relationship with industrial activities.  There is undoubtedly a good deal of work being done under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture of a research kind.  How much of that could be related to industrial activity I do not know.  I do not know whether anybody knows.  I think there is no co-ordinating authority.  There is nobody who has the responsibility of preventing overlapping of this kind of industrial and scientific research, and there is no touch, as far as I can gather, between the work being done under the professors of one university and similar work being done under professors of other universities.  We do not know whether any of the industries of the country have research departments and are doing scientific research for their own betterment and benefit, and whether there is any waste of effort of this kind.</P>
    <P>The object of the department that was set up in Britain&mdash;similar organisations have been set up in South Africa, Canada and Australia&mdash;is, as was described very succinctly by Lord Balfour, to shorten the passage between pure science and pure industry, to bring those research students into fruitful study and to relate their work to practical application in industrial activities.  I read, for instance, in a recent report just one of the very many illustrations of what is being done by one of the associations which have been formed under the auspices of the research organisation in Great Britain.  I should say that under the general control of this organisation the various industries have set up their own research organisations.  In the main those industrial organisations are fairly wealthy and extensive, and are able in a degree to finance their own work.  They are aided by grants from this association.  There are research associations associated with the building and wool industry.  As we know, in the North of Ireland there is a good deal of research in connection with the linen industry and so on.  I want to draw attention to this little <Col N="1808" /> illustration of the value in one respect of the Wool Research Association.  It is from the report for 1927-28.  It reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Wool Research Association has succeeded in introducing this year a new woollen ring-spinning frame which is believed to be capable of producing two and a half times as much yarn per spindle as the standard frame and of giving a superior yarn.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That I just quote because we have a wool industry and a woollen cloth-making industry in this country. Unless by some means it is possible for the woollen manufacturers of this country to take advantage of any research results that are being arrived at in Great Britain, it is inevitable that the industry in this country will fail in the competition, and unless we are progressing scientifically in industrial affairs with other countries, no tariff or no protection that we could possibly conceive of would save the industries of this country.  This is quite utilitarian, and it is likely to be the most fruitful expenditure that public money, well directed, could be applied to.  The need is probably greater here than in industrially advanced countries for Government stimulation, a Governmental organ or an organ initiated at the expense of the Government for the encouragement and development of this kind of work.  The British organisation and the Canadian, and, I think, the South African, are based upon advisory committees which consist mainly of scientists combined with men actually engaged in industrial activities.  These associations are charged with assisting, encouraging, and co-ordinating work of scientific research.  What seems to me to be required greatly here is some organisation of the kind, and State money advanced to aid the students, both the novices and the advanced students, to train them in research methods, and, where the student is advanced and is working on a particular line which has the promise of success, that he should be assisted by grants to carry on the work for a few years until he has been <Col N="1809" /> tried out and success or failure has been decided.  We have had, though we do not know a great deal about it, within the last year or two a good deal of encouragement in the fact that one research student, Dr. Drumm, has been engaged in the practical application of scientific knowledge.  I have no more knowledge about that experiment and that proposal than anybody has who reads the newspapers.  But I say that even though that were a complete failure, any money that has been spent upon it would be very well spent, having regard to the encouragement that it is giving to young men and young women who have a scientific bent to apply their brains to work that they believe shows some chance of success.  There is not only one man of that calibre in this country, I am sure.  I am quite sure that in the case of the universities, and even in the case of those who have gone through universities, if we had some scheme whereby men could be encouraged to spend their time in this particular work we would find, and it would be maintained during their application to that work, that that work would eventually be of real benefit to the country and to its prosperity.</P>
    <P>One does not want to prophesy what could be done in this, that or the other thing, or even to indicate lines in which research would probably prove fruitful.  These are matters for the scientists, and for those who have accurate knowledge of this kind of thing.  One can surely surmise that in the deposits of this country there are potentialities, if scientific minds were directed to searching out the possibilities of utilising those peat deposits for the general well-being. We have been told that there are mineral deposits of various kinds in certain parts of the country.  These two should be not only discovered, but the best use to which they could be put found out.  There are numerous ways in which one could suggest that scientific research would be valuable to the country, but unless our students are directed in the best methods of research, and unless they are encouraged to carry out their research for the direct purpose of applying their <Col N="1810" /> knowledge to practical results, we shall not get the benefit of their university training.  They will be lost to the country.  Even though I must admit that we may have to run the risk of losing them to the country after having perhaps spent money on their scholarships and grants, it is miserable to think that so little of the public moneys is being devoted to this work, and that so far as one can find out, so little of private moneys is being devoted to this work.  One reads of certain discoveries.  Even within the last month or two we have heard of the utilisation, by certain methods, of residue from gas works in Belfast as being potentially a very valuable motive agent.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that there are numerous methods in which money, time, and brains can be profitably used in this matter.  I would urge that there is very great need for a good deal of attention being paid to this work in this country, of encouraging the students to devote their attention to the work, of properly directing their work, co-ordinating it, and preventing overlapping, and of inducing the industrialists of the country to spend their time and their money in cooperating with whatever authority may be set up to further the work of scientific research.</P>
    <P>I would like Senators to direct some attention to the importance of this subject.  Perhaps if the Minister has an open mind on the matter he will give some personal attention to the organisation of a permanent scheme. It might not be very satisfactory, if there were another Dr. Drumm, that the promise of his work should be dependent upon the chance co-operation of a Minister who might be enthusiastic in supporting it.  We do not want to run the risk of the work of such a man being lost.  We want to have something in the nature of a permanent organisation to which such a man could present his proposals and suggestions. If these proposals gave any faint promise of success, the originator would have some assurance that he would be maintained during the carrying out of researches.</P>

      <P>I will second the proposal. Senator Johnson is apparently not aware that there are already excellent research departments connected with various industries throughout the country.  The question of research really resolves itself into the question of a career.  If you give a student a research scholarship amounting to £500 over a period of five years you embarrass his career.  The Government Departments are very well equipped and it must be remembered that if we start upon a new constitution of education it will require very deep Government consideration.  Senator Johnson omitted to mention the peat project.  The molecule in peat cannot be broken up, except by the strongest electrical shock.  The Germans have considered the matter and they believe that they would require from 30 to 40 square miles of bog on which to experiment.  There is very little likelihood of the people who hold turbary in this country clearing out on the off-chance of a world revolution in peat.</P>
      <P>This country is very rife in the matter of invention.  It was an Irishman who invented the Dunlop tyre and the internal combustion engines that ultimately enabled fliers to cross the Atlantic. There was another aerial invention which does not get much credit. I refer to the discovery by Thwaites how to make an effervescing drink. Marconi's wireless discovery was anticipated by an Irishman, a professor in Trinity College.  At the time it was regarded by the Royal Dublin Society more or less as a system of magnetism. Not a single man in Europe recognised its importance at the time.  The country is rife in talent.  It is purely a matter of ways and means.  No student will accept even a £500 scholarship if it is not going to lead to something.  You will have to put down £100,000 if you want a man to sacrifice his career.  Many people would prefer to put the money into bricks and mortar and afterwards admire the beauty of the building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of many researches are in abeyance.  There is an astonishing demand for knowledge about certain things in this country, and that does <Col N="1812" /> not seem to be generally realised.  Many researches were carried out under such curmudgeon circumstances that people got a distaste for them.  It is known for instance, that the sea is full of fish and that the fish reach a different level because the food seeks a different level in the winter.  Of course our fishing fleets always make a point of being back in time for the cinema and therefore there is a certain amount of difficulty in following the fish to the different levels.</P>
    <P>This is a very important motion, and I am sure the Minister will not lose sight of it.  We have in this country a chemical industry, Guinness's industry and Jacob's industry.  In these industries experiments are taking place every day.  An important lesson can be learned from the Germans.  When they were being hammered in the war they were able to produce nitrates from the air.  I do not suppose anyone in Ireland could produce anything like that from the air.</P>

      <P>I will support this motion with great enthusiasm.  I am glad that Senator Gogarty seconded it. We had from him a most eloquent discourse on a number of very interesting things, including the habits of fish.  I hope codfish were included in that category.  It is a remarkable thing that the excellent speech made by Senator Johnson on a most important subject was delivered to practically empty benches, and Senator Gogarty almost feared that he might not have a quorum to listen to him.</P>

      <P>Of course the Senator does not care twopence whether or not he had a quorum.  I am not concerned with Senator Gogarty's opinion.  What I am concerned with is the importance of this subject, and the fact that there was not a full Seanad to listen to the excellent speech made by Senator Johnson.  Within the last ten or fifteen years the question of scientific and industrial research has become most important. Science has advanced at a tremendous rate, and the application of science to industry has been seriously <Col N="1813" /> considered in the leading countries of the world.  It is given serious consideration in Italy, Belgium, France, the United States and England.  In London they have a great organisation for scientific and industrial research. We cannot avail of that.  In Italy Mussolini is not far behind, and one of the most significant things he ever said was: &ldquo;We must apply science to industry in order that we may find food for our people, not merely on the surface of the ground, but under the ground.&rdquo;  That is a phrase of tremendous significance.  If this motion were proposed in Italy there would not be a paucity of Senators in the House to listen to it.</P>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister found time to listen to Senator Johnson's speech.  Although I have not very much to praise the Minister about, and, of course, it is not part of my business to do so, I believe he takes a very lively interest in scientific matters.  We have been a very backward people on this question of scientific research.  Notwithstanding Senator Gogarty's great eminence as a surgeon, notwithstanding Dr. Drumm, notwithstanding the tyre that Senator Gogarty claims was invented by an Irishman, that Englishmen claim to have been invented by an Englishman, and that I contend was invented by a man of my own profession, we are a backward people so far as science and the application of science to industry are concerned.  I have some little foibles and peculiarities of my own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Gogarty will readily admit that.  One of these peculiarities is that I have a great interest in science and the application of science to industry.  I believe that if ever I am remembered at all it will not be because of any passages between Senator Gogarty and myself in the Seanad, but rather will it be for encouraging the Government in the pursuit of science and in developing the great resources of this country.  I have in mind the phosphate deposits in the West of Ireland.  There is in the West of Ireland a boundless treasure, not <Col N="1814" /> merely on the ground but under the ground.</P>
      <P>A few little facts are sometimes better than a wealth of statement.  I find the greatest possible difficulty in getting proper scientific assistance in this country, because nobody is paid to give it.  There are very able men here, but they are not paid or expected to give the assistance which men require. You have a very great geological department here; you have splendid men in your National University; you have splendid scientific men; you have great chemists.  In Trinity College I got the greatest possible assistance and the greatest courtesy from the professors.  Still, within the last six months I had to go into co-operation with Imperial Chemicals in Yorkshire and London, where they are carrying out special experiments at their own expense and partly at my expense.  I think that a motion of this kind ought to be received with the greatest possible respect in this Seanad.  I am certain it will meet with consideration from the Minister, whom, I understand, Senator Johnson wishes to interest more than the Seanad itself.  I do believe that this is a most important motion, and it is one that ought to commend itself to sensible and reasonable men, not merely in this Seanad, but in the country.  It is a motion that ought to be taken very seriously.  It is a motion that does perhaps afford here and there an opportunity for witticisms.  But it is not a question of wit and it is not a question of amusement.  It is a question of the bread and butter, of the livelihood not merely of young Irishmen of this time, but Irishmen of succeeding generations. Unless you do something towards scientific and industrial research you will have trouble with the young men who are growing up in this country and who need employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. Barrington Mr. Barrington">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrington</NameTxt>
      <P>Much as I am in sympathy with the object that Senator Johnson has in view, and much as I desire that research should be forwarded, I must say that I cannot imagine a more fertile way of wasting public money than the establishment of a special research department by money directly supplied by the Government. <Col N="1815" /> I do not know whether Senator Johnson is aware of the great number of concerns in this country that are fostering research work.  I do not know if the Senator knows how nearly all the larger industrial concerns here have establishments of their own for research work.  I know that the Chemical Manure Manufacturers have got their own offices for research. Messrs. Guinness have got their own staff, and so have Messrs. Jacob their own staff of experimental chemists. The linen people have their own staffs.</P>
      <P>Outside things immediately connected with special industries there are a great many other institutions working along these lines.  I happen to be a member of the Science Committee of the Royal Dublin Society, and they are always giving grants for research work.  There are perpetual applications coming up to us every year for grants to enable various investigations to be carried out, and various things to be started.  Always there is the most sympathetic consideration given to these applications. We have made grants within the last two years to provide university students in the University College, Cork with the means of carrying on research.  These students have been trying to experiment in improving on the methods of extracting various essences.  They have had most satisfactory results.  Another grant has been made lately through the professors in the Galway University College for the same purpose, and the most wonderful work has been done at the Albert College and in the National University by my friend Professor Drew and Dr. Paul Murphy in the matter of investigating the diseases of plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there are scholarships given by the different county councils.  I know of cases in which young students have been anxious to investigate certain objects, and they have applied and have got scholarships to enable them to do so.  I think it would be far wiser if something could be done in the shape of assisting, say, one concrete case that can be put forward. That has been done in France.  I know <Col N="1816" /> the case where certain experiments were carried out in connection with peat, and the French Government took the matter up, as they do in cases where special claims are put forward for special purposes.  In these cases grants are given.  I understand the object of the resolution is to establish some general kind of council.  To my mind spending money in that way would open the door to the most fertile way of wasting public money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief in dealing with this motion.  I take it that the phrasing of the motion has been deliberate.  It does not refer to the expenditure of moneys precisely. The motion says: &ldquo;That the Seanad is of opinion that better provision should be made for the encouragement and organisation of scientific and industrial research.&rdquo;  There are two things in that motion&mdash;organisation is specially referred to and encouragement in whatever way there should be encouragement.  Personally it is a matter which I have been delaying for some time, in the hope that good results would attend upon a particular research work to which Senator Johnson referred, and that that might give me a better way of getting a little money, and consequently bringing about greater co-ordination between industrial folk in the country and the universities.  In spite of what has been said in general terms about the organisation of research work for industrial purposes, in the main the system adopted by the forward countries of Europe is that the State provides the laboratories and the universities in which the research work may be carried out, and in which students may get facilities.  The industrial groups supply the money.  It is, therefore, a question of getting the industrialists in the country better informed as to what provision is there and better inspired as to the use to be made of whatever facilities there are.  They go themselves to the universities to see that better provision is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is quite an amount of vagueness as to the work done in the universities. Possibly the universities should have dispelled whatever ignorance <Col N="1817" /> there is and why there is ignorance. I think a publication will shortly be made which will gather up in a special volume what is going on. I am aware of what is happening myself in several colleges, because I have been in contact with people through the Department of Industry and Commerce. Dr. Drumm has been referred to as an outstanding example, even if the exact business in which he is engaged at the moment does not give us the success that we hope from it. There has been an amount of work done in one of the colleges in reference to peat.  If there was not more it was because there were certain people who had the direction of the research who were rather despondent, as Senator Gogarty seems to be, as to any good results accruing from research in this matter.</P>
    <P>University College, Cork, and University College, Galway, have their own young research students conducting experiments with regard to certain matters arising out of peat.  That work came in very useful when certain peat developments were under consideration. A certain amount of benefit was derived from the work of the persons concerned, even though the plans did not go along the lines that these people were thinking of.  I have no doubt that these young students are continuing their researches in the matter, and that we will get benefit from them in the long run.</P>
    <P>I think also there is more co-ordination than Senator Johnson seems to imagine as between the colleges. Young students go to their professors and indicate the lines on which their minds are turning.  If certain other students are developing on the same lines they are warned by their professors of that.  For that reason the professors must keep in touch with the developments that are going on from time to time.  There is, I think, even co-ordination between one university and another, from this angle that the professors will want to know what is happening in a rival university so that they may be able to warn off students from going along lines that other students are developing <Col N="1818" /> on.  There may be a necessity for better co-ordination through Government Departments.  That is a matter that will have to be attended to.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point that Senator Barrington made about the expenditure of money, whether money voted for such a purpose is likely to be wastefully or usefully expended.  The amount granted in the past few years indicates that a very limited sum of money is sufficient for this purpose.  If big sums are voted there is a danger that a large percentage of it is going to be wasted. The peculiar thing is that all the big discoveries have been made clearly and definitely in an accidental way.  The discovery made by Dr. Drumm has been referred to.  I do not suppose that Dr. Drumm would have made any approach to me except for this, that the particular discovery he made with regard to a battery was, as he put it himself, a red herring across the path of his proper research work and that he wanted to get rid of the thing.  If he had been an electrical man properly he would, when he made this discovery, have probably tried to develop it himself, and we might not have got the benefit of it.  The discovery that he did make and that has been spoken of was quite an accidental thing.</P>
    <P>I know of one case that throws into a rather bad light some industrial concerns in this country.  For years a certain firm had continued to lose a contract for a certain type of article. On one occasion a young student went to the works of the firm.  The work that the firm was engaged in was not in his particular line at all.  He went there more for amusement than anything else.</P>
    <P>He was told about this contract that the firm had been losing for years because they were not able to produce a certain article.  He began to wonder about it, and in the end put up a proposition to the firm that solved the difficulty.  They asked him to name a fee for the piece of work that he had done.  He told me himself that the amount of work required was so elementary that if he had given it as a question in a second year medical or chemistry paper that at least seventy per cent. of the students would pass <Col N="1819" /> on it.  He charged a fee of two guineas for the information he had given to the firm.  The contract involved was a fairly big one, and yet that particular firm had been losing it for a number of years because they had never thought of making inquiries as to whether there was a chemist&mdash; it was clearly a chemical point&mdash;of sufficient intelligence to probe into the matter.  On the other hand, as Senator Barrington has pointed out, most industries of any importance, certainly industries of standing, have their own research departments.  Students who have got their preliminary training in the universities are brought into them and put on problems which are of special importance to these industries.</P>
    <P>The most that I can do in this is to see that the sums of money voted at present are continued.  The amounts are very small, less, I think, than one thousand pounds.  Generally they are expended on pure research of a scientific type&mdash;on chemistry and physics, a little zoology and a little botany.  I will see that this sum of money will continue to be provided; that the universities will continue to provide the facilities they have already provided through their laboratories and laboratory equipment and get university students interested in research in touch, as far as I can, with industries. I will also see how far through advisory committees I can stir up small committees throughout the country to co-operate in the way of encouraging young people to direct themselves to special problems.  Of course you really cannot direct research work.  You can give a student a problem and let him loose on that.  He may or he may not make a discovery.</P>
    <P>I have often thought it might be a suitable thing, when granting tariffs in the future, that the Oireachtas should tack on, as it were, in return for the benefit which the tariff gives, an obligation on the people getting the tariff to employ scientific men of the type appropriate for the particular business concerned.  When we give a tariff and impose a certain obligation on the consumer there is no reason why we should not seek employment for our trained people, and at the same time try to improve <Col N="1820" /> the business operating under the tariff.  I am accepting the motion, which is very carefully worded, but I am assuming that it does not mean that provision is to be made by way of big funds.  I found a great deal on the special example which Senator Johnson gave.  If that proves to be successful to any degree there is an object lesson at once, and there is money in it.  I may be able to combine both in an effort to get pressure brought to bear on industrialists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his encouragement of this idea.  I had no desire that very large sums of money should be provided. I was thinking more in the way of grants to students to enable them to carry on for one, two, or three years, if necessary.  I am inclined to agree with the idea that I think Senator Barrington is aiming at, that only when propositions had got to a certain point, and where money for experimental purposes was required, these should be considered on their merits.  I am in agreement with that, but I think it is important that it should not be left to the chances of having a sympathetic Minister.  I think there should be a permanent body for dealing with the matter.  Senator Barrington referred to the Council of the Royal Dublin Society, and it is typical of the body I have in mind, a body of scientific advisers to the Ministry to whom such propositions should be referred, to advise whether, in all the circumstances, they were worth spending money on.  They should be considered on their merits.  I think the subject is an important one.  I am sure the Minister realises its importance more than I do, and I am quite satisfied with having raised it.  I hope interest in the matter will be continued.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Senator O'Doherty I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;available&rdquo; in line 33 to insert the words &ldquo;and that within six hours from the time of birth one or other of the qualified persons described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this sub-section was summoned to attend.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As far as I understand it, the purpose of the amendment is to see that at the earliest possible moment notification is to be sent to a competent or responsible person.  Senator O'Doherty's idea is that when an unqualified person goes in to attend at childbirth that person continues indefinitely as the servant or nurse for a period, and that that emergency case may result in the object of the Bill being defeated.  Senator O'Doherty's idea is that information should be sent immediately to the doctor or qualified midwife to attend on the case at the earliest possible moment.  I think there is a great deal to be said for that point of view, in view of the fact that an unqualified person may be in attendance for perhaps a week or a fortnight and no intimation may have been sent to the responsible authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second.  In order to see the need for the amendment it is necessary to look into Section 2, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>... every person who attends a woman in childbirth shall, unless&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  such person is a midwife, or</P>
      <P>(b)  such person is a duly qualified medical practitioner, or</P>
      <P>(c)  such person being a person undergoing training with a view to becoming a duly qualified medical practitioner or a midwife gives such attention as part of a course of practical instruction in midwifery recognised by the Medical Registration Council or the Board. or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  such person satisfies the court that such attention was given in a case of sudden or urgent necessity and that a midwife <Col N="1822" /> was not immediately available.</P>
    <P>That would be a defence, that there was necessity for it, and that no midwife was available.  Senator O'Doherty's amendment provides, &ldquo;and that within six hours of the time of birth one or other of the qualified persons described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this sub-section was summoned to attend.&rdquo;  Suppose there was a case of urgent necessity where an unqualified person attended the woman, that unqualified person would be subject to a penalty unless a qualified person was sent for in six hours.  That is a very good provision. There are a number of ailments of after-birth that a qualified person would be able to guard against, both in the case of the woman and in the case of the child.  It is, therefore, desirable that a qualified person should be summoned within six hours, or within such time as the Seanad considers proper, in order to provide for the care of the child and the mother. Another reason that I would like to bring before the Seanad is this.  In our periodicals recently we have heard of the prevalence of a certain kind of crime in relation to poor little children, that is, concealment and murder. Senators have heard of it.  It is said to be prevalent.  I do not believe it is more prevalent now than ever, but it is probably a little more carefully looked after.  I have this impression, that if there is an obligation on the wise woman&mdash;that is the woman who attends in the case of emergency&mdash;to send for the midwife or the nurse that is in every district, within six hours, there will not be time to do away with the child, or there will not be a disposition to do so, and that would be much better for the poor children in the circumstances that I have indicated. Senator O'Doherty, in his amendment, strikes very deeply into the medical side of the midwife's work, also into the social side, as well as into the legal aspect of the matter.  It is a great protection to the mother, and it will be a great protection to the child. I believe, from my own experience, that it would prevent a number of the cases that unfortunately come before <Col N="1823" /> the courts, and that have been the occasion for sermons, denunciations, and articles in the public Press.  If the Minister considers the amendment from that point of view I think he will accept it.  In any case, I recommend it to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardBigger" hpid="Sir E. Coey Bigger Sir E. Coey Bigger">
      <NameTxt>Sir E. Coey Bigger</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to the amendment.  The chief object of the Bill was to safeguard women in childbirth by stopping, as far as possible, the practice of the handywoman. It is illegal for a handywoman or a person who is untrained to attend a woman in childbirth.  This amendment would give the handywoman or the untrained person a certain amount of status, so long as she sends for a midwife or a doctor within six hours.  It would open up all sorts of difficulties. I think I speak for the Midwives' Board, who have gone into the matter very fully, when I say that the Bill is much better as it stands.</P>
      <P>For instance, after-care has been spoken of, but after-care is of very little importance compared to actual attendance at the birth.  The object is, as far as possible, to ensure that every woman will have a midwife or a doctor at confinement.  I am opposed to the amendment for these reasons, and, moreover, I think dispensary doctors would have a just cause of complaint if they were sent for merely for the sake of covering the untrained nurse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate all that Sir Edward Bigger has said but I would like to point out that what he calls the handywoman is already provided for in the Bill in emergency cases, and that the amendment in no way prevents the handywoman from being called in in such cases.  The purpose of the amendment was to ensure that at the earliest possible moment competent people would be brought in and that the emergency could not be used for any longer period than was necessary. It was for that reason this amendment was drafted.  I pointed out that the status of the handywoman exists, but the amendment shortens the period of her attendance to the <Col N="1824" /> shortest possible time, and for that reason I recommend it to the House.</P>

      <P>If the handywoman is recognised in any way she is recognised only under certain conditions of emergency, and when there is nobody else available.  If you add on this phrase suggested by the amendment, what is going to be the natural effect upon the mind of the people judging it afterwards&mdash;the mind of a court?  If you leave the Bill as it is the court will go into the circumstances, see if there is what is called an emergency, and see in fact that nobody else is available.  But if you add this proviso it is the special point on which a court will lean, so they may say that irregularities are justified simply because notice of this type has been given.  There is that danger.</P>
      <P>As to what Senator Comyn said, the circumstances under which infanticide ordinarily happens are not such that the crimes would be prevented by this. If people are out for infanticide they are not likely to call in anybody&mdash; handywoman or anyone else&mdash;to see what is happening.</P>

From what I can gather from their statement, the Seanad would agree to insert in the Bill such amendments as would ensure that their point of view in these respects would be met, but the amendments would require some consideration.  In one case it would be a drafting amendment and in the other case it would be a little more than a drafting amendment.  I think the point of view they put forward could be readily agreed to by the Seanad.  That cannot be done without consultation, and it is with a view to that kind of accommodation that I think there should be an agreement by conference between the two Houses. There will be nothing prejudiced by such a conference.  The Bill cannot become effective until a similar Bill, as regards the status and organisation of the College, has been passed in the British House of Commons.  That is because of paragraph 10 of the First Schedule, which points out that the two Governments &ldquo;shall as soon as possible introduce into their respective Parliaments such legislation as may be necessary to give statutory effect to this Agreement, and this Agreement shall not take effect until such legislation in both such Parliaments shall have been passed into law.&rdquo;  Nothing like that has been done in the British Parliament.  They are adjourning this <Col N="1826" /> week, and obviously we are not going to prejudice or delay anything by deferring this matter until the Dáil meets again.  I think that the real issues between the two Houses could be met if there was a discussion by a joint committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the reasons will be the same in both cases, and I might as well state them now.  I should first like to explain that I am perfectly aware that in the earlier stages of this Bill I did not intervene in the debate on either of these amendments.  The reason was that I did not feel at that time that I knew enough of the subject. I do not wish to give the impression that I know nothing about the subject, because I am concerned with cattle and horses and all kinds of live stock, and consequently with veterinary surgeons to a certain extent.  I did not feel at the time, however, that I knew enough to intervene in the debate. Since then this matter has been in my mind, and I have had an exceptional opportunity of improving my knowledge of the question involved, and I find there is general agreement among the class of persons whom one would listen to as being authorities on the subject that there are not sufficient veterinary surgeons in this country, and especially that there are not sufficient good veterinary surgeons.  I understand, for example, that the Civil Service Selection Boards find the <Col N="1827" /> greatest difficulty at various times in obtaining men with sufficient veterinary qualifications for appointments under various Acts, such as the Fresh Meat Act, the Diseases of Animals Act, and so on.  What is the reason for this? The reason simply is that veterinary surgeons cannot earn a living, or at least find it very difficult to do so, and the prospects of the profession are not sufficient to cause young men to go into it, or parents to favour their children, who are likely to make good veterinary surgeons going into a profession which offers so little to them.  That is a position which is very detrimental to farmers, horse breeders, and owners of all kinds of live-stock.  It will not be remedied unless the veterinary surgeons' profession is protected somewhat more than it would be by the Bill with these amendments.  Sections 46 and 47 in their original form would remedy the position undoubtedly, and I believe, without any serious detriment or inconvenience to farmers or horse owners.  A scarcity of veterinary surgeons is really a very bad thing for the country, and one which it is most desirable to remedy, and the extent to which the prohibition of unregistered quasi-veterinary practice will cause a loss is quite trifling as compared with the other matter.  These are my main reasons for opposing the motion, and were it defeated I would be prepared to move the alternative which I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Seanad not to agree with the motion moved by Senator Johnson.  I should like to make this point to the House, and I make it in no attitude of contempt to this House.  But where there is a definite conflict between the two Houses as to a piece of legislation I think it must be recognised that the Dáil is the superior body.  There is a complete conflict in this.  The two amendments completely destroy the Bill.  I do not know what the suggestions are which come from certain veterinary people.  I do not think I have got them.  Certainly I have not got them personally.</P>

      <P>At any rate I am not concerned very much with what these people may suggest in the particular position in which they find themselves.  There was a Bill brought forward and very thoroughly discussed in the Dáil.  Enlargements were made in Sections 45 and 46, and I offered to have further enlargements made here. Instead of that the Seanad decided to cut the heart out of the Bill.  The Bill went back in that condition, and the Dáil unanimously disagreed with these amendments.  If I am asked to speak on this matter when it gets back to the Dáil, I shall ask the Dáil not to agree to amendments 2 and 3 made by the Seanad.  That would be putting the Seanad into a superior position. The Bill goes back in a form which the Dáil unanimously rejected, and the Dáil is asked to discuss the Bill in that rejected form with the disagreed amendments as its terms of reference. I certainly shall ask the Dáil not to do anything of the kind.  I do not know whether I would succeed in persuading them, but I certainly will oppose that resolution.  The Veterinary College or some President of the College suggests something now which is unknown to me, and which I cannot consider.  I will oppose anything which will ask the Dáil to discuss the Bill with Sections 45 and 46 as amended by the Seanad and rejected by the Dáil as the matter for consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister that in Bills such as this the other House is the complete master because I think the Seanad is of equal importance with the Dáil in matters of this kind.  In the concluding stages of this Bill I said that I hoped the Dáil would reject the amendments inserted by the Seanad for the simple reason that they were to my mind very foolish amendments and because they were inserted by the votes of the people who did not rightly consider what the results of these amendments would be on the Bill.  If the Bill as it stands now becomes law it would place the veterinary profession in a very much worse position <Col N="1829" /> than it was at any time.  The Council to be set up under this Bill would have no authority, practically, over any veterinary surgeon, because no veterinary surgeon would register, as he would have nothing to gain by it.  You would only fill the country with quacks.  Every veterinary surgeon who got a diploma or any qualification in any other country would be able to come over here and practise.  The only thing necessary for him would be to have a diploma.  For that reason, I think, the amendments inserted by the seanad should be rejected and that we should accept the Bill as it came back here.</P>
      <P>It is a very important matter that we should have a veterinary profession in this country second to none.  It has been said recently in England by a number of very important people interested in livestock that this country is full of foot-and-mouth disease, and if you have not veterinary surgeons of the highest standing and qualifications, it would be hard to get the idea out of the heads of the rank and file of the English people.  They think your inspectors at the ports might be all right, but they would ask: &ldquo;What about your veterinary surgeons down the country?  We cannot depend upon their reports.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator Bagwell stated, as I stated in a previous speech, that at the present moment we are short of veterinary surgeons in this country and that there is no encouragement for parents or guardians to put their children into the veterinary profession, because veterinary surgeons in this country cannot earn a livelihood except they have some local appointment.  All the work is done by quacks, and for that reason there should be some protection, and therefore I shall vote against this motion.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the question of the merits of this motion has rather dwindled in comparison with the doctrine the Minister has laid down as to the inferiority of this House to the Dáil in matters of this kind.  I think if we are to accept what the Minister says, then really the functions of the Seanad as a Revising Chamber would practically disappear.  If every time <Col N="1830" /> we insert an amendment which the Dáil rejects, we swallow our amendment when the Bill comes back here, as the Minister has asked us to do now, especially without any real argument being advanced in the Dáil in favour of the Dáil's action, then, I think, we are stultifying ourselves and reducing ourselves to a cipher.</P>

      <P>Senator Hooper has said, much better than I could, what I would like to have said with regard to the position in which the Minister would place this House, and in which Senator Counihan would back him, that this is a Bill that should not be dealt with by the Seanad, and that obviously the Seanad is a subordinate Chamber in respect of this kind of Bill.  This is not a Money Bill and if the Seanad, on the advice of the Minister, and with the assistance of Senator Counihan, is going to say that the Dáil, having done a certain thing in opposition to the Seanad, then obviously and inevitably the Seanad must lie down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position the Minister, backed by Senator Counihan, is taking up.  I quite understand the Minister's taking that view, but I cannot understand Senator Counihan's taking that view.  I think it is practically a challenge to the House to say whether that is to be the normal procedure; that the House is to spend its time in considering on their merits certain proposals, insert these proposals in a Bill, and that when that Bill goes to the Dáil for reconsideration the Dáil simply accepts the advice of the Minister and refuses to accept the Seanad amendments or consider them, and that then the Seanad must automatically acquiesce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My proposal is one which asks this House to meet the other House in consultation on certain matters of detail&mdash; obviously the kind of thing the Seanad ought to do.  I do not want to rediscuss the merits, but I believe I am right in saying that the Seanad did take the view that, important as the veterinary profession might be, the farming community of the country is even still more important.  Senator <Col N="1831" /> Counihan, to draw attention to the prevalent opinion amongst the rank and file of the English population that foot-and-mouth disease is rife in this country, said that that wrong conception can only be dissipated by the enlargement of the veterinary profession. At the best the veterinary profession is going to take quite a long time to have any considerable enlargement, and if that misconception in England is to remain until the veterinary profession is sufficiently large and important and sufficiently well established, then I am afraid that the situation of this country in the minds of the British public is going to be rather pitiable.</P>

      <P>I quite agree.  I am misinterpreting what he would now think, but I only interpreted what he said.  Senator Bagwell has pointed out very rightly the insufficiency in numbers of the veterinary profession.  That is exactly the case I made&mdash;that they are grossly and lamentably insufficient to supply the needs of the country, and because of that insufficiency, or paucity of numbers, it is necessary to allow those people who are not qualified practitioners to do what they are doing to the extent that the farmers require and which is at present necessary. One of the points made by the veterinary representatives to me was that they do not want to allow to grow up in this country a new body of whole-time, unqualified practitioners.  I am entirely with them in that.  But I want to safeguard the present rights of the farming community to approach the type of man who has been up to now advising and assisting in the treatment of sick animals.  I want to make quite sure that it will not be an offence for a druggist or a chemist to advise <Col N="1832" /> a farmer that a particular medicine is suitable for an animal suffering from a particular malady.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the motion for the adjournment, I desire to bring before the Seanad the question of the regulations recently made by the Minister for Agriculture in the Butter Exporting Examination Order, 1931.  This Order relates to the export of all kinds of butter&mdash;farmers' butter as well as creamery.  My observations will have reference only to the export of farmers' butter.  It was only very recently that this regulation was laid on the Table. I think it was at our last meeting that it first appeared on the Table.  I do not know whether or not the Dáil has had an opportunity of considering it. According to the Dairy Produce Act, the Minister is entitled to make those regulations.  The only authority the Dáil and the Seanad have is that they can, within a certain period, pass a resolution annulling the Order if they find it is working harshly on the people concerned.  It is proposed that this Order come into force on 1st August, <Col N="1834" /> which is next Saturday.  In consequence of the urgency of the matter, I ask leave of the Cathaoirleach to bring the question forward now.</P>
      <P>Already the effects of this Order are being felt in the country.  I have had a number of communications from home butter-makers in different parts of the country to the effect that the purchase of their produce has ceased and that the merchants are not prepared to buy from them in consequence of the restrictions imposed by this Order.  I have got a telegram from Adrigole, a rural district in County Cork, on the borders of Kerry.  The telegram says: &ldquo;Our butter being refused because of export restrictions.  Do something for us, as it will mean bankruptcy for poor farmers.&rdquo;  That telegram is signed by the Rev. Fr. O'Sullivan, P.P.; John O'Shea, D. Sullivan and J. Downey. Similar communications have come from Caherciveen, Dingle and Kilrush, County Clare.  What I ask the Minister to do is to give these farmers more time to consider how they will meet this Order, and perhaps, after consultation with the Minister, he will be able to work out some plan by which the exportation examination will be carried out without serious injury to the farmers who are making home butter. The quality of home butter made in this country is quite equal to that of creamery.  The quantity, I believe, of the two is about the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are districts where it is impossible to establish creameries.  In many cases farmers, even if they had creameries at their doors, would prefer to make butter on their own farm premises simply for the reason that they can rear better calves with the fresh separated milk than with the milk that would come back to them from the creamery.  If there is one department of the farmers' business which pays in some way at the present time, it is the rearing of good calves and the sale of them as yearlings. Many farmers are afraid that it is the policy of the Government to wipe out home dairying altogether, and that the Government is out for compelling all farmers to establish creameries in their districts and to send all their milk to <Col N="1835" /> those establishments.  I think it is very wrong to interfere with the discretion of the farmer as to how he will carry on his business.  Those farmers who make home butter are not subsidised in any way by the Government.  They ask to be let alone, to sell their butter in the best market, and to sell it only on its merits.  They do not receive a brand or a Government guarantee such as is given in the case of creamery butter.</P>
    <P>The restrictions in the Order provide that the quality of the home-made butter shall be within four points of the quality of the best creamery butter.  I think that is a very drastic regulation, because we all know that, although many people like home-made butter, and prefer it to creamery butter, still it has not the general qualities or the general flavour of creamery butter.  The manufacture of this butter has not been helped in any way.  I believe it is almost impossible for a farmer to get help to buy even a hand separator.  The whole idea seems to be to drive the manufacture of butter into the creamery, and I think that it is a great mistake.  I think farmers ought to be allowed to select the method of carrying on their work and of making their butter.</P>
    <P>There should be no compulsion on them to patronise creameries if they do not wish to do so.  The Order has been made, and there will not be an opportunity of going into the matter fully until the Seanad and the Dáil meet again in October.  I would ask the Minister that at least during that period, or until the 1st November next, he would not enforce this Order as far as it relates to farmers' butter and the butter that would be exported by butter factories, because the only purchasers the makers of farmers' butter have are the proprietors of butter factories who make up their butter and export it to Great Britain as well as to certain other parts of the world.  Anything that will hamper them in the purchase of that butter will react on the farmer, because when they find an obstacle to the export of the butter they will naturally cease to purchase, <Col N="1836" /> or will purchase it at such a price as will not at all pay the farmer.  I would be quite satisfied if the operation of the Order, so far as farmers' butter is concerned, was postponed until at least the 1st November, and so give the farmers of the country an opportunity perhaps of consulting with the butter merchants, and also with the Minister, to try and devise means that would carry out the object the Minister has in view of having a proper examination of butter and, at the same time, do no serious injury to the farmers who are producing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I will finish in five minutes.  These figures show that 50 per cent. of the creamery butter is produced in two counties&mdash;Cork and Limerick&mdash;and that 66 ?rd per cent. is produced in Cork, Limerick and Tipperary. The statement of Senator Linehan with regard to the production of butter, namely, that the amount of butter produced in the farmer's home and the amount produced in the creameries approximate closely to fifty-fifty is correct.  It will accordingly be seen that apart from three counties, Cork, Limerick and Tipperary, the vast bulk of butter produced is farmers' butter, and it is produced not primarily as a dairying industry, but as an art which carries with it the rearing of pigs and calves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any order that would interfere with that over such wide parts of the country would be very onerous and I think in many cases productive of ruinous losses to the farmer.  When this Order came out I looked up the &ldquo;Grocer,&rdquo; which is a sort of official trade paper, and looked up the quotations for New Zealand butter.  The quotations ran this way: finest, such a price; good to fine, such a price; inferior, such a price.  The same was true of Australian <Col N="1837" /> butters.  In fact, it is true of all butters except Danish.  As we know, the Danes have no cattle trade, which is the biggest trade in this country. I know it would be easier for the Department and the Minister if only one quality of butter were produced here, but that does not fit in with the advantage to the farmers.  Creameries have been advocated and set up in a great many districts in Ireland where they have as much chance of succeeding as if they were established at the North Pole.  I suggest to the Minister that he should ask for a return for the last fifteen years showing the number of co-operative creameries and societies that have been wound up.  I think it will astonish him.  Notwithstanding that, public money is being given to the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society which advocates creameries in districts where experience would go to show that they had no chance of success. It is said that this butter interferes with the marketing and reduces the price of creamery butter.  It does not do that.  The buyer in England is not a fool.  He knows what he is buying. It no more does that than that the price of a good hunter interferes with that of a racehorse or that of a draught horse interferes with a racer. There are different classes for different purposes and they are well known.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that there are many parts of the country where, no matter what the farmers do, they will not produce butter which would pass any Government standard.  That butter is sold to biscuit manufacturers, sugar boilers, and for other manufacturing purposes of that kind.  It is important that the farmers who are compelled by circumstances to produce butter of that sort should not have losses inflicted on them.  The Minister has power under the Dairy Produce Act to permit the export of butter under licence.  I think that might be a matter for consideration.  He may, if he so wills, prescribe certain forms of branding for butter&mdash;&ldquo;Not for table use&rdquo; or some such brand as that.  He may take it from me if it does not suit the buyer in England he will immediately erase that mark.  Still if he wants to take that precaution he can do it.  I know a deputation is <Col N="1838" /> meeting the Minister to-morrow, but I hope that whatever the result of this will be that it will not inflict losses on farmers who find it all they can do at present to make things pay.  I will go so far as to say that in the very best dairy districts farmers cannot make things pay unless they employ their own labour.</P>

      <P>According to Senator Linehan and Senator Dowdall one would imagine that no butter could be exported except creamery butter.  I want to ask the Minister is that so, or whether all butter up to a certain standard can be exported and that the order only prohibits the exportation of low-class butter.  Could the Minister give us the percentage of dairy as compared with factory butter?</P>

      <P>The figures given by both Senators are completely beside the point.  It is true that 50 per cent. of the butter manufactured in this country is manufactured at home by the farmers.  The other 50 per cent. is manufactured in the creameries, but this Order does not deal, as Senators know well, with all butter manufactured. It only deals with butter exported, and the figures for butter exports are as follow: 130,000 cwts. of factory butter and about 450,000 cwts. of creamery butter.  This Order only deals with those two classes of butter. Senators can take it that about half the butter produced in the country is exported&mdash;half the creamery butter anyway.  If there are 450,000 cwts. exported it means that there are 900,000 cwts. of creamery butter produced. Presumably if there is the same amount of home-made butter as creamery butter, there must be something like 900,000 cwts. of home-made butter. That is about 1,800,000 cwts of butter altogether.  This Order only affects 130,000 cwts. of factory butter.  Senators are completely beside the point when they speak of the dilemma of the farmers and about compelling all farmers to send their milk to the creameries or preventing them from making butter at home.  Of course, it is not the policy of the Government to compel farmers to send their milk to the creameries or to prevent them making <Col N="1839" /> butter at home.  In the County Galway there never was, and never will be, a creamery until there are four times as many cows.  The economy of that county is different from the Counties of Roscommon and Mayo.  There is one creamery in a certain district in Roscommon.  Where it would be uneconomic to have creameries butter will be made at home, and mostly consumed at home.  So it is idle for Senators at this hour of the day to pretend that they think it is the Government policy to compel every farmer to send his milk to a creamery.  I would have to send my milk about one hundred miles in order to reach the nearest creamery, and it will be a long time before there will be a creamery nearer.  The big majority of the farmers go in for mixed farming, stores, fat cattle, pigs and poultry.</P>

    <P>It has been said that this Order has been sprung on the butter factories and on the farmers who are making butter at home and sending it to the butter factories.  That is not the position.  In October, 1929, this question of defining some standard for home-made butter came up for discussion when a Consultative Council was set up under the Dairy Produce Act.  That Council contained representatives of practically every leading agricultural organisation in the country&mdash;the farmers, the factories, the creameries, and other well-known people outside.  It is a big body of fifteen, sixteen, or more persons.  This Order was discussed and a motion was proposed and seconded by farmers there to the effect that the same standards should be applied to the export of factory butter as to the export of creamery butter.  The motion was carried with one dissentient.  A <Col N="1840" /> week after that resolution was passed, the intention of the Department of Agriculture to provide some standard for exported butter was published in every paper in Ireland, and since then discussions have gone on in connection with it.  Months after that there was a meeting with the butter merchants, and they were told that this was the intention.  It was finally suggested, and they agreed, that they should send forward to the surprise butter inspection certain samples of their factory butter.  They did that.  In addition to that, for the last year or two we have been examining factory butter leaving the ports, and we have been conducting these examinations with a view to arriving at a workable standard for factory butter.</P>
    <P>It is as a result of these examinations that we have provided this standard of fifty marks for factory butter.  In fact, during the last three months seventy-one per cent. of the butter we examined&mdash;and we examined over thirteen thousand samples of factory butter&mdash;has come up to the standard.  What is our object?  It is not to force people to go to creameries. We have no power to do that.  It would be undesirable in cases.  It is not to force people or to prevent people from making factory butter.  The object of this Order is to prevent people from making bad butter, whether it be factory or creamery butter, and is not that quite a legitimate object? Whether it is legitimate or not it is entirely a different matter.  I would agree that Senators would have some reason if I compelled creameries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
