      <P>I very deeply regret to announce to the House the death yesterday of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator P.W. Kenny.  Senator Kenny has been a member of the Seanad since its inception, and his fellow-Senators paid him the tribute of electing him to the Vice-Chair in December, 1928. Senator Kenny was prominently identified for the past thirty years in the movements for the revival of the Irish language and of Irish industry, and his ability and knowledge were recognised by Arthur Griffith, who appointed him to the Commission of Inquiry into the Resources and Industries of Ireland. In recent months his gradually failing health prevented his attendance here, and this was a source of grief to him. A pathetic interest now attaches to a letter I received from him only a fortnight ago, in which he asked me to apologise to any who might inquire the reason for his absence from our midst.</P>

      <P>I should like to associate myself with the vote of sympathy and, as one who worked with Senator Kenny more or less for twenty-five years, to pay a tribute to his insistent and consistent work for Ireland.  He was one of the pioneers of what is now known as the Irish Ireland movement&mdash;a new movement of the period.  Pioneers at that time were very few.  Senator Kenny was a consistent supporter of the Sinn Féin movement, and as you, a Chathaoirligh, mentioned, of Arthur Griffith.  I should like to say that I know personally that every time that Senator Kenny was wanted by Arthur Griffith and his small band of workers in Dublin, he was to be had.  He was a Gael above all.  From the inception of the Gaelic movement, he threw himself heart and soul into it, and when the Irish college at Ring was established he was <Col N="858" /> one of those to put it on its feet and left it for all time free of debt.  It is now a recognised college of the Irish language.  He was a Gael and he belonged to the Gaels.  He believed:</P>
      <P>Gaedheal mise agus mise 'mo Ghaedheal</P>
      <P>Gaedheal mise agus ní thuigim gur náir dom é.</P>
      <P>He lived in that atmosphere, and no man or no woman could do more than he did to express in his own life the tenets and beliefs that he held.  Go ndéanaidh Dia trócaire ar a anam!</P>

      <P>This is the third Telephone Capital Bill which has been introduced since the setting up of the Saorstát.  The funds for telephone development as distinct from the moneys required for ordinary working and maintenance are provided by means of Telephone Acts.  These Acts authorise the Minister for Finance to issue out of the Central Fund such sums, not to exceed a stipulated amount, as may be required for the development of the telephone system, in accordance with estimates which must have the prior sanction of the Department of Finance.  The Minister for Finance, if he thinks fit, may raise necessary capital by means of terminable annuities of a period not exceeding twenty years. Under the previous Telephone Acts, a sum of £1,000,000 has already been provided. This sum was provided by means of two Acts, each authorising the issue of £500,000.  One Act was passed in 1924 and the other was passed in 1927.  The amount required under this Bill is £250,000 and there is still unexpended under the previous Acts a sum of £40,000.  That amount, with the sum to be provided under this Bill, will, it is anticipated, suffice for the telephone capital requirements of the State for a period of four years or thereabouts.  The sum of £1,000,000 already provided, covered the telephone expenditure for development purposes since 1922 and, therefore, the average annual expenditure was about £107,000.  This rate, however, cannot be regarded as normal because it covered not only the exceptional extensions rendered necessary by the untelephoned condition of the country on the establishment of the Saorstát but provided for growth in congested city areas&mdash;work that must be done in bulk well ahead of the actual needs of the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> Perhaps it would be well that I should explain to the Seanad that considerable expenditure on telephone capital development was necessitated because of the obsolescent condition of the telephone plant on the taking over of the service by the Irish Free State Government.  It will be recalled by those conversant with the telephone system in this country that the telephone installation originally belonged to the National Telephone Co.  At the expiration of a certain period, the British Government had the right to take over the apparatus and plant of the National Telephone Co. under the licence by which the Company had been established.  The consequence of that situation was that the National Telephone Company expended the least possible sum on maintenance and renewals and kept its systems working by many expedients of a temporary nature in the period immediately preceding the transfer to the British Government.  The telephone system was acquired by the British Government in 1912.  They immediately proceeded to reorganise it and to bring it up to date.  But the Great War broke out in 1914 and the Government's energies were diverted.  Telephone development and maintenance were neglected to a very considerable extent during the period of the Great War.</P>
    <P>This applied, one might say, to an aggravated extent to the Free State, with the result that, following the close of the Great War and the subsequent internal disturbances here, the telephone plant that was handed over to us was practically the same plant that was handed over to the British Government by the National Telephone Co.  and it was in an advanced state of obsolescence.  Things were sufficiently bad at that stage, but then there were the further internal disturbances, in the course of which telephone plant was interfered with to a considerable extent, and renewals and repairs could not be carried out. At that period we had to face a situation in which all the important exchanges were obsolete and inefficient, the cables and conduits inadequate, and the trunk lines ineffective and inefficient. <Col N="861" /> Little or no development had taken place in the rural areas, and many counties were without any service whatever.  When the service was taken over by this administration, the situation was taken in hand energetically, and we are satisfied that the service has, in general, reached a high standard of efficiency, while no areas of real importance have been left uncovered. The expenditure necessary was in excess of requirements in normal circumstances, and in excess of what will be required in the future.</P>
    <P>Members of the Seanad may wish to know how the money which was previously borrowed has been expended. I shall now indicate the major items of expenditure out of the £1000,000 authorised by the two Acts I have already mentioned.  £70,000 was expended on the introduction of automatic telephones to Dublin; £3,000 on main underground schemes; £418,000 on local underground plants; £80,000 on new exchanges and call offices: £88,000 on overhead trunk lines and £190,000 on subscribers' lines.  The following comparison of the position in 1922 and now will indicate more clearly what has been done: The number of exchanges existing in 1922 was 194; in 1931, 720.  The number of call offices in 1922 was 552; in 1931, 1,257.  The number of exchange lines in 1922 was 12,387; in 1931, 19,289. The number of stations&mdash;that is, the number of telephones in houses&mdash;in 1922 was 19,101; in 1931, 30,465.  The number of telephone kiosks in 1922 was nil; in 1931, 14.  As the Seanad will observe, there has been a very considerable increase in all the items mentioned by me.  The Seanad may be particularly interested in the development which has taken place in Dublin &mdash;the extension of the automatic system to several of the Dublin exchanges, and the areas surrounding those exchanges.  6,381 subscribers are now connected with the new automatic exchanges at Merrion Street and Ship St.  The system is highly efficient and has given general satisfaction.  In connection with the conversion, under ground cables have been laid to provide wires for new subscribers for ten to fifteen years to come.  Apart from <Col N="862" /> the automatic extension, a large proportion of the amount previously borrowed has been spent on other extensions and other developments.  In the areas outside Dublin, considerable improvements have taken place.  In Limerick, a new manual exchange of the most modern type has been installed. Other extensions of an important nature have been carried out all over the country.  Development has also taken place in Cork City.</P>
    <P>As to future development policy, owing to the work already done there is no scope for any immediate, largescale extensions, and therefore capital expenditure will be substantially less than in the past.  As to the automatic service, it is the intention that the whole of the Greater Dublin area shall be brought within the system, but existing manual exchanges will be maintained as long as they are capable of giving efficient service.  Senators residing in Dublin area may be interested in the telephone conditions in Rathmines, Terenure and Drumconda. I have received complaints as to the inadequacy of the service in these areas and, to a certain extent, these complaints were founded on fact. Under this Bill money is to be provided to convert Rathmines and Terenure exchanges to the automatic system.  In the meantime, a temporary relief exchange has been opened at Terenure.  It will provide for all the temporary requirements of that area until a building necessary to contain the automatic exchange is erected. The Drumcondra exchange is also congested, but arrangements are being made under which it is hoped to meet all the requirements of that district for telephones within a few months.</P>
    <P>As to the rural side of our development, projected developments in the provinces include the provision of additional trunk lines so as to give a nodelay service to the more important centres.  The introduction of small automatic exchanges is contemplated for outlying areas, where the cost of manual service is prohibitive.  This side of our development is, however, in the experimental stage and its practicability is not yet assured.</P>
    <P>Senators may not be conversant with <Col N="863" /> the system of book-keeping applicable to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. In addition to the ordinary system of Government book-keeping, we issue periodically what are known as &ldquo;commercial accounts.&rdquo;  These commercial accounts are made out according to a system different from that prevailing in the ordinary Government Departments.  They are prepared on the assumption that the Post Office is&mdash;as I think you will all agree that it ought to be&mdash;a business Department, working on commercial lines.  These commercial accounts are issued about a year after the close of the financial year.  According to our estimate of the balance on the commercial account for the past financial year&mdash;which accounts have not yet been issued, and will not be issued for some time&mdash;we believe that the telephone service has now been established on a self-supporting basis and is paying its way.</P>

      <P>I was interested in the description which the Parliamentary Secretary gave of his system of accounting, because I expected to hear what provision he was making for the repaying of this quarter of a million pounds.  He has borrowed already £1,000,000 for capital expenditure in respect of telephones.  He now wants a quarter of a million.  This is to be raised by means of terminable annuities repayable within the next twenty years.  I should like to know whether he provides anywhere in his system of accounting an account which would show that the general taxpayer is not the person to pay this money.  I would be completely satisfied with any development of telephones provided it was shown to me that this development took place at the expense of users of telephones and not at the expense of the general taxpayer.  I cannot see anywhere in the accounts nor could I gather from the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary that <Col N="864" /> there is any account showing that this money which is being advanced and which is stated to be repayable in twenty years is to be repaid by telephone users.</P>

      <P>I should like to ascertain from the Parliamentary Secretary whether or not there has been any success in the extension of the party line.  Those who have been in Canada know that system well.  There are a number of subscribers on one line.  They can hear what the other subscribers say but, of course, they do not listen.  In the country districts, it is the cheapest system.  While welcoming the extension of the telephone system, I should like to voice a complaint which I have received.  It is not a complaint by one individual but by a very large body of professional people who use the telephone. They complain of the unsatisfactory service.  The parties who approached me have very heavy telephone communication with London.  I will give you an instance of one individual whose quarterly bill amounts to about £80.  So bad was the service in this case that this person has now to telegraph to London and get the call originated there instead of attempting to originate it here.  In that way, the £80 goes to the British postal authorities instead of to the postal authorities here.  If the call can be orignated promptly from the other side and cannot be originated promptly here, it would seem as if there was something radically wrong at this end.  I shall give privately the Parliamentary Secretary particulars of that case.  I do not want to mention names in the House.  That is a matter which I think should be investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a question regarding the general policy for future development of the telephonic system.  The Parliamentary Secretary has given figures relating to the State as a whole, which show that in 1931 there are 50 per cent. more subscribers than there were in 1922.  I have no doubt that that is regarded as fairly satisfactory, but there is plenty of room for further improvement. Having expended the greater <Col N="865" /> part of this £1,000,000 in providing the basis of telephonic communication, the aim in the future will be, I presume, to ensure that there will be a very big increase in the number of telephonic communications.  In other words, having got the main lines and the general system in satisfactory working order, something will require to be done to increase the number of subscribers and to induce the people to use the telephone to a very much greater degree than it is being used. I was curious to know the relative figures for Dublin, because it seems to me the principal opportunity for rapid increase in the number of telephonic communications and telephone subscribers would be in the Dublin area. It is unfortunate for the business of telephoning that the number of private subscribers is not much higher than it is.  The chief reason for that is, I think, the £5 a year rental.  I make the suggestion, without having sufficient data for calculation, that a reduction of the rental would, in the Dublin area at all events, result in a very great increase in the number of subscribers.  People without business connections who do not find it necessary to make many business calls find that their telephone costs amount to from 4d. to 7d. per call.  That is because their usage of the telephone is limited by the number of business relations they have.  In these cases, the relations of the people are more of a social than of a business character, and the fact that their neighbours and acquaintances are not on the telephone means that they cannot communicate with them.  I think the aim of the Department should be to increase the number of telephones in private houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think if it were possible, within the estimates made by auditors or actuaries, to reduce the basic charges it would encourage people to instal the telephone.  The fact that a very large number of residents had the telephone would immediately lead to a great increase in the number of calls, and therefore to the revenue from calls.  If that is not feasible at this stage, I suggest that the capital expenditure required in building and erecting a large number of kiosks in <Col N="866" /> residential areas is worthy of consideration. I believe that if there was a kiosk to every thirty or forty houses within the region of the telephone system it would be a paying proposition. The fact that there was a telephone convenient would induce people to use the telephone to a very much greater extent than they do at present. That might be detrimental to the tramway service and, incidentally, to the telegraph service, but it would add to the convenience of the public, in the absence of individual telephones, and certainly to the income of the telephone department.</P>
    <P>I said there was plenty of room for development.  I was interested sufficiently to obtain, with the courtesy of the Department, some figures regarding the relative use of the telephone in various cities of the world.  While it is true that there are some cities where the number of telephones per 100 of the population is lower than in Dublin, there are a considerable number of cities where telephone installations are greatly in excess of those in this city. I will take some extremes to begin with.  The Dublin figure is 3.8 telephones per 100 of the population.  To show that there are possibilities of very great advance in this respect, I next take Montreal where the figure is 18.9. In the case of Copenhagen&mdash;this is another instance besides the more frequently quoted one of agricultural cooperative progress in which Denmark leads the way&mdash;the figure is 16.8 telephones per 100 of the population.  For Paris the figure is 11.9; Berlin, 11.4; Geneva, 14.6; and New York, 27.  Those are very high figures.  They are much the highest of the cities which I can quote.  There are several in the region of five, six, seven and eight per 100 of the population, so that it is quite conceivable that we could, by a development policy, ensure a very much greater use of the telephone and a greatly increased number of installations, thereby achieving the double purpose of adding to the public convenience and of bringing the telephone service generally into a non-losing category: that would pay for itself, be no burden, and add greatly to the convenience of the public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> I have nothing to say against the Bill, of course, because I would like to see the telephone system developed. I do want to point out that the Dublin area, in my opinion, offers a field for very much greater development from the telephone finance point of view, while the public convenience will, perhaps, be more greatly served if one thinks of the development in the country areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane asked the Parliamentary Secretary how the telephone party line system is working in this country, and pointed out that the system is used extensively in Canada.  I want to tell the Senator that the party line system never got a chance to work here.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us that we in the country could have the system for a charge of something like £4 10s.  a year.  A number of farmers in my district applied to have the system installed.  When we got the estimate we found that it would be £19 10s.  A number of people in the villages and towns throughout the country have been making applications and sending petitions to the Parliamentary Secretary during the last five years to have a telephone call office established in their areas for the convenience of the farmers.  Nothing, however, has been done.  Even the establishment of a call office in the villages and towns throughout the country that are without one at present would, I think, be a wise undertaking. The amount of money involved in carrying out such an extension would be well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told the House that the British Government took over the system from the National Telephone Company.  He said that the telephones, when taken over, were in a rather obsolete condition, and that they had only two years to improve them and bring them up to date. Apparently that period was not enough, because they were interrupted again in 1914.  Under the two Bills that the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned there were two loans of half <Col N="868" /> a million each.  He stated that the telephone system was now nearly on a paying basis.  I take that to mean that in eight years the loans, though intended to cover a period of twenty years, have been repaid.  That, I think, is very creditable.  I would like to get from the Parliamentary Secretary figures giving the amount that had to be paid for the destruction of telephones throughout the country in 1921 and 1922.  If we had that figure it might comfort Senator Comyn for the loss to the general taxpayer for whom he is so solicitous, because I think it was his Party that was largely responsible for putting that cost on the general taxpayer at the time.</P>

      <P>I like to comfort the Senator.  He is solicitous for the general taxpayer.  I am, too, and would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what was the amount of the losses sustained at that time by certain interference with communications generally.  With regard to the quarter of a million that it is now sought to obtain, I would like to know how it is to be expended.  Is it to be expended on new apparatus, or is it merely to meet the difference between revenue and capital expenditure? I would also like to know where the telephone apparatus is purchased.  Is it a British product or Swedish?  I imagine that most of the expenditure goes for labour and skilled work in extending and erecting the different exchanges, as well as on overhead and underground wiring.  As far as the apparatus goes, I think no part of it is made in this country.  Even the telephone poles have to be imported.  I hope that when our Forestry Department gets properly under way it will be able to supply us with telephone poles.  The creosoting process is not a very difficult one.  It is astonishing to find, in travelling through England, that the millions of telephone poles along the Great North Road are imported. Surely there ought to be enough trees in one's own country to supply a need of this kind.  I believe only 1½ per cent. of the land in this <Col N="869" /> country is under forestry.  Still there ought to be enough of Scotch fir to supply our needs in this respect, not necessarily poles of the finished decorative appearance of those in use.  In France poles grown in the country are used.  They present a rather unfinished appearance, but they last for 10 or 14 years.  I think this is a matter that might be looked into both by the Forestry Department and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I know, of course, that it takes 21 years for a fir tree to grow to a height to enable it to be used for a telephone pole. There should be co-operation between the two Departments concerned to ensure that in future we will be able to supply our own needs in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that his Department might aim at least at having a telephone in every post office and every sub-post office.  There are very many sub-post offices throughout the country without a telephone.  It does seem a bit absurd to have places like a post office without one of the most modern and necessary means of communication. In many districts the only place in which one can have access to a public telephone is in a publichouse where there is no box and where, generally, it is difficult to hear and very inconvenient sometimes to convey your message.  There is one anomaly in connection with the telephone system that I think requires some attention.  A subscriber, no matter how big a subscriber he may be, who requires to have his telephone transferred from one premises to another, or even from one part of one premises to another, has to pay the cost of the removal. Recently I had occasion to change my office.  I found that I would have to pay £5 or £6 for having the telephone changed, but I discovered that by applying for a new telephone I could get it installed free.  Needless to say, I got in the new telephone.  In order to get the old telephone changed I could get no guarantee that it would be done within three months, nor could I get a guarantee that I would continue to have the same telephone number. The new telephone was installed <Col N="870" /> within a month.  I got a new number which caused no great inconvenience. I think that, in the case of subscribers of long standing who want to change their business from one place to another, the Department might consider changing the old telephone free of cost to them, seeing that the subscriber can always have the work done free by becoming, as it were, a new subscriber.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillicuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>I also have got a few strictures to make on the telephone system.  I think that some of the rules taken over from the British act rather harshly on subscribers or possible subscribers and rather prevent a desired extension of the telephone system.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will admit that our telephone book is not a very large one.  One of the reasons, I think, for that is that telephones are supplied at a fixed rate according to lineal measurement.  I wish to mention two cases that were brought to my notice. One is that of a subscriber who lives across an arm of the sea from the distributing station.  He has the telephone for something like £15 a year. The telephone wires had to be taken around a distance of five miles, or near it, to his residence.  Another man who lives four miles along the road from the distributing station made an application for the installation of the telephone. He was told that in order to make a service to his house pay, the charge would have to be something like £30 odd, and that in addition he would have to get a couple more subscribers with himself.</P>

    <P>I see, of course, the point the Parliamentary Secretary made in his statement that you have got to make these things pay their way.  At the same time I am of opinion that if you stick to hide bound rules you are not going to get the rapid extension of the system that you expect.  I agree with what Senator Dr. Gogarty said as regards encouraging the use of native grown poles.  I think if applicants are willing to provide suitable poles which are passed by an inspector as likely to last for 20 or 30 years&mdash;if they are certified to last that length and there will be no increase in the cost <Col N="871" /> of maintenance&mdash;their offer should be accepted.  It would be one means of increasing this line of communication throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I desire to support what is being said by other Senators with regard to extending the telephone system to country post offices.  I know many villages that are not connected with the telephone system, the result being that the inhabitants and people of the surrounding districts are put to great inconvenience.  A short time ago I had occasion to send an urgent call to the Civic Guard station. There is no telephone in the local village.  The nearest village where there is a telephone is five miles distant from the Gárda station.  The people over an area of six or eight miles have no means, if they need to do so, of communicating with the Guards.  In this case I had to send a telegram which was delivered at a village five miles in the opposite direction to that in which the Guards are stationed.  The telegram was handed in about 11 o'clock.  It was 3 o'clock in the afternoon before the Guards arrived.  It was well it was not a case of burglary, because if it had been, the thieves would have had plenty of time to take the booty and get away.  If the telephone system could be extended and a telephone provided in every post office it would be a great convenience to the people throughout the country.</P>

      <P>At the outset I want to assure Senator Comyn that the Minister for Finance takes care to see that money lent by the Department of Finance to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is paid back.  If the Senator turns to page 272 of the Estimates for the current year he will find the following items in Vote 62&mdash; Posts and Telegraphs: Sub-head M&mdash; annuities in respect of debt created under the Telegraph Acts, 1892-1921, and the Telephone Capital Acts, 1924-1927; M (1)&mdash;in respect of debt created under Telegraph Acts, 1892-1921, £16,253; M (2)&mdash;in respect of cost incurred since 1st April, 1922, £84,384. That is the amount which has to be <Col N="872" /> repaid to the Department of Finance for the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation, what I wanted to know was not whether the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are paying the Department of Finance out of the general revenue of that Department, but whether the users of telephones are paying the interest and sinking fund on this money which is being advanced under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that the telephone system was now on a paying basis.  That means that all the charges applicable to the telephone system, including capital, interest charges, etc., are balanced by revenue.  From that it is quite obvious that the charges, which the Senator is interested in, are repaid by the users of the telephone.  With regard to the complaint made by Senator Sir John Keane in the matter of establishing a telephone connection between Dublin and London, I have not received any personal complaints.  I am afraid I cannot deal with that now, but if the Senator or his friends have experienced any difficulty in that direction and are good enough to communicate with me privately, I will have the matter looked into.  Senator Johnson spoke of a particular kind of telephone extension.  The Senator's point, as I understand it, is that if we reduce our rate of charges we will get a considerably greater number of subscribers than we have at present, and that the revenue derived will compensate the Department for the additional expense incurred in making the extensions.  That is an aspect of the telephone system which we have examined very carefully.  We have examined it not only in the light of theory, but in the light of practice. The conclusion we have come to is that any further reduction in our rate of charges would not be justifiable is the existing circumstances and would not result in any appreciable increase in the number of users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of charges has been reduced since the telephone system was taken over by the Free State.  In 1925 the rate was considerably reduced. <Col N="873" /> At that time the annual charge to the ordinary householder in Dublin for the installation would, on the average, be about £7 10s.  a year, plus call charges.  That has since been reduced to £5 a year, plus call charges.  I regret to say that the response to that reduction, so far as getting an increased number of users is concerned, has not been very great.  On the question of theory, I might mention that there is a peculiarity about telephone conditions which makes it difficult to fix charges by means of an extension of the number of users.  That is a position that is well understood, not only here but in other countries.  With the permission of the Seanad, I will read a short extract from a statement I made in the Dáil in 1929 when dealing with the Estimate for this Department. The statement is really a paraphrase of a statement made previously by Sir Evelyn Wood, one of the highest officials in the Post Office Department on the other side.  It also happens that a somewhat similar statement is made in this year's report of the American Telegraph and Telephone Company.  The statement I want to refer to is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Ordinarily, in an expanding business proportionately to expansion, expenses on the unit basis have a tendency to decrease as expansion takes place.  This rule does not apply to the telephone services. Overhead expenses do not, of course, increase in the same proportion as the number of telephones.  The cost of apparatus tends to fall.  The savings effected on these are offset to a large extent, if not altogether, by the increased expense in cost of the plant necessary to provide ready means of communication between the increased number of users of the telephone.  Exchange plant and staff increase out of proportion to the number of added subscribers.  In effect the advantage which the user of the telephone gets from development and extension is not cheaper rates, but an increased service, i.e., a greater number of persons with whom he can talk.</P>
    <P>That is the position with regard to a reduction in charges for the purpose of extending the telephone system.  I <Col N="874" /> might add that, in so far as it is possible for us to make comparisons between the charges we make and the charges countries somewhat similarly situated make, particularly under the British system, we find that our charges are somewhat lower.  It is not possible to make exact comparisons, because the basis of charge in the different countries is not quite the same.  Our charges in Dublin, for instance, when compared with the charges which operate in Manchester, Liverpool, and other big English cities, are somewhat more favourable. It is not possible to give a comparison of the charges made under Continental systems, for the reason that the basis on which the charges made here and on the Continent are not comparable.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson suggests, as an alternative, that if we do not see our way to reduce our rate of charges we should take steps to establish kiosks and connect them with the telephone system.  We have established a number of kiosks&mdash;10 or 12.  Our policy is to establish kiosks where we find a demand exists for them and where we think it will be a paying proposition to set them up.  We set up one quite recently at the Cattle Market.  Possibly Senator Counihan had something to do with that.  A number of Senators referred to the party line system. With regard to the case mentioned by Senator Counihan, I cannot deal with that now.  I do not know what charges were quoted.  As a general rule we are prepared to quote a very low charge for the establishment of the party line system in a rural area. provided we get a sufficient number of subscribers, and provided that they are not scattered over too great a stretch of country very far away from the nearest exchange office.  Our basic rate of charge is about £4 10s.  We advertised the advantages of that system all over the country.  Leaflets descriptive of the system were widely distributed through the post offices. The response that we got was very poor indeed.  I think that we have only six party line systems in the country.  I cannot tell the reason for that.  Senators may perhaps guess the reason.  It may be that as a race we <Col N="875" /> are nervous of letting our neighbours know what we are talking about to another subscriber.  One disadvantage of the system is that if our neighbours lift the receiver they can hear what we are talking about to a third party.</P>
    <P>I believe one of the favourite forms of amusement with lady farmers in Western Canada is to listen to their neighbours talking over the party line system.  Apparently they do not mind that out there, because they have a great number of party lines in Canada. The position here, at any rate, is that the system has not taken on.  Of course, we would like to provide Senator Counihan, and other Senators who live in the rural areas with telephones, but if Senators and other members of the public like to have manorial residences far out in the seclusion of a rural area and far away from the local post office and telephone exchange, then that is going to cost them a considerable amount of money.  If these people will not bear the cost of a telephone system provided for them under such circumstances, then the taxpayer will have to bear it.  If we were to give a Senator living in a rural area a telephone service for £10 a year, a service that was costing the Department £20 a year to provide, then that particular subscriber is simply getting a subsidy at the expense of the taxpayer to the extent of £10 a year.  Knowing the individualistic and non-socialistic tendencies of the Senator, I am certain he would be very slow to ask the taxpayer to pay any portion of the cost of giving him a telephone.</P>

      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary might now get away from that.

I have mentioned a case where six people made application and where the rent was quoted at £19 10s.</P>

      <P>I cannot deal with the special case submitted, because I have not the information in front of me.  I did not quite follow Senator Gogarty's inquiries with regard to the repayment of loans.  Perhaps, I have answered his point in the course of my answer to the remarks of Senator Counihan.  We are, of course, repaying our loans, and I may say that, of the £1,000,000 borrowed, we owe only £40,000.  The Senator made a point about the difference between capital and revenue.  The answer I will give in that connection is that in so far as we are installing new apparatus it is charged to capital, but in so far as we are renewing existing apparatus it is charged to revenue.  The Senator was also very interested in the question of the materials used. He asked me what nation provided the particular telephone apparatus that we have installed.  As far as I understand, and I am speaking without very full information, most of our existing apparatus has been provided by British Companies.  I think it is provided on a competitive system. The Contracts Committee control the buying of it, and I think it will be found that the buying is arranged on a satisfactory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the use of Irish timber for telephone poles, I am not sure whether we have as yet used any Irish timber, nor am I quite sure if Irish timber is suitable.  We are importing our telephone poles uncreosoted, and we get them creosoted in the Irish Free State.  One of the main requirements of telephone poles is that they shall last as long as possible.  That, of course, helps to reduce the maintenance expenses.  The wood must be of a suitable kind, and of a lasting nature. I am not sure whether the Irish wood that is available is of that kind. I know that in other countries, such as France, they use a cheaper and an inferior pole to the poles we use. <Col N="877" /> I am not sure that is a satisfactory system.  We have inherited the British system in regard to our telephones. We are installing the very best poles, and that helps to make the service a satisfactory service.  I do not want to cast any reflections on the French system, but I have heard that it is not as good as other systems. One reason is that the poles they use are not as good as they ought to be. We are using as much Irish material as we can.  The cross pieces are made of Irish oak.  We find that we can get Irish timber of a suitable kind for the cross pieces.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Farrell, The McGillicuddy of the Reeks, and others raised questions with regard to the installation of the telephone in every post office.  I presume they mean the establishment of a call office in each post office.  Again it is a question of cost and revenue.  We are not allowed by the controlling regulations made by the Department of Finance to establish a telephone call office if it is estimated the establishment will result in a loss to revenue.  No matter how great the humanitarian considerations are, we cannot establish telephone exchanges or call offices at a loss that would have to be borne by the taxpayer.  Our post office being regarded as a commercial department our object is to make it pay for itself, and we endeavour to work it on a commercial basis.  If it were thought by the Oireachtas that it would be advisable to establish call offices, a new policy would be developed whereby the taxpayer would become responsible for portion of the cost.  As a matter of fact, up to the present year the telephones have been working at a loss, but we are reaching a point when there will not be any loss in that respect.  I think I have dealt with all the points that have been raised by Senators.</P>

Under the section the Judicial Commissioner has a right by order to fix the appointed day, and he might fix it retrospectively; he might put it back behind the date of his order.  He probably would do so if the nearest gale day happened to be there.  If the section had been left as it was, and the Judicial Commissioner happened to fix the appointed day retrospectively, the quality of the vendor's property might be changed.  If the vendor died without making a will his heir-at-law would think that he had come in for the real estate, whereas if the Judicial Commissioner made an order putting back the appointed day, then the heir-at-law would be cut out and the property would go amongst the next-of-kin.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> Section 34, sub-section (5).  After the word &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; in line 33 to insert the words &ldquo;and all costs and expenses&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 34, as the Seanad will remember, provides for paying out money to owners on titles which may not be perfect provided the court is of opinion that the facts are such as to make it improbable that any adverse claim will be made to the purchase money. The section also provides for a case in which, notwithstanding the ruling of the judge, another owner, the lawful owner or claimant, may appear and prove himself to be the person who really is entitled to the purchase money.  In such a case as that the section provides that the Court can pay him a sum of money by way of compensation.  There is also a provision that the money paid by way of compensation to the rightful owner shall be recoverable from the person who was wrongfully paid.  Of course, it is very just and fair that it should be in the section, although indeed, if a man who is not entitled to money gets it I should imagine that he would very quickly go out of the jurisdiction. There is a provision here to the effect that the amount of any compensation paid by the Land Commission under this section shall be repaid to the Land Commission by such person as shall be declared by the Court to have received any portion of the purchase money.  That is the section as it stands, and it provides for the payment of compensation.</P>
    <P>My amendment is to this effect: that, in addition to the compensation, the person who wrongfully received the money shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by the Land Commission. I think it is reasonable that he should.  If the compensation can be recovered from the man who wrongfully gets the money why should not the costs and expenses incurred by his wrongful claim be also recovered?  The Parliamentary Secretary says that these costs and expenses are trivial.  I do not understand how he can say that because no case of the kind has yet arisen.  There has been no case of a person being wrongfully paid and of a rightful owner turning up and claiming <Col N="882" /> and receiving compensation.  Therefore we do not know what costs and expenses may be incurred in litigation and in the investigation of title.  There have been several cases in which persons representing themselves as owners have received money and have been enabled, by orders of the Land Commission, to mortgage their estates, but there never has been a case in which a person not entitled got money, the person really entitled turning up later and claiming and receiving compensation. Such a case could not arise except under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Land Commission can pursue a person who wrongfully got the money for the amount of compensation that they are compelled to pay, why should not they be entitled to pursue him for the very heavy costs which, in my judgment, will be incurred in the litigation that must necessarily arise where a person lawfully entitled claims money which a person not entitled had already received?  I do not know why the Parliamentary Secretary has refused to accede to this amendment.  I think he is under the impression that the costs and expenses would be trifling.  I think he is wrong in that impression. He may say that these costs and expenses will be included in the compensation, but I say that they will not be included in the compensation.  I think it is only just that the person who gets money to which he is not entitled should pay, not merely the compensation, but the costs incurred by the Land Commission.  Why should the State be at the loss of the costs and expenses entailed by litigation of this character?</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 44, sub-section 1.  To delete in lines 64 (page 22)&mdash;1 (page 23) the words and figures &ldquo;Land Act, 1923&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 44 it is provided that the third term judicial rent, which was to be calculated as the basis of finding out whether the untenanted land was held at a substantial rent or not, should be fixed in line with what would be a fair rent in the year 1923.  My amendment proposes to have that rent fixed from the date of the passing of this Bill.  That makes a considerable difference, because the rent which would have been a fair rent in the year 1923 would be somewhat different to-day. <Col N="884" /> It would be at least 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. less.  Furthermore, it would be much easier for a land valuer to estimate what the rent should be at the present time.  It would also enable some tenants who are now excluded from the benefit of land purchase to come within the scope of the Land Purchase Act.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will accept the change. In my opinion, it will facilitate him in working the Act.</P>

      <P>The only difference between this section and Section 11 of the Act of 1927 is that under this section it is proposed to treat the owners of land held under fee-farm grants or on long leases as the owners of tenanted land instead of the owners of untenanted land.  The Land Commission will not have any difficulty in fixing fair rents on this land.  Already, under Section 11 of the 1927 Act, they have fixed at least 200 fair rents.  I think the figure is a little more than that, but for the sake of argument we will assume it is 200.  Notwithstanding what the Senator has said, there is very little difference between the fair rent fixed at the date of the passing of the 1923 Act and the present day.  I object to the amendment for the reason, particularly, that you are making a distinction between this class of tenant and the tenant ordinarily coming under the 1923 Act.  I cannot accept the amendment because it would be inconsistent with the whole scheme of this Bill and particularly with the very important sections in the Bill dealing with tenants generally.</P>

      <P>Before this Bill is passed, as I expect it will be, I would like to address some remarks to the Chair in relation to the policy of the measure.  We have always been anxious that lands should be vested as <Col N="885" /> quickly as possible.  This Bill provides for the early vesting of land, and we are assured by the Parliamentary Secretary that before the 1st of May next, long lists of holdings will be published, and great areas of land in this country will be vested. I think the Parliamentary Secretary would be much better advised if, while expediting the vesting of land, he took more care of the interests of tenant farmers and of persons not yet tenant farmers or owners of land whom we hope to see in possession of economic holdings before many years have expired.</P>
      <P>My idea of expediting the vesting of land would be, firstly, to vest all holdings in respect of which judical rents have been fixed.  You could make no mistake in that, because you would be quite certain that the person you were making a fee simple owner was a person who had tenant right. The next thing I would do would be to vest all holdings to which section 24 (1) of the Act of 1923 applied&mdash;that is, all holdings which were in occupation of tenants and in respect of which no fair rent had been fixed. That is the system that I would adopt in the vesting of land, and I would leave to another day the question of vesting holdings which, in a country as narrow as ours, with resources as limited as ours, must be regarded as nothing short of estates&mdash;holdings in respect of which an advance of more than £3,000 is to be made.  I do not think that it is just, in the circumstances of this country, to make an advance of public credit for the purchase of land to a greater extent than £3,000 to any one man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill which our Party introduced in the Dáil, the Bill which has been criticised but which still holds the field, is the simplest solution of the question of vesting land.  It provided that Section 70 of the Act of 1923&mdash; that is the section dealing with the list of holdings to be vested&mdash;should be amended &ldquo;by the addition at the end of the section of the words &lsquo;provided that in the case of holdings subject to judicial rents to which Section 24 of this Act applies the appointed day shall be fixed at a date not later than <Col N="886" /> the first day of December, 1929, and in the case of all other tenanted and untenanted lands to which Section 24 of the Act applies the appointed day shall be fixed at a date not later than the first day of June, 1932.&rsquo;&rdquo;  You have heard this Bill discussed for days.  It was closely discussed and analysed on both sides, and I submit that, as a measure of policy, that one section holds the field and is the only reasonable method of dealing with the vesting of land, while still preserving to the State the power which the State ought to have and thus go on, reasonably and prudently, with the settling of the farmers on the land.  The Parliamentary Secretary and his Government thought otherwise, and they have produced a Bill of about fifty sections.  I do not intend to criticise the various sections of the Bill.  It would probably be out of order to do so at this stage, but I do want to repeat that, in my opinion, it is wrong, where lands have not been subject to judicial rents, for the State to advance money without an inspection of the holdings so as to secure that the holdings are value for the money.  It may be said that a year or two ago we passed a Bill providing for a general reduction of 35 per cent. in all cases where judicial rents had not been fixed and that we gave the right to the landlord and the tenant to serve a notice and have an inspection.  But there are numerous cases in which neither the landlord nor the tenant will desire inspection and in which the interests of the State are likely to be sacrificed.</P>
    <P>I do think that the tenant farmers who have sub-tenants are being very badly treated in this measure.  They are being crushed out.  I am not in favour of charging a sub-tenant more than the value of his land, but I think it is a case in which the State ought to intervene and compensate the middleman in the same way as it is compensating the landlord&mdash;treat the tenant in the same generous way as the landlord is being treated under this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another question of principle in the Bill which, in my opinion, will be of far-reaching importance. There was a clause introduced into this Bill on the Second or Third Stage <Col N="887" /> in the other House providing for compensation for disturbance in the case of resumed holdings.  Anybody having experience of the long land struggle in this country and of the land question in general will at once fix on that as the most important clause in the Bill, because not alone does it provide for compensation for the value of the holding which is being resumed, but it also provides compensation for disturbance.  These holdings are resumed for one purpose only&mdash;for the purpose of settling congests, landless men and people who can suitably conduct small farms.  Of course, when a holding is divided, it must be sold to the incoming tenant&mdash;the small man &mdash;at a fair price.  If the owner of the resumed holding gets a fair price, with compensation for disturbance, and if the small man is to get in at a fair price, the difference must come from some source.  There is no provision in this Bill for bridging that gap. There is no provision whereby the State will come in to subsidise the transaction.  I was very glad to hear Senator Sir John Keane say, by way of interruption on the Second Reading of this Bill, that in such a case the State ought to come in.  I was stopped on Second Reading when I endeavoured to suggest an alternative method of acquiring land for the benefit of congests&mdash;by empowering the Land Commission, instead of taking land compulsorily, to acquire land by purchase and to place a fund at their disposal in the same way as a fund was placed at the disposal of the Congested Districts Board.  That method would be successful.  No general system of compulsion in Ireland can be successful.  It is absurd to suppose, at this stage of the history of the land system in Ireland, that the farmers of Ireland, or any substantial group of farmers, can be placed under the heel of compulsion.  They cannot. They never were placed under the heel of compulsion, and they never will be.  Land in Ireland has always been held by force.  Land in Ireland will always be held by force.  Let there be no mistake about that.</P>
    <P>There is one small aspect of this <Col N="888" /> measure to which I would like to call attention.  You will have observed that provision is made for the payment out of moneys without complete investigation of title to persons who represent themselves as owners of land.  That may be a reasonable thing, but I think that any loss sustained in the financing of a matter of that kind should be borne by the class of persons which is benefited. Under this Bill, it is to be borne by the State.  We had an amendment down which sought to provide that a fund should be constituted out of the moneys retained&mdash;the guarantee deposit&mdash;to be called the &ldquo;Title Compensation Fund,&rdquo; and that that fund should be used for the purpose of meeting claims made by rightful owners in cases where the wrong persons had been paid.  I think that that amendment was reasonable, but it was not accepted.</P>
    <P>These are the main objections that we had to this measure.  We think that it ought to have been a simpler measure, that it ought to have provided for the vesting of judicial holdings, and after that, for the vesting of ordinary tenancies, and that until there was time for the proper distribution of land the Minister ought not to have gone farther than that.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to add much to what Senator Comyn has said, but I feel that it would not be right to let the Bill go through its final stage without making one or two observations.  I may state frankly that the Committee Stage which we went through last week was, to me, a disappointment&mdash;not so much because of the few amendments which we got accepted, but rather because of how little we learned either from the House or from the Parliamentary Secretary as to the reasons for his objection to the amendments, and because of what I might call a lack of defence of his own measure.  Senator Comyn has referred to one clause that we argued fairly vigorously last week &mdash;the clause dealing with the Title Compensation Fund.  Frankly, I think a mistake was made, in spite of all that the Parliamentary Secretary has said, in not accepting that <Col N="889" /> amendment or bringing in an amending clause on the same lines.  I think that losses will be made by the State owing to the absence of such a clause.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, it was interesting to hear certain points of view, as expressed by Senators on that occasion. Senator Brown, speaking, I presume, for what I would look upon as the landlord interest&mdash;the vendors who will be&mdash;strenuously opposed any such proposal.  With due respect to his legal ability, which we all admit, I think he made a wretchedly poor case, and that all the arguments of equity, and in favour of protection of State funds were on our side.  That, in spite of Senator Brown, and in spite of the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary.  We had another interesting disclosure last week, when Senator Jameson, throwing up his hands to heaven, asked why we, as Senators, should stand up in face of what the experts had said.  To me, that was an extraordinary attitude.  It was the most revelatory attitude I have yet seen in the Seanad.  To my mind, it condemned us as a totally unnecessary and superfluous body.  Some of us think we are such, and that this House is not in any sense justifying its existence, but Senator Jameson was the last person whom I expected to say &ldquo;Why worry about these things; the experts are satisfied; we cannot say any more.&rdquo;  I suggest to the House that Senator Jameson may have been encouraged in that view by the attitude of many Senators who are here &ldquo;two by two and by captain's command,&rdquo; and whose opinions, when we do hear them expressed, lead one to believe that we are a fit case for expert direction, and for nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the amendments which we discussed in committee were highly technical.  Some of them were highly technical even from the legal point of view.  Many of them were highly technical from the point of view of the city man, who has not had experience of Land Commissioners, land legislation, or land courts.  Still, I think, that some of us who belong to the category of city folk did try to analyse, understand and reason out <Col N="890" /> the various sections of this Bill believing, as we believe about all Bills, that it is up to us to try and understand our work, and to do the right thing by the State.  Otherwise, we are shirking our job.  That being so, it is disappointing to find that not only are amendments turned down but that they do not evoke anything like a convincing explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We have had considerable experience in this House, though not as long experience as some people have had. We have dealt with many subjects here &mdash;finance, foreign exploitation of industry, flour milling and other subjects. A lot of these things involved very big interests&mdash;both domestic interests and external interests.  In so far as our views have been expressed in debate or by motion or by amendment, we want all and sundry to understand that if and when we do get power we will exercise ourselves to the best of our ability to see that those fundamental viewpoints are carried through, whether it is going to affect landlords selling under this Bill, flour millers coming into Limerick, or foreign syndicates exploiting the country.  I have nothing to add as regards the Bill.  The Committee Stage was frankly a disappointment to me, not so much because our amendments were rejected&mdash;we are used to that&mdash; but because we did not learn much from the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Bill as to the reasons for the various clauses for which he fought or the reasons against the various amendments which he turned down. Senator Johnson referred to-day to a mere &ldquo;nod of the head&rdquo; of the Parliamentary Secretary.  We had a great many nods last week, and I suppose we have got to be satisfied with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I was somewhat at a loss to follow Senator Comyn, particularly at the outset of his speech, when he said quite definitely that, in his opinion, the Land Commission should, first of all, publish the list of judicial tenancies.  I do not think the Senator was aware, when making that statement, that if the Land Commission did as he suggested <Col N="891" /> they would succeed in defeating the object which the Senator had in view, because many of the tenants who have got advances from the Land Commission up to and exceeding £3,000, are judicial tenants.  In fact, the majority of these tenancies are judicial.  I might also remind the Senator that the Land Bill from which he read an extract merely re-enacted the law of 1923 on that particular subject.  In that re spect it is identical with the section relating to the publication of lists in this Bill.  The Land Commission will, of course, take tenancies, whether judicial or non-judicial, according as they appear on the schedule of particulars supplied by the landlord.  The particulars of these holdings will be published in the list of vested holdings and the annuities will be fixed in respect of judicial holdings in accordance with the Act of 1923 and in respect of non-judicial holdings in accordance with the Act of 1929.</P>
      <P>The Senator will probably remember that, in the case of non-judicial holdings, there is an automatic reduction of 35 per cent. provided by the Act of 1929.  If other non-judicial tenants are dissatisfied with that automatic reduction in their payment in lieu of rent, they are entitled subsequently to object, and there is ample provision made in this Bill for the hearing of their objections.  It is, without doubt, provided in the Bill that the tenants of holdings in respect of which advances of £3,000 or upwards have already been made are to be deemed to have entered into subsequent purchase agreements on the date of the publication of the lists, but in later sections of the Bill it is provided that these agreements can be afterwards cancelled, and that the sections in the Act of 1923 relating to retained hold ings shall apply in their entirety to these classes of tenancies.  The position has not been altered in the slightest, and the Land Commission has, under this Bill, the identical power that it had under the previous Land Acts to retain and resume land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section to which the Senator referred at some length relating to the <Col N="892" /> payment of compensation for disturbance and injury in the case of a certain class of tenancy is, in my opinion, the most important section in the Bill.  It will facilitate the Land Commission considerably in resuming land of that character for the purpose of relieving congestion, particularly in the western areas.  Most of these holdings at present are utilised for the purpose of providing land for the big type of farmers who are removed from certain western areas.  If any impression at all is to be made on the problem of congestion, it is necessary during the next few years that a larger number of these big farmers should be taken out of these areas and transplanted in areas where there is plenty of land available for the purpose.  This section will facilitate the Land Commission considerably in carrying out that work.</P>
    <P>The Senator seemed to imply that the landlords were getting some special treatment under this Bill&mdash;that the financial terms of the previous Acts had been altered in some way for the purpose of facilitating the landlords. I do not know whether the Senator wanted to convey that meaning to the House or not, but he must be aware that this Bill does not alter in any respect the financial terms of any one of the previous Land Acts.  The only way in which the landlord is facilitated under this Bill is by the provision for distribution of the purchase money more quickly than it would otherwise take place.  As a matter of fact, that will greatly facilitate the Land Commission. It will relieve the Land Commission of a certain amount of work.  It must be apparent to anybody that there is a considerable amount of work involved in the keeping of accounts for all the estates with which the Land Commission is dealing at the moment.  That money will not be distributed until the landlord shows title to the land and until the Land Commission is satisfied that his title is <i>bona fide.</i></P>
