      <P>The House will now proceed to the election of a Leas-Chathaoirleach. Pursuant to the Standing Orders, the motions proposing candidates will be formally moved and seconded in the order in which they appear on the Order Paper.  The names of the candidates will then be submitted to a preliminary vote. Voting papers will be distributed by the ushers, and each Senator will write on his voting paper the names of not more than two candidates.  He must then sign the voting paper in the place provided and hand it to the Clerk.  I shall ask if all Senators desiring to vote have voted, and the Clerk will then proceed to count the votes.  Once I have given directions to the Clerk to begin the count, no further voting papers may be received. The voting lists will be duly published in the Official Report of the Debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the count has been completed I shall announce the result thereof and the names of the two Senators obtaining the highest number of votes will <Col N="894" /> then be submitted to the House and a division taken between them, tellers being appointed for each candidate. The division bell will be rung, and after the usual five minutes' interval has elapsed the bell will be rung again and the doors locked.  The result of the division will be announced from the Chair, and the candidate obtaining the highest number of votes will be declared to have been duly elected as Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I will ask those Senators who have nominated candidates formally to move the adoption of their candidates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill which is now before the Seanad has been rendered necessary by certain defects found in the Local Government Act of 1925, a section of which had relation to the help which local authorities might give to the development of tourist traffic.  It was found on examination of that section, and the practice under that section has made the matter very clear, that there were two main defects.  Under that Act a local authority might, alone or jointly with other local authorities, subscribe towards, and undertake the duty of, advertising the amenities of particular areas.  There was also power given to them to contribute to the funds of a recognised association for the purpose of advertising the amenities of the district.  Secondly, under the old legislation the local authority could only strike a rate in a particular year. As it happened, the only association which has been recognised for the purpose found that when it should have been making preparation against the coming season it had no assured revenue, because the date for the striking of the rate had not come. Section 67 specified advertising as the purpose for which this money would be contributed.  According to legal interpretation that meant advertising in the ordinarily accepted meaning of the word, and it was to advertising only all the subscriptions related; no other activity could be financed out of the <Col N="897" /> money of the local authorities, save advertising in the ordinarily accepted meaning of the term.</P>
      <P>It is proposed by this legislation to remedy these three things.  We proceed in this way: the scheme of this legislation looks to one recognised association.  It does allow the local authorities to expend their own money, but only after permission has been given, and that permission will be given only in exceptional circumstances. Therefore, the scheme looks to the local authority not to expend its own money on advertising by itself, but rather to contribute in the main to an association which will do the business for it.  Secondly, it allows local authorities to enter into a contract for a period of years to strike a rate so that the society or societies may be assured of a known income for a period of years.  Thirdly, the old restriction of spending money only on advertising is taken away and the money may be spent on any scheme which receives the approval of the Minister concerned.  This legislation, therefore, sets out to remove the main defects with regard to the narrow restrictions relating to advertising and other defects, such as the inconveniences which developed as the old legislation operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the case of an urban district council which, possibly, might spend quite a lot of money in pushing forward the claims of its particular district for tourists from other parts of Ireland.  I take it that the development of tourist traffic does not mean encouraging Irish Free State citizens to travel from one part of the Free State to another.  I do not think that any rates ought to be allowed to be struck for any such purpose as that.  I assume that developing tourist traffic means trying to bring overseas tourists to Ireland&mdash;trying to encourage people to come here from other countries and spend their money in the same way as they do in Scotland and other countries.  I cannot see anything in the Bill, with the exception of the control to be exercised by the Minister, which will ensure that the money to be spent will be utilised <Col N="898" /> in advertising, so as to attract to the Free State the class of tourist traffic that we want.  We want overseas people to come to the Free State.  If we merely spend our money in competing with each other locally&mdash;Killarney, for instance, competing with other Irish resorts&mdash;it will be a pure waste of money.  The money to be derived from the rates should be spent on a scheme of advertising aimed at attracting the outside tourists and not Free State citizens.  As I have indicated, with the exception of the control that will be given to the Minister, I cannot find in the Bill anything which will ensure that this money will be spent on what is genuinely tourist traffic&mdash; bringing wealthy overseas people into the Free State.  I do not know how the Minister is going to exert his authority in order to bring that about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I must disagree with Senator Jameson's suggestion.  I think in the matter of tourist traffic there is a very big field to be covered in Ireland. We have thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people leaving this country each year in order to visit different parts of England, Scotland, the Isle of Man and other places.  I think we should concentrate our efforts on getting the Irish people to see Ireland first.  I can quite conceive it being well worth while to broadcast a slogan of that sort.  It is being done in almost every other country in the world.  Other countries use every effort in order to develop their tourist traffic and they do their utmost to encourage their own people to visit their own resorts.  I think Senator Jameson is taking a very short-sighted view of this matter.  The suggestion he has put forward is not covered in the Bill and I would be very sorry to see it covered in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there should be some provision made in this Bill whereby, if a rate is levied on rural parts of the country for the purpose of tourist traffic development, there should be some <i>quid pro quo.</i>  This association which has been referred to is eventually going to profit under this measure. <Col N="899" /> There may be some reference in the Bill to the benefit that is likely to be derived by the various parts of the country that will contribute to this development of tourist traffic, but at the moment I must confess I do not see it quite clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is mainly concerned with the development of tourist traffic.  It seems very strange that the cost of developing that traffic, which will benefit the entire country and every class in the country alike, should be placed altogether on the ratepayers.  When I mention ratepayers I mean more particularly the farmers.  The benefits derived from a development of tourist traffic are of interest to the farmers in a very small way only.  I suggest to the Minister that if it is desired to develop tourist traffic in such a way that it will be of advantage to the country as a whole he should provide the necessary money out of the Central Fund, which is contributed to by every citizen in the country.  I know that under this Bill it is optional with the local authorities to levy this rate.  I would like to point out, however, that a short time ago we had an example of where a rate which was originally optional with a certain local authority was raised by them and afterwards the Government introduced a Bill making that rate compulsory.  Have we any guarantee now that at some future time some Minister will not come along and declare that the rate which is provided under this Bill should be compulsory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers will not be very much concerned about this rate if they are promised a scheme of de-rating.  Up to this there has been no certainty of any such scheme.  I think it is time to stop the practice of having every new measure brought in here financed by the ratepayers.  If this measure is calculated to be of use to this country it ought to be financed by the country as a whole.  I strongly object even to permission being given to the county councils or other local authorities to <Col N="900" /> levy any further rates on the ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Linehan expressed the pathetic hope that we might have de-rating.  Considering the number of Bills that have been introduced here during the last six months, under which additional rates have been imposed upon the rural community, I think that what we are likely to have is not de-rating, but be-rating. We have been, during the last six months, be-rated to the extent of 11½d. in the £.  It is true that this is a permissive measure; the local authorities are to be permitted to levy rates, if they so desire, for the purpose of encouraging the tourist traffic.  What I object to is that the Bill is so framed that, unless they do that, nobody is going to do it.  I think this ought to be a national and not a local charge, and for that reason I agree with what Senator Linehan has said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill allows 2d. to be contributed to the company and 2d. to be used either directly by a council alone or jointly with other councils. The Minister stated that permission to spend money would be allowed only in special cases.  I presume he means special show places where they may desire to advertise particular amenities directly.  In the main this will be a voluntary rate comparable with the present voluntary rate.  I thought the present voluntary rate was 2d. and that this did not add anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Connolly's remarks about Irish people seeing the beauty spots of their own country first before travelling to other countries.  As far as this matter of advertising Irish tourist areas is concerned, <Col N="901" /> I think the Minister should first investigate whether our tourist areas are ready for foreign visitors.  I know that in the western districts of Ireland it can hardly be said that the tourist areas are ready for foreigners. The roads are almost impassable and the sanitary accommodation is on the poor side.  There are very few, if any, water supply schemes.  I am now referring to Achill Island and to other places along the western seaboard&mdash; Connemara generally.  Foreigners who read advertisements relating to those areas would get a terrible set back if they were to visit them at the moment. They would certainly get a very false impression, and I am sure they would go away with a bad opinion of what they had seen.  As regards catering, I would like the Minister to inquire into that matter and see if something could not be done to improve hotel accommodation and establish adequate water supply schemes and proper sanitary accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMacKean" hpid="Mr. MacKean Mr. MacKean">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacKean</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the two greatest obstacles to tourist development in Ireland are the slowness of the railways and the slowness of the hotels.  Until something is done in the way of improving the hotels and the railway services you can never have in this country a real development of tourist traffic.  I can claim a considerable amount of experience of Irish hotels.  My opinion is that instead of improving our hotels are disimproving.  There are some of the larger hotels, of course, as well equipped as any hotels you will find on the Continent.  On the other hand, the smaller hotels in this country are falling very much behind.  They supply a very indifferent sort of food.  The hotel proprietors seem to think all the time in terms of beef and mutton, and I may say that a chicken at the dinner table of a hotel in the country is indeed a <i>rara avis.</i>  Potatoes and other vegetables should be cheap enough in the country, but instead of lowering their prices the hotels in different parts of the Free State maintain them at the old standard.  The fact of the matter is that the prices are first class but the service is very second class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> Until some method is devised by which the Government or the Tourist Association can force our hotels to keep pace with the requirements of the age, I see no real chance of encouraging tourist traffic.  I think it is actually a fraud on tourists to invite them to see the beauty spots of Ireland when they have to put up with indifferent hotels, bad food, linen that is not clean, sanitary arrangements that are antiquated, and service of a casual and indifferent type.  Before we can deal adequately with the development of the tourist traffic we must have all these things remedied.</P>
    <P>With regard to the railways, there has been no change made in the matter of accommodation for many years.  The waiting rooms in most cases are in a scandalous condition; in fact, in many places there are no waiting rooms.  Take Mullingar as an example.  It is a big central station, and yet there is very poor waiting accommodation there.  I have gone into a carriage at Kingsbridge.  It was just after being washed, and the atmosphere was moist and smelt of cheap soap.  I have seen a lady go in with a pair of white gloves.  The seats had been wiped with a piece of dirty waste, with the result that the lady's gloves were black with the dirt of the carriage.  I have seen a boy hit the cushions of a carriage in the North of Ireland with a stick.  All the microbes that had been lying dormant there for generations&mdash;I mean generations of microbes&mdash;started into activity.  A visitor will not pass unnoticed things like that.  If we bring visitors over here on the false pretence that we have well-equipped hotels, with fine services, they will go back, and, instead of assisting our tourist traffic, they will do it very considerable harm.  If there is money to be given to assist tourist traffic, there should be some <i>quid pro quo</i>.  At the present time there is not. Next year there will be a great demand for accommodation in this country.  If some steps are not taken to meet that demand, in what position will our visitors find themselves?  The hotels and everything connected with them are antiquated.  If they were <Col N="903" /> clean I would not mind.  But they are antiquated and unclean.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the suggestion that instead of a local rate for this purpose there should be a central charge.  People living in remote districts will have to contribute under this Bill, although they will gain nothing.  I think that is grossly unfair, especially in view of recent happenings. I think the contention that development of tourist traffic justifies a local rate cannot be borne out at all. This local rate is intended, according to the Bill, to advertise the amenities and attractions of the country.  That probably means our main or trunk roads and the attractions of our great cinemas and dance palaces.  These, I presume, will be the attractions that will be advertised.  To my mind, it is grossly unfair that people living in remote districts, who hardly ever see any of these attractions, should be asked to contribute for this purpose.  I shall certainly vote against the Second Reading of this Bill if a division is called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the optional rate, I am inclined to agree with the contention that these optional rates have a tendency to lose their optional character and to become mandatory, as Senator Linehan has pointed out.  The opportunity <Col N="904" /> is always being sought to make these rates compulsory.  If the matter is examined, it will be found that in practice these optional rates lose their optional character very soon.  I doubt if there is a single voluntary rate which has received statutory authority or sanction that has not been levied off the people, and very often off people who cannot hope to enjoy any of the advantages accruing from it.  I do not oppose the development of tourist traffic.  I think it is very desirable that we should have money spent in the country in that way, but I think that the principle contained in the Bill is wrong and that this expenditure should be a central charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand, the principle of this Bill is to ensure that, in the main, money to be spent by local authorities in advertising the amenities and attractions of the country shall be canalised and spent in a particular, organised fashion.  I certainly agree with that principle, which is the main principle in the Bill.  The question as to the amount which a locality may vote is not a new principle at all.  I gather that it will be optional for the councils under this Bill to increase the amount they vote but that is not a matter of principle. The principle is clearly to ensure that that money shall be wisely expended and not spasmodically or sporadically expended.  I think that it is very advisable to put that principle into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Senator MacKean's case, I would direct his attention to the activities of the present organisation, which I presume will be&mdash;until it fails to do its work, at any rate&mdash;the body which will be recognised and approved by the Minister.  The activities of that association are, to a considerable extent, directed to doing the very thing that Senator MacKean desires should be done&mdash;improving the hotel attractions. I have spoken to certain people who are intimately associated with this organisation and they were of opinion that there should be some power which would deprive proprietors of certain premises from describing <Col N="905" /> these premises as &ldquo;hotels&rdquo; unless they conformed to certain minimum conditions.  I think that that is a very important thing in these days of pretty wide advertising.  A person may have a place in which he provides &ldquo;entertainment for man and beast.&rdquo;  He does not mind what charge he makes, if it is high enough.  He does not mind what the service is or what facilities he provides.  He is quite prepared to call that place a &ldquo;hotel.&rdquo;  A person in Manchester reads an advertisement that, say, the &ldquo;Imperial Hotel, of Ballaghadereen,&rdquo; will provide all necessary accommodation at so much per day.  The reader of that advertisement has no idea of the capacity of that hotel to provide necessary facilities.  I think it should be an offence for any person to advertise in this way unless his premises conform to certain standards.  I think it would be well that this Association, or some association, should get power to classify hotels, so that a person who is aiming at a visit to this country would know the kind and character of the hotel he is seeking and would have some guidance as to what kind of accommodation he would have, apart from the question of price. That has been done in some of the Continental countries and the information given in certain of the guides is, I think, quite reliable.  I believe that the organisation that is to be approved by the Minister should have some authority to compile a register of hotels which they would certify as being in conformity with certain requirements.</P>
    <P>The attributes of uncleanliness and bad food, to which Senator MacKean referred, I hope are very much exaggerated. Unless one is aiming at the very highest luxury, his would hardly be the general experience.  It has not been my experience, at all events.  That may be because I had not looked for the particular kind of luxury to which Senator MacKean is accustomed.  I think it would be a great mistake for the tourist industry, as it is being called nowadays, to aim at the establishment of hotels simply to provide lavish accommodation for a <Col N="906" /> few persons for a few weeks in the year.  Senator MacKean will, I am sure, agree with me that the greatest advantage possible would come to the country if the aim of the hotel proprietors was to improve the accommodation for the commercial traveller and the regular visitors.  I think that if that were done, it would have a levelling-up effect and that the hotels could cater for the kind of tourist who is likely to be most beneficial to this country&mdash;the tourist who will come, and send his friends, from England, Scotland, Germany or France&mdash;and not the occasional visitor from across the Atlantic who is expected to spend, but never does, many thousands of pounds in the course of his few weeks' visit.  Inquiries I have made generally confirm the view that the alleged American &ldquo;millionaire&rdquo; tourist is a fancy.  That is to say, he does not exist. A few tourists from England and Scotland are generally more serviceable to the locality than the occasional visitor from across the Atlantic.  That is the view I have heard expressed in many cases.  I think you will attract that kind of visitor in much greater numbers by improving the smaller and more homely hotels rather than by catering for those who come for a short time in summer and who seek lavish food, lavish furnishings and all the rest. The Association that is doing the work which this Bill seeks to pursue is doing it very well and quite on the lines that Senator MacKean and other members of the House have advocated.  Therefore I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Johnson attributes to me epicurean tastes which I do not possess at all.  I like to see a plain, nice, well-kept, clean hotel. The majority of hotels in Ireland are not of that type.  I should know as much about hotels as any man in this House, because I pass from one hotel to another from New Ross to Bundoran. I did not make the statements I made here with any intention of throwing slurs on the hotel owners.  I did so in the hope that by calling attention to these little defects in the way of cleanliness, which could be <Col N="907" /> easily remedied, something would be done to meet what is at present a grievance.  I did not speak with any personal feeling against hotel owners.</P>

      <P>I only rise to say that business compelled me, three or four years ago, to travel very extensively in remote parts of the country in which creameries are situate.  The impression made on me as regards hotels was not at all of the nature that Senator MacKean has described to the House. Our hotels may not be up to the standard of hotels in Switzerland, which is a tourist country, but they are not of the type that Senator MacKean spoke of.  I should not like that it would go out that our hotels are as Senator MacKean described them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a good deal of what Senator MacKean said is true&mdash; that is to say, that if you are going to make tourist traffic in this country a bigger thing than it is, better value for money must be given.  Otherwise there cannot be much increase.  There are a certain number of hotels which are very good, but they are full during the season, so that no amount of organisation will serve them very much.  What I fear is that a great deal of this money that is to be contributed by the ratepayers for the improvement of the organisation of tourist traffic will be wasted.  I hold that the people who ought to put up the money are those who are directly interested.  A great many ratepayers are neither directly or indirectly interested in this matter, and it is quite possible that a great deal of money may be wasted in connection with it. For that reason I would be inclined to think that the Bill might be improved by restricting within narrowest limits the amount of the contribution that can be made.  On the other hand, I recognise that the Irish Tourist Traffic Development Association are doing good, educative good.  It is to be presumed that this Bill will help them to do more of it.  What amount of good you can produce now by this class of work, I do not know.  I used to know a good deal about that work at one time, but things alter very <Col N="908" /> quickly now.  It may be that this type of work will be a national benefit, but I agree with the view which has been expressed that there will not be benefit to the country as a whole unless you bring tourists in from some other country.</P>
      <P>To the extent that a person may take a holiday in his own country rather than go outside, a certain amount of money is conserved.  On the other hand, it is very much better for him to go outside his country for a holiday, just as it is better for an Englishman to go outside his country. By going outside one's country one gets a change, which is what is wanted.  Our real aim should be to get the people from the very much bigger countries to come over here and enjoy a change.  I do not know to what extent that can be done by organisation, but I suppose it can be better done with organisation than without it. However, I see great difficulties in the way.  I do not believe that any amount of organisation is going to produce very big tourist traffic in this country, because the season is too short.  We have also the difficulty that at present there are very few good hotels of the smart sort.  There is lack of good value for money in quite humble accommodation, including lodging-houses.</P>
      <P>The Tourist Development Association has my best wishes.  I hope they will do good, but I am very doubtful whether it should be made possible to spend the ratepayers' money on this-matter to the extent provided in this Bill.  Of course, the ratepayers have the remedy in their own hands.  But there is a danger that when a facility of this kind is given people will go on striking the rate without being very critical as to what results are being obtained.  I should like to see, on Committee Stage, the amount of the contributions restricted to narrower limits.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but I feel that if the remarks that Senator MacKean made are broadcast to any extent they may do a vast amount of harm.  I think I know this country as <Col N="909" /> well as most people.  Although the Senator is perfectly correct in describing the conditions in some of the hotels in the villages and smaller towns, which have really no attractions for tourists at all, my experience is that in the tourist districts the accommodation is by no means bad.  A great number of people who come here do not come with the notion that they are going to receive the same sort of food which would be served in an expensive Parisian hotel.  They are quite pleased to get away from that and to get simple, plain food, served under clean conditions.  In the tourist districts such service is to be obtained.  I do not think that tourists should be discouraged by getting the idea that the conditions which Senator MacKean described prevail all over the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister made a case for the principle of the Bill with perfect clearness.  There seems to be no question at all that if money is to be spent at all it should be spent under some sort of central control and should not be spent simply on advertising.  I have a kind of feeling that if I were to travel as much and as frequently as Senator MacKean I would make exactly the same kind of speech that he made.  I think he might even be forgiven&mdash;I did not hear all that he said&mdash;if he exaggerated the circumstances. Whether we like to admit it or not there is a great deal in what he said, though there is a danger that speeches such as his may be made to apply to other places where clean hotels can be found.  Senator Johnson thinks that the only Americans who travel are those who spend a few thousand pounds.  I have good reason to believe that a very large number of the Americans who travel in Europe have not a great deal of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but they do want clean hotels and they do want some way by which they can get a list of guaranteed hotels to which they know they can go with confidence.  I was told by a gentleman in the American <Col N="910" /> Express Agency, whom I met some years ago, that he did not at that time include Ireland in the list of countries in his itinerary for people who wanted to visit Europe.  He said that he only included Ireland when they asked for it.  He did not include it as a matter of course because of the difficulties of being certain that the accommodation at a medium-class hotel would be satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Johnson that you will need to get powers to act somewhat drastically.  I think some power should be provided whereby you would get a uniform, reasonable standard of cleanliness at a reasonably uniform price.  At the present time in Europe, particularly in Germany, there are a large number of people doing walking tours.  That habit is spreading all over Europe.  They do not necessarily confine themselves to places of specific tourist interest.  They want to go through the country.  I am told that in many cases they are afraid to do walking tours throughout Ireland because they want only inexpensive hotels.  They cannot afford elaborate hotels.  They may not be able to walk far enough in the day to reach a tourist district where they would be certain of getting a hotel of moderate standard, such as a commercial hotel.</P>
      <P>If the central body which is to receive the money under this Bill could be given power to compile a list of hotels which would reach a certain uniform standard and which would provide accommodation at a reasonable price, it would do much to attract the tourist of the common or garden type from other countries.  That would be good for us and good for them.  I think that it would be a great advantage if we could advertise the fact that there were dotted all over the country clean hotels with moderate prices which were satisfactory, particularly in regard to lavatory accommodation, which is not always the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better take up the points in order, because they are for the most part of Committee Stage type.  With regard to the point mentioned by Senator Jameson, I must <Col N="911" /> admit that the only way in which the standard of the Association's work is going to be settled is by central control&mdash;by the Minister.  In so far as he referred to area advertising against area, the scheme here, though it is not absolute, is designed to prevent that sort of thing happening.  We do want to have a single organisation centrally governed, instead of having two or three organisations advertising particular areas.  When I first came in touch with this matter, many years ago, there were three separate tourist associations.  It took a considerable amount of effort to get these associations to coalesce.  We want to preserve that central body and to give it as much power as possible.  Now and again there may be an exceptional place which will require facilities for advertising itself.  We have got power in the Bill whereby such a place may advertise itself instead of having its money spent centrally.</P>
      <P>With regard to the speech of Senator The McGillycuddy of the Reeks, the <i>quid pro quo</i> that we expect from the Association is that it will do proper advertising.  If it does not do proper advertising, having regard to what is suitable for such an Association to do, we will have to see that another association comes along and takes its place.  The money is given on recognised conditions.  Accounts have to be submitted and audited, the scheme according to which the money is to be expended has to be passed, so that there is a certain amount of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators have referred to the charge on the ratepayers.  All I can say is that we do not impose&mdash;I stress the word &ldquo;impose&rdquo;&mdash;any charge on the ratepayer.  There is permission given to local authorities to raise money.  They need not do it if they do not wish.  When the Local Government Act of 1925 was going through, certain representations were made by most of the local authorities asking that such permission should be given them.  A certain amount of pressure had been put upon the local authorities by the Tourist Development Association.  As a matter of fact, of the 26 Counties, all but six <Col N="912" /> did, in fact, subscribe in the year ending March, 1930.  Of these six, it is peculiar that one is notably a tourist county&mdash;a county which depends, to a great extent, on the fact that it has certain amenities and certain scenic attractions.  It did not subscribe in that particular year, although it was one of the places which was clearly going to benefit.  As to those who propose to vote against the Bill, I would ask them what will be the position if this Bill is defeated.  It will be simply this&mdash;that local authorities will be able to subscribe the money they have subscribed heretofore, but that money can only be spent on advertising, in the limited sense of the word.  Certain things that we want to get done through the Association, by means of the money of the local authorities, will not be achieved.</P>
    <P>What Senator The McGillycuddy has said hardly arises here.  As to the complaint that certain roads are impassable, and as to the complaint that from the point of view of sanitary accommodation certain places are unfit for tourists, the remedy is not under this Bill.  There may be a point later in the contention that certain places of ill-repute, from the point of view of tourist traffic, should not be advertised. Again, we shall have to depend to some extent on the Association. The Association has managed its business very well up to the present, having regard to the limited moneys they had to spend and in relation to the manner in which they had to spend the money as it came to them.</P>
    <P>Senator MacKean has, in fact, put his finger upon one of the difficulties of the situation.  One of the ways in which the Association, up to date, wanted to spend money was in having inspectors appointed to look after hotels so that hotels could be graded, or at any rate that certain good hotels would be promised a recognition which would not be accorded to hotels of less repute.  That particular type of activity was prohibited under the 1925 Act because it was not advertising, the word &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; being narrowly interpreted.  The Association had, in fact, before them a scheme for the inspection of hotels, and even advanced <Col N="913" /> to the point that Senator Johnson spoke of, of regularising hotels according to certain standards of comfort, cleanliness, service, and so on, and the type of pleasure afforded in the neighbourhood of the hotel.  The Association could not spend any money for that purpose, but they will be enabled to do so under this legislation.  Even though the matter may appear to have been over-stressed, it is no harm, I think, that vent should have been given to the complaint Senator MacKean has.  He has obviously suffered from these hotels, and it is only when a man has suffered that he can speak with feeling.</P>
    <P>This hotel matter is one about which a great deal could be said, and on which a great deal of adverse comment could be made.  There are places which are called hotels which should not appear in any tourist development list as hotels to which tourists should be invited.  In fact, there are a great number of such places from which tourists should be definitely kept away.  Recently a friend of mine landed at Cobh in the early hours of the morning.  He was simply grabbed by a brigand of a jarvey and brought to what was called a hotel.  The bell had to be pressed on three occasions before an attendant arrived.  When he did make his appearance he seemed to suffer from a certain amount of beverage, more than would appear to be good for him at four o'clock in the morning.  Later, when the smell of food being cooked got through the house my friend made some inquiries and was told that was the family breakfast, and that he could not partake of it.  That place was described as a hotel.  People are brought to such places by the drivers of vehicles in these areas.  They are feed to bring people who arrive by the early boat in the morning to them.  Activity of an undesirable type of that kind should be stopped.</P>
    <P>With regard to the railways, I am not so sure that the Senator's complaint was well founded.  He complained of carriages being damp.  That is a thing that should be attended to. It is well it was raised, because we can <Col N="914" /> have it brought to the notice of the railway directors.  From the statistical information that I have, I should not like to let it go forth, without some sort of reserve at any rate, that the transport facilities here are not given in a proper way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMacKean" hpid="Mr. MacKean Mr. MacKean">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacKean</NameTxt>
      <P>On that might I make an explanation?  The first train in the morning that goes down to Trim serves a district that has interesting archaeological associations.  As the train does not arrive there until ten minutes past eleven o'clock half the day is gone and visitors have not much time to visit the archaeological remains in that part of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that if the people here expect cheaper transport they are under a delusion.  Any investigation of the problem that we have made shows that passengers are being carried at less than the ordinary cost of bringing them from one place to another and that goods are subsidising passengers.  That is a situation that can hardly hold, and if people want better railways, faster train services and more frequent train services, better accommodation in the way of carriage cushions being kept cleaner, and so on, then I think they will have to pay more for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson, I think, made one mistake as regards the legislation in respect to the maximum amount.  The Bill was amended in Committee when it was before the Dáil, the maximum amount now being threepence.  The Senator, if he reads Sections 3 and 4 together, will find that under them the amount contributed cannot exceed a maximum of threepence.  It is slightly larger than the maximum under the 1925 legislation.  When this Bill was introduced originally in the Dáil I had exactly the same maximum, but on the Report Stage in the Dáil the maximum was fixed at threepence.  The old system used to be a maximum of 3d. over a county, including any special rate from any particular area.  In the Bill originally the provision was that there might be a contribution equal to <Col N="915" /> a rate of a penny in the £ on the rateable value of such county or county borough plus a maximum of 2d.  Now it is a penny on the rateable value of a county plus 3d.  The maximum has been extended by 1d.  As a matter of fact, it is only a permission.  There is no attempt to impose this on any county council or local authority, but the practice has been for local authorities to contribute.  Probably by far the biggest amount of the funds of the Association comes from the local authorities.  I agree with Senator Bagwell that more should be expected from hotelkeepers&mdash;the people who are going to benefit directly&mdash;particularly those who are likely to get on the good list.  They should subscribe more than they do.  I do not think there is any other point that requires to be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>There are quite a number of points that I think ought to be touched upon before this motion is passed.  The Treaty itself is, I think, the first of what will likely be a series of somewhat similar treaties.  Therefore I think we ought to know exactly where we stand and what the principles in operation are.  What I have to say on the matter will be preliminary to voting in favour of the motion, but I think there are some points that require explanation by the Minister.  To begin with, I take it as quite a courtesy to the Seanad that the motion is submitted in this form at all. We are asked to approve and to recommend the Executive Council to take steps to ratify.  It happens that Article 25 of the Treaty says that &ldquo;the present Treaty, after having been approved by Dáil Eireann and by the Competent Legislative Authorities on the part of the German Reich, shall be ratified,&rdquo; and so on.  So that the form of the Treaty itself does not recognise the Oireachtas so much as the Dáil.  I say, therefore, it is somewhat of a courtesy that this Treaty is formally brought to our notice as a Seanad at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question I want to raise is as to whether, in Article 7, the term &ldquo;The British Commonwealth of Nations&rdquo; is understood by the German Government in the same sense as <Col N="918" /> it is by the Free State Government. The same term is included in the Portuguese Treaty.  In the Portuguese Treaty and in this Treaty the corresponding foreign text signifies &ldquo;the British Empire&rdquo; where the English text speaks of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I think it is quite understandable that the use of this new term in recent years should be somewhat vague.  That is to say, it does not bear a precise definition, and perhaps there is some misunderstanding as between the British Government and the British people, the Free State Government and the Free State people, Australians, Canadians, and so on, on the significance of the term &ldquo;British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;  It may not be any great harm that the term has not been specifically defined.  But so far as we are concerned, when we put it into a Treaty, it surely is important that the other parties to the Treaty should have the same understanding of the term as we have ourselves.</P>
    <P>It has been stated, for instance, that the term &ldquo;British Commonwealth of Nations&rdquo; only includes those Dominions with Great Britain and the Free State which are independent, self-governing, and have representation on the League of Nations and are recognised by it.  If that is the meaning in this particular Article, then it is a question as to whether the succeeding Article in the Treaty would apply, let us say, to Ceylon or perhaps even to India.  Although India is represented on the League of Nations, it is not a self-governing Dominion of the British Empire.  If that narrow definition is the real definition, and is understood by the German Government as well as by the Free State Government, it would rule out many countries&mdash;Ceylon, Newfoundland, I think, the West Indian Islands, Rhodesia, Malay, and quite a number of other places with which there may be traffic at some time or other.  The important thing, I think, is that the German Government should have the same understanding of this term as we have ourselves.  In the German text there is a phrase which clearly indicates &ldquo;British Empire.&rdquo;  We have to take <Col N="919" /> it, therefore, that &ldquo;the British Commonwealth of Nations&rdquo; has the same meaning as &ldquo;British Empire&rdquo; has. That, surely, is likely to be a difficulty in the future.  It certainly has been stated in the Dáil that the term &ldquo;British Commonwealth of Nations&rdquo; is something different from the term &ldquo;British Empire&rdquo; in its meaning.  I think it is important that this matter should be cleared up at an early stage in these international conventions in which the term occurs.</P>
    <P>In Article 5&mdash;to come back again for a moment&mdash;there is a reference to exemption from all compulsory military service.  That is to say, that Free State nationals in Germany will not be obliged to serve in the Army, or that if there were compulsory military service here German nationals in this country would not be obliged to serve in the Army.  The Article goes on to say: &ldquo;They shall similarly be exempted from all judicial, administrative, and municipal functions whatever, other than those imposed by the laws relating to juries.</P>
    <P>I am in a difficulty to know what exactly is exempted there.  Is it meant that only those judicial, administrative and municipal functions which are obligations shall be exempted, or are we to take it that those functions may be the duties and privileges of residents in this country? Is it the function that is exempted and does exemption there imply prohibition; that a German living in the Free State will be exempted or prohibited from exercising the vote? That is a municipal function.  Will a German citizen living in the Free State be exempted from serving in the Dáil, if elected, or on a municipal council, if elected?  I am inclined to presume, after reading the next paragraph, that this word &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; rather implies exemption from obligations that are imposed upon all the citizens, but it seems to bear the interpretation that it is a deprivation of what is the right accorded in the main to residence in the country.  I do not think it would be desired by the people of this State to exempt or deprive of the right to vote a resident who was of German nationality <Col N="920" /> and who had not taken out Free State naturalisation papers.</P>
    <P>There is a series of Articles dealing with navigation, light dues, tonnage and harbour dues.  It appears that what we are asked to say is that henceforth, while this Treaty is in effect, no preference shall be given to vessels of Irish Free State register which will not equally apply to German vessels; and, similarly, that German vessels will not have preference over Free State vessels in German ports.  As the number of Irish national vessels is very small and the number of German national vessels is very great, the advantage in this matter is clearly with the Germans.  It ought to be known that we are entering into an obligation not to give a special preference to Irish national shipping over German shipping.</P>
    <P>In Article 14 there is a provision giving a preference in respect of fish&mdash;</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Treaty shall not be applicable to the special treatment which is, or may hereafter be, accorded by either of the contracting parties to fish caught by vessels of that party.  Fish caught by vessels of either party shall not be treated less favourably in any respect on importation into the territory of the other than fish caught by the vessels of any other country.</P>
    <P>That could be quite well understood as a Treaty between Great Britain and Germany, but I am not quite sure what its effect would be in respect of herrings caught by the Scotch drifters in Donegal and exported to Germany. They are not caught by vessels of the Free State.  Are they to be treated on equal terms and as though they had been caught by vessels belonging to the Free State?  I think that the great bulk of the fish caught around our coast and shipped to Germany is caught by vessels not belonging to this State.  Therefore, this particular provision would seem to have no reference to the bulk of the fish exported from this country, because it is not caught by vessels belonging to this State. Articles 15 to 19 deal with matters of tonnage rates, harbour rates, pilotage, lighthouse, quarantine or other <Col N="921" /> analogous duties.  We are again contracting with the German Government not to give any preference to Free State ships which will not apply equally to German ships, and we are not to give any preferences to British ships which are not to apply to German ships.  That is not stated in so many words, but it is the clear implication of these Articles.</P>
    <P>There is another Article which, in effect, is a proviso which says &ldquo;the provisions of this Treaty relating to the mutual concession of national treatment in matters of navigation do not apply to the coasting trade.&rdquo;  Now, I am at a loss to know what that means, because, in practice, unless there have been great changes in the last few years in the shipping trade, the merchanting of goods traffic between Dublin and Belfast is coasting trade, as it is between Dublin and Liverpool, Cork and Liverpool, Cork and Bristol.  So that while we are making certain concessions in regard to tonnage rates, harbour rates, etc., saying that we are giving to German ships in Free State harbours treatment equal to that which we give British ships or to Free State ships in those harbours, we are also saying that these concessions will not apply in respect to the coasting trade.  Are we certain that the Free State Government and the German Government understand that the trade referred to as &ldquo;coasting trade&rdquo; is the coasting trade round the ports of the Saorstát only, or are we contracting to put German ships in respect to all Free State ports on equal terms not only with our own ships but with British ships?  Are we binding ourselves to give to German ships the same terms and privileges in regard to all shipping that we are doing in respect to British ships?</P>
    <P>There is a further point.  Unless there has been change within recent years, it was customary for harbour dues and light dues to be on a lower scale for coasting traffic than for foreign-going vessels.  Cross-Channel traffic was always treated as coasting traffic and, therefore, charged on the lower rate.  British ships, in the main, do that coasting traffic.  It would seem to me to follow from this Treaty that <Col N="922" /> henceforward German ships travelling, say, from Hamburg to a Free State port must be placed in the same category as British ships which are doing a coasting trade.  If that is understood it is all right, but if there is any doubt in the interpretation of this Treaty in that respect I think it may cause some difficulty in the future.  The term &ldquo;coasting trade&rdquo; has hitherto been held to mean cross-Channel trade as well as trade around the coast of Ireland, and even taking Ireland as a geographical unit traffic between Dublin and Belfast was surely coasting trade.  Is it still coasting trade?  If it is, then it would seem to me to follow that Hamburg to Cork traffic would be coasting trade.  I am rather doubtful whether that is the intention of this Treaty.</P>
    <P>Article 23 provides that this general series of most-favoured-nation provisions will not extend in respect of favours already granted or to be granted hereafter by either of the contracting parties to an adjoining State &ldquo;to facilitate traffic to certain frontier districts, as a rule not extending beyond 15 kilometres on each side of the frontier, and for residents in such districts.&rdquo; That is quite easily understood, particularly when we have regard to the recent provisions respecting butter going across the Border.</P>
    <P>Then we have paragraph 2 of Article 23, which sets out:</P>
    <P>The provisions of the present Treaty with regard to the grant of the treatment of the most-favoured-nation do not extend to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2)  Favours granted by either of the Contracting Parties to a third State in virtue of a Customs Union which has already been or may hereafter be concluded.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3 says:</P>
    <P>(3)  Favours which either of the Contracting Parties has granted or may hereafter grant to a third State in agreements for the avoidance of double taxation and the mutual protection of the revenue.</P>
    <P>It would almost seem to me that if the present ideas regarding a customs union come to fruition, and if the relations <Col N="923" /> between the States that are members of the British Commonwealth are to be interpreted as being a customs union, there will not be very much left within the scope of this general scheme.  These are some of the points that occur to me as being worthy of further elucidation.  I make these comments in the hope that some of the doubts I have expressed as to the interpretation of the Treaty have been made quite clear to the other party.  I hope the Minister will reassure me on the point, particularly in regard to those two matters&mdash;one, as to the recognition of the meaning of the term &ldquo;British Commonwealth of Nations,&rdquo; and, two, the interpretation of the term &ldquo;coasting trade.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that the points outlined by Senator Johnson have been raised.  I am not sure that I will be able to give him the entire satisfaction that he would like in regard to all his points.  This Treaty took us very much longer than one year to negotiate, not because there was any lack of good-will as between the parties, but simply because there were so many details to be covered and because we did regard this Treaty as a model Treaty, a Treaty which will be the basis of most of the trade relationships into which we will enter with other countries.  We left certain things somewhat open, it being recognised that the Treaty may be denounced on six months' notice and may thereby be subject to amendment on disputed points.</P>
      <P>As to the clause dealing with exemptions, all that we set out to achieve here was that nationals of either of the contracting parties should be exempted from certain things which they considered undesirable.  For instance, the nationals of either of the contracting parties in the territory of the other shall be exempted from all compulsory military service, whether in the Army, Navy, Air Force, National Guard or Militia.  Similarly, they shall be exempted from all judicial, administrative and municipal functions other than those imposed by the laws relating to juries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> The Senator raised the special point about a German being allowed to stand for Parliament and being allowed to serve if elected.  If we attempted to impose an obligation on a German to stand for Parliament, or if there was compulsory voting in this country and we attempted to impose it on a German resident in this country, I think that under the terms of this Treaty he could object.  On the other hand, if we decided under the municipal law to grant to a German resident in this country the right to vote or stand for election, I do not think anybody could use this Treaty as against that person availing himself of the right.  It seems to me that it is only where the person himself regards it as something compulsory and objectionable that he might claim exemption.  That, at any rate, is the framework of the section, and I may say that the trouble that is likely to arise under it will be small.</P>
    <P>A variety of matters was raised by the Senator with regard to shipping. Under Article 16 we do guarantee that in regard to duties of tonnage, harbour, pilotage, lighthouse, quarantine, or other analogous duties or charges of whatever denomination levied in the name or for the account of the Government, public authorities, concession-aries or undertakings of any kind, the vessels of each of the contracting parties shall enjoy in the ports of the territory of the other treatment at least as favourable as that accorded to national vessels or to the vessels of any other country.  In respect of specific duties&mdash;duties of tonnage, harbour, pilotage, lighthouse, quarantine or other analogous duties or charges&mdash; certain vessels are guaranteed national treatment.  The ships affected are the vessels of each of the contracting parties.</P>
    <P>The Senator raised the point: What vessels are &ldquo;the vessels of the contracting parties&rdquo;?  Section 17 makes an attempt to deal with that, and it sets out that: &ldquo;The nationality of vessels shall be recognised by each of the contracting parties in accordance with the laws and ordinances of the other, and shall be proved by the documents issued by the competent authorities and carried on board.&rdquo;  With regard <Col N="925" /> to boats which carry herrings caught off our coast, say within our territorial waters, whether or not these boats will be considered as boats of ours will have to be determined by our shipping legislation.  The question of the registration of the boats will, of course, then arise.  If they are registered here, then they are our boats, and they will get whatever favourable treatment they are entitled to under this Treaty. Boats will have to be registered in connection with herring fisheries.  Already some boats have attempted to take out registration, and a certain type of registration has been introduced in regard to them.</P>
    <P>With regard to Article 14, I did not quite catch the Senator's point.  Reference was, however, made to boats carrying fish, caught around our coast, to Germany.  The Treaty sets out: &ldquo;The provisions of this Treaty shall not be applicable to the special treatment which is, or may hereafter be, accorded by either of the Contracting Parties to fish caught by vessels of that Party.  Fish caught by vessels of either Party shall not be treated less favourably in any respect on importation into the territory of the other than fish caught by the vessels of any other country.&rdquo;  Again, the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;of either Party&rdquo; will have to be determined in accordance with Article 17.  If and when the whole thing is clear we shall not give less favourable treatment in any respect on importation than would be given to fish caught by the vessels of any other country; in other words, the most-favoured-nation treatment is accorded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, I did not make my point clear.  Let us take the Scottish herring boats as an example. They land their fish in Buncrana.  The fish are cured in this State and they are shipped from Buncrana to Germany. Does this Treaty guarantee that these fish, not caught by vessels of this State, will be treated equally as though they were caught by vessels of this State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not as far as this Article is concerned.  The fish are caught by vessels which are not &ldquo;of either Party.&rdquo;  There is an Article <Col N="926" /> with regard to the exportation of goods which would have a bearing on those fish, but this Article would not have any bearing.  I am in doubt as to the point raised in connection with Article 18, which says:</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Treaty relating to the mutual concession of national treatment in matters of navigation do not apply to the coasting trade, in respect of which the nationals and vessels of each of the Contracting Parties shall enjoy most-favoured-nation treatment in the territory of the other, provided that reciprocity be assured.</P>
      <P>In respect of that we guarantee most-favoured-nation treatment if there is reciprocity.  The Senator is really, I think, querying what is coastal trade. That, again, may have to be determined by practice.  I want, however, to be precise on one point.  Trade between Hamburg and Cork is not coastal trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>What about trade between Cork and Liverpool?  Is it coastal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.  The trade between Cork and Belfast is a more difficult thing to determine.  The trade between Cork and Liverpool is not coastal and the trade between Cork and Hamburg is decidedly not coastal.  There were two big points raised with regard to Article 23 and Article 7.  According to Article 23 the provisions of the Treaty with regard to the grant of the treatment of the most-favoured-nation do not extend to favours granted by either of the contracting parties to a third State in virtue of a customs union.  Consequently we do not receive by virtue of this Treaty any advantages which Germany may give to Austria through the projected Austro-German Customs Union.  Even if customs arrangements are hereafter concluded between different members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and if these arrangements were to count as a customs union, I think that there would still be quite a lot of value in this Treaty if it continued to regulate our relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> With regard to Article 7, I think that there we find a difficulty in translation more than anything else.  We have no doubt as to what is meant in that Article and I cannot conceive that the Germans are in any doubt as to what we mean.  The term &ldquo;British Commonwealth of Nations&rdquo; is a wider term than the British Empire.  The British Empire is in itself one of the sections of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  &ldquo;British Empire&rdquo; has, in fact, now come to mean &ldquo;British Colonial Empire.&rdquo;  The meaning of &ldquo;British Commonwealth of Nations&rdquo; emerged to some point of clarity in the 1926 Conference, and year by year it is becoming clearer to the nations which <Col N="928" /> frequent Geneva.  Even though there is some slight difficulty because people may, in rhetorical moments, use the term &ldquo;British Empire&rdquo; in the old meaning, I do not think there is any difficulty when it comes to a matter of precise documents.  There may be confusion in the phrase used in the German text, but as far as we are concerned we rely on the English text of the Treaty.  There is really no doubt as to what the term &ldquo;British Commonwealth of Nations&rdquo; covers in the minds of the nations with which we have frequently to deal.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
