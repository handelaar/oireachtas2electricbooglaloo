      <P>I have considered a request from Senator Howard to raise, on the motion for the adjournment this evening, the following matter: the present dispute involving the local authority engineers.  I rule this matter is not suitable for discussion on the adjournment on the grounds that there is no ministerial responsibility involved.</P>

      <P>When the Cathaoirleach gives a ruling it is not open to a Senator to dispute it in the House.  There is a long tradition in this House of acceptance by Senators of the rulings of the Chair and I know that the Senator would be the last to depart from that tradition.  I hope that I am not being unreasonable in expecting the Senator to accept the Chair's ruling even if one does not agree with it.</P>

      <P>When the Seanad last met on 8 November it allowed the First Stage of the Family Planinng Bill, 1978, and at that time I was asked when I would like to have the next Stage taken. I asked that it might be taken in two weeks and there was no objection on any side of the House to that.  It was stated in the report for that day: &ldquo;Second Stage ordered for Wednesday, 22 November 1978&rdquo;.  I requested the Leader of the House to order it today when he was describing the items which he proposed to the House should be taken this afternoon.  He noted my request but clearly he is not prepared to accede to it.  It is particularly regrettable that he has not ordered the Bill because the House did not meet last week as there was no business for it.  We adjourned <i>sine die.</i>  We are now meeting this afternoon and there are four items ordered.  I submit that, if these items take up most or all of the Business of the House today, the House should meet <Col N="223" /> tomorrow to discuss the principles and give a Second Reading to the Family Planning Bill, 1978.  The Labour Party have tabled this Bill because of the need to legalise the availability of contraceptives, to change the censorship laws and give the health boards an active role in this very important health problem.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party tabled this Bill and sought a First Stage to have it published because they regard this as a very urgent social and medical problem.  It is a situation which continues to discriminate against the minority and continues to place women in Ireland in a very disadvantaged position. There is a feeling at times that it is not an urgent problem.  The Labour Party believe that the Government are neglecting their responsibilities in the matter and this despite the fact that the Taoiseach said that Fianna Fáil would introduce legislation within a year of being in office.  They are now 17 months in office and there is no sign of any Bill being tabled in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Seanad could have an opportunity to express a view on the urgency of the problem and on the real medical and social need for a change in the law. This House has taken the initiative before in relation to debating family planning.  For that reason I propose an amendment of the Order of Business so that Item No. 6 be added to the items to be taken by the House and that, if necessary, the House sit tomorrow for a debate on the Family Planning Bill, 1978.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want on the Order of Business to detract from the importance or the urgency of the Bill which Senator Robinson has mentioned. I want, on the other hand, to draw attention to Motion No. 20:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to make an order to preserve indefinitely the Viking site at Wood Quay already designated a National Monument, in view of the many other sites in Dublin available for civic offices.</P>
      <P>I raised this in the House some weeks ago on the grounds, and under the very urgent understanding, that there is a deadline really pending in this case.  It is only a matter of days or, if we are to believe the newspapers, hours before developments on Wood Quay begin to take place.  I am not insisting that we take my motion today but I would ask the Leader of the House for some assurance as to when it will be taken.  I interrupt, in a sense, Senator Robinson's request because my request is not going to take very much time.  I suspect that the debate on whether or not her Bill is to be taken will probably take up a good deal of time and occupy a great deal of order and controversy in the House.  I beg the indulgence of Senator Robinson and do not want to detract from the importance of what she said but the importance and urgency of the Wood Quay issue is palpable and obvious.  There are many issues involved in it but I do not want to dispute the Order of Business today but I would like an assurance from the Leader of the House that it will be taken next week or the week after because the urgency surrounding the Viking site at Wood Quay makes it a matter of extreme priority.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be distracted. I just want to address the Chair. The fact is that there is now a minority of people demanding a service of this nature and we have had an opportunity of giving it to them.  There was a remark that Deputy Brendan Corish would have brought it in.  Deputy Corish made an offer to this House for an all-party grouping to get together to examine all the ramifications of it and nobody took that up.  Fianna Fáil certainly did not take it up.  That remark cannot be allowed to go unanswered.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Robinson's motion.  If there is any further delay in proceeding to the Second Stage of this Bill it will be a further gross neglect of duty by the politicians to the young women of Ireland.  It is a Government's duty to govern.  Why are they afraid even to talk about it, which is all we are asking?  I suggest that we support Senator Robinson and I hope that the lady Senators on the other side of the House will listen carefully to what is said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Crowley wants to immortalise himself it will not be through heckling in this chamber.  On the proposed Order of Business, I would like to draw attention to the general unsatisfactory state of progress in this House.  On the inaugural day of the present session high hopes were expressed here that this House would fulfil its considerable potential. On the last day before the summer recess some of us expressed the hope that the recess would not be excessively long so that we could come to grips with the backlog in the Order Paper. Throughout, Government spokesmen made the pretence of joining in our general aspirations, a pretence that now must be clearly seen as hypocritical.  The fact is we did not reconvene after a long summer recess until 1 November.  We met only on two days since.  There are <Col N="227" /> 15 or 16 private motions on the Order Paper.  There is obviously no serious attempt on the part of the Government side to tackle them.  It now must be crystal clear that the Government want to minimise and downgrade the role of the Seanad despite the previous pious protestations of Government spokesmen.</P>
      <P>It is disturbing to find that on the rare occasions when Private Members' Business is taken, as on the Labour motion recently on the question of the disabled, expressions of obsequious gratitude are conveyed by the proposers to the Leader of the House.  I want to remind Members that this House is not the property of the Leader of the House.  It belongs to all of us.  I would urge Labour and Fine Gael Members to be more assertive and to have a bit more backbone about the rights of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Martin has said about the urgency of Motion No. 20, concerning Wood Quay. As far as one can ascertain, the time left before the bulldozers move into Wood Quay is short.  This motion has been on the Order Paper for some time.  There have been some negotiations about it.  I know there is an order of precedence for motions but this motion, as a result of the negotiations, is next on the list of Private Members' motions.  There is no point in leaving it until after destruction of the site in Wood Quay has commenced. I would like the Leader of the House to ensure that the motion is taken at the next available opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of the Order of Business is something that concerns every political party represented in this House and, indeed, every individual Member of the House.  The Order of Business should not be turned into a political issue.  The Leader of the House, when suggesting the Order of Business should be required to give reasons why he feels that some matters are more important in his opinion, and in the opinion of the Government, than others.  We all have our priorities.  As far as I am concerned, the most important matter on <Col N="228" /> the Order Paper is Motion No. 15, which deals with youth unemployment.  I am not going to refer to that matter; that would not be in order.  It should be possible for the Leader of the House to contact the Leaders of the other parties in advance of a meeting of the Seanad and arrange the Order of Business in accord with some priority or other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Kennedy's plea for some rationality in the approach to ordering the business of the House.  The Senator rightly pointed out that there are very important motions on the Order Paper that have been lying there for some time.  We are faced today with debates on two motions arising out of the reports of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EEC.  One relates to Community action in the cultural sector in the EEC and the other relates to the teaching of languages in the Community.  Undoubtedly they are important subjects but they fade into insignificance beside Motions 14 and 20 on Wood Quay.  Wood Quay has a specific urgency about it.  I support Senator Kennedy's point of view that there should be some discussion between all parties to try to get an Order Paper that in some way reflects the seriousness of the matters on it and justifies the existence of this Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to indicate our support for including Item No. 6 in the Order of Business today.  It was agreed by the House unanimously that Item No. 6 would be taken on 22 November and it is wrong that such an agreement should have been entered into, as it now appears likely, just to get over the difficulties of that day.  On that day a certain counting was done and it was seen that there was no alternative but to agree to it and let it go through on that day. The attitude expressed today in refusing it, so far as we can see&mdash;we have to wait to see what everybody has to say about it&mdash;seems as if it was included without any real intention of doing anything more about it.  For the sake of the reputation of the House and of our precedures, when something is agreed to be printed, unless that means literally nothing, there should be a further agreement to having a Second Stage debate. <Col N="229" /> We are in favour of the principle of having a Second Stage debate irrespective of the merits of that debate, and irrespective of the contents of the Bill.  It is a matter for Members in the course of that debate, and on the vote on that Stage, to express their views on the merits and contents of the Bill.  We should reach that Stage and have the debate.  Consequently we will be supporting the proposed amendment to include Item No. 6 in the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Murphy has to say concerning the lack of use that is being made of the House.  The short answer is that this House is primarily part of the legislative process and there is no legislation coming up. Private motions have their own intrinsic value but, essentially this is a legislative Chamber.  The unfortunate fact is that the Government have fallen down badly in bringing forward legislation.  That is the real reason why we do not have business to occupy us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business I support Senator Martin's plea that we should without undue delay discuss the motion on Wood Quay.  I see little point, if our debates in this House are to be regarded by the general public as relevant, in waiting until the subject matter of motions has become the subject of irrevocable Government decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the motion on Wood Quay, I hope it will be possible to take that on this day fortnight. With regard to the Family Planning Bill, I want to make it quite clear that there was no agreement or undertaking given to take that Bill today.  The proposer of that Bill was asked when she wanted it put on the Order Paper and she said today.  That merely means it is on the Order Paper.  It is a matter for this House to decide every day it sits which items on the Order Paper will be taken.  There can be no agreement in advance that anything in particular will be taken.  I gave no agreement or undertaking that the Bill would be taken today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> As regards the question of whether it should be taken today, the position is, as I am sure most people in the House are aware, that the Government are about to introduce a Bill on family planning to be introduced within the next few weeks.  It would be absurd to have one Bill dealing with family planning being debated in this House at the same time as another Bill on the same subject was being debated in the Dáil.  For the reason that it would be obviously absurd to have two different Bills on the same subject being debated at the same time, I am not prepared to agree to order this Bill today.</P>

    <Title>Exchange Control (Continuance and Amendment) Bill, 1978: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Wyse) Pearse Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>The two purposes of the Bill are, first, to continue in force the present exchange control legislation beyond its expiry date at the end of this year for a further period of four years, and secondly, to amend that legislation to enable the Minister for Finance, by regulation, to apply exchange controls to transactions between this country and the United Kingdom should the need arise.</P>
      <P>A little of the historical background to exchange control would be useful before proceeding to discuss the individual sections in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Before control originated at the beginning of the Second World War, when, in common with other sterling area countries, it was found necessary to introduce controls on current and capital transactions with countries outside the sterling area to protect scarce foreign currency reserves.  These controls were initially operated under emergency legislation. This was replaced by the present legislation in 1954.  It was hoped at that time that the necessity for controls would fade away in due course, and the legislation was accordingly framed to expire within four years.  The choice of the initial duration of the Bill was arbitrary, but has been followed ever since.  The situation now is not essentially different from that in 1954 as it seems likely some form of exchange control will be necessary for some time to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exchange controls as operated at present do not, in general, affect transactions between this country and the scheduled territories, that is, essentially, Northern Ireland and Britain, and indeed cannot do so under the legislation <Col N="233" /> as it stands.  Current transactions, such as trade and travel payments are also free of control, except in so far as these are monitored to ensure that capital controls are not being evaded.  It is in this latter area, that is capital movements, that the main effects of exchange control are felt, apart from the liberalised approach to direct investment in and personal capital movements to, other EEC countries.  The main controls relate to purely financial transfers, such as deposits, loans and portfolio investment. There are also some restrictions on direct investment in and personal capital movements to, countries outside the EEC.  It should be emphasised, however, that the controls are operated in such a way as to minimise the impact on normal commercial activity.</P>
    <P>I mentioned a minute ago the need to protect the external reserves.  While in the past this has been the major objective of exchange control policy, in recent years, in the situation of extreme currency instability, the need to be able to protect a currency from massive speculative flows has become equally prominent.  Exchange controls are, then, at present, required to meet these two basic objectives, and as I indicated earlier, will inevitably continue to be needed for some years.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill, therefore, provides for the continuation of the Exchange Control Act, 1954&mdash;the Principal Act&mdash;in operation for a further four years.  The amendments proposed in the remaining sections of the Bill would enable the Minister for Finance to extend exchange controls to transactions between this country and the United Kingdom by regulation should this need emerge at any point.  Under the Exchange Control Act, 1954, the &ldquo;scheduled territories&rdquo;, the area within which exchange controls are not applied, are defined to include the State, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and such other countries as may be prescribed by the Minister by regulations. The Minister cannot, therefore, at present use the powers contained in the Act in relation to transactions with the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill, however, enables <Col N="234" /> the Minister, by regulations, to exclude Northern Ireland and Britain from the scheduled territories.  I should like to stress, however, that this is merely a contingency provision, which would only be used should the particular circumstances which might warrant it ever arise.  I might add, also, that were the Minister to avail of the provision, he would still have discretion to include these countries in the scheduled territories again at some future date.</P>
    <P>Section 4 would allow the Minister for Finance to prohibit the importation, except with his permission, of such Irish or foreign currency notes as might be prescribed by him by regulation.  This amends the existing limited prohibition in section 15 (2) of the Principal Act on the importation of United Kingdom currency notes from countries other than Northern Ireland, Great Britain, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, from which, in fact, exemption has been given by regulations.  The new section would confer on the Minister power to prohibit the importation of Irish currency notes which had been illegally exported; it would also allow him to control inflows of foreign currency notes generally.  The amendment would only come into effect on the making of regulations, and these regulations would provide for the exemption of all normal inflows.</P>
    <P>Section 5 amends section 16 (2) of the Principal Act which, as it stands, only allows the Minister to prohibit the export of currency notes and other financial instruments to areas other than the United Kingdom.  The amended section would allow the Minister to control the export of currency notes, postal orders and assurance policies to any country.  Again, it should be stressed that this provision would only come into effect on the making of a commencement order by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is a consequential technical amendment to sections 18 and 19 of the Principal Act to ensure that any import prohibitions introduced under the proposed amendment to section 15 (2) of the Principal Act would be subject to the Customs Acts in the same way as existing import and export prohibitions.</P>
    <P>To summarise&mdash;there is no prospect <Col N="235" /> that in the foreseeable future we shall be able to dispense with exchange controls. I am asking the House, therefore, to agree to the extension of the basic exchange control legislation for a further period of four years.  In addition, I am asking the House to agree to amend the existing legislation to enable exchange controls to be applied to transactions between this country and the United Kingdom should the need arise.  This power does not, in general, exist at present. In the uncertain situation before us it would not be prudent to continue with the existing limitations on our exchange control powers.  It is obviously not possible to set out in advance what detailed exchange controls might eventually need to be implemented under this Bill.  This will depend on what conditions emerge in the future.  It is, however, clear that we must be in a position to deal with whatever developments in this area do occur.</P>
    <P>I trust the Bill will be acceptable to the House on this basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking for my party, I can say that the requests of the Minister of State will be met and that the extension of the exchange control legislation proposed will be agreed as will be also the proposal to amend that existing legislation to enable these controls to be applied in transactions between this State and the United Kingdom.  Having said that, it is desirable to emphasise the grave nature of the proposed change in the legislation.  Of course, the powers given do not, for any reason, have to be exercised; the matter is different and the gravity disappears. But assuming that&mdash;and this is the only reason for agreeing to the request for powers&mdash;the powers being sought may in an actual situation apprehended as likely to arise be exercised then the gravity of that change for this State can hardly be over-stated; the gravity of the change for every citizen, and in particular for everyone who has the conduct of enterprises in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is reasonable to remind the House of the historical background to this.  The situation currency-wise that exists today <Col N="236" /> before we enact this legislation, which will exist until the new powers, the different powers proposed in this legislation, are exercised, is not something that arose merely yesterday.  It has existed for more than 150 years.  For that period, we have been in an exchange race and currency union with a dominant currency.  It will change our position dramatically if we, in effect, by the exercise of these powers move out of that union.</P>
    <P>The matter can be quantified to some extent by reference to two statistics.  One is the extent of the trade with the union that we would be leaving.  Taking the Central Bank Report of this autumn, Table 59, the figures given there for exports to the United Kingdom showed that our exports for that year were £1,182 million worth of a total EEC export figure of £1,916 million worth of goods.  I am only speaking about trade.  Therefore our exports to the United Kingdom, which includes Northern Ireland, represent 61.7 per cent&mdash;according to my computation, not that of the Central Bank, so that calculation could be wrong&mdash;of the total exports to the EEC.  The import figure is even greater.  Total imports from the EEC amounted to £2,100,000,000; the United Kingdom portion of that was £1,486,000,000, or 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is a curious, ironic reflection on the situation that proposals which it is known by Members of this House are under consideration and which it is not appropriate for us to debate&mdash;that is not the nature of our debate today&mdash;are coming to this Community for consideration under the general proposal that we are seeking to enlarge and make freer an existing market.  It is not proposed that we have a currency union with the other people who may join the European Monetary System but in general the objective is by removing to some extent the exchange risk which is an impediment to trade to make the trade freer.  It is an ironic comment on that, that that being put before this community for consideration, the increased freedom in that area&mdash;if this goes ahead&mdash;is going to lead possibly, but hopefully not, to an increased control in a very much larger area of our existing <Col N="237" /> trade because if the 30 to 40 per cent trade that we do with the other EEC countries gets to some degree freer the 67 per cent trade that we are doing with the United Kingdom may become subject to impediments.</P>
    <P>Control is not encouragement.  The inter-position of exchange control is a limitation of freedom.  I am not talking in abstract terms.  I am talking about a free exercise by every citizen, in which he may engage every day, of buying and selling, once he breaks over the border of trading and engages in transactions with people outside this.  In so far as controls exist there, to that extent his freedom is limited, his choices are limited and all sorts of elements enter in which were not there before, including the costs, because there has been no exchange risk&mdash;which is an interesting point&mdash;in trading between the UK and this State, which may be one of the elements making for the expansion of that trade, a withdrawal of which may be an element in the reduction of that trade.</P>
    <P>Apart from anything else, exchange control is an administrative cost.  Even if the cost is not directly or immediately transferred into the books of the customer by paying his £4 for his £100 worth of foreign money, or £500 worth of foreign money, or whatever it may be, there is somewhere in the system an additional cost involved in the production of paperwork, the consideration of applications, the decisions with regard to transactions which arise.  This is one quantity which indicates the gravity of the matter.  There is another quantity. We have approximately three million people in this State, approximately one-and-a-half million in Northern Ireland and about one million Irish people resident in Great Britain who were either born in Ireland or who are in many cases the young offspring of living parents resident in Great Britain and who were born here.  Therefore, we see the dimensions of the problem with which the Central Bank is going to have to endeavour to cope in having to, in some fashion, trap and monitor transactions involving proportions relative to this population of two-and-a-half to three million here and two-and-a-half million resident outside this State.  The <Col N="238" /> problems with which the Central Bank may be asked to cope when faced with the exercise of these controls will be very great.</P>
    <P>Apart from this trading relationship, apart from the very large sums that are deposited in Great Britain from this State, there has been the very considerable facility of capital flow between the two countries.  It would seem to me that the interest of the State so far as it can be achieved in this area must be to maximise the freedom, though one recognises the problems that may arise if the situation is that we leave what I describe as the union, the currency union.  All I can say about the Central Bank&mdash;the way I would like to put it&mdash;is that I am glad that it is this institution that has the burden to carry because of its past performance, its considerable experience, though its experience is not, I think, contestably deep enough in relation to the operation of this new problem.  I am glad that it is an institution that has always shown appreciation of the economic advantages of the freedom that we should seek to retain to the maximum extent, that has shown a great deal of flexibility in the administration of the powers it has had to administer, which has&mdash;let us face it&mdash;an international reputation and enjoys international trust.</P>
    <P>The policy which some might have fought and criticised of good behaviour in relation, for example, to the sterling area in the past may build up a bank of goodwill of great value to this country now as between the Bank of England and the Central Bank.  The Bank of England will know the genuineness and truthfulness of the Central Bank in its communications with it.  The Central Bank, after all, is rather like man, his pre-history and his history.  The Central Bank itself derives from the Currency Commission&mdash;I suppose, that is almost pre-history&mdash;but really it did not have any great powers until 1972.  Now, six years later, it receives this enormous new problem, this very considerable extension of power and is faced with a financially unique situation.  I may be wrong, but I do not know of any other situation internationally where the economic, historical bind is as close as that which <Col N="239" /> has existed in the past and, which continues&mdash;despite the reduction in the proportions of UK trade to the overall trading of the Irish economy&mdash;to be vastly significant.  There is a close relationship between Canada and America, a still closer relationship between Belgium and the Netherlands; that latter linking seems to operate on minimal controls.  While one apprehends the UK attitude not to impose controls, for a number of reasons, one of them being that they are aware of the disadvantages to their own overall policy in extending control to Ireland, if controls come into the field, though not desired by the Central Bank&mdash;conceiving the Irish interest in the matter&mdash;one can see where they may have to come in.  They may have to come in to prevent the disturbance to the international value of the punt caused by the continued existence, without control, of the movement of funds, the free movement of funds in and out, of the punt, in and out of portfolio investment in this economy.  Five hundred million pounds internationally may not be a great deal of money.  It would make an enormous impact on the Dublin situation, even stretching, perhaps, the rating of the punt one way or another to the full of the proposed 2½ per cent band and causing consequential operations by the Government, by the Central Bank in relation to its reserves. Maybe the Central Bank will be able to contrive some sort of monitoring of this in association with the UK authorities, but one conceives that it may not be able to do so.</P>
    <P>The difficulty the Central Bank is faced with, being at once flexible and realistic, is perhaps indicated by the one problem which existed even before this Bill came before this House, and that is that the development of a forward exchange market in the punt has been stopped, as I understand it.  Might I suggest to the Minister and the House that this step was not realistic and that the fact that the forward market on the punt was not allowed to be developed by the banks so that people who want sterling, for example to pay something in March next, cannot now buy sterling for delivery in March next, unrealistically <Col N="240" /> ignored the fact that the strong customers of the bank do not need the forward market.  It is the weaker customers who need the forward market. The strong customers who incur a liability in sterling to be discharged in March simply place the money on deposit in sterling now and do not need to buy forward sterling because they can have it forward by making the deposit now either out of their own funds or, because of their economic and financial strength, can borrow from their local institutions to make the deposits.  The absence of a forward market merely catches the person who is so circumstanced that he cannot make that money either available directly out of his liquid resources or by borrowing.</P>
    <P>I would take this not so much for itself, though it is of considerable importance, but as an instance of something of more general character of extreme importance in the operation of any controls if they are to be operated realistically. recognising realities that are not particularly agreeable, for example, to a preview of this.  I take it the objection in principle to this would be the presumption that if this market existed the one-for-one link would go.  Even if it never goes it is realistic to recognise that there are people in the market who, once this arises, will want to cover themselves against the exposure and it is good business for them to do so.  In regard to a forward market, it is inherently important that it be dealt with by the Central Bank and that in the general administration of exchange control, of this exchange control in particular, that actual solid realities as they emerge will be constantly and immediately and flexibly recognised and responded to.</P>
    <P>There has been a large amount of material in the newspapers about interest rates and, it seems to me in my innocence, a simplistic kind of idea that were it not for the wretched British we would be able to lend each other money at 2 per cent, 1 per cent, anything, but that these savage new impositions are really caused by the link with sterling and once we get rid of that everything will be splendid.  Everything will not necessarily move at all in the direction that is anticipated by those who so write.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> For example, at this moment Irish industries, companies and co-operatives, raise a considerable amount of money cheaply.  I hope the figure I am operating on here has some rational connection with reality.  There is about £150 million being used at the moment and at any moment in aid of Irish industry, which consists of more cheap type of finance from the point of view of the person who raises it than he would experience if he were to raise it at home, and he raises it essentially through acceptance credit facilities that are dominated in sterling and discounted in the London Discount Market.  It is likely that that may disappear.  Is it certain that it will?  I do not know, but it is possible that it will.</P>
    <P>Again it is estimated that there may be funds at use, as I shall in my loose fashion describe it, from the UK in the Republic of the order of £500 million. Apart from the effect on our banking system of providing the £150 million which at present comes out of the London Discount Market and which, if that as a source of finance went, would constitute a new pressure of £150 million locally, to some extent the £500 million at use in this country will be withdrawn, and as an offset to switching plus withdrawal there will be the impact on local funds of withdrawals from the UK deposits, and the overall effect, at least in a medium term or in a short term&mdash;in this area one does not know how short a short-term is or how medium a medium-term is: we are not talking about weeks, we are not talking about years&mdash;there is more likely to be a pressure on liquidity tending to raise interest rates as a consequence.  At least there is a very real danger of this.</P>
    <P>Another element in this picture is the effect the movement of international British funds, gambling or speculating on the future of sterling or the punt, might have on that scene, but I do not intend to make any guess what it would be.</P>
    <P>In relation to the possible impact on our local financial scene we have at the moment a system whereby the associated banks can get their Exchequer bills re-discounted and to that extent the Central Bank operates as a lender of last <Col N="242" /> resort to that part of our banking financial system.  It seems we will have to develop a system side by side with that if we are to avoid the tendency in the situation I have described for interest rates to rise excessively, to pump some liquidity into non-associated financial institutions.</P>
    <P>I will go back to the words I spoke with regard to the Central Bank, and that is its understanding of the whole scene.  I think that this area is particularly one in which we must avoid any patriotic songs.  We must close our ears to tunes which may be coming from the devil, as merry tunes generally do, and have cold regard only to what is financially and economically beneficial, and in doing so remind ourselves that we are not behaving like hard-faced men who think of nothing else, but that in behaving like that we are thinking of people's lives and their wellbeing and their wealth.</P>
    <P>In terms of capital flow as between the UK and Ireland, so far as one can make a judgment, one senses that if you disregard portfolio investment in which probably capital flows out&mdash;I have not looked at the balance of payments figures&mdash;I would not be surprised to find that there is some flow out of portfolio investment, and it is difficult to get the figures for real investment, direct investment. If you want to make a judgment, we are net beneficiaries of that, we are net beneficiaries of a free system, and it is enormously important that this whole thing be operated in such a way that we will remain-net beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>I have not referred to the EMS and I do not propose to except to say that we should be like the strong armed man going into battle, and I am not so sure we are.  Maybe the date for the battle was not fixed by us but the risks, the costs, are very real.  Mistakes in the formulation of economic policy would tend for the first time to get expressed in a way that it has never been the Irish experience that they should be expressed. With all the jumbles of millions of decimal points that are being whizzed around in public, even the most constant of men tend to lose their balance, and what is happening or likely to happen to the balance of payments or whether we can afford what is happening to it moves <Col N="243" /> into the realm of templar wisdom.  But people will understand very well indeed if their punt becomes worth only 95 sterling pennies.  They will be very pleased indeed, may I add, in case anybody writes only that sentence down, to find out that their punt is worth 105 sterling pennies.  The point I am endeavouring to make in my infinitely laboured way is that we are very like a subsidiary company about to be hived off from the parent when our balance sheet will be looked at the first time by a lot of people who will be quite content to take us as part of the group.  I use balance sheet here in the non-technical sense of our overall economic performance which will take in not merely growth rate but whether we can afford the growth rate.  Reserves&mdash;where do they come from?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I had thought I would be allowed in a discussion on an exchange control Bill to discuss exchange control.  I did not think that I had ceased to do that, and if I have in any way I would be grateful to the Chair for intervening to prevent me wandering in the direction I certainly do not want to wander.  Indeed, as I reflect on what the Chair said I see that it is possible that if I pursued the language I was on I might indeed depart from the rules or breach the rules of good order, and that would not be my wish.  I merely say that if the situation arises when the powers which we are being asked to give to the Central Bank become necessary, we would be in the position of a hived off subsidiary and our controls would then be exercisable in these new conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chair will not take offence if I say that I am less concerned about the rules of good order than I am about lots of other matters, and I do not want to say anything which would be in any way damaging to this economy.  I think the <Col N="244" /> House will accept that from me.  I cannot think it is damaging to this State if I say that if exchange control comes to be operated under the powers that are supposed to be given it would be good for this country to have good economic policy and bad for this country if it has not, and we will be more clearly perceived by the world to be good or bad in that situation than we have been perceived by the world in the past and in the situation in which we may be moving out of.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my good wishes to the Central Bank as it is faced with this very heavy additional burden, and to emphasise the very high desirability of extending in as complete a fashion as possible its awareness of all aspects of our economic situation as it has not been so necessary for it to be aware in the past, with a view so far as is possible to maintaining the flow of direct investment here and minimising the exchange risks or any risks of trading.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Senator FitzGerald I got the feeling that most of his remarks were directed towards a situation where the additional power here would be exercised, and of course I agree with him that that sort of situation must be approached with caution. However, what we are dealing with is a Bill to enable the normal control over the transfer of currency to all areas other than the United Kingdom to be continued for another four years.</P>
      <P>The discussion is being made a lot more interesting.  There would have been a token approach to the Bill were it not for the fact that there is an amendment attached to it, to include, if necessary, if directed by the Minister, the area of the United Kingdom.  First of all, I do not see much prospect of an end to the ordinary exchange control exercise in which we have been engaged since the last war, but it is a good thing that the measure should be renewed every four years or so so that there can be discussion on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why we should have this sort of control is to protect ourselves against outflow of capital and against the fluctuations of currency around the <Col N="245" /> world.  However, the additional power sought by the Minister to apply the control of currency to the area of our nearest neighbour is a different aspect, and it is new.  It is the sort of power that the Minister should have had at all times, that is, to direct the Central Bank, because in practice we have had a situation between us and our neighbour where all notable changes in bank rates have had to be followed automatically by the Irish banking system so as to protect ourselves against an outflow of money following the introduction of higher interest rates in the other area.</P>
    <P>At all times we have to try to meet the consequences of that sort of situation.  It has always been a problem, and probably will continue to be a problem for so long as our monetary situation remains as it is.  Nevertheless, one must be concerned at all times for the effects, for example, on unemployment of changing rates in the different currencies, particularly in sterling.  One must also be conscious of the cost to us of the extraordinary fall in value of sterling over the past five years.  The cost to us of the eventual clearing of overseas loans is absolutely astronomical.  The amending power here should be in the hands of the Minister in case the need to exercise it should arise.</P>
    <P>I found one matter of interest mentioned by Senator FitzGerald in relation to the present trading situation.  If the figures he has given us are correct&mdash;he said our trade with the UK is 61 per cent of that with the EEC&mdash;the change in our own trading situation has been somewhat dramatic, because the position six years ago would have been that our outside trading would be more than 70 per cent with the United Kingdom as against the rest of the world.  It would appear that there has been such an increase in our own trading situation with the Community that it is now to us a major trading area.</P>

      <P>I have not got this year's figures but I know that on the figures up to the end of 1977 our position has changed so that our exports to the world outside are now somewhat in excess of our exports to the United Kingdom, which is a significant change. It is an improving situation so far as our own trading prospects are concerned.</P>
      <P>I do not think that there is much point in speculating on the situation, which was touched on briefly by Senator FitzGerald, where a monetary system is proposed in the interests of greater monetary stability in the European Community.  We do not know at present whether the United Kingdom, with which we are associated, will be involved in that.  We do not know whether we will. In any case, the position is that the Minister should have the power to direct the Central Bank to control the flow of money to all areas, including, if necessary, the United Kingdom if the need should arise.  That is the prudent thing to do.  I welcome the precaution the Minister is taking, and support the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill and the sentiments of the two previous Senators. I do not see why we could not have brought in legislation some years ago providing for the possibility of applying exchange controls to Britain.  The possibility of changing our fixed parity with sterling has been aired now and then for a number of years and it must have become more than just a possibility when some time ago sterling dropped against the major world currencies. Happily for us, since we did not make the break at the time, which might in the long run have benefited us&mdash;making it some time ago, if the timing had been right&mdash;sterling has risen again against the major currencies and the position is not nearly as bad as it was, say, 18 months to two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand because of the fall in the value of sterling there have been major problems in the repayment of loans borrowed in foreign currency, and virtually every statement of account or balance sheet one gets from a semi-State body records these losses which the semi-State body have had to bear on <Col N="247" /> the repayment of foreign loans.  It is one of these stark facts that if one sticks with sterling then one has to take the knocks as well as receiving the benefits of remaining in the sterling area.</P>
    <P>I imagine that nobody in the House would disagree with the main part of this Bill, the maintenance of exchange controls in the areas where they have already existed.  The substantive change is that now we are talking about extending the provisions to the sterling area, and even though there are some advantages, the disadvantages of a break in the link and application of the controls are fairly clear.  It is interesting to me that on a number of occasions previously when I have spoken somewhat in favour, on balance, of changing our situation <i>vis-a-vis</i> sterling I have received correspondence from business people of my acquaintance and some not of my acquaintance throwing up their hands in horror and claiming that their businesses would all go to the wall.  It is interesting that at this time when the possibility has reared its head again there does not seem to be quite the same trepidation.  I think this is important. The very fact that this Bill refers to the possibility of application of controls to the United Kingdom in our financial dealings means that there is perhaps not so much extra confidence than there was but that there is less of a lack of confidence in our situation than there has been on other occasions.  Certainly confidence is of tremendous importance in this international monetary scheme. Again it has been encouraging to read the reports by foreign correspondents of generally benevolent nature when our problems <i>vis-a-vis</i> sterling have been rearing their heads again in the last couple of months.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill.  The decision whether to apply these particular controls to sterling obviously is a difficult one to take and it is one that in a sense would most easily be taken when external pressures forced it to be taken.  It is a nice way for anybody to get off the hook, and perhaps from our point of view as a small country this is the situation in which such a decision should and would be made.  My feeling about a decision <Col N="248" /> like that is that it is not entirely an economic decision.  It is not purely financial; clearly finance is going to play an overbearing part, but it is very much a political decision also.  The advantages and disadvantages are not nearly as clear as, for example, were the advantages of joining the European Community in the first place when the benefits, particularly to our agricultural system, were absolutely clear.  But, I think on that occasion we were being prepared to make the decision that we made whatever Britain's reaction was. The same may occur again.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and I feel that in the long term a change is inevitable whether it comes in the short term or not, and I think that we should have this legislation on the books because the moment of application could occur very suddenly.  So, I believe people will not disagree in this House about the extension of the possibility of applying exchange controls to the sterling area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the House will approve of the two purposes in the Bill, first, to extend the period of the exchange controls and secondly to improve the legislation as the Bill is here for an amendment.  Most people realise that the world is in a difficult monetary situation in so far as the exchange or the transfer of large sums of money can have serious consequences for any country.  Certainly, it is very wise for our Government to be in a position to act quickly should any major transfers of money take place.  We realise that if this country breaks with sterling there may be attractions for people to invest money in this country.  At a first glance that might appear to be a good thing, but we also realise that anybody who comes in such circumstances to invest money here only comes to take his pound of flesh and go.  The consequences would have to be met and could be serious for the country.  We realise that this is an important Bill, and even those who are not financial wizards and experts realise it is most important to have very strict control especially for a small country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather amused now to find that the people who are saying that we should be very cautious in regard to our <Col N="249" /> break with sterling are the very same people who over the years were calling for a break with sterling and the many advantages of such a break were pointed out.</P>
    <P>There is very little to be said on this Bill other than that I am one of the Members of this House who are absolutely convinced that the Minister must have power to act in the circumstances in which he could find himself. With other Members, I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to my colleague for his contribution to this debate.  Like Senator FitzGerald I regard this as a very important Bill because of its background implications.  One of the disadvantages of the procedure before this House is that it may be difficult for us to emphasise the importance and the implications of this Bill because, as the Minister has said, it is an enabling Bill; it enables us to change a pattern of economic activity with Britain which has lasted for a very long time.  Despite the fact that it is an enabling Bill I do not believe that we should try to discuss it or assess its implications in a vacuum.  We are not operating in a vacuum, and the Minister in his opening speech made that clear.  He made it clear that the Bill would enable the Minister for Finance to apply exchange controls to transactions between this country and the United Kingdom should the need arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in his conclusion he said that he is asking the House to agree to amend existing legislation to enable exchange controls to be applied to transactions between this country and the United Kingdom should the need arise.  He goes on with the final paragraph which I would describe as civil service gobbledegook: &ldquo;This power does not exist in general at present.  In the uncertain situation before us it would not be prudent to continue with the existing limitations on our exchange control powers.  It is obviously not possible to set out in advance <Col N="250" /> what detailed exchange controls might eventually need to be implemented under this Bill.  This would depend on what conditions emerge in the future.  It is, however, clear that we must be in a position to deal with whatever developments in this area do occur&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are some experts advising the Minister who could go on in that vein for a considerable length of time.  But if we take away the curtain of gobbledegook and get down to the intent and purpose of this Bill, then clearly it is a step in preparation for the eventuality that we would join the proposed European Monetary System and that Britain would not do so or would delay its entry whilst it negotiated better terms.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, if the trains run on time, to use the phrase coined by Dr. O'Donoghue, the Minister for Economic planning and Development, the decision about the proposed European Monetary System would be taken in less than a fortnight.  So, in less than a fortnight we may be in a position to know whether the Government are going to have to avail of the facility which would be provided by the amendment proposed in this Bill.  That is very important, because it comes back to the relevance of this House, the relevance of the Senate, to what is going on.</P>
    <P>When we were debating developments in the European Communities, the 11th and 12th Reports Senator Whitaker specifically asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was in the House at the time, if there would be an opportunity provided in this House to debate the European Monetary System, and it was presumed that this would be on the basis of a Government White Paper on the European Monetary System.  I have not looked at the precise reference in the Seanad but I certainly heard the Minister say that there would be an opportunity. I would like to ask the Minister for State whether that opportunity will be given some time in the next fortnight to debate the question of the European Monetary System and Ireland's possible membership of it, and whether the Government will produce a White Paper on which we can properly and seriously and, discharging our responsibility as legislators and as <Col N="251" /> representatives of the people, apply ourselves to that debate.  I immensely distrust technical Bills which are introduced in an enabling manner so that very fundamental and important political decisions can be taken but the Houses of the Oireachtas would be deprived of an opportunity to discuss the very important political steps which might be taken.</P>
    <P>Clearly, then, this Bill prepares for an eventuality, or possibly for several different variations of an eventuality.  There are certainly three clear options facing us in the imminent proposals to establish a European Monetary System.  The first is that Britain and Ireland would both join, in which case the power which we have been given in this Bill would not necessarily have to be exercised immediately but could be there in case it was decided to use it at a later stage, and the situation would be more likely to continue more or less as it is at the moment. In the second eventuality Britain and Ireland, and possibly Italy, might decide not to enter this European Monetary System, and again this would hardly change very substantially the existing relationship between ourselves and Britain.  But it is the third eventuality, if Ireland does join and makes a decision in principle on the 4 and 5 December and there is a scheme introduced in the early months of next year, and if the United Kingdom either refuses to join or postpones its decision, as is looking more and more likely, to negotiate better terms at a later stage following a British election, then it appears that the Minister may very well be making the regulation and the commencement orders which we would be empowering him to make under this Bill before the House today.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is not in the best interests of democracy, not at all reconcilable with the idea of open and democratic government, that we would discuss giving the Minister these powers without knowing to any responsible degree precisely what the implications of the powers would be.  I am disappointed that the Minister in his opening speech chose to give us a very brief and technical introduction surrounded by some civil service gobbledegook about <Col N="252" /> preparing for a possible eventuality should that eventuality ever arise.  I do not think that this is adequate for Members of this House in a situation where Ireland is poised to take a step, which, if it is a step on our own, to join a European Monetary System in which Britain and possibly Italy would not be participating, then it could have far-reaching implications for employment, which is the major concern of the Labour Party, and for the economic stability in this country.  I do not think that anybody in the Labour Party or in the other political parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On this subject we may only debate the link with sterling and the EMS in so far as it is relevant to the question of exchange control.

      <P>I am aware that there has been a desire by the Chair to control very narrowly the scope of this debate.  I obviously do not question the authority of the Chair but I find the attitude difficult to reconcile.  For example, in the debate on the Reports on the Developments in the European Communities which we had recently in the Seanad, the two reports that we debated, the 11th and 12th Reports, ended with the Bremen meeting&mdash;I do not think they took in the Bremen meeting and if they did, they barely did&mdash;but we discussed the implications of development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I think the Chair must appreciate that this Bill is enabling the Government to have the power to take steps which are envisaged in a very concrete context.  We are not speaking in a vacuum; we are not debating the Bill in an abstract way.  We are looking to the very important political decision which may very well face this Government initially for decision in a fortnight and then for further powers to be exercised in the early part of next year.  I would have thought that before this House was asked to agree to this Bill a great deal more information should have been provided to Senators.  I would have thought that first of all a White Paper should have been published by now by the Government setting out the implications.  I appreciate that all of the financial arrangements may not have been fully discussed and decided upon, but surely the basic implications of the possible variations in the exchange rates between this country and Britain if this country joins and Britain does not have been considered.  It is not very difficult to see the possibility of a White Paper assessing the implications for employment and for the monetary situation here if the Government were to exercise the power that we are proposing to allow them to exercise by allowing this Bill to be passed.</P>
      <P>If the Minister would assure me at this stage that we will be given an opportunity in this House for a debate on the European Monetary System, I would be much more prepared to make my comments on this Bill a little less lengthy because there would be a further opportunity which would not embarrass my relations with the Chair to discuss the EMS.  Will there be an opportunity and will the Government publish a White Paper?  Is the Minister in a position to tell us?</P>

      <P>As I say, this Bill will enable the Government to exercise a very significant power in relation to our economic future.  I have no objection to the Minister having the latent power to break the link with sterling, to break the exchange rate.  In fact, there was a time not very long ago when all the indicators were that this could have been a very favourable course.  With the limited information available to me at the moment and my personal lack of competence and economic training to assess it, it does not seem as though all the conditions would be as favourable at this point in time to break the link with sterling in the process of joining the European Monetary System as of now in a situation where Britain did not join but waited, perhaps for six months or a year, and then negotiated more favourable terms for joining.  That is only a very qualified hesitation, because we just do not know what the situation is.  I find it intolerable that we do not know; I find it difficult to debate this Bill without getting extremely angry at the lack of accountability by the Government to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I appreciate the sensitivity of some of the areas; I appreciate the need to negotiate on a bilateral basis with heads of governments, with Finance Ministers of other countries.  But there has been a singular lack of real endeavour by the Government to inform both Houses of the Oireachtas of what is happening in relation to the most important step this country can take since we joined the European Community.  What is worrying is that some of the effects of the Government policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that I must relate my remarks to the subject of the Bill.  I do so by seeing this Bill as enabling the Government, as a step towards Ireland joining the European Monetary System, to break the link with sterling. Because through this Bill we are giving the Government the power to do that, it is open at least to question the Minister on the implications of giving the Government the power to take that step.  That seems to be a logical context in which to consider this Bill.</P>
      <P>I have no desire to try to enter into a very technical debate on the role of the Central Bank.  I want to assess, as a politician and as a member of the Labour Party, what kind of power the Minister is being given in this Bill and why he is being given it at this particular time.  The only context in which I can do this is to say that the Minister for Finance and the Government are being given the power to break the link with sterling at this time because they envisage what looks now to be the likelihood of doing so when Ireland joins the European Monetary System.  We can only really assess that situation if we have a White Paper which gives us the Government's assessment of the implications for employment, inflation and the kind of resource transfers that we would need in order to combat any adverse consequences of that break with sterling. I find it hard to believe that I am intolerably out of order in asking the Minister these questions when the Minister is seeking power from this House to break the link with sterling in the context of the current negotiations about the European Monetary System.</P>
      <P>There is a concept in law whereby the court can take judicial notice of something that is so obvious and so well known that by common sense the judge knows of it.  Surely in the context of a debate like this we can take Parliamentary notice of the forthcoming decision on the European Monetary System.  We cannot, in a blinkered and abstract way. debate a Bill of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I had had an assurance from the Minister that we would get an opportunity in the Seanad to debate the European Monetary System before the vital decisions are taken, then I would certainly <Col N="256" /> accept the ruling of the Chair and say that there would be a more appropriate place to debate this very important subject.  But the answer is that the Minister has very clearly stated, but not in an entirely unambiguous way, that there will not be an opportunity in this House to debate the implications of the EMS before the decisions are taken in Brussels.  I resent the fact that decisions are going to be taken in Brussels which would have such far reaching implications for employment, the prospects for our economy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I register my protest as a Senator that we are not going to be given an opportunity in this House of debating the implications of the EMS before the decision is taken.</P>

      <P>Surely my colleagues in the Opposition benches must realise that all this Bill is doing is giving the Minister power that he should have.  This power was not required in the past because of the traditional relationship between sterling and the Irish £ and because of the way transactions are carried on.  I cannot understand what is bothering them.  We are not saying, and I am sure the Minister is not saying, that this Bill is breaking the link with sterling. It is not.  It is giving him power to regulate the movement of capital particularly. Every small country in the <Col N="257" /> EEC has the same powers.  The bigger countries probably do not need it because they usually have enough capital.  That is what the Bill is about. We could stop and leave it there, but the Opposition Senators have not left it there.  They have opened up a number of issues on which the Chair has had to rule.  It will be pretty difficult for us at this side of the House to ignore some of those issues because they are going to receive attention.  I am not going to go into an EMS Second Stage speech but I think I am entitled to deal with what has been said.

We want to keep the same currency.  We are talking about union in Europe, not about breaking things up.  It is the UK that is making life difficult for us, not Ireland.

      <P>The Opposition should have taken it when it was given to them. On the question of the interest rate which was mentioned and the effect it would have on exchange, the UK will change its interest rate to suit itself.  It is changing it now in order to regulate the economy because it cannot produce a good deal with its trade unions.  It changed its interest rate and we have got to follow suit because we are in a position where there is a free flow of funds.  It seems obvious to me that the power we are asking for in this Bill is the sort of thing that, given the developments in the future, we will have to use in a situation such as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The notion that introducing a regulation of this kind is going to affect the sources of funds is a point that was made.  Far from affecting sources of funds, it might make it much easier for us to have a much wider set of sources of funds such as German, French or Arab sources and much cheaper money than one can get from the UK.  If we were linked to a European Monetary System in that situation we would not have the problem of risk because our currency would be harder as it would be moving in line with the other currency. This country has a tie through sterling to the Bank of England and to other banks. We all know what happened when we had the bank strike.  If we did not have the foreign banks we would have been in real trouble.  As we opened up our trading movements and as more banks took an interest in Ireland our businessmen became better at their jobs and took more opportunities to develop our economy so that eventually they might <Col N="259" /> provide the employment that we need. We are talking about a Bill that is giving the Minister the power he needs to do his job particularly in the situation in which we find ourselves.  I find it very difficult to avoid widening it into the broader issue and I shall leave it at that.</P>

      <P>I wish to reply to a remark by Senator Mulcahy to Senator Markey that we had an opportunity to discuss this matter on the appropriate motion in June.  No decision was made by the Government at that time.  What would have been the advantage of a discussion when the Government had not made a decision at that time?  I am not taking issue with the Minister, but I think he answered a bit too quickly when Senator Robinson asked him if there would be a debate before the decision was finally taken or whether we would have to wait until after the decision has been taken.</P>

      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair but I cannot see the relevance of that reply to Senator Robinson because I think it is very important to the nation. If an employer told me that he was going to change my whole way of life, that he was going to make a decision that would affect me, and if he then said in a public forum that I would have no right of consultation before that decision was taken, I would not take that from him.  I would not let any of my trade union members accept a situation like that.  There must be consultation before a decision affecting the whole nation is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems is the way Bills <Col N="260" /> are drafted.  They are drafted in legal jargon.  That is all right for the solicitors and other legal authorities but somebody else has to read the Bill also.  Farmers, auctioneers, trade union officials have to read it.  I can only interpret a Bill as I read it and I do my best to be relevant to the subject matter of the Bill.  As I see it, nobody is arguing that the powers should not be given to the Minister, and I would welcome the Bill in this respect. I cannot understand what is wrong with debating to some extent the underlying reasons.  If we go beyond the bounds of what is the norm, I think it excusable in the circumstances because of the lack of information on the whole monetary situation.  It is not easy to publish a Bill in the way people would like because it must be written in a certain way.  To me this 1978 Exchange Control (Continuance and Amendment) Bill, is a means of facilitating a break with the link with sterling whenever the opportunity presents itself.  It is taking into account that we may actually enter the EMS and in order to offset difficulties the Minister must be given certain powers.  There is nobody arguing about that.  I welcome the Bill from that point of view.</P>
    <P>It could well be that the Bill itself was necessitated by the extended argument over the debate on the break with the link with sterling.  I am not talking about the merits of breaking that link but if we do not deal with the problem areas we will not know whether we were actually wise in bringing in this power so quickly rather than waiting a while.  I can see that I am going to be ruled out of order because I took the tone of the Bill to mean something else until I heard the debate and I am not going to carry on much longer.</P>
    <P>The position is that nobody is opposed to granting the powers to the Minister but if there are underlying reasons we are entitled to have some possibility of debating them.  I would like that to be considered.  I cannot see how I can go on any further without being brought to order.  Therefore, I think the best thing I can do is sit down.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this very necessary and prudent <Col N="261" /> matter.  Movements of exchange, whether we like it or not, have been a major feature of economic life particularly in the past ten or 15 years, such as successive changes in sterling, the current position of the dollar versus the yen and the European currencies, variations in the &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; and constant inflation in the Swiss franc.  We can think about the massive efforts made in eastern countries to control their exchanges and their desperate efforts to obtain a western currency which certainly make our exchange controls seem very mild indeed.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a matter of simple common prudence and indeed one might possibly query the Bill.  When the Exchange Control Act of 1954 was being enacted it was not thought fit and proper to take in the powers which the Minister is now quite rightly requesting.  One could just imagine the chorus of criticism that would arise in the present and future situation, whatever way it may turn out, if the Minister had not taken appropriate powers so that our foreign reserves were under control and we had the appropriate financial legislation. I think it high time that we had these powers.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing them in.</P>

      <P>I wish to put this Bill in context because there seems to be a lot of diversion from what we are doing here.  As Senator Mulcahy said, we had an opportunity before of discussing the EMS and there has been no decision taken anywhere in the meantime so we are still in the same position.  Exchange control originally came after the Second World War, and originally it was under emergency legislation.  This Bill was brought in in 1954 and every four years it has been renewed.  What we are doing is that for the sixth time we are renewing something which has been renewed five times already with a slight variation that there is an amendment in that by regulation if the Minister so wishes he can bring in those areas which were previously scheduled.  As everybody is aware there have been discussions about changes in our monetary situation and it appears sensible to give the Minister <Col N="262" /> power to regulate it.  That appears to be the total position of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister one question because I am not quite clear on one point.  In the explanatory memorandum which was issued with the Bill, in paragraph 2 in the scheduled area Gibraltar is included but later, and in the amendment in paragraph 5 of it, Gibraltar is omitted.  I would like to know what has happened to Gibralter.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Senators for their contributions.  Some of the speeches were worth while and I listened to them carefully.  I shall start first with Senator Robinson who was fully aware in reading the Bill that it was not dealing with the EMS.  It surprised me that she availed of the opportunity to deal with that matter.  Of course under this Bill I cannot discuss the implications of the EMS or any other questions that she wanted me to answer.  She highlighted the whole thing when she said &ldquo;an enabling Bill&rdquo; and that is all it is.  It is an enabling Bill giving the Minister options in preparing for any eventualities in the future.  I think any Minister for Finance in any part of the world would be entitled to this power. After highlighting the principle of the Bill, she availed of the opportunity to discuss the EMS.  I cannot comment on the whole EMS question.  I understand that there is a possibility of an EMS debate in the Seanad at some stage but I cannot go into details now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald certainly went into a very broad area and I would be here for the remainder of the evening if I had to answer all his points.  I can accept what the Senator has said about the gravity of the question of the possible deduction of exchange controls on transactions with the United Kingdom.  I can assure him that if any such exchange controls were ever to arrive, and I want to put emphasis on that, all these matters would be very carefully examined. Senator FitzGerald talked about the advantages but Senators Brugha, West and Mulcahy pointed out that there are also disadvantages in the present system and I agree with that.  That is why the whole question has arisen.  A Minister holding <Col N="263" /> such an important position as the Minister for Finance does is entitled to rectify anything that may be a disadvantage to this country.  Senator Mulcahy has also pointed out this Bill will not give the power itself to break the existing exchange rate relationship with sterling.  It is concerned solely with exchange control. I was amazed that some of the Senators took the opportunity of discussing such matters.  I am glad that the majority of Senators on both sides of the House welcomed the Bill.  I think it is of vital importance that the Minister for Finance would have the power in this respect.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that in a small capital-importing economy such as ours we are primarily concerned with limiting the outflow of capital funds for purely financial reasons.  We are not concerned with current transactions except to the extent that such transactions are supervised to prevent unauthorised capital transfers.  Senators on both sides of the House would agree on this very important matter.  An additional reason for having controls is to regulate speculative movements of funds either inwards or outwards.  Ireland has not to date experienced much difficulty in this respect but, at the same time, it is important that we prepare for all eventualities that may arise from now onwards.  This to my mind is the whole principle of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendments proposed in the Bill will allow us to maintain our existing legislative power and in addition will allow us to use these controls in respect of United Kingdom transactions should the need arise.  I think that the Minister must be put in that position.  However, the present administration of exchange control is not amended thereby.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators made tremendous contributions and we have noted them.  I want to assure everybody concerned that when we talk about exchange control every possible avenue is being explored, everything is being examined to the fullest extent by the Minister for Finance in the event of any changes that may arise where the monetary system is concerned.</P>

    <Title>Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Bill, 1978: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give legislative effect to a situation that has existed since 1974, when my predecessor in office decided to allow tenure of higher education grants at approved non-degree courses at such institutions as colleges of technology and regional technical colleges.  This decision was taken in anticipation of the necessary amending legislation and, although the intention behind it was laudible, it is a matter for some regret that the relevant amendment of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968, did not follow more expeditiously.  It now falls to me to fill this lacuna in the grants legislation.</P>
      <P>As Senators will know, the 1968 Act initiated a scheme of grants to enable eligible applicants of proven academic ability to pursue courses of university degree standard or degree equivalent standard at approved third level institutions. The academic attainment laid down for the purpose of a higher education grant is stated in terms of achievement at the leaving certificate examination. The relevant provision in the published grants schemes is that the candidate must have obtained grade C or higher grade in higher or common level papers in four or more subjects, or, alternatively, have obtained grade C or higher grade in higher or common level papers in Irish and in two other sub-or in mathematics and in two other subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the introduction of the 1968 Act there has occurred a progressive burgeoning in the educational sphere. particularly in the technical and technological area.  In the late sixties and early seventies the regional technical colleges were set up at strategic centres <Col N="265" /> throughout the country.  Some of these have since been extended and the extension of others is in train.  These colleges provide our young people with the opportunity of acquiring appropriate qualifications in the commercial, engineering and scientific fields.</P>
    <P>The National Council for Educational Awards was also set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in the early seventies to provide the machinery for the validation of courses and the means of qualification. The relevant legislation to establish this council statutorily has now been introduced in Dáil Éireann.  The scholarships provided by the vocational education committees were also expanded during the early seventies into a comprehensive scheme enabling recipients to proceed to certificate and diploma courses in the various disciplines and, indeed, to transfer to degree courses, if accepted.  The amount of student support provided and the means test provisions to be fulfilled are the same as in the case of the higher education grants scheme.  It may be that this scheme should be more widely publicised so that pupils in all second level schools who may be contemplating proceeding to regional technical colleges and the technological colleges may be fully aware of its existence and provisions. I propose to have this matter examined.</P>
    <P>It was a logical and commendable development that the higher education grants scheme should be extended to include the regional technical colleges and the technological colleges for the purpose of tenure of grant.  A wide choice of courses is thereby thrown open to grant-holders, the successful completion of which offer the student an enhanced prospect of employment in a developing economy.</P>
    <P>There is also the consideration that the colleges provide a more local access to further education and offer a decentralised infrastructure which can draw off numbers from the city concentrations and spread the student population somewhat more evenly throughout the country.  This is a desirable trend both socially and educationally.  The participation of <Col N="266" /> higher education grant-holders in the regional college courses will help to enhance the status of these colleges, will strengthen the input into existing courses and promote the development of variety in the options available for study.</P>
    <P>In the year 1977-78, a total of 5,848 students held higher education grants. This figure should have been higher and would have been if the appropriate revision as to amount of grant and means test conditions had been made during the period 1973-76.  Of this figure of grant-holders, 160 have exercised the 1974 option of holding their grants in non-university institutions.  I anticipate that this figure will increase over the years.</P>
    <P>I wish to recommend highly the VEC scholarships scheme which, in the year 1977-78, was providing assistance to a total of 1,658 students in the non-university area and which will continue to provide the main basis of student support in that area.  Comparisons between the number of grant-holders and the number of scholarship holders may be misleading as to the extent of their impact. In the first place, the numbers attending universities are much greater as of now than those in the RTC's and the colleges of technology.  Secondly, the duration of courses in the non-university third-level sector is, on average, shorter than in the case of the universities.  The scholarship scheme has yet to reach its full potential and will develop according as the RTC's continue to absorb an increasing number of our third-level students.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a non-controversial measure and was so regarded in the sympathetic and expeditious treatment which it received in the Dáil.  I said there that it would provide a bridge by which higher education grant-holders may proceed to courses having a technological emphasis, thus contributing to the supply of trained personnel for our expanding industrial sector.  I commend the terms of this Bill to Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I am very pleased that the extent of its application is to give scope in relation to institutions or institutes of education other than the statutory higher education <Col N="267" /> institutes as we now have them.  The difficulty that obtained here in relation to grants towards higher education by local authorities has been an issue that militated very much against a farmer's son or daughter who would be the child of somebody who had a very small income and had the income assessed on the basis of the valuation of a holding. This is something that has not been redressed before.  I would like the Minister to take into account, to whatever extent he can, an analysis of a more appropriate means of giving a fair and equitable proportion of scholarships, where it appears they were not given up to now, to the children of farmers.</P>
      <P>Before the advent of VAT, or income tax to the extent to which it now applies, a man had only to sign a form indicating that his income was £X and there was no means of contradicting that or saying that he should go back again and look at it and amend it in any measure or form. That had to be accepted by the local authority.  Scholarships were awarded to people with very considerable means.  I do not begrudge them but very often at local council meetings difficulties arise because very wealthy people are able to obtain a scholarship to the exclusion of a poor farmer's son whose means is assessed on the basis of valuation.  A farmer could owe several thousand pounds and be paying interest on it when his means are assessed.  He is entirely and arbitrarily excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of standards of higher education other than the equivalent of university education. Academics were looked on as belonging to a certain class and had the standard of education necessary to enable them to enter third-level education in university. That time has now gone.  Each particular profession or trade should issue a diploma and give a course of education to enable a young person to become proficient to the extent of being awarded a diploma.  Such a standard should be recognised and there should be a grant process.  The Minister has a very wide field to examine in this respect.  If we look at the availability of technicians who will come from technical colleges <Col N="268" /> or institutes of the kind referred to in the Bill, we will see that they are in very scarce supply.  The achievement of professional status out of university would mean that very many of these people, if they got qualifications, could find a ready opportunity to apply themselves and get profitable employment in filling many of the vacancies that are at present filled by foreign technicians.</P>
    <P>It is important, therefore, that when the Minister comes to give his <i>imprimatur</i> to the professions or services for which a diploma will be issued he should leave himself as free a hand as possible so that there would be a grant supported course towards that diploma whether it is in respect of fisheries, agriculture or building structures of every kind.  In the past the small farmer's son or the poor man's son was at a disadvantage because he had nothing to show for his standard of proficiency. People who had attained academic standards, such as a degree in engineering and so on, were looked up to.  Those who worked in the services sector were regarded as not having attained the same social status and as being of a lesser status.  If the Minister applies himself in the way I know he can, he will provide in this Bill the means of giving every man and every woman who is proficient in a trade or craft the opportunity of holding up their heads and saying &ldquo;I have my degree; I have qualified to a certain standard&rdquo;. They would be given appropriate respect and would not have to take the emigrant ship without a standard of proficiency if they did have to leave the country.  They would not have to train abroad or take the less lucrative and more menial jobs in another country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope that when it is applied to the spheres of activity that the Minister engages in, he will leave himself power to make it more effective as time goes on.</P>

Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo. D'fhéadfá a rá, b'fhéidir, gur saghas <Col N="269" /> Bille iar-chéime é toisc go gcuireann sé neart dlí agus cumhachta le rud a ghlacadh leis ceithre bhlian ó shin.  Mar sin féin is maith ann é an Bille céanna agus sílim go ndéanfaidh sé an-tairbhe don aos léinn ins an triú léibhéal.</P>
      <P>This Bill is to be highly commended. If we look at the main provision in it we can grasp what it is all about.  It legislates for the substitution of the following definition for the definition of an approved institution: &ldquo;Approved institution&rdquo; now means:</P>
      <P>a university, university college, or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course or courses of which the Minister approves for the time being for the purposes of section 2 of this Act.</P>
      <P>Times change and the functions of various types of schools at various levels must also change and take into consideration the society we are living in and the needs of that society.  Recently I was reading&mdash;I like to read it now and again because in this very troubled world it brings one back to one's senses&mdash;the discourses of John Henry Newman, later Cardinal Newman.  He said something that was so relevant to this Bill and the circumstances in which it comes into operation that I jotted down an extract from his Discourse No. 7 which was given about the year 1851-52.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now this is what some great men are very slow to allow.  They insist that education should be confined to some particular and narrow end and should issue on some definite work that can be weighed and measured. They argue as if everything, as well as every person, has its price and that where there had been a great outlay they have a right to expect a return in kind.  This is what they call making education and instruction useful, and indeed, utility becomes their watchword. With a fundamental principle of this nature they naturally go on to ask what there is to show for a university, what is the real worth in the market place of the article called a liberal education on the supposition that it <Col N="270" /> does not teach us definitely how to advance our manufactures or improve our lands or make better use of our civil economy.  Or again, it does not at once make this man a lawyer, that an engineer and that a surgeon.  Or at least if it does not lead to discoveries in chemistry, astronomy, geology, magnetism and science of every kind.</P>
    <P>There we have the old question: what should be the purpose of a third level institution as we call it nowadays?  Thank God we have the university which does, or at least should, basically pursue the arrival of our minds at the ultimate truth, and the ultimate excellence in every department of life.  On the other hand, we have a growing economy, as was stated in the Minister's address, and we require men to fill the vacancies that need to be filled in areas of engineering, mechanical skills and so on.  There one has perhaps a slight conflict between the two.  But, let us always remember that be the course long or short in a university or in a regional technical college, there is more to education at that level than the acquiring of skills or knowledge or the know how.  One of the things that has led to the troubles the world finds itself in, and which we can and do find ourselves in, is the lack of a sound philosophy behind all these things.  That is a very important point.  Perhaps the Minister would bear in mind having a course of philosophy in all the regional technical colleges so that, not alone will people know how to do a certain type of thing in their everyday occupation, but they will know the reason why.  Thus we would have a better idea of where we are going and how we should arrive at our destination.  Many do not seem to know at the present time in our history if we have any destination or, if we have, some are determined that we just will not get there.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for bringing in this Bill.  I know that many people will be delighted by it especially on account of it reducing the time limit required for the grant to two years.  There are in many families boys and girls who pursue courses and because there are other children coming along after them they find great difficulty in pursuing a course <Col N="271" /> for three years, which is the minimum required in any university.  The year there makes a very great difference.  The regional technical colleges have given great satisfaction.  From reports I hear not alone from our own Regional Technical College in Cork but elsewhere that they are doing splendid work.  I am sure that with an increase in the number of students coming into these colleges, better work will be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said in respect of scholarships that it may be that this scheme should have been more widely publicised so that pupils in all second-level schools who may be contemplating proceeding to regional technical colleges and to technical colleges may be fully aware of its existence and provisions.  I propose to have this matter examined.  I am glad to see that, and I am sure that when this will get further publicity, the result will be all to the good.</P>

      <P>When the Minister said that this is a non-controversial measure, what he really is saying is that he hopes it is a non-controversial measure.  I do not agree with him that it is a non-controversial measure.  The Minister said, in effect, that what he wants to do with this amending Bill is to legalise the extension of the scope of the grant scheme to cover the non-university and particularly the technological sector of third-level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all agree that this country desperately needs a considerable diversion of students from the traditional academic area to the non-university technological sector.  The Minister is on record as saying that this is very close to his own heart and I agree.  One of the things we should be considering is why there is a psychological block among parents which wants them to send their children to a college in the conventional university sense rather than sending them to a far more useful non-university third level.  If the Minister thinks we believe that the present amending Bill is really going to extend the grant system, we can tell him that he is not going to bring in any new grants under this <Col N="272" /> amending Bill.  There is no question here of fearing him because he is <i>ferentes dona.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The great obstacle to any such extension that the Minister says he desires is ignored in this Bill and, that is, the four honours requirement for a grant.  In addition to the unsatisfactory means test position as long as the four honours requirement remains it will prevent third-level technological education from being democratised in any real meaningful sense.  The present grant scheme which it is proposed to leave untouched under the amending Bill discriminates against RTC students.  It also discriminates against those would-be university students who need only two honours for entry to certain courses but whose parents cannot afford to pay for them and who do not qualify for the rather strict terms of the grant scheme. Regional colleges very properly assess suitability among applicants on a certain amount of academic criteria, in this case a pass leaving certificate and on other criteria which have nothing to do with academic performance in the leaving certificate, a performance which is irrelevant to the kind of non-academic and technological courses they are going to pursue in the RTC for which they have a particular bent.  The RTCs apply their own tests within the system.  In the universities proper one has a static position&mdash;the student gets his grant on four honours.  There is no further testing of his aptitude or suitability.  In the regional technical colleges the student can move on from a cert stage to a diploma stage to a degree stage.  There is a proper inbuilt system of testing the students to which the whole business of leaving cert honours is largely irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The four honours requirement is an anomaly in the context of the regional technical colleges and a complete block to the aim which the Minister now professes that is, the liberalisation of the grant scheme to the non-university sector. The four honours requirement reduces the number of grant-aided students who would otherwise be suitable <Col N="273" /> for third-level non-university education and who would not only help to democratise third-level education but would make a badly needed contribution to the technological development of our economy.  Surely the real criterion for suitability of entry to third-level regional technical colleges and the real basis on which grants should be given is whether the student is judged by those most suitable to do so, to be suitable to get a place in the course.  The place in the course criterion is the appropriate one rather that the four honours requirement.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister explain the following facts or how does he think this amending Bill is going to improve the positions reflected by the facts: (1) 60 per cent of the students in Waterford Regional Technical College last year had no financial aid, (2) only 4.4 per cent of the RTC students generally are receiving higher education grants, (3) more generally the number of people suitable for higher education seems to be falling rather than rising and (4) the Vocational Education Committee scholarship scheme which was lauded by the Minister in his statement, is, as is well known, defective from the point of view of being competitive and limited?  In Dublin County Council, a vast area, the number of such scholarships currently granted is very small indeed.  Part of the answer to these drawbacks lies in low eligibility levels, but a very important part of the answer is the anomaly of the four honours requirement.</P>
    <P>The real purpose of this Bill, with its retrospective clause, is to cover the Minister against the irregular situation that has developed over the last four years where the scope of the grant scheme has been broadened in a piecemeal fashion and where grants have been handed out <i>ultra vires.</i>  There are all kinds of anomalies.  In Galway Regional Technical College there was a student pursuing a course in secretarial studies who did not have a grant sanctioned by the Department.  There was another student in similar circumstances similarly qualified in other respects whose grant was sanctioned.  Is not the real purpose of this amending Bill to put <Col N="274" /> a cosmetic liberal gloss on the present position while guarding the Department against the prospect of civil actions?  It is not altogether clear that the amending Bill is going to guarantee the Department against the prospect of such actions.</P>
    <P>What about a student, for example, in a non-university college who retrospectively, so to speak, was eligible for a grant in 1974 and duly and properly finished his or her course in 1976?  Is it not conceivable that such a student can sue the Department and claim a grant retrospectively?  The amending Bill, as it stands, is altogether too vague and leaves the Minister with arbitrary powers.  For example, in the only part of the Bill which actually proposes an amendment there is a reference to a course or courses of not less than two years duration being a course or courses of which the Minister approves.  Is it not possible for the Minister, under this vague clause, if the educational national cake dwindles further, to withdraw recognition from certain courses and accord it to others, even within the universities themselves?  Of course there must be ministerial discretion.  The Minister is a highly discreet man; there is no doubt about that.  But his discretion should be more clearly defined, more clearly circumscribed.</P>
    <P>The Bill purports to be a progressive measure.  In fact, it is a no-change Bill, arguably a reactionary Bill.  It leaves unchanged section 2 (1) of the existing Act of 1968 where the four honours requirement is, if not specifically laid down, certainly understood.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one more general and political point&mdash;I have kept fairly closely to the terms of the Bill&mdash;which occurred to me just this morning.  Under our grants scheme generally a qualified student is entitled to hold a grant in university institutions outside this State.  It you have a student who wants to go to university, who has his four honours and is properly qualified, he may hold it in the New University of Ulster in Coleraine.  Nothing is stopping him, and a very good thing too.  But there is, of course, something stopping him and that is the inadequate level of our grants <Col N="275" /> scheme.  In 1973 when fees were much lower in the New University of Ulster in Coleraine 20 per cent of the students in that university were from the Republic. Now that the fees there are out of the reach of our present grant holders that percentage of Southern students has fallen to 5 per cent.  In passing I would recommend this particular inadequacy in our grants scheme to the consideration of the Minister because Government professions of sincerity about building North/South bridges sound very hollow indeed when you examine them in the light of the situation on the ground.</P>
    <P>What a pity we should have such an unsatisfactory measure before us in a week in which the Higher Education Authority, hardly a body composed of long-haired student radicals and subversives, has made very clear its own dissatisfaction with the present system of financing higher education and with the reactionary thinking on education in the Green Paper.  No: the Minister must do better than this.  Instead of this negative measure he should be coming into this House to do something about inadequate grants and inadequate fees, about raising the scandalously low participation rate of our youth in higher education, far and away the lowest participation rate in the EEC.  He should be doing something about improving the level of education spending in the context of Government priorities generally.  If the Minister does not do better I shall be compelled to revise my assessment of him which was made in the days of our golden youth; I shall be compelled to mutter mournfully: <i>O quantum mutatus ab illo Hectore.</i></P>

      <P>I should like briefly to welcome this Bill.  It seems to be the custom to present various phrases in Latin, no doubt in deference to our distinguished classical scholar, the Minister, and I suppose there are many different routes to the stars but, unfortunately, in this country we have tended to assume to far too great an extent that the only route was via the universities. The basic intention of this Bill is to provide the necessary amending legislation <Col N="276" /> to allow tenure of higher education grants at approved non-degree courses at such institutions as colleges of technology and regional technical colleges. This is a very welcome, albeit a very belated step.  I am glad that the Minister has seen fit on one of his first visits to this Chamber to introduce this very necessary Bill.  It is enormously important that we put more emphasis on technological education, that we appreciate more and more that there are many routes to the stars, that the only way is not just through the universities, and particularly not through the rather perhaps excessively traditional universities we have in this country with a very heavy emphasis, in the past at any rate, on arts subjects and nowhere near sufficient support or emphasis on the science and technological aspect of learning which in itself is surely just as important as the arts, and which additionally is so very necessary in practical terms for our developing economy.</P>
      <P>It is a strange fact that at present in this country, in many areas&mdash;computer science is one&mdash;we are very short of qualified graduates.  For many technological subjects we find ourselves having to import technological people of the highest ability and intelligence.  But equally well we could supply this perfectly adequately from within our own resources were there the opportunity and also perhaps the tradition amongst our parents and in our society generally to realise that technology is not just second best.  In many ways it is a first rather than a second.  It is a matter of great sadness to see that the number is so few&mdash;160 exercised the 1974 option. I am very glad to see that the Minister is going to take steps to see that the scheme will be more widely publicised so that students in other schools generally who may be contemplating proceeding to the regional technical colleges and colleges of technology may be fully aware of their assistance and provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other aspect that I am glad to see is that we are now giving support to people who are taking non-degree courses.  I sincerely hope we will begin to get away from this bias or snobbery which tended <Col N="277" /> to separate degree and non-degree courses.  There may be many circumstances in which a non-degree course is much more appropriate, much more valuable to the individual and perhaps of a far higher standard than that of a given degree course.  They each have their place and one is not necessarily below or above the other.  I very much welcome this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>In the sense that this Bill merely legislates retrospectively for a situation which already exists the Minister may try to describe it as a non-controversial measure.  I would agree very much indeed with Senator Murphy that that depends on how you view the subject, and for those who are deeply concerned, as is the Labour Party, with the inequality of access to third-level education, with the distorted way in which the present system operates, this has to be a very controversial Bill because it is going to do nothing to counter the inequity and imbalance in the present system.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable the Minister has decided to introduce a Bill because that is a complicated process&mdash;it has to go through both Houses&mdash;and has chosen to structure it in such a very narrow way.  I propose, first of all, to speak in more general terms about the position relating to access to third-level education in Ireland and then to relate my remarks specifically to what the Minister could have done at the very least, in introducing a Bill called the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Bill, 1978. The very least he could have done&mdash;as I shall explain&mdash;is to abolish the four honours eligibility requirement for grants to the approved courses to which he will extend the legislation, namely, to the RTCs and COTs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, let us look at the background picture relating to higher education in Ireland.  In doing so I am indebted to the Union of Students of Ireland, as I think a number of other Senators are, for very useful material which makes the case which they want to bring before the public, the unanswerable case, that in the youngest and fastest-growing country in the European <Col N="278" /> Community we have blatant discrimination in access to third-level education; we have inherited privilege and unnecessary and unacceptable criteria for that access.  We are steadily worsening the situation by not having the grants for third-level education keeping pace with the cost of living and not ensuring that the means test is a realistic one for 1978 and into 1979.  The situation is a very bad one indeed, is getting worse very steadily and is doing so in the context of a country with a population 50 per cent of which is under 25 and&mdash;perhaps an even more relevant statistic&mdash;39 per cent of which is under 19.  So the challenge is clearly there.  We should be doing a very different kind of thing in this country at present.  We should be examining every aspect of our economic and social development to see how far we can ensure that every last penny that can possibly be spared goes into education of our young in every possible way&mdash;improving the ratio of teachers and pupils at primary level, improving access and facilities there, improving access at secondary level and improving and correcting the present imbalance in access to education at the third-level.  That would make a great deal of political sense if we want to have a basic social cohesion as a people&mdash;it is as important as that&mdash;if we want to realise the challenge of our economic and social development in a very complex world, where we need an educated labour force, where we need skilled people, where we need a very adaptable labour force&mdash;technicians and those who would contribute to expanding the economic life of the country for the benefit of all our people.</P>
    <P>These are the kind of urgent considerations which just will not wait. Instead, the picture is one of diminution in Government expenditure in education generally and specifically in third-level education.  It displays a lack of any attempt to ensure that student grants and the means test for eligibility for grants keep even some linkage with the cost of living.  The effect of this is that there is a decline in our third-level institutions of students supported by State funds.  I propose to put on the record of the <Col N="279" /> House figures illustrating this which have been compiled by the Union of Students in Ireland.  It is very important indeed that we, the representatives of the people and the people, through a debate in this House, know what the situation is and are made aware of the very crucial social problems and indeed the political lunacy of not redirecting the focus on education and vastly expanding the facilities and access to education.</P>
    <P>An assessment has been prepared of the percentage of students receiving financial aid from the State.  The figures show a comparison between the years 1975, 1976 and 1977.  For the universities the percentage in 1975 was 22.5 per cent; in 1976 it went up to 23 per cent; in 1977 it came down to 22 per cent.  I will be interested if the Minister can fill in the figure for 1978.  For the RTCs and COTs, the percentage of students receiving financial aid from the State in 1975 was 27 per cent; in 1976 it was 27.5 per cent; in 1977 it had gone down to 22 per cent.  In the first-and second-level teacher education, the primary teacher training, the percentage of students receiving financial aid from the State in 1975&mdash;and here for complex reasons there are the two figures but the figures again decline&mdash;72 per cent, declining in 1976 to 68 per cent, declining in 1977 sharply to 61 per cent. Therefore, the percentage in all third-level institutions of students receiving financial aid from the State goes down from 29.5 per cent in 1975 to 29 per cent in 1976, and a more sharp drop, 27.5 per cent in 1977.  This must illustrate, more than any words alone can do, what is happening effectively in third-level education&mdash;the lack of a realistic student grant.  I would accept as moderate the figure of £900 which is the assessment given by USI of the basic living grant on which a student can attend a third-level institution, pay for his or her accommodation and live, without any particular luxuries.</P>
    <P>The present grants and the very outdated and unrealistic means test and level of eligibility exclude a very considerable number of students whose parents may not seem to be precisely on <Col N="280" /> the poverty line.  But they cannot, in present circumstances, afford to support a student during that student's time at third-level education.  The number who are able to avail of State-financing declines because they are caught just outside the means test eligibility. Therefore, they are victims of the system.  Similarly, in the case of the RTCs and COTs there is a most illogical exclusion, that is, the four honours exclusion. This type of prerequisite to getting a State grant to go on for technical education does not make any sense. First of all it does not acknowledge the value of technical education, the different criteria, the different approach; very often, the different strengths of the individual who will go on for technical education.  It is applying a criterion&mdash; one type of criterion&mdash;which is for an academic stream.</P>
    <P>The subjects in which a student may get honours could be completely unrelated to the question of going on for technical education.  Similarly, a student who wants to go on to take a course in a regional technical college may be an excellent student when assessed by the kind of criteria that the technical college itself would apply, would definitely gain entry to the college, but cannot avail of a grant because of the completely unsuitable prerequisite of having four honours in academic subjects in the Leaving Certificate.  The Minister has not advanced the cause of higher education, has not improved in any way the eligibility for higher education, in the Bill before the House today.  I can accept that he may wish to introduce the provisions relating to the amount of the grant, the extension of scholarship or the means test eligibility by regulations at a different time.  But I would have thought that any measure relating to extending the grants scheme, to legislate retrospectively for the fact that the RTCs are covered already, with some anomalies, afforded the Minister an opportunity which he had a very deep responsibility to assume, an opportunity to recognise the difference, to allow technical education to come of age in Ireland, indeed to endorse what I think is an increasingly widely-felt view that we must, as a <Col N="281" /> country, emphasise and increase access to and facilities in the area of technical training and education in order to provide the opportunities to our young and the opportunities for economic and social development of this country so desperately needed in the whole economic sphere.</P>
    <P>The Minister had that responsibility when he was deciding to introduce a Bill to legislate for extending the grants scheme to other approved courses.  He has failed in that responsibility by retaining an illogical qualification which does not make any sense to the individual going on to the technical college, which is not an entry requirement of the technical college and which has the very undesirable effect of continuing a privileged, streamed access so that it is still beyond the reach and scope of the numbers of students coming up who would otherwise avail of the opportunity to go to technical college.  Obviously to remove the four honours requirement would be to increase the number of those who would apply for local authority grants and would involve the costing of the scheme and the expenditure.</P>
    <P>Here it is relevant to examine the figures regarding expenditure in education, to see that in this area of social expenditure, far from the budget increasing in proportion to the demands, needs and physical description of us as a people, a demand which recognises our very substantial youth and the fact that there is no longer the level of emigration there was, the fact that the birth rate is continuing at a higher level than in other countries, that the population will continue to increase and to require to be educated to the end of the century.</P>
    <P>The figures with which we are faced in looking at expenditure in education and the Green Paper predictions are running counter to the real situation, the real demand on the ground.  It is very hard to reconcile this with the priorities of the present Government.  I believe, and the Labour Party believe, that you cannot dissociate the Government attitude towards education generally, and access to higher education, from the whole approach to the economic and social planning of the country.  We believe that if <Col N="282" /> there is going to be the possibility of diverting adequate resources to educate and to provide equality of access to education to this growing number of our young population, not from the privilege of their birth but as a right as young citizens to have access to education, to have equality of that access and to have the bias in favour of those who cannot afford to pay fees or to cover the cost of accommodation&mdash;if we are going to change that&mdash;then I do not think it can be done by a Government which appears to be prepared to structure their economic strategy on fostering a consumer boom by an elite, of a band of about 30 or 40 per cent of the population who are made dramatically better off as a strategy so that they may consume more and therefore generate the need for more production the need for a so-called economic growth based on that.</P>
    <P>I believe that the strategy of making the better off in our society dramatically more affluent through the various measures taken&mdash;the removal of car tax, the removal of rates on private dwellings, the retention of the highest band of income tax, 60 per cent, the removal of wealth tax, the removal of a partial effect of capital gains tax, the increase in personal allowances at the higher level, all of these have generated more consumer spending, more money freely floating around.  We have seen evidence of this. One only has to go to a race meeting to see the amount of money, at a certain level, which is in free flow, where people have no problem in spending at a certain level.  This has to be contrasted with the lack of priorities in where we should be spending any resources of the State.  It is not merely a question of spending the money.  It is a question of ensuring that, as a people, we understand where our priorities should be and why they should be there.  The problem in debating education&mdash;it has been said and I think there is some truth in it&mdash;that it is a subject that empties the House at times&mdash;it is both too complex a problem, too difficult to tackle because once you start talking about third-level education you have somebody else who says: well my priority would be primary education. <Col N="283" /> This is a problem, that of trying to relate a discussion on education to our present economic and social context.  I believe this is more urgent, more basically critical in Ireland today than it has been since the foundation of the State.  We have changed so substantially in our demographic structure and yet we have have not changed sufficiently in our perception of ourselves.</P>
    <P>We do not see this country as being a very young country.  We do not see this country as being a country with a lower expenditure in education than the other countries with whom we are in an alliance in the context of the European Economic Community.  I do not think people would know, if asked, that the percentage of State-financed students in our third-level institutions has gone down since 1975.  I think there would be a great deal of surprise, that people would say: that cannot be so; there must have been an increase in expenditure in third-level education.</P>
    <P>It is hard to believe that students could really be expected to live and be able to follow their courses of studies on the present maximum maintenance allowances. The maximum maintenance allowance in 1978 and 1979 is £500 for somebody away from home and £200 living at home.  The maximum fees allowance is £289, except for certain courses, medical, veterinary or dental courses in Trinity or in the NUI.  To anybody who is trying to budget in present circumstances, with the increase in the cost of living in recent years, that is not by anybody's standards a minimum living allowance.  The effect of that is to make still more privileged, still more narrow, access to third-level education, and I believe that there was a fairly high expectation of the present Minister for Education when he came into office, that he was seen as a man with a certain vision to improve access to education and in particular to provide a focus and a structure which would lead to an improvement in equality of access to education.</P>
    <P>Whether it is because he cannot persuade <Col N="284" /> his Cabinet colleagues to assist him in the matter or because he has not been following through with that mission, I do not think he is redressing a bad situation.  I think he is allowing it to drift and become a worse situation, a situation of still narrower access, a situation which in a country that was about to become a republic allows us to build into the system a degree of privilege which would be very seriously questioned in any country which genuinely proported to treat all its citizens equally.  We do not treat all our citizens equally, and nowhere is that more dramatic than in the overall picture of access to education and distribution of our resources in relation to the amount we spend on education generally and specifically, since we are talking about it here in the House today, on third-level education.</P>
    <P>It is not too late for the Minister.  He could still introduce an amendment to this Bill to abolish the four honours entry requirement for technical education. This would not dramatically affect the position in relation to universities because the universities have, as we all know, an increasingly high entry requirement anyway.  There is great pressure on places at the university level and the universities are increasingly upping already very high requirements, and this in itself is causing very real difficulties. But it would have a dramatic effect in opening up access to the technical colleges in giving us the skilled, trained, educated young work force that we so desperately need as a country and it would show our young people that we have some sense of social priorities, that we have some sense of what the focus of our attention as a people should be.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will be tabling amendments to this Bill at the Committee Stage, and one of these amendments will relate to what Senator Murphy rightly referred to as the very vague and worrying new power which the Minister has taken in relation to approving an institution or a course in an institution to include also the approval of university courses.  It may be that the Bill was unintentionally drafted in an ambiguous way, but I, like Senator Murphy, would <Col N="285" /> read from the Bill the possibility that the Minister might reserve for himself a discretion whether to approve for the future an existing course in a university institution. I think this would have a disasterous effect on university autonomy. It is something that is not necessary or desirable, particularly in the relationship between the State and university institutions. We can provide the proper focus of equality of access through proper distribution of resources of the country without impinging on basic university autonomy.  The Labour Senators have also been trying, within the constraints imposed on them, to amend a Bill in this House without imposing a further charge on the public expenditure&mdash;to broaden the scope of this Bill&mdash;because it seems to me a regrettable waste of the time of both Houses to have a Bill going through which merely legislates the <i>status quo</i> when we know so well that that <i>status quo</i> is inequitable and unequal and should not be tolerated in our very young and hopefully democratic society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Minister will be relieved to hear that I do not claim to speak for the Union of Students in Ireland but merely as the mother of the Cassidy students.  I should like to add my voice to those who have welcomed the Minister on his first visit to the Seanad and to wish him well in a portfolio which many of us consider to be the most important in Government.  I should also like to welcome this low key but important measure to increase the scope of higher education grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has noted in his speech that a progressive burgeoning in the educational sphere has occurred particularly in the technical and technological area, and although this is to be welcomed, he goes on to say that the numbers attending universities are much greater than those in the RTCs and the colleges of technology.  Therefore, the universities still dominate third level education here.  They make up 2.5 per cent of students at all levels, a little less than the number of students who attend private primary schools.  Roughly 25 per cent of university students are the <Col N="286" /> recipients of higher education grants which are designed to cover fees and the minimal subsistence level of maintenance, the cost of which is borne by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The grant system comes in for constant criticism&mdash;its inadequacy, its grounding of a means test and a merit test: and on a location basis it is said to impose more stringent standards on poorer students.</P>
    <P>Many students who receive grants emigrate and spend their working lives abroad, thereby conferring the advantages of their skill and learning on other communities.</P>
    <P>Is there not a case then to be made to replace the grant system by one whereby students would be enabled to obtain long-term loans, to be repaid after graduation and assisted, where necessary, by scholarships?  Would this not be a way through which the State could recoup its investment, and would it not be a more equitable system particularly for the taxpayer who not only contributes to the cost of educating his neighbours' children, but is not afforded income tax relief for what he pays, in full, for his own?  After all, to be ineligible for a higher education grant does not automatically put one in the Rockefeller class.</P>
    <P>We tend as parents, and as a community in general, to be very complacent in our attitude to this aspect of the educational system.  We look with pride at the number of students who graduate every year from the universities.  We ignore the fact that at the same time many of them will never be able to obtain employment in their own country.  We point with pride to our love of learning which we regard rightly as one of our finest traditions.  It is time we stopped looking back at the hedge schools and fixed our gaze firmly on the many problems which exist in education today&mdash;the funding of the system, in particular, which if all places sought are to be provided will have to be double the 1974 figure by 1986 at all levels.  We want to look at the direction in which the system will go in the 1980s.</P>
    <P>I hope that the next legislation brought in by the Minister will afford us <Col N="287" /> scope for a wider debate on these matters and give us something to get our teeth into.  Of course, a basic problem before we talk about expanding the scope of grants at third-level is to ensure that all students who want to avail of third-level education, whether in university or technical college, will be given the opportunity to do so.  We must ensure equality of access&mdash;that no child will be denied an education (a), because his parents cannot afford it and (b) because he is disadvantaged by the sort of first-level education available to him.</P>
    <P>The State guarantees to provide a free though not necessarily an adequate primary education for our children and many children, because of where they live, find themselves seriously disadvantaged not only before they reach second or third level but before they go to school at all.  I think there is a historical reason to this.  We have inherited a highly developed national school system which concentrated on providing a basic education for as many as possible as cheaply as possible.  This system could not and did not stand up to the demands of modern first-level education without substantial funding by the State to replace old insanitary and unsuitable schools, and to replan the curriculum in a rather drastic fashion.  Although a lot has been done in this area, a lot still remains to be done.  We will end up replacing a highly developed cheap system with a highly developed expensive one. We must also regard as particularly disadvantaged the many children who for one reason or another drop out of the system at an early stage.</P>
    <P>One of the points that inevitably crops up in any debate on third-level education is the points system as a means of entry. As a system it is inequitable.  It merely acts as a device for screening and rejection. It places intolerable pressures on pupils to pass examinations, and while one admits the point of view that the prospect of examinations helps to concentrate the mind wonderfully, as a parent one can deplore the undesirable pressures and the nervous tensions it causes in pupils, teachers and parents alike, and it should be replaced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> Perhaps the separation of the matriculation certificate from the leaving certificate, the removal of compulsory subjects and a system which would include individual assessment, are possibilities to be considered.  If places can be provided very substantial growth at third level can be expected.  Budgetary and enrolment pressures would increase and the response to these pressures should be a planned one.</P>
    <P>They are some random thoughts as a parent.  I see the need for more involvement by parents in the educational system.  I find it disheartening when, if one talks about career guidance, for example, parents say: &ldquo;Oh yes, we must get the bank manager in to give a talk to the sixth year lads&rdquo;.  At this stage of our educational development that sort of thinking is for the birds.</P>
    <P>I have great hopes for this Ministry.  I know the Minister will be a worthy successor of previous Fianna Fáil Ministers who pursued far-sighted and courageous policies in order to ensure that all our children, whatever their social background or their income limits, would have access to education, and I will leave the Minister with this thought, expressed by the Prime Minister of Great Britain and Ireland, Benjamin Disraeli, in a debate in the House of Commons in 1872 when he said: &ldquo;Upon the education of the people of this country depends the future of this country.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not apologise for speaking on this debate even if I appear to represent the Union of Students in Ireland.  It is important that university Senators in this House should comment on this Bill which affects higher education so significantly.  It is important also that we note the concern of some of us who have the honour to represent university graduates that there should be a great widening of access to education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity we have not been considering far more fundamental measures in the whole area of education than this very small measure which is basically to clear up a problem which existed.  It is not a new concept.  It has been mentioned before that it is a rich country indeed which has a high level of participation <Col N="289" /> of its young people in all areas of third level education.  In Ireland we have 33,000 young people enjoying full time higher education.  This is an extremely low participation rate, as has been pointed out, 7.9 per cent, the lowest rate by far of our European neighbours. The number holding higher education grants is 5,848, and if you add to that information which came to hand last year that under 3 per cent of the students of UCD in 1966-67 were from families where the breadwinner was a manual worker or in that bracket, you have a very sorry picture of restricted access to education.</P>
    <P>This Bill corrects an anomaly and extends the provisions of grants to the non-university sector, but in doing so it brings to mind and exacerbates the unfairness of the four honours criteria. Again, as I say, I make no apologies for expressing grave concern on that point. It is scandalous that in 1978 a child whose father is better off than his neighbour should have access to third level education even with lower academic achievements.  It is very difficult to explain that away in a country which professes to believe in social justice and in which we are striving for equality of opportunity.</P>
    <P>When you remember that the children of the poorer sections of our society are already extremely handicapped in their attempts to gain education&mdash;they are most grievously handicapped by the under-financed national school system &mdash;how can we add another handicap when they have made the admirable effort to reach a stage where they wish to partake of third level education?  It is a great achievement for a child from a poor background to have got to that level and a great achievement for his parents to have foregone the opportunity to put that child out to work at an earlier age.  This is a system which we cannot possibly condone any longer.  It should be replaced, as Senator Murphy has said, by acceptance to a course&mdash;that should be the criterion which would decide if the grant was to be got, leaving aside the other criteria regarding income and so on.  We cannot continue to add to the cynicism which we deplore in young <Col N="290" /> people at so early an age by the spectacle of his less bright neighbour's child who happens to have money in the bank getting yet one more advantage over him.</P>
    <P>If a side effect of this Bill is to give more impetus to a very badly needed raising of status and interest in technology and in the courses offered by non-university institutions in technology, that is to be greatly lauded.  I hope it will not be long before some of the seats in which our university Senators sit will be available to the people who are coming through those regional colleges.  This is another measure which is long overdue. It is an anachronism that there are six seats in this House reserved for university Senators.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister that this is a non-controversial Bill.  It raises controversy by its very limited area.  We need far more imagination and energy to be applied to a broad range of educational positions.  We have an expanding young population.  We must bring it to its maximum potential in terms of involvement and achievement which lead to personal fulfilment, and anachronisms by the four honours and the grants criteria have no place in a modern educational policy.</P>

      <P>I will be speaking for myself, and, like Senator Cassidy, for my own children who are students, but I make no apology whatsoever for saying a few words on behalf of the USI.  Over the years I have managed to work very closely with them and as Chairman of the National Council for Educational Awards.  There are two members of the USI on that group and they never failed to get a hearing.  We did not always agree with some of their views, but I think that my relationship there is good and I do not mind saying a few words on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find myself in a difficult position.  I know that the Bill is recognising the <i>status quo.</i>  I would like the Minister spending a few million, if he had it, to give greater support to people in the third-level educational system.  I am looking forward to the debate we are to have on the National Council for <Col N="291" /> Educational Awards Bill which I believe was released today.  I am not going to broaden the scope of my statements on this measure.  At the same time, I would have to express some disappointment that we cannot make some more money available.  I had a look at the figures: I do not know whether this is right, but it seems to me that another 4,000 would be brought into the net if we adjusted the criteria for entry as four honours. That would cost us £1.5 million or so.</P>
    <P>Maybe this is our chance.  I see in the Minister, a man who can move in the steps of Donogh O'Malley, but we need a new &ldquo;Investment in Education.&rdquo;  The report, Investment in Education, was published, I think in 1966&mdash;the OECD Report.  Looking at the projections before us for the necessary enrolment taking into account the growth in jobs that we must get for a healthy society over the next few years, the whole educational system will be one big problem from the point of view of the funding of it.  I would throw it out on this occasion to the Minister on his first time in the Seanad that he might think about that.</P>
    <P>I have here a report that was published by the National Council for Educational Awards written by Dr. Joe Hennessy.  The sort of thing that is ahead of us is daunting.  When we consider projections at a given point in time it is very hard to visualise the impact of a ten-year development.  I remember in 1969 when we were working on the Steering Committee Report for the Regional Technical Colleges we had no output from colleges of that kind.  In the vocational system we had, say, 1,800 or 1,700 students.  We went from zero to 4,000 now in the RTC system, and it is growing.  I mentioned it before in the House but I should like to mention again that we must believe our own forecasts. If we believe the country will expand at a rate of 7 per cent, then employment will expand, and if the employment expands we need properly trained people to take up the jobs.  Dr. Hennessy's report states:</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the needs of industry <Col N="292" /> for more and higher technological skills, the trends in student enrolments when related to the projected population increase in Ireland and the increasing participation rate in third-level education predict a heavy demand for higher education in the 1980s.  In the higher technological sector alone there will probably be a demand for 12,000 student places by 1981 and for 18,000 by 1986 in contrast to just over 7,000 in 1977.</P>
    <P>I had another rather sinful thought, maybe, and I will throw it out here as well.  What we need are young people who will be induced more into the technological sector.  In 1969, I do not think we ever dreamt that there would be such acceptance of it as there is now. But we need even more; we need the doubling of the number of technicians in the next five years.  This figure has been thrown out by the Confederation of Irish Industry and has been mentioned by Dr, Joe Hennessy here.  That is a big number, but they are required if we are to meet our job targets, our industrial targets.  Possibly the Minister might be able to make a few bob available to encourage people to go into that stream, in other words, to give differential grants. That might not cost so much.  It is what the country is about.  It may get a student who has been left out of the arts faculties into the tehnological areas.</P>
    <P>As I said at the opening I will not broaden the debate past this Bill.  We will have the NCEA Bill coming in and we will have a chance to go into the other implications of technological education. I look forward to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the spirit of the Bill as I am one of the people who deal with large numbers of students who will be effected by its provisions.  I also advise large numbers of people whom I do not actually teach who will be affected by its provisions.  Everybody in this House supports the widening and the extension of the grants scheme for universities and any broadening of the terms of reference for this grant scheme is to be welcomed.  This is the object of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make some general observations on the problems the <Col N="293" /> Minister faces.  He is a distinguished man of letters.  In recent times I have had many letters back from Irish people in the US to say he has performed with distinction, which is not normally associated with Ministers for Education, for one reason or another, in his visits abroad.  He has helped greatly to project our cultural image and, of course, he has been greatly helped by the fact that his predecessor and himself combined to allow the exhibition of Irish art to tour the United States.  This sort of thing is a very important plus in our cultural relations abroad.  I do not think we should hide the fact under a bushel that in the eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh centuries we produced some of the most remarkable art of the artistic world in any era.  It is one of our great prides and joys.  The Minister has acquitted himself with great distinction in the United States accompanying this exhibition, and it has rubbed off in a very benevolent and positive way.  This sort of thing can only do this country good.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see the Minister in the House after one of his successful visits to the US.  If I might digress for a moment&mdash;I see the beady eye of the Leas-Chathaoirleach about to descend on me and cut me off&mdash;I might make a small political point.  Our relations with our Irish-American colleagues are not always easy, sometimes they are very difficult indeed, and I think that the exhibition now visiting the United States can only have done a tremendous amount of good for that difficult political relationship.</P>
    <P>To get down to the substantive ideas contained in this Bill, I commend Senator Mulcahy who consistently in this House has been making a strong case for the development of our technology and for the powers-that-be in this country to realise that the forward projections of people like him who are trained in this area of projection show very serious shortfalls in this area particularly in the technological sector. Senator Mulcahy has consistently made this point since he came into the House. It is greatly to his credit and I want to say this in a non-political way.  Far too few of our representatives have any <Col N="294" /> technological training or expertise and it seems to me that it is one of the most important, if not the most important point to make as far as our higher education is concerned, that the great development has to come in the technological sector. That is the way the world is going and whether we like it or not if we are going to be able to pay our way and make our living we must have people developed along all the strata of the technological sector.  We have to put considerable resources into this and we must if we can, get help from the European Economic Communities to develop our technological training at all levels.  It is one of the things the Minister must be considering at considerable length.</P>
    <P>It is very important in connection with this Bill that this sort of idea be put into practice.  I feel that the National Council for Educational Awards has a great deal to recommend it.  It is a very important body and I think as a university person that the universities were wrong when some time ago they appeared to want to swallow up so many of the other third-level institutes and educational bodies. That is wrong.  There are many of these institutes and bodies that can play a very fruitful role in conjunction with the universities. Let us have co-operation and two-way communication going all the time.</P>
    <P>The move some years ago may have been a defensive gesture on the universities' part.  I do not want to defend the universities on this but I think they were basically wrong.  Their philosophy of trying to swallow up these bodies was wrong.  I am not saying this as an absolutely blanket statement applying to every one of the links the universities have but, in general terms, a number of these bodies would be better and it would be better for the nation as a whole if they remained independent.  I feel as a university person that the universities have a clearly defined role to play but there are many other very important roles for other institutions and we should not overlook them.  We must be careful about keeping our terms of reference right.  This sentiment will not make me popular in my own institutions or perhaps some other institutions but I <Col N="295" /> have felt this for some time.  In the appropriate areas independence is important and provided that acceptable standards can be maintained, then this independence is worth while.  I say this to the Minister because it is one of the difficult problems which must constantly lie on his desk, the problem of assessment of the end product of these sorts of institutions.</P>
    <P>I think the NCEA is a good idea; it has a lot going for it.  Mistakes will be made in this area of assessment: it is a difficult and delicate area; there are political pressures pulling in many directions but the nettle must be grasped.  It should be done and people should be big enough, after a period of operation to say: &ldquo;Let us review the situation and let us change certain aspects of it.&rdquo;  That is important.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the broadening of the scheme which we are considering to non-university institutions.  One of the questions that surrounds this Bill is: how broad is the definition in section 1 of the institutions, and how many institutions does it encompass in its terms.  The idea is to broaden the application of the 1968 Act.  I am not quite sure that the Minister is broadening it sufficiently and I intend to put down an amendment for Committee Stage which will broaden it still further.  There are considerable arguments for a further broadening of the terms of this approved institution.  Even though the terms of my amendment may go further than the Minister would himself approve of, I think I should table the amendment.  It is worth considering a further broadening of the terms of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's attention one anomaly which I came up against in the application of the rules which are mentioned in this Bill.  It came to my attention because of the problems that a certain student faced in 1972 or 1973, a student who was coming under my aegis, the family wrote to me and as a result of this I contacted the student and went to see them and the following situation had arisen.  He was a student from a particular county.  He had got seven honours at a high level in the leaving <Col N="296" /> certificate and his family, as I ascertained on my own, would have been well within the means level for the operation of the grant.  There was no problem there; large family, small farm, large number of children to be educated; no problem about the means test.  This young man who did extremely well in his leaving certificate entered a dentistry course and went on holidays with a friend of his from a neighbouring county.  He was applying for a grant in the normal way and he was with his friend who was also eligible for the grant in a similar situation.  He was saying: &ldquo;I had better go and get my grant application made&rdquo; and his mate said &ldquo;Do not worry; there is another month to go&rdquo;.  It turned out that when he returned to his home county the dates for application for the grant in the two counties were different.  So, the boy in county X got his grant and my man in county Y was late for his grant, and when you are late with your application you do not get the grant.  That was not the problem.  I do not have much sympathy with people who apply late.  If you are late, you have to wait for the following year.  That was not the crux.  The crux came when he wrote to his county council and when they contacted the Department of Education the Department said &ldquo;If you want to get the grant in the following year you must repeat your leaving certificate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I never heard anything so ludicrous in all my life.  He had to repeat his leaving certificate at the end of the first year of his dental course in TCD.  You cannot ask human beings to pass their first premedical or pre-dental examination and to repeat their leaving certificate, but this was the regulation laid down, that if you were late one year then you had to repeat your Leaving Certificate.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter on an Adjournment Debate and the then Minister's Parliamentary Secretary who was in office, I think for a short time before the dissolution of the Dáil, was Deputy O'Kennedy.  The interesting thing was that the candidate was in his home constituency and he had already been notified about the problem as a Deputy. After this Adjournment Debate and <Col N="297" /> much discussion beforehand and afterwards with the Minister's advisers that regulation was changed, but not retrospectively, and so my man did without his university grant.  The argument given by the Minister's advisers was that if you do not put a terminal date on this sort of regulation then you will have people applying from 1908 with six honours in the leaving certificate and they will be eligible for university grants.  It is the greatest lot of nonsense I ever heard in my life.  That was the official argument put up by the advisers of the Minister and my man never got his university grant.</P>
    <P>I got him some money.  He scraped around and got some money from other sources.  He worked hard night and day. I told him long before this that his family were put to the pin of their collar to get this lad through because the dental course is a long course.  I asked him to do one thing for me and he promised to do it.  There were three children, younger than him as well as four older than him. I suggested that he should pay for their education when he had his dental qualification.  I am not sure about dentists operating in this country, but as soon as one goes to England and operates in the national health service there one can earn £X thousand a year where X is a large whole number.  I told him to make sure that the three children were educated, that his family had &ldquo;bust&rdquo; themselves to get him through. The great grey bureaucracy defeated us at every turn but because of him, I said, we got the regulation changed, but not retrospectively.</P>
    <P>I also want to put down an amendment to obviate the situation that arose originally because I think that all county councils and borough councils and corporations must have the same application date.  I would like to put down an amendment to another part of the 1968 Act in this connection.  Therefore, I want to put down two amendments for the Committee Stage of this Bill, one to attempt to broaden the terms of definition&mdash;I think it is in the spirit of what the Minister is doing but perhaps it goes further than he does&mdash;and the other concerning the application date for <Col N="298" /> the grants for the various county councils.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say to the Minister that I have come across very many students who would not be getting their third-level education if they did not have grants.  I have thought a lot about this problem.  I myself had access to certain limited funds and have been able to help people who have not been able to benefit from the scheme for various reasons&mdash;mature students are one difficult area although I would not say they have the most pressing need to be brought under the Minister's scheme. Sometimes in various institutions one can find funds to help people who genuinely have talent and who could genuinely benefit.  I know that the Minister is a man of culture and I am delighted to see someone with a classical education in office, someone who is prepared to use the classics in a position of authority in our educational system.  I have a great respect for a classical education.  I think it is being somewhat undervalued at the moment.  I hope also that the Minister is a good poker player and that he has the other qualities which one needs to ally with a classical education so that when the chips are down&mdash;and for any Cabinet Minister the chips are down when it comes to getting your slice of the money&mdash;he will assert himself.  As an educationalist I hope that what I say at any time supports the Minister and supports his Department and supports his officials in their attempt to get the money that is necessary to fund schemes like this.</P>
    <P>I have thought at times that we should have a repayable grant scheme like those they have in some of the Scandinavian countries.  I do not know if it operates at present, but ten or fifteen years ago in Norway one got a university grant provided one was prepared to do some teaching service north of the Artic Circle. If this was applied in a reasonably benevolent way it could do a lot of good to the person who held the grant.  If more Dublin people spent some time in the west&mdash;I would not say they might have to teach in the Aran Islands&mdash;if they spent a sufficient length of time in the country the Minister knows it would do <Col N="299" /> them a great deal of good.  As a countryman&mdash;he shares that distinction with me&mdash;coming up to Dublin, we know we have an edge over the people here, and if some of the people here spent some more time in the country they would be the better for it.  I am not making this as an entirely factious point because I really think if one spends one's whole life in Ireland, even if one becomes the most highly qualified technocrat that Senator Mulcahy can dream of, and if one has never milked a cow in one's life, one is missing something.</P>
    <P>That is true, and the Minister knows it to be true, but how do you put this point over unless you can say it nicely in French?  I do not know how you can put it over so as to convince the people.  I firmly believe that if as a city man you do not experience rural life you are missing something considerable.  Probably the reverse is also true, but I want to say that I appreciate the position that the Minister is in.  I know that there are very many calls on the funds that are at his disposal.  One of the things I hope that we can do in the Seanad is to make the case and help him in his arguments in the big slice-up in the Cabinet when it comes to developing the financial provisions for the coming year.</P>
    <P>I know there are many people in this House who are interested in education, and if our words can encourage him it will help not only in this particular sector, which I think is important, but also in the other very important sectors of the whole educational system.  Regrettably I only heard the end of Senator Mulcahy's speech and none of the previous ones. This case that Senator Mulcahy made is a very cogent and important case, and the whole of our effort should be directed at getting more money for education.  It is the great investment for the future, and we should support the Minister and perhaps push him a bit further than he is at present willing to go on extending the grant scheme as set out in this Bill.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to thank the Senators who contributed to the Second Stage <Col N="300" /> debate on this Bill which is a minor Bill, a Bill to fill, as I said in my introductory speech, a legal <i>lacuna.</i>  In fact, I was rather surprised that Senator Robinson used some phrase about &ldquo;a waste of time&rdquo;, and as a qualified barrister I find it very hard to understand how she would regard it as a waste of time seeing that we are righting a legal wrong, in other words grants were being paid without proper statutory authority to do so and I find it very hard to understand how anyone would say that it would be a waste of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Through the Chair, I would like to say that I consider Senator Robinson's statement that it is a waste of time to set right a legal wrong rather strange.  However, I do not want to labour the point.</P>
      <P>Senator Kilbride began by saying that there was a scarcity of technicians and that the poor man's son, the small farmer's son, in the past had nothing to show for his proficiency, and he welcomed the Bill in that it was providing for people who would go to our regional technical colleges to develop trades and crafts.  He talked about what was one of the serious social ills, particularly in the areas that we both know very well, and said that very intelligent people in the past had to emigrate and that all the jobs available to them in the countries to which they emigrated were the menial ones because of this lack of educational provision.  Is chuige sin ataimid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is mian liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Seanadóir Cranitch mar gur chuir sé fáilte romham sa Teach seo.  He said that it was very important for us to have a philosophy of education and particularly in the technological sector <Col N="301" /> because he felt that the need for a philosophy was strong in that sphere.  I suppose the need for a philosophy is strong throughout all sectors of education; it is when you are laying down the tenets of your basic philosophy that you might not get agreement in this House or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Now Senator Murphy picked up my contention that the Bill was noncontroversial in so far as it was simply a <i>lacuna</i>-filling Bill.  He said that it was controversial in that it pretended to extend the scheme and in fact was not extending the scheme, and he went on to talk about the four honours requirement and that the four honours requirement prevents the democratisation of education. I would contend that any extension of the scheme is to be welcomed; that as far as extension in the area to which most Senators directed their remarks, the technological area, is concerned, the scholarship scheme is the best vehicle. The point was missed that in the scholarship scheme the four honours requirement does not exist at all.  In fact the scheme simply states that candidates must have obtained grade D or a higher grade in at least five subjects in the leaving certificate examination, and many in the RTCs who have these scholarships have nowhere near four honours and there is no requirement that they have four honours.  I would like that to be on the records of this House.  I want to state also something which many people miss, that is that the scholarships are of the same money value as the grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In some vocational <Col N="302" /> education committee areas all the scholarships available are not taken up. This is something that exercises my mind and this is why I said in my introductory speech that I would emphasise the importance of that scholarship scheme.  But even if there are not enough of them&mdash;and I would hope we would extend the scheme&mdash;I want to say that the four honours requirement does not apply in the vocational education committee scheme.  Even without one honour, on occasion, the student in the RTC may be enjoying a grant of the same monetary value as the grant in the university system which is now being extended statutorily to the non-university sector.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy said that the New University of Coleraine had 20 per cent of its students from the Republic of Ireland.  I would like to think that that was so but my statistics are quite different. I have information that we never had more than 7 per cent.  I would agree with Senator Murphy that it is highly desirable that as many as possible of the Ulster students anyway should go to the New University of Ulster.  I have my own views as to where that university should have been: I think it should have been in Derry City, based on McGee College, but that is an old controversy.  I do know that before other things intervened to prevent it, the New University of Ulster people were in the schools in Counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan encouraging students from the South to go there.  They were meeting with some success but for reasons known to all of us there has been a falling off.  To my own knowledge, certain students did not go there because of the political turbulence in the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great play was made both by Senator Murphy and Senator Robinson about the inadequacy of the grants and of the eligibility limits.  I will deal with that in a moment. First I should like to commend Senator Conroy on his summing up of the situation in third-level education, that there is a very important place both for technological education and the traditional universities, which also <Col N="303" /> provide technological qualifications in engineering and science, perhaps not with the practical bias which we are hoping for from the institutes of higher education and the regional technical colleges. They have supplied us with engineers and scientists during the years and deserve credit for it.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson prefaced her remarks by talking about the Labour Party and the Labour Party's concern&mdash;she used the word &ldquo;concern&rdquo; on a number of occasions.  I suggest to the House that Senator Robinson was playing to the gallery.  As the student gallery changes&mdash;it is of the nature of student life to be transitory&mdash;I would like to point out that for practically four-and-a-half years I, as spokesman on education, tried to get the Labour Party sufficiently concerned with education to support me in an attempt to have the grants raised and to support me in an attempt to have the eligibility limits raised.  They had the power and the Government could not do without them.  They had members in the Government but the concern was strangely asleep.  Concern has suddenly been aroused again now when somebody else has the responsibility for administering education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>At least the Labour Party did not try to buy the votes of the young.  It is time Fianna Fáil delivered on what they promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past, when Senator Robinson was here, she was free of whip and there was no resolution on this.  I searched the Seanad records in vain to see if Senator Robinson urged the Government to increase the grants or the eligibility limits but my search was in vain.  What did I do?  I paid 66? per cent more than my predecessor did by way of university grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the eligibility limits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the eligibility limits by 29.5 per cent at the lower level and 21.5 per cent at the higher level.  It is important when people indulge in this <Col N="304" /> pseudo concern to put the record straight.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson asked me to abolish the four honours.  As I have already said, in the technological sector the condition of four honours for the scholarship is not relevant.  Those who get four honours may go there now as a result of this Bill.  In fact, they have been going into the RTCs and into the NIHE already, but they lacked statutory authority.  This is what the Bill is doing, as was pointed out by Senator Murphy and by others in the House.  If, as a result of this debate, there is an emphasis in public on the availability of these scholarships for the RTCs and for the NIHE, the debate here will have been a success.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson made the point that the Government were not committed to education.  I repudiate that statement. Our record speaks for itself.  Every worth-while advance in education has been as a result of a policy decision by Fianna Fáil and the implementation of that decision by a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I challenge the Senator to name any of the advances during the years which were not brought about by a Fianna Fáil Government.  The foundation of the RTCs, after they were recommended by a committee chaired by Senator Mulcahy, the free secondary education, the transport schemes, and so on, are an indication of the Government's commitment to education.  Just by way of a footnote to the statement, which cannot be challenged, that for four-and-a-half years the Labour Party had an opportunity to do something for the grants and the eligibility limits because they were in a position to do so, I should like to point out that the 66? per cent increase at the top&mdash;I paid more than my predecessor paid&mdash;and the raising of eligibility limits, were both done in a position where inflation was decreasing and was much lower than it had been during the period when both these things should have been attended <Col N="305" /> to by any political party that was claiming to have a sensitive social conscience.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy made the point about the possibility of giving income tax relief to people who have to pay their own fees.  That is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  We would all be delighted if he would accept that proposition.  Senator Cassidy feared that our highly developed cheap system could be replaced by a highly developed expensive system.  This was one of the points that Tussing made in his report&mdash;that we had a very elaborate system of education, a very widely and finely developed system, but that we developed it in certain regions, for obvious economic reasons, which did not put the same kind of financial strain on us as will the development of the technological sector in education in the future.  I accept that it is going to be difficult to cope.  I think that hope rather than the caterwaul is important.  We should say the problems will be there to be solved and that we are resolved to solve them.  There is more of a future for that kind of attitude than for the attitude of despair which people sometimes adopt.</P>
      <P>Senator Hussey referred to the restricted access to third-level education and said that we would have to attempt to make third-level education accessible to more people.  I can assure the Senator that this has always been&mdash;I am not saying this chauvinistically, I am prepared to back it up with facts&mdash;the strongest motivation of Fianna Fáil because the support of this party was a populist support.  For that reason, representatives are more than conscious of the particular sector in the economy that is least able to afford third-level education.  Senator Hussey referred to the danger of cynicism and I think she made a real point there.  Before the introduction of the grants scheme it was a cynicism that was corrosive in that some person with a bare matriculation certificate could get university education and someone who happened to be able to scrape together enough money to get a secondary education could not go to the university even though he or she might have five or six honours in the leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> The purpose of the grants and scholarships scheme is to obviate this in so far as that is possible.  I know that the philosophy of the dog is prevalent anyway and always will be prevalent but the kind of cynicism that grows out of that situation should be removed and we will try to ensure that the grants system and the scholarships cover as many as possible of those who have the ability and the intention of availing of third level education.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy rightly said that he got great help from the Union of Students in Ireland when he was Chairman of the National Council for Educational Awards and he also had contacts with them when he was chairing the committee that recommended the foundation of the regional technical colleges.  I find the interest of the USI in the development of third-level education and education in general very helpful, as I also found it when I was Opposition spokesman, and I want to commend them on their researches.  I assure them that in so far as funds may be available&mdash;several Senators referred to the fact that all areas of education demand funds and priorities have to be laid down&mdash;it will be my purpose to increase and improve them.</P>
    <P>I agree with Dr. Hennessy's report as quoted by Senator Mulcahy.  At the moment we are engaged on extending the regional technical colleges and only last Monday I had the privilege of opening a £1 million extension to the regional technical college in Sligo.  We have at planning stage or in execution at the moment extensions to the other regional technical colleges as well.</P>
    <P>Senator West supported Senator Mulcahy in the emphasis on development in the technological sector.  I was very pleased to hear him saying that he was supportive of the independence of other institutions in the third-level.  He said that he might suffer a little, that a few feathers might be shot out of his tail in his own institution for having said it. That makes it all the more pleasing to hear him say it.  He commended the National Council for Educational Awards and he said something about assessment which we all know to be true, <Col N="307" /> that assessment is a very difficult field. He also mentioned how important it was to establish high standards in new areas such as those that are covered by the National Council for Educational Awards and I think that when that Bill comes before the Seanad Senators will see that we have taken care to include external examinations so that those people who have expertise in other countries, in Britain, on the Continent and in the United States, in various fields will be able to monitor our standards here.</P>
    <P>Senator West is going to table some amendments and we will wait until we see them.  He made reference to the dates for application for grants.  In one particular year when in Opposition I got letters from a number of students, particularly from the west, who were late in applying.  It is difficult to administer a scheme if you do not fix a deadline for applications.  It is a great tragedy when somebody who is entitled to and needs a grant is deprived of it because of a late application.  At that time I got one of the popular radio programmes to mention it in August.  That is the vital month and many students go away to work at that time and in this way they can lose out.  It was mentioned on a morning radio programme in the hope that somebody would hear it and alert the students to the deadline.  I notice that in the vocational education committee scholarship scheme there is some discretion given to the authorities to extend the date.  There is no such discretion in our Act.  There is an obligation on the schools to bring this to the attention of their final-year pupils and warn them to apply for grants if they think they are entitled to them even before they leave the schools in June, immediately after they do their leaving certificate, so that this kind of thing will not occur.  It is a great pity that it should occur at all.</P>
    <P>Senator West mentioned a very interesting Scandinavian scheme of repayable grants.  The Higher Education Authority are examining the possibility of a loans scheme at the moment.  I do not know when we will get a report from them.  The idea of providing some service <Col N="308" /> for the State in return is not a bad one. While we do not want to send people to Lapland it would be an interesting kind of thing to experiment with.  I agree with Senator West that not being able to milk a cow should be regarded as a disability.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on the Commission's proposals on the Teaching of Languages in the Community which was laid before the Seanad on 8 November 1978.</P>
    <P>It is interesting and encouraging to find ourselves twice in the same afternoon in the Seanad debating matters relating to education.  We are moving from the very broad and obviously politically engaging, if not dividing, area of how we allocate resources to and how we cope with higher education in a very specific area, and that is the proposal that there be more concentration on the teaching of languages in schools, on the training of teachers, mobility of pupils in the European Community and on the involvement of the Commission's proposals to ensure that the European Community would match with European Community funds what was being done at national level.  The proposal in general terms is to provide 50 per cent of the costs of implementing the various proposals at the European Community level.  I understand that these proposals will be considered by the Council of Ministers for Education at a meeting on 27 November 1978 and for that reason I am particularly pleased that the Minister has chosen to remain in the House for the debate on this report.  I hope that he will be prepared to comment on the report and on any views expressed to him by Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a fair and accurate representation of the views of the sub-committee which considered this proposal that every member of the sub-committee across the political divide felt that for Ireland in particular the teaching of languages, a familiarity with languages and an emphasis on training our teachers of languages is a vital necessity, that it is important to redress the situation in which we find ourselves as an island which already has itself the richness of two languages.  We have our first and second official language in Ireland and we have now, through our membership of the European Community, aligned ourselves with other <Col N="310" /> countries in a situation which is going to require of our people generally, and especially our young people, a familiarity with other European languages.  I suppose this will be specifically and more particularly with French and German in the context of the European Community but also with important languages such as Spanish and other European languages.</P>
    <P>I think the members of the sub-committee felt that the situation was an urgent one.  We should seize the opportunities both at an official and diplomatic level of ensuring that Ireland's interests are represented in the various forums and discussions.  At an economic and commercial level it we are to avail of the export potential and to market our produce, it is important that we be able to argue our corner in these areas and, therefore, advance the economic and social life of our people. The sub-committee responded very positively to the Commission's proposals and the draft of the report by that sub-committee was subsequently endorsed by the full Joint Committee at their meeting on 8 November.</P>
    <P>Basically the outline of the Commission proposals is summarised in section 3 of this report.  The plan suggested by the Commission would be carried out over a period of three years from 1980 to 1983 and would involve an expenditure both by the European Community itself and by member states.  It is proposed that 50 per cent of the costs would be met by the member states and there would be the following elements in this overall plan.  First, the initial training of teachers.  The objective here would be to secure that trainee language teachers would spend a period of study in the country of the language they proposed to teach and that <i>per capita</i> grants would be paid by the Community for this.  There are also proposals relating to the continuing training of teachers, both the provision of long-term interchange of teachers and also medium and short-term teacher exchanges or visits.  There is provision for early foreign language teaching by requiring that the member states appraise the way in which they would introduce more extensive teaching <Col N="311" /> right from the beginning.  The sub-committee had the advantage of a written submission from the INTO favouring the possibility of introducing the teaching of languages more positively at the primary level while bearing in mind that Irish children at the primary level are coping with the two languages of the country.  This should be encouraged and opportunities to do this within the context of additional European Community funding should be availed of.  There are also proposals for greater mobility and exchange of students involving group visits, exchanges of pupils between the ages of 11 and 16, activities during the holiday periods by pupils between 16 and 19 and various private projects in this area, establishing special measures for the teaching of less able pupils and for information and documentation services which would be necessary in order to provide specialised information on foreign language teaching as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>In section 4 of the report the views of the Joint Committee are summarised. The Joint Committee endorse the general approach of the plan but would go further than the Commission's proposals in identifying a number of priorities.  It is stated at paragraph 4: the Joint Committee would add that in the case of Ireland, increasing contacts and trade with the Continent since our accession to the Community has brought with it a clear need for more and more people with a command of Continental languages&rdquo;.  We point out that there has been a comparative neglect in the teaching and expertise in languages in this country and we refer to the unsatisfactory fact that there are no oral tests or examinations for secondary students taking public examinations except in Irish.  The Minister could comment, when he contributes to the discussion on this report, on whether it is the intention to introduce oral examinations for modern languages into our examination system and, if so, in what kind of a time span.  I know this has been discussed before.  It does seem to be a great lack.  It is not possible to really assess the ability of a student without emphasis on an oral <Col N="312" /> examination, and if there is an oral examination it would be of benefit in the approach to the teaching of the language.</P>
    <P>It is stated at paragraph 5 that a community involvement in the teaching of languages would be very much in Ireland's interest because of the necessity to concentrate on building up that kind of resource.  The Joint Committee urges that Ireland should argue a case for getting not a 50 per cent involvement in Community funding in this but a 75 per cent bearing of the cost at the European Community level.  If one looks at the situation here in contrast to other countries, for example, The Netherlands or Belgium, they do not have anything like the same need to stress and to focus on the teaching of languages in schools. We do not have&mdash;and the Minister I am sure knows this more than any of us&mdash;unlimited resources.  We have very limited and highly sought after resources.</P>
    <P>If the European Community is genuinely a Community concerned about the peoples of Europe and about emphasising both their shared identity and the diversity of their cultural identity, a strong case should be made for arguing that an island on the periphery of Europe, which already has two languages of its own native culture, should be able to get special additional funding from the Community to promote the teaching and knowledge of other European languages.</P>
    <P>Another important matter which was brought very forcibly to the attention of the sub-committee by the representative of ASTI who came to a session of the sub-committee was the need to go further than just providing certain courses for teachers involved in modern language training and to provide a genuine free movement of teachers.  It was emphasised that this could be of considerable benefit to teachers from here who wished to teach English as a foreign language in other European Community countries.  They would have the benefit of the fact that English was one of their native languages and they should be able to travel freely under the provisions for free movement and right <Col N="313" /> of establishment and teach English in other countries if they wished to do so as a career.  They should not have, as they do at the moment, to go through an examination system and qualify under the particular provisions for the qualification of teachers of English in that other country under the French or German system or whatever.  It would be interesting to hear the views of the Minister as to whether there are active steps to promote free movement of language teachers, because this would be a career possibility and an advantage for Irish teachers who might wish to pursue that career in the European Community.</P>
    <P>That summarises the main focus of the report and the matters which the Joint Committee wished to bring to the attention of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney referred to the question of whether this was a priority in the ordering of business.  When the European Community is involving itself financially in an area like education, even if it is a very specific area which may not be an urgent social priority in a general context, it is of immense value to Ireland to seize the opportunity with both hands, to welcome the European Community involvement and to call down the additional funding while making a case for more than 50 per cent involvement so that the teaching of languages here can get the necessary boost, emphasis and focus that will bring us more into line with the other countries of the European Community.  The United Kingdom is, at least in general terms, more on the same level as we are in the approach to the command by children, young people and adults of a second or third European language.  The subject matter is precise but it has a political relevance in that it was understood by the members of the Joint Committee that it would be discussed at a meeting of the Council of Ministers for Education on 27 November.  I commend this report to the House and I look forward to hearing the views of other Senators and of the Minister if he wishes to contribute to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to second this motion which has been dealt with so <Col N="314" /> well by Senator Robinson.  I will not add very much to it.  The Minister, with his wide competence in languages, is I am sure well aware of the handicaps of those people that are not so gifted or indeed so lucky as to be able to communicate with other people in modern European languages other than Irish.</P>
      <P>The Minister is also, I am sure, very much aware that the private conversations which take place after the public debates have been finished with the aid of simultaneous translations are often as important if not more important than those public debates.  Irish people, particularly Irishmen, suffer a great handicap in this area.  It is a source of shame that so many Irish people representing this country cannot communicate except in English, because so few of our European partners can speak Irish.  They only have one language to speak to them in. It is a severe handicap and, historically for some reason, boys are more severely handicapped than girls in this respect. Yet it is men who are going abroad and hold senior positions in our diplomatic missions, political missions and in the institutions of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I thought there was an improvement in the learning of languages by boys and girls I would not be so concerned. I have the figures for boys and girls studying French and German in the 1976-77 academic year for the leaving certificate course.  There were 27,500 girls taking French and 16,000 boys taking French&mdash;nearly twice as many girls. There were 2,243 girls taking German and 700 boys taking German, which is a remarkable figure considering that German is widely regarded as being one of the principal languages of technology and is very important to a great many people studying in that area. 1.89 per cent of all boys taking the leaving certificate are studying German and 45 per cent of all the boys are studying French as opposed to a figure for both boys and girls of about 97 per cent taking Irish.  There is something very wrong there.  An examination needs to be made by the Department of Education to draw up plans in order to take advantage of the European Commission's interest in this subject.  Ireland is a <Col N="315" /> special case and needs special attention. It will not get that special attention unless we are prepared to present our plans before the people who have the giving of the funds, as one might say.</P>
    <P>I notice among my own children and among the children of people I know, that the language is still largely being taught by the old fashioned written method to children of 11, 12 and 13 who are starting at secondary level.  I am sure the Minister is at least as aware, if not more so, than I am, that it is a totally wrong approach to a modern continental language to begin by teaching it in the written form.  Children should learn these languages for at least two years before they see anything written down. Audio-visual equipment costs money. We are back to the money again, but now that Europe has evinced interest in this subject let us take them up on it quickly.  It is a matter of urgency and of concern.  This country has a lot of prestige in many areas but we are very badly off as regards the learning of languages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of speaking to this motion also.  We all know that the people who go to Europe to sell our wares and make sure that we capture the right amount of world trade are handicapped because they are not able to deal in the nuances of language which are necessary when it comes to selling a product.  The figures that Senator Hussey has just quoted are rather frightening.  I knew they were bad but I did not realise that they were quite that bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our research in the Irish Management Institute some time ago showed a terribly bad state of affairs in relation to the ability of businessmen to speak a modern continental language.  We, in the institute, have provided a service to try and have crash courses and total immersion courses to try and catch up with the situation.  I am glad to say that a lot of success has been achieved.  I took part in the discussions in the Joint Committee on EEC Legislation.  I was very pleased to see the EEC were going to give some help.  Help means cash.  We were talking <Col N="316" /> about cash earlier tonight.  I wonder whether some co-ordination of the effort is not required.  It really does need crash action.  Perhaps the Minister for Education, who has a great interest in language, might give time to thinking about some crash action on this that would co-ordinate efforts in places like the various language institutes that are doing good work which, perhaps, could be improved and make sure that any funds that are available are used.  When we are taking a later motion on the Order Paper I will be pointing out that, on many occasions, there are scholarships available from the EEC and they are not even known about.  I hope that this money will be used.</P>
    <P>While I was pleased to have Senator Hussey give me some information that I find useful if dismaying, I am worried about her comment on the Irish language.  We are old friends on this but I never let her get away with any implication that the Irish language or its study is going to be downgraded in favour of a continental language.  They must all go together.  As Senator Robinson said, and I agree totally with her on this, we already have the richness of a bi-lingual system.  We are not a nation of monoglots like our neighbours. Research has shown that it is easier to pick up a third language once one has broken out of the system of the monoglot into two languages.  I hope the Senator did not mean that, because the teaching of language, whether it is the Irish, German, French or any other continental language, is something that we have to give more attention to.  We have an Institiúid Teangeolaíochta, which operates in association with the Minister's Department.  There they do studies in this area.  Maybe they might be the people who would provide the co-ordination I am speaking about.</P>
    <P>It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak in public in support of this EEC move, and I hope that the Minister and the Department will take every advantage of it.</P>

      <P>I commend the work which the sub-committees formed from the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation are doing.  I have had the opportunity on a few occasions of attending meetings which members of the European Parliament are entitled to attend. I am very much impressed by the work which they are doing in examining reports and legislation coming from the Commission.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to take a serious look at the prospect of introducing a third language at some stage in the primary school system.  Judging by the European performance, I do not see this as in any way being inhibitive or as in any way affecting the two languages that are taught in our primary schools.  Looking ahead into the future and into our greater involvement as one of the European nations I see the acquisition of at least one Community language as becoming of greater and greater importance in the future.  The right place to begin is in our primary schools.</P>
      <P>The whole area of language learning has been undergoing change in the past ten years or so.  Today young people are getting an opportunity to expand their communicational and mental horizons in ways that were not open a generation ago except perhaps to the elite&mdash;the minority who had better opportunities. Indeed, one can be somewhat envious today of the opportunities which young people have and will be having from now on in relation to our involvement in Europe.</P>
      <P>I welcome the many points raised by the committee in this report.  I will not go over them again.  I welcome the possibility of expanding the teaching of language with the assistance of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the opportunity during the summer of spending ten days at an audio-visual centre in north-west France, and I found it a very useful and interesting experience. It is partly subsidised by the French Government and also by the Community.  There were students there <Col N="318" /> from all the European countries and countries outside the Community.</P>
    <P>The ideas set out here are excellent.  I cannot think of any way of improving on them.  The suggestions of the exchange of students, of arranging group visits between the ages of 11 and 16 and arranging exchange holidays between 16 and 19 are excellent ideas.  I am glad to note in the report that the problems of less able pupils are not neglected, including the idea of teaching children of migrant workers in schools where there is more than one language taught.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of it which I welcome is the stress on free movement.  The Minister might break with some of the rules and regulations that constrain his Department by considering the idea suggested in the report of arranging for the free exchange of teachers for periods without loss on an exchange basis in teaching the language of their own country in another country.  This is something new that is being talked about.  It is part of the new horizon which is opening up before us in our involvement in Europe.  I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I commend to the Minister the report from the Joint Committee and hope he will be able to give consideration to the many suggestions in it.  We must avail, so far as we can, of the opportunities for using the funds for the educational system that become available from the Community as put forward in the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what has already been said.  It can be embarrassing for people going to Europe to have to rely on their counterparts to be able to speak English so that they can carry out their business.  When I was in national school, before Irish was compulsory, we had three languages, Irish, English and Latin.  If that is still the case one could drop Latin and substitute a modern language.  I often wonder why doctors still have to learn Latin.  The time to teach a language is when a child is very young.  The way to teach it is orally.  The scheme to interchange teachers is a very good scheme, but if we are to wait until the teachers interchange to be able to teach the language then it is going to be a long time before we get off the ground. <Col N="319" /> If any scheme is going to be put forward I suggest it should start with the young child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Robinson and Hussey for asking us to take note of the report of the Joint Committee and for requesting the debate.  It is only by debating the reports that we show our appreciation of them and put ourselves in the way of benefiting from them.</P>
      <P>As one of the people who formed the AEDE in the early sixties, the European Association of Teachers, to prepare us for entry to the European Economic Community, I am more than disappointed with the place that education has got in the European Economic Community. In fact, it has not made any significant impact in the Community since the Community was established. Perhaps we were too idealistic in the AEDE when we established it.  The Economics Ministry has taken it over and I regret to say that the meeting of the Council of Ministers of Education scheduled for next Monday has been either totally abandoned or postponed.  I do not know why.  I was informed today. I will not say what I suspect.  It is of a pattern with the grave letdown that education and educationalists have suffered from the EEC.  I feel very strongly about it.  I had intended to tell that to the meeting in Brussels.  They did not deliver in any significant way in education.  Admittedly the social fund has supplied us with very useful money to spend in the regional technical colleges on the training of young people.  They are very careful to avoid the word &ldquo;education&rdquo;.  It is a dirty word.  It bears out what I say. that they are not as interested as they should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had an idea that, purely for information, there could be, for example, a Leabhar na hEuropa or a Libre European in which all nine countries would feature with a brief <i>resumé</i> of their history, cultural traditions, literary history, economy, population and so on. All the pupils in the nine countries would study that book.  There would then be a common field of knowledge of Europe <Col N="320" /> among young people.  We could relate it to this report in that a student who had studied and mastered it in his own language could get the French version, the German version, the Italian version and so on and in this way advance his or her knowledge of the language.</P>
    <P>The basis for hope that the report gave&mdash;that we would be in a position to have a scheme, 50 per cent or hopefully more as Senator Robinson said, available to us&mdash;is delayed if not abandoned.  I am not sure what the reason is for the abandonment of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, but it is not a hopeful sign and I am not too sanguine about the recommendations ever being made effective.  The draft resolution proposed by the Education Committee for adoption by the Ministers at a meeting which will not now take place on Monday suggests that member states should take the following measures: examine ways and means of ensuring that future form teachers spend a period of study and preparation in a country where the language they intend to teach is spoken.  That decision could only be taken by the Ministers.  It will not be taken on Monday but I am in agreement with it: to examine ways and means, including the negotiation of new bilateral agreements, for ensuring that practising teachers of foreign languages will have the opportunity to spend officially recognised periods of refreshment and training in a country where their target language is spoken&mdash;I wonder is it the best translation of whatever was the original.  Senator Robinson referred to this when introducing the report and I am in agreement with it.  It goes on to say: increase the opportunities to perfect one or, where possible, two Community languages during the final years at school and/or during vocational training.</P>
    <P>I will take the comments of Senators and make some comments of my own.  I agree with Senator Robinson that Ireland is a particular case.  It is on the periphery of Europe and we do need a very strong movement in the teaching of modern languages.  We have two official languages, as she rightly pointed out, <Col N="321" /> and she urged that we take steps to improve the position of the other continental languages.  I am very glad that she mentioned Spanish as well, which possibly will be an official language of the Community, is not one at present but is spoken over a very wide area of the world.</P>
    <P>The idea of introducing a third language at primary level is an interesting one.  It would have to be done with great skill.  I would say that the flexibility the new curriculum gives would be a help in this regard.  The possibility should be explored.  The one thing that I would fear would be an attempt to over-achieve, to bring too much pressure with three languages and the other wide areas being studied now in the new curriculum at primary level.  In many preparatory schools the modern language, or classical language, is introduced before the period covered by the primary group has ended.  It will be interesting and we will have a look at it anyway.</P>
    <P>On the question of orals, I am totally committed to introducing some form of oral test on at least an experimental basis as soon as possible.  As Senator Robinson said, an attempt has been made before and has been under discussion for a long time.  There have been difficulties, there still are difficulties.  It is to me totally ridiculous to have heavy concentration on the writing and reading of a modern continental language to the exclusion of oral expression.  I am not saying that the good teacher in the class cannot do it as it is.  But Senator Robinson rightly pointed out that if an oral examination existed it would focus attention on it.  I have not great belief in any form of examination except that you have an objective.  If you have an objective, as you will have in an oral test, of developing facility in the use of the language, then the oral is highly desirable.  I will read some detail of what I intend to do later on when I get through the remarks made by Senators up to now.</P>
    <P>It is news to me that Irish teachers have to do some kind of an examination in order to be allowed to teach English in some of the continental countries.  I am <Col N="322" /> just wondering if it were challenged under the free movement and right of establishment clauses it would hold up in, say, a court.  But then we do not want to have to involve ourselves in that type of thing for every teacher who goes out to the Continent.  I do not know what is the argument behind that.  Again it is a little bit of a derogation from the spirit of the Treaty of Rome which guarantees freedom of movement and right of establishment.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey talked about the situation&mdash;which was a factual situation&mdash;that the boys in this regard are more handicapped than girls, and have been traditionally, in the Irish education system.  John Milton got his daughters to read Italian to him but never taught them Italian, on the basis that one tongue was enough for any woman.  With such an intelligent man using language like that it is no wonder a women's liberalisation movement had to develop.  The boys were more handicapped because they concentrated more on the classical languages, particularly Greek, and the girls generally took French.  I have some statistics which I will give the House in a moment about the present position.  I think Senator Mulcahy has made the comment that I would make: I regard it as a great shame that 98 per cent only are doing the Irish language; I would think that the other 2 per cent should also be doing it.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey mentioned the importance of methodology.  Great strides have been made in the matter of methods of teaching modern languages. Senator Brugha mentioned that he had been on a ten-day audio visual course somewhere in France which was subsidised by the French Government.  If it was the type of course that they did develop there one would want to be very physically fit to come through.  I am sure that Senator Brugha is physically fit, but it is a very severe immersion course which has been developed mainly since the last war, mainly for purely practical purposes to enable students, particularly from the United States, to study in French universities.  The whole scientific study of audio-visual teaching of modern languages began from a practical <Col N="323" /> necessity.  Certainly great strides have been made.  In this country those teachers who have used it to teach the Irish language have been singularly successful.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy emphasised what is obvious to all of us, the economic necessity of competence in the languages of the Community: the businessman who is trying to sell, who is trying to manipulate, trying to wangle a deal, if you like to put it that way, is severely handicapped if he has to do it through an intermediary or if he only poorly understands the language.  The obligation is on us not merely to provide for more teaching, more oral teaching particularly, of the modern languages in the normal school periods but also for specialists, for engineers, businessmen, scientists, people who will need it increasingly in the future.  I think the Institiúid Teangeolíochta has done work already on the oral examination and the results of their work and research are available to me.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha advocated the introduction of the other language in the primary school.  The idea is an interesting one.  It would have to be done with great skill.  We would have to have plenty of courses for the teachers.  I think it would have to be done piecemeal; it would have to be done experimentally first and develop from there.</P>
    <P>I just want to give the House some of the facts on languages in our schools at present.  The question of the teaching of the languages may be considered from the quantitative point of view which was referred to by Senator Hussey when she mentioned German.  Also we can consider it under the headings of balance and quality.  The quantitative aspect of modern language teaching is readily studied from the statistical records of my Department.  Here they are; they will be interesting for the House.  Taking 1967 as a base year, we find that from a total of 13,590 candidates at the leaving certificate examination there were 6,635 entries for examination in the continental languages, French, Spanish, German and Italian.  As only relatively few students <Col N="324" /> present more than one continental language it is reasonable to give this figure as 48.8 per cent of total entry for the purpose of establishing a trend.  The comparative figures for the leaving certificate of 1978 were 35,000, 25,174 taking one of those languages and 70.3 per cent respectively.  In 1967, of 21,822 candidates for the intermediate certificate there were 11,492 entries for continental languages giving a percentage of 52.7.  The corresponding figures for 1978 were 49,423, 40,119 and 81.2 per cent.  So there is a significant change quantitatively.</P>
    <P>I have here a statistical table which will be available to Senators showing those statistics under those three headings for the years from 1967 to 1978.  This table and the figures I have quoted show very clearly that there has been an extraordinary response from the school system in terms of increasing opportunities for the learning of continental languages.</P>
    <P>As well as a significant increase in the numbers studying continental languages at the universities there has been a marked demand for language study in conjunction with the study of nonliterary subjects.  This trend is particularly evident in the colleges of technology and the regional technical colleges. There is little need for me to stress, as has been stressed by Senator Mulcahy already, the extent to which the study of continental languages has been a growing trend in the adult education sector as evidenced by increasing demands for extra-mural courses for business people and so on, evening courses run by vocational committees.  The services of the cultural institutes are very important and they are doing very effective work in this field.  All of this is not to say that I am complacent&mdash;and one cannot be complacent about the general position&mdash;far from it.  But I am satisfied that the trend is strong, that we are playing with the wind, so to speak.  I would hope to do all I can to meet the demands of the schools and of the public generally in this respect in the institutions for which I am responsible.</P>
    <P>I mentioned also balance and quality. At the outset I indicated that French had <Col N="325" /> a strong position, particularly in girls' schools.  This was mentioned by a number of Senators.  They had this long before the matter we are now discussing became a matter of public debate.  In the 1978 leaving certificate while some 21,668 candidates sat for examination in French the entries for German, Spanish and Italian were 1,498 for German, 1,817 for Spanish and 191 only for Italian.  For the intermediate certificate this year there were 34,000 entries for French, 3,204 for German&mdash;which really covers the pattern for two years with a little loss&mdash;2,595 for Spanish and 301 for Italian.  These figures illustrate very clearly the prominence of French among the continental languages in our educational system.  While in no way wishing to diminish the popularity of French it is very clear that special attention should be given to the development of the other Community languages.  I should like also to advert to the question of quality.  There are many factors that go towards making up the quality of language learning.  Foremost among these are the objectives of the teaching given in schools and the influence which public examinations exert on these objectives. The emphasis on listening, comprehension and oral skills in continental languages has been reflected in the nature of the methodology programmes offered to teachers on an in-service basis for more than a decade, and the response of language teachers to such programmes has been very heartening indeed.  It would not be an over-estima-tion to claim that upwards of 1,000 teachers have benefited from such in-service training courses.  An alternative examination in French at the intermediate certificate level was introduced in 1972 for the purpose of stimulating listening comprehension and oral skill, the two things that an oral examination would test as important features of language learning at this level.</P>
    <P>For a variety of reasons, which I do not propose to go into now, the introduction of oral and listening comprehension components into the leaving certificate examination has been too long delayed.  I intimated at the Congress of <Col N="326" /> the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland in Sligo this year that I was having proposals on this matter worked out in my Department.  It would be my intention to have an oral/listening comprehension examination in French available on a voluntary basis to leaving certificate candidates in the first instance. This would be followed by a similar facility to students in the other continental languages.  Students who took these examinations would be credited with a separate extra grade in their leaving certificate results.  After due consultation with school authorities and an adequate period of notice these arrangements would be introduced as an essential part of the examinations in continental languages at the leaving certificate level and the examination results would be issued as a single grade incorporating the written, oral and listening comprehension components of the examination. This matter is still under consideration and I hope to expedite the study of it as much as possible.  How am I for time, a Chathaoirleach?</P>

      <P>I will conclude.  The initial and continued training of teachers is very important also.  It is especially important here because we have not the opportunity&mdash;this has been mentioned also by Senators&mdash;of conversational practice. We are on the periphery&mdash;the word used&mdash;of Europe.  This is so but, of course, with all the means of communication we have nowadays it is somewhat easier than it used to be, particularly with the tapes, discs, radio programmes and so on made available to people.  While the efforts to provide practice and familiarity have been considerable, particularly in the case of French&mdash;under the auspices of the Franco-Irish cultural agreement&mdash; through such mechanisms as teacher exchange and the provision of long, and shorter-term scholarships to courses in the country of the target language, a policy for the development of oral skills <Col N="327" /> and the promotion of a balance of continental languages in our schools add new urgency to the improvement and extension of such mechanisms.  At the student level the &ldquo;assistants&rdquo; scheme which operates in respect of French and to a lesser extent German supplies opportunity to our students to engage in conversation classes with native speakers from the country of the language they are studying, as well as supplying Irish undergraduates, potential teachers of the future, with the opportunity of living, working and studying in France or in Germany.  In the present year there are 36 French and four German &ldquo;assistants&rdquo; in Ireland and 36 Irish &ldquo;assistants&rdquo; in France.</P>
      <P>It is in the context of this background of activity, its achievements as well as its problems, that I welcome this debate on the Joint Committee Report and I look forward to hearing the various views.  I have heard quite a few already on this very important topic, which interests me personally and has done for a considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by thanking Senators on both sides of the House and the Minister for the welcome given to this report from the Joint Committee and to the strong endorsement of the priority felt by the sub-committee which originally drafted the report and by members of the Joint Committee; the emphasis that we need to give to improving the teaching of languages in Irish schools, to improving the training and mobility of teachers, the mobility of students, the backlog we have to catch up on in trying to ensure that modern European languages are well taught and learned by young people here in order that we may ensure, in governmental, administrative, business and personal contacts, that we advance our priorities as a people, particularly in the context of the European Community, but generally in a cultural context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been adequate opportunity to discuss the proposals of the report and I do not intend to reply at any great length but merely to make a number of <Col N="328" /> specific points.  Obviously it is disappointing that the Council of Ministers for Education has either been postponed or abandoned&mdash;the Minister did not seem to be quite clear which it is.  This reinforces the comment he made, with which I agree, that education has not been treated seriously in the context of the European Community.  To that extent it is perhaps still too much a European Community and it has not succeeded in giving itself that human face which was so much part of the underlying commitment of the Paris Summit in 1972.  I would turn the subject around on the Minister a little because we are coming rapidly towards the next period when Ireland will be chairing the Council of Ministers, as of next July.  It will be an extremely important time because this will be the first six months of a directly elected European Parliament.  At that point the Minister will be President of the Council of Ministers of Education. He will be able to take initiatives in relation to the importance placed by the European Community on the subject of education, on the kinds of proposals which are being discussed here this afternoon. In view of a very strong personal commitment to the subject and in view of the opinions which have been expressed on both sides of the House here about the importance of the knowledge of and teaching of modern languages in the Irish context, I hope the Minister will seize the opportunity and take any initiatives he can to focus attention, at European level, to support the Commission in its proposals and to involve the directly-elected European Parliament in these proposals.  I am sure Senator Brugha would play his part in that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope all the Ministers will be so committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the presidency is to allow each country to establish certain priorities and initiatives. I do not underestimate some of the difficulties of getting commitments from other member states.  The ball is at our feet for those six months.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will be able to focus for the first time the attention of the Community on the importance of education <Col N="329" /> and on the importance of taking these kinds of initiatives at the European Community level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the members of the Joint Committee has, I think, been achieved.  Members of the Joint Committee feel that when a report has a particular relevance to this country&mdash;even if it is a specific matter&mdash;the report should be debated in either or in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  A number of us on the Joint Committee feel that the Seanad has a particular role to play in providing time for debates on the particular subjects, therefore giving them an emphasis and a priority.  Otherwise the Joint Committee would just continue to compile and publish these reports but they would not get the attention of politicians generally, of the relevant Minister and of his advisers.  To that extent since we are a Joint Committee which is established to report to both Houses it is very encouraging that the Seanad is prepared to give time for debates where they are called for.  I hope this practice will continue and that the Seanad will renew the <Col N="330" /> necessary amendment of its Standing Orders to allow it to continue to debate reports of this sort.</P>
    <P>Once again, I thank Members of the House and the Minister for their contributions. I am glad that they gave a welcome to the contents of the report.</P>
