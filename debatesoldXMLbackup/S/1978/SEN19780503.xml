      <P>I have notice from Senator West that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House this evening, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The practice by which inspectors' reports on planning matters where there is an appeal are unavailable for inspection by interested parties without recourse to the courts.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, in the period ending 31 December 1978, notwithstanding anything contained in Standing Orders and unless the Seanad shall otherwise order, if the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities lays before the Seanad a report containing a request for a debate thereon in the Seanad, one hour and a half shall be set aside for debate on a motion.  That the Seanad take note of such report, on the first day on which the Seanad shall sit after</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1002" /> (a)  six clear days have elapsed since the report was laid before the Seanad, and</P>
    <P>(b)  due notice of the motion has been received by the Clerk from a Member nominated by the Joint Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I particularly welcome this motion proposed by Senator Ryan that the Seanad introduce an automatic system for debating the reports of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities if the members of that Committee have requested a debate. During the time of the previous Joint Committee the members of that Committee assessed the performance of that Committee and published a report in which they criticised the fact that none of the reports which had been submitted by the Committee was debated in either House of the Oireachtas.  They considered this to be a very substantial democratic failure because they were a Joint Committee whose function it was to report to both Houses, drawing their attention to draft regulations and directives.  The Committee concluded, unanimously I think, that unless there was some automatic provision for debate of the reports of the Joint Committee when the Joint Committee itself felt that the matter was important, it would be very difficult to have regular debates on the floor of either the Dáil or Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason why I welcome this amendment of our Standing Orders, so that we allow an hour and a half for debate of a report and provided six days' notice has been given, that we provide time on the next sitting day of the Seanad, is that this is an initiative by the Seanad.  To the best of my knowledge the Dáil has not as yet finally considered the matter in its Committee on Procedure and Privileges and has not made any recommendation. So, to those who think that the Seanad is incapable of taking initiative, this is a good example of a step taken by the Seanad which will enable us automatically to debate the more important reports of the Joint Committee.  Because of the extended terms of reference of the Joint Committee there will be, during the course of the year, several <Col N="1003" /> very important reports which will come up for debate.  I am very glad that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has recommended it and that the Leader of the House has moved this motion.  I give it my wholehearted support.</P>

      <P>I would merely like to make one point in regard to this motion.  It is in regard to the time limit of one and a half hours.  Why should we arbitrarily cut off the time?  Do we have the option, when discussing some of these reports, to extend the time limit?</P>

      <P>I think if a particularly important report was coming before the House, the House, before discussing it, could agree to take a longer time.  It would be a matter for an <i>ad hoc</i> decision in relation to a particular report.</P>

      <P>As a preliminary point, while personally welcoming the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs here, it is disappointing that there is yet another change of pilot for this Bill.  The Minister of State was here for the Second Stage and he gave his views on it.  We then had a different representative of the Government here for Committee Stage.  As the House knows, Committee Stage is a detailed Stage and there is a lot of detailed argument and detailed discussion. In the course of that, the Minister for Fisheries indicated his <Col N="1004" /> willingness to consider certain matters for Report Stage.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State here now had the benefit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Senator that he should speak on the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take what the Cathaoirleach says but if the debate on the amendments is to be as full a debate as this House would wish it to be, the Government should pay the House the minimum of respect of ensuring that detailed matters are processed through the House by one Minister and that we do not have sent to the House whichever member of the Government happens to be available and willing to come.  It is not good enough for the Government to treat the House in that way.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 20 after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other than a lease made pursuant to a contract entered into before the passing of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is in relation to section 2.  Section 2 says that a lease of land made after the passage of the Bill shall be void if the lessee would, apart from this section, have the right under section 3, to enlarge its interests into a fee simple.  In effect this is the kernal of the Bill.  This is the provision that restricts the creation of future ground rents.</P>
      <P>Our amendment is designed to insert the words &ldquo;other than a lease made pursuant to a contract entered into before the passing of this Act&rdquo;.  In the absence of these words there could be a certain number of parties prejudiced, through no fault of their own, by the passing of this Bill.  They would be in a transitory position in regard to their title.  They would have entered into a contract to purchase a site.  The contract would have provided that the sale would be by way of lease.  In the meantime, the Bill would pass and after its passage the lease, as I read the Section, would be void and the person would not be able to avail of the provisions under subsection (4) and consequently would be prejudiced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that this amendment, <Col N="1005" /> having transitory effect and essentially having only a temporary life until such time as any such contracts have been exhausted, is desirable, and it protects certain members of the community who might find themselves in this position. It does not infringe or in any way act detrimentally to the principle that is being achieved by subsection (1) of section 2.  We had the arguments at length on Committee Stage and it is my recollection that the Minister agreed to look at it before Report Stage.  I am trying to get the reference in the Official Report.  It was at column 882 of the Report of 19 April.  The Minister said that he would look into this question before Report Stage and it might be possible on the basis of a time limitation.  He was worried about writing in something that would last for ever and he thought it might be possible to write in protection for a party who would enter into a contract but to put a time limit on that protection so as to compel these parties to complete the contract expeditiously and of course tidy up the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment.  There is a very common commercial transaction when people are purchasing houses that they enter into a contract to get a lease and at the same time enter into a building contract with a builder and there is the danger that they could have a contract for the lease that might be unenforceable because of the provisions of this Bill and have a building agreement that is quite enforceable.  I do not think that it can happen in many instances because, as the Minister for Fisheries who took the Committee Stage of the Bill in the Seanad mentioned, people will know the law and will take precautions. I think that if there is any danger of anybody being put in a prejudiced position because of the passage of this Bill and we have a way of getting out of it&mdash;which we would have with this amendment&mdash;we should take it.  I support the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>To reply to Senator Cooney's observations in the first instance in connection with the availability or non-availability <Col N="1006" /> of Ministers and so on, it is a matter of fact that the Minister for Justice himself is taking parliamentary questions in the Dáil this moment, possibly.  As Senator Cooney said, I took the Second Stage of the Bill before us but unfortunately I could not take the Committee Stage because I was out of the country at a Council of Ministers' meeting.  We did undoubtedly try to preserve the continuity of the presence of the individual who took the Bill from beginning to end and I am now back here to give effect to that attempted continuity.</P>
      <P>If it is of any consolation to Senator Cooney and, indeed, Senator Molony who made all the running on Committee Stage, I would like to say to them that I made it my business to consult with the Minister for Fisheries and the Minister for Justice and I also consulted the Official Report of the Seanad on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  So, as far as that is concerned, I do not think it will prejudice the contents of the debate as such.  I also feel, and I am sure the Seanad will agree with me, that they had a very full and long discussion on Committee Stage. In all the circumstances they have had their day in every respect.</P>
      <P>To reply specifically to the points made and to give effect to the undertaking given by the Minister for Fisheries, Deputy Lenihan, that he would scrutinise in depth the points raised on Committee Stage in relation to this amendment, I understand the amendment here on Report Stage is similar to that of the amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the Bill, its purpose is to prohibit the creation of future ground rents on ordinary dwelling houses.  The Bill proposes to do this by making void any future attempted lease of such a dwelling that would create a ground rent, apart from renewals of existing ground leases.  I think that is a fair point to put in. The amendment seeks to validate such leases provided a contract for the leases has been entered into before&mdash;I think this is the point the Senators might consider&mdash;the Bill has become law.  As I understand it, reading the Reports and consulting with the Minister <Col N="1007" /> for Fisheries, the main burden of the argument on Committee Stage was that at the time the Bill becomes law some unknown number of persons will have contracted to take such ground leases but will not actually have taken them.</P>
    <P>If section 2 (1) as presently set out in the Bill before us stands part of the Bill as enacted into law, such a person, my advice is, will have a contract for a void lease&mdash;a nullity&mdash;and such a contract is probably&mdash;subject to the lawyers and others&mdash;unenforceable.  On the other hand, that person has already paid the builder and the builder may, after the Bill has become law, demand a large extra payment for the grant of the fee simple of the property or indeed he might ask that the site be returned to him.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary to repeat, as I said in the course of the previous debate on this Bill, that no ground rent lease of a dwelling-house made after this Bill has become law can be recognised and valid.  Having studied this, apart altogether from it being a matter of law, logic can come into it. This is why I understand that the Senator's amendment should fall in the circumstances.  What we want to do is to give this Bill certainty.  I know that there may be a certain amount of uncertainty: you can say that and I can say what we want to do is to give it this absolute certainty.  We believe that the section as presently drafted will give it certainty for all time.  I can only offer that as my opinion&mdash; Having offered it as my opinion I have no doubt that if one had the money and so on one could go to another lawyer and get a different opinion&mdash; but I expect that is what the law is about.</P>
    <P>However, to admit of exceptions would make for uncertainties, as I have already said, in the future, perhaps the distant future, as to whether some unknown number of ground leases were valid.  Every person concerned has been on notice for a considerable period of time that ground rents on dwelling houses are being abolished and, indeed, on the practicable level, ordinary home purchasers <Col N="1008" /> are unlikely to have been able to arrange loan finance, even bridging finance, unless firm arrangements have also been made to complete any intended lease before this Bill has become law.</P>
    <P>Again, as I understand it, and my advice is that the Incorporated Law Society and solicitors representing lending institutions were made fully aware that once the Bill becomes law no ground lease of a dwelling can be made and the law society indicated that it was advising its members to that effect. I accept that it is not a very strong point in the overall argument, but the practitioners themselves have been advised by their law society, by their own institution, about the realities of the Bill when it becomes law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about existing contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I appreciate that point but what I am speaking about is certainty.  What I am speaking about is notice.  What I am speaking about is the fact that this Bill may come into law in two or three months' time.  I am not quite certain in that respect. I do not know what the final programme for the Bill is in the context of putting it on to the Statute Book but I think that if we go back to what Senator Molony is looking for in the meantime&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would imagine in a couple of weeks' time.  Will it not become law when it is signed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, a couple of weeks' time.  Let us look back and see how long it has been in existence, how long we have been dealing with it.  As I say, it is not a very strong point and I am not making it to any great extent.  However, the need to establish a clear watershed in conveyancing practices is such that were the date of enactment into law of this Bill not to be a cut-off date for all ground leases of dwelling houses, it would be better to postpone the operation of the new Act altogether. But, again, if we were to postpone the Act, of course, we would have been wasting our time for months past. <Col N="1009" /> Consequently, in all the circumstances, a postponement is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>On a final point&mdash;again a point which was made on Committee Stage &mdash;it does remain the case that any person who has given consideration for a lease that is void under section 2 (1) is in section 2 (4) of the Bill before us being given the right to acquire the fee simple at the expense of the purported lessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  I think that it is not impossible that this right might extend to a person whose consideration for the lease has been paid on foot of a contract for that lease.  That is not an unacceptable proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the position under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how an action to enforce a contract for the consideration implied could be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are saying is that in other words it is not to be taken for granted that such a person is at the mercy of the builder and I think that is basically the main burden of the Senator's argument, that in some way this individual would be at the mercy of the builder.  I think that is what has been suggested.  We do not accept that.</P>
      <P>I realise that the amendment has been put down by two Senators who are dealing with leases on a day-to-day basis and I realise that it was put down with the feeling that it would protect what the Senators consider to be an imperfect instrument.  I realise all that and that it was put down, as they see it, to improve the legislation but what we want to do, and what the Minister for Justice wants to do, is to give a certainty to the legislation, to make it absolutely watertight within the ability of the draftsmen, the ability of the legal advisers and so on.  That is what we are offering to the House.  We are offering what we consider to be a perfect piece of legislation and while I realise that the amendment was put down with all sincerity, I fear that in all the circumstances, it is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most disappointed that the Minister in effect accepts the <Col N="1010" /> validity of our arguments but refuses to give pupose to its acceptance by agreeing to the amendment being made. He accepts that an injustice can arise for a person who has entered into a contract, before the passing of the Act, to take a lease, who may have made certain commitments and engaged in certain financial arrangements and finds then by virtue of the new law that all those arrangements have to be forgotten and finds himself in a position where he cannot complete the title to his plot and cannot build his house.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his reply accepts that that will be the position, that A makes a contract with B to give a lease to B of the site for a house.  Before the actual lease is granted this Bill becomes law. A can then say to B: &ldquo;I will not give you the fee simple; my contract with you is to give you a lease.&rdquo;  Or he can tell B: &ldquo;I will give you a lease&rdquo; but, by virtue of the Bill we are enacting that lease is void and he is left with no title to his site.  That is the position that that person will be in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, under the Bill, B has a remedy against A and he can cure that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>B has no remedy against A because the consideration has been rendered void by virtue of this Bill.  He has no action against A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>If we do not take the amendment into account and we take the Bill as it stands, in those circumstances B has a remedy against A and he can convert what purports to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>He cannot convert anything until he gets the lease and he cannot compel A to give him a lease after the passing of the Act on foot of a contract made before the Act because at that stage that contract will in fact be void by virtue of the Act.  It would be unenforceable.  There will be no consideration.  Consideration will have failed.  There will be all sorts of technical contractive reasons under the law of contract whereby he cannot make A give him a contract.  If he could, that would be fine because he could then use his powers under subsection <Col N="1011" /> (4) and he could convert it into a fee simple.  But he cannot do that and that is why we feel that B is going to be most seriously prejudiced if his builder changes his mind and reckons that he was given the lease on too favourable terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The best solicitor in the world would not help him there because he has a perfectly valid contract and we are going to change the legal status of the parties <i>vis-á-vis</i> each other by virtue of this Bill.  The builder might say: &ldquo;This is my chance to get back this site.  It is more valuable back with me for further development elsewhere.&rdquo;  By virtue of this Bill, we are leaving B in the position that he has a contract for a lease which is not worth the paper that it is written on.  His house may be up to first storey level; he may have commitments in bridging finance and interest accumulated.  All that goes by the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the legal position. It is such a basic proposition that I am horrified to hear the Minister suggest that a court of law could come to the aid of B in the example I have mentioned.  B is totally and completely prejudiced and the Minister's argument to console the citizen who is put in that position is that we have finality in the Bill: this Bill is to be a watershed; we do not want anything hanging over.</P>
      <P>I would respectfully submit that it is a poor argument when the result of it is to cause a grave inequity to the citizen and there could be a substantial number of citizens who are at the stage of having entered into contracts to take leases, then find the Bill is passed, then find that the contracts to enforce the leases are unenforceable and they are left with nothing.  That is what the Minister is offering to the citizens of this country.</P>

It is a simple amendment which would cover the transitional period until these contracts have been exhausted and completed.

That citizen is left with nothing.  The Minister has admitted that and a Bill that leaves any citizen in that position is not a perfect Bill.  It is a travesty of a Bill and it <Col N="1014" /> would be extremely wrong for the Houses of the Oireachtas to pass a law that will prejudice any citizen to such an appalling degree.  Our amendment will avoid that without in any way taking from the principle of the Bill, without in any way impeding its finality.  We cannot quantify the number of contracts that must be in this position but they must be comparatively few.  I am suggesting to the Minister to let those contracts proceed. It will be a matter for the conveyancer afterwards to ensure that the lease, which would be technically granted after the passing of the Act, was granted in pursuance of a contract entered into before the Act.  That would be a matter for the conveyancer afterwards and it is not something which would prejudice a borrower with a lending institution or anything else.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 1 to 19 and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) (a) Where a person&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  immediately before the passing of this Act holds land under a lease for a term of not less than 99 years, of which at least 50 years are unexpired, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  obtains permission under Part IV of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 for development of the land, wholly or mainly by the construction of dwellings,</P>
      <P>that person shall have the right to acquire under the Act of 1967 the feel simple in the land and any intermediate interests therein.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing subsection (5) provides for a situation in effect that where somebody holds land on lease and on the passing of the Act permission exists for the development of it into a housing estate, that that person who holds the land on lease will have the right within one year to acquire the fee simple.  It is a logical and sensible provision in that the purpose of it is to ensure that the person who holds the land will get the fee simple rather than perhaps having a series of 100 or 200 sub-leases and then putting the onus on the tenants under the sub-leases to buy out the fee simple individually. We support the general purpose of the section in that sense but we feel that it would be better if it were provided that where a person holds land under a long lease and even after the passing of the Act he gets planning permission, that he should have the similar right to acquire the fee simple.  Our main reason for saying that is that we feel that if the amendment is not accepted there could be an effective sterilising of potential development land.  Somebody who holds land under a lease and who has not obtained planning permission at the time of the passing of this Act&mdash;it can sometimes take years to get planning permission particularly for some of the big housing estates&mdash; cannot have that type of notice in relation to this.  I do not think that <Col N="1017" /> argument is a valid one against the amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Fisheries proposed in the House on Committee Stage that lawyers could find ways around the Bill.  He acknowledged that there could be difficulties and he was, in many ways, willing to consider the proposition we put to him at that time but he withdrew from it for some reason. We have now changed the amendment quite substantially.  It is a compromise, in effect, between the amendment we had on Committee Stage and the Bill itself.  Where there is the danger of sterilising development land with the cost of such land and the difficulties we have in creating sufficient houses for our needs, we should avoid that. We should also avoid the danger that builders will be employing lawyers and experts to find ways around the Bill.  The Bill as it stands is riddled with difficulties and, possibly, loopholes but I do not think the way the Minister for Fisheries suggested is the proper way to get over a problem like this.  I cannot see that there should be any valid objection to the amendment and I would ask that it be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  The section as drafted provides that where a person has land for lease of not less than 99 years with 50 years unexpired and permission exists at the time of the passing of the Act for the erection of dwellings that a person then has one year in which to get in the fee simple. If there is land held under the long lease but no permission existing at the time of the passing of the Act, then that person never has the right compulsorily to get in the fee simple.  The question then arises as to whether that person will be ever in a position to sell sites on the land.  It appears to me from reading the Bill that he will not.  The Minister might enlighten us in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind the situation of a person living within a mile or two, maybe three miles, of a developing urban area, living on land that has been in his family for generations and is possibly held under an old fee farm grant or under an old long lease.  That type of title is not unusual on the outskirts <Col N="1018" /> of towns in Ireland.  At the moment that land may be agricultural land and not used for anything else. But the pressures of development over the years will bring building closer to it and there will be pressure then to develop that land.  If the adjoining town is to develop, that land will have to come into the development area and will have to be built on.  That pressure might not come for another two years. At the time of the passing of this Act there may not be planning permission on it but in the future planning permission may be sought.</P>
    <P>As I read the Bill, that person will be unable to acquire compulsorily the fee simple when the pressures come on him to allow his land to be developed for building and commercial purposes. It appears to me that that land will have to be left there idle.  I am sure that that is not a consequence intended, nor would the Minister like to see the landowner personally prejudiced or to see the land left incapable of being used for development purposes because the title is wrong&mdash;and the title cannot be remedied due to the narrow constraints of this subsection.</P>
    <P>I do not think relief can be had under subsection (4) of section 2.  It would be straining the section if one were to read it that the landowner holding under the long lease proceeded to give a lease to a would-be developer or would-be purchaser and that would-be purchaser then relied on his rights under subsection (4).  That certainly would be a strained interpretation to put on it.  It would be a rather ridiculous position to put the parties into.</P>
    <P>All we are asking in our amendment is to provide that, if planning permission is obtained at any time, at that stage the person would become entitled to acquire the fee simple compulsorily and develop his land by making conveyances in fee simple. There would have to be planning permission, but of course planning permission would not be available from the local authority until such time as it would be in the interests of ordinary development and obedience to good planning principles to grant that permission. Consequently, it would be socially and economically desirable <Col N="1019" /> that the land would be developed and the fee simple would be compulsorily acquirable by the lessee.</P>
    <P>I do not think the position of the lessor comes into the picture.  He is not going to be prejudiced any more under that provision than he would be under the provision in the Bill.  He will have to sell and the maximum purchase price provisions will not apply.  They are specifically excluded.  We would be continuing that exclusion so that the lessor could not claim that he was being prejudiced by this provision.  The value of the reversal to a lessor must be small, because the type of lease I am talking about is usually for 999 years or is generally a fee farm rent.  The value of the lessor interest is, accordingly, of no great significance.  Consequently, compulsory purchase is not going to see him in any way prejudiced. Should the odd case arise where it would be valuable, then the county registrar, the arbitration authority, whoever that might be, is not constrained by section 18 (1) (b) of the 1967 Act in regard to the maximum purchase prices.</P>
    <P>We are asking the Minister, by accepting this amendment, to ensure that land of the type I have described within a reasonable distance of towns and villages throughout the country can be used for development purposes in the years to come.  I cannot see on reading of the Bill how that land can be used because of the prohibition in creating leases.  It would be an extreme interpretation if one had to say that the owner of the land could grant leases in the knowledge that what he was granting was void and that the person taking the lease could then compel the fee simple to be granted to him.  It would be an odd sort of Act that would compel people to get the legal rights by insisting initially that the process starts by the granting of something declared void by an Act of Parliament.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to hear from the Minister whether he thinks the section will have the effect we think it will have, that it will freeze building or development land in years to come, development land that is held otherwise than in fee simple which has not <Col N="1020" /> yet got planning permission but which may in the future be necessary for development.  Does the Minister think that that type of land will be frozen in the sense that the owner will be unable to grant a title to a prospective builder?  If he thinks it will have that effect will he justify why he will not accept our amendment?  If it does not have that effect I will be glad to hear why he thinks it will not have.</P>

      <P>This will end up in a clash with no conclusion.  However, the amendment does not find acceptance.  I am sorry to sound difficult <Col N="1021" /> as far as the Senators are concerned. I know they have tabled the amendment out of the goodness of their hearts and with a hope that by having the amendment accepted in some way they would improve what they consider to be an imperfect legislative instrument.  That is their view but I am afraid it is not acceptable to the Minister for Justice.  The amendment proposes to substitute a new paragraph for paragraph (a) of section 2 (5).  This provision is designed to give relief to any builder or developer who at the time the Bill becomes law is engaged in the residential development of land which either is held by him on a long lease or in respect of which he has an enforceable agreement for a long lease.</P>
      <P>The provision proposes that such a person, shall during the period of one year after the Bill becomes law&mdash;a very reasonable, clear and understandable provision&mdash;have the right to acquire the fee simple in land and any intermediate interests.  In either case, planning permission for the development must exist at the time the Bill becomes law.  Senator Cooney and Senator Molony moved a somewhat similar amendment when the Bill was taken by the Minister for Fisheries on Committee Stage.  I appreciate that the wording in the context of the new amendment is somewhat different but trying to reach the same conclusion.</P>
      <P>At the same time the fact is that the wording is different and the amendment on Committee was put to the House and was lost.  The amendment now differs from the text of the Bill before us on three grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill requires that immediately before the passing of the Bill planning permission should exist for the proposed development of the land.  The amendment would simply require that planning permission for the development be obtained at any date. The second is that the provision in the Bill is transitional and would last for one year only.  There is an element of certainty.  There is no cut-off date in the proposed amendment.  The third and final point is that the amendment makes no provision for a person with an enforceable agreement who is proceeding <Col N="1022" /> with a development on the basis of that enforceable agreement.  On those grounds alone the amendment is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The main objection to the amendment is that it would make the provision permanent instead of transitional. The sole purpose of this provision is to provide a saver for current developments because, failing such a saver, builders and developers could be held to ransom by the owner of the fee simple or might even, for various reasons, be unable to bargain for the fee simple at any price.</P>
    <P>In arguing their somewhat similar amendment on Committee Stage the Senators seemed to assume that unless, a provision, unlimited in regard to time of the type they are now proposing, was included in the Bill, the future development for housing or land held under long leases would be in some way inhibited. There is no good reason to suggest this is the case or that this will be the case.  What will happen is that a builder or developer will in future have to acquire the fee simple of the land together with any intermediate interest there is.  Here, we have the normal bargaining process instead of as present having to acquire as much of an interest as will support the grant of a ground lease.  In other words, he will have to deal with the fee simple owner as well as any lease holders but the process of acquiring the land for his purposes will remain essentially the same.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment is also unacceptable on the grounds that it does not require that planning permission be obtained before the Bill becomes law.  I specifically put an emphasis on the words &ldquo;before the Bill becomes law&rdquo;.  This point is central to the transitional nature of the provision which is designed to provide a saver for builders' developers caught in a situation not of their own making. Furthermore, the amendment makes no provision for the case of a builder who, at the time the Bill becomes law, has not a lease of the land but is proceeding with the building of houses or with the preliminary development of the site on the basis of an enforceable <Col N="1023" /> agreement.  Such a provision, which is clearly necessary, was inserted by official amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil in response to arguments by the Committee of Senator Molony's and Senator Cooney's law society.  The amendment could introduce an inequitable provision into the law by giving the right to acquire the fee simple to a long lease holder of vacant land and on no other grounds than that he had obtained planning permission for housing development.</P>
    <P>The right to acquire the fee simple is, however, grounded in the purchaser's brick and mortar interest in this built-on land.  The builder/ developer catered for in section 2 (5) (a) is in the same position as a ground rent tenant with a bricks and mortar interest.  He has already bargained for and paid for the right to build his houses and if he waited until the houses were built he could buy out the fee simple as an ordinary ground tenant.  This is not the position of a long leaseholder of vacant land in other circumstances.</P>
    <P>In other words, the amendment proposed would give permanent rights to tenants of unbuilt-on land in a way which is totally alien to the basic tenet of landlord and tenant law to date. Such rights have never been given except where there are permanent buildings on the land and the unbuilt-on land is ancilliary and subsidiary to the buildings.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) of section 2 justified exemption since it is only a transitional provision to cater for the real possibility of hardship but it would be an unwarranted interference in an area which is outside the scope of landlord and tenant relationship, basically the area of agriculture, to extend these permits of rights to lessees of vacant land.  The existence of planning permission to be obtained at any time in the future would not remove this objection.  On a practical level, if a lessee of land, in the circumstances outlined by the two Senators, wants to develop the land at some future date, he has two real options.  One would be to buy the fee simple.  This should not be a problem since the <Col N="1024" /> development value windfall should cater for the provision of the spoil. The second point is that he can build the houses and that will give him the right to get in the fee simple.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a social problem which has been bedevilling this country for many years and this Bill, as presented to the Seanad, is as perfect as we can make it.  Again, to go back to Senator Molony's allegation that the Bill is riddled with difficulties and loopholes, nothing could be further from the truth.  We have dealt with this Bill for a considerable length of time and I do not think I should let the opportunity go without thanking the two Senators for tabling their amendments, however well-intentioned and however unacceptable, but what we want is perfection and we believe that we have reached perfection without the two Senator's amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not long in this House but I must say that the attitude adopted by the Minister in dealing with this Bill is very difficult to understand. I make this preliminary point in view of the fact that the Minister has made arguments against our amendment.  We are not talking here in any sense about something that is political, apart from the fact that we <Col N="1025" /> are all in agreement that something should be done to abolish ground rents here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>God forgive the Senator's innocence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all in agreement that the law needs to be changed so that ground rents can be abolished but we are dealing with a Bill that is an extremely complex legal measure. It has ramifications far beyond what we have realised.  The Minister made reference to the fact that the law society had suggested changes in this section.  The Minister is also aware that the law society complained that they did not have sufficient time to examine this Bill.  They made the point&mdash;and very rightly so&mdash;that this Bill was so complex and had such ramifications that it required consideration over a period of time so that all the possible consequences of the Bill could be considered.  I am sorry that the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment.  He has made the point that the amendment was sincerely tabled.  It was sincerely tabled, but the consideration which the Minister has given to it is most unsatisfactory and, certainly, some of the arguments he has used against the amendment have no foundation whatever. It should be stitched into the record of this House that Senator Cooney asked the Minister a very fair question in relation to an argument used and he chose deliberately not to reply to it.  The reason he chose not to reply to it was that there was no reply; there was only one reply that he could have given and that was that the argument he had used was hogwash and nothing else.  The simple fact is that the point the Minister made in that regard was that if a builder held land under a lease, that if he built houses on it, he would automatically acquire the right to buy the fee simple.  Senator Cooney asked if it was not the case that under the Bill he would only have that right where the lease was granted after the passing of the Act.  The Bill clearly provides that it is only where a lease is granted after the passing of the Act and somebody builds on the land that he will have the right to acquire the fee simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> In this amendment, and this section generally, we are talking about an existing lease.  We made the point on Committee Stage that land could be sterilised because of the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister has made the interesting point that this is a transitional section, a section to save the unfortunate builder or developer.  It is significant that the Minister is interested in saving the unfortunate builder or developer and is prepared to have in the Bill a transitional section but is not prepared to put in a transition section, as we proposed in our first amendment, to save the innocent house purchaser from the possible consequences of this Bill.  It shows truly where his loyalties lie.</P>
    <P>In relation to the amendment there are certain specific points I should like to make in reply.  In the first instance, the amendment we had on Committee Stage differed quite substantially&mdash;not only in words&mdash;from the amendment we have here now.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in our amendment on Committee Stage it was provided that the lease should have just ten years' unexpired term remaining.  The amendment which we have before the House now provides that at least 50 years are unexpired.  That is similar to the original section.  It differs very much in that respect.  When answering our amendment on Committee Stage, the Minister for Fisheries made the point that our amendment was unacceptable for that reason.  The Minister has already said the Bill is perfect.  I doubt very much that it is.  I do not claim our amendment is perfect but we can improve on the section by allowing for this amendment.</P>
    <P>The only purpose behind the amendment is to provide that where a builder or a developer or anybody else has land under a lease, but does not at the passing of the Act have planning permission, if he gets planning permission and proposes to build a housing estate, he will have the right to acquire the fee simple.</P>
    <P>It is worth considering the position as it would be if the Bill is passed without the amendment.  There is, in fact, in Rathfarnham a lease which was <Col N="1027" /> granted in 1679 and which in effect, would come under the provisions of this Bill and would be affected by the provisions of this transitional paragraph. I am not in a position to say that there is planning permission in respect of all of the land that comes under that lease but there is a portion of the take of that lease which has not yet been developed and, being where it is, and with the demand that exists for housing in Dublin, it is a prime spot and it is obviously desirable that if somebody wishes to develop that land in the future he should be in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>I speak of the existence of that lease because I know of it.  I cannot say that the consequences I will point out will, in fact, apply to it but I would apprehend that they might and this is the point we wish to get across in this debate.  That land is held under a lease.  If, in fact, planning permission does not exist on the passing of this Bill, the effect after the passing of the Bill in its present form will be that that land will not, in our view, be capable of development.  The title to the land will be a lease.  The developer will not have the right to acquire the fee simple.  Therefore, he is in the position that he cannot grant to potential purchasers anything but a sub-lease; he can only grant a portion of what he has himself or an assignment of what he has himself.  The Bill does not allow him the right to acquire the fee simple. The only consequence of that is that that land is sterilised as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would be delighted to learn that I was wrong in that; I do not think I am.  We have discussed this on Committee Stage.  I have heard the Minister's argument against the amendment in this House and, frankly, I am not at all impressed.  I feel that there is the likelihood, as Senator Cooney has already pointed out, that, under old fee farm grants or old leases around the country generally, the situation of which I speak could be multiplied and the problems multiplied throughout the length and breadth of Ireland and at a time when we need so much housing this is a very dangerous <Col N="1028" /> and bad development.  I can see no harm whatever in the right being given to somebody who has leasehold land and who gets planning permission to acquire the fee simple at any stage.  It is a sane provision.  I do not see how it is objectionable.  The Minister did not answer the amendment when he attempted it a short while ago.</P>
    <P>There is no other point I want to make but I should like again to record my regret at the attitude adopted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters which were agreed by the other Minister to be considered by him are dealt with in column 882 of the Official Report where he indicated that he was attracted by the principle of the amendment that was being moved on that occasion. The Minister appeared to be sympathetic to the predicament of persons who had entered into contracts before the passing of the Act but had not obtained their leases before the passing of the Act.  He did not seem to consider that the need for what the present Minister determines finality to mark the watershed nature of this legislation would be a superior need to that of the prejuliced citizen.  He indicated that he would look at the matter.  He thought that the protection for contracts could have a time limit on it in the sense that they would be given a year or 18 months to enforce their contracts.  This would appear to be adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the sympathetic spark which the Minister for Fisheries showed has not been repeated here by his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I do not think there is any point in repeating the <Col N="1029" /> arguments that we made beyond puting it on record that the Bill when passed will be to the serious prejudice of that unknown number of citizens who have entered into contracts to take leases but have not succeeded in obtaining their leases before the Act was passed.  The Act will then have the effect of saying that those people have nothing.  We proposed an amendment to safeguard those people.  The Minister has rejected that amendment on the ground that he wants the Bill to be final and certain and to be a watershed and hump John Citizen.</P>
    <P>The other matter that was to be considered and which the Minister indicated he would look at at column 888 was in connection with our amendment to expand the saver in section 2 (4).  We felt that subsection (4) only gave protection to persons taking a lease that happened to be void under subsection (1).  You would have an equally innocent party under subsection (3).  Yet there is no protection for that person.  Our reading of the section is not total and there is somewhere in the Landlord and Tenant code protection for the person under subsection (3).  We fail to see why subsection (4) cannot be extended to subsection (3) as well as subsection (1).</P>
    <P>Senator Molony gave a graphic example of the consequences in practice of subsection (3) where he took the situation of A making a lease of an industrial site to B.  The lease was made for industrial purposes but did not prohibit the erection of dwellings. If for some reason the lessee wanted to be rid of his obligations under that lease all he had to do was erect permanent buildings for use fully or principally as a dwelling and the lease became void and by using the provisions of subsection (3) that lessee had escaped his contractual obligations to his lessor.  It seems to me to be a clear consequence of subsection (3).  It would be wrong to pass legislation which could have that effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when he heard that example, said that he would certainly have it examined because the example was a valid one of what might happen. He said that it would obviously be undesirable. <Col N="1030" /> I would be glad to hear from the Minister if he considers that that example could take place.  If it is a valid example he should fulfil the wish of his colleague that it should be looked at as being obviously undesirable.</P>
    <P>The other matter which the Minister said he would look at before Report Stage was the question of whether the right of a county registrar to arbitrate in cases arising under section 2 (5) would be constitutional in view of the removal of the limitation on purchase prices to be fixed by the county registrar.  Section 18 (1) (b) of the 1967 Act which refers to maximum purchase prices is said not to apply to the provision of subsection (5).  I read that as meaning that there was no limitation on the amount of compensation which a county registrar could award.  I suggested to the Minister that to give unlimited jurisdiction to a county registrar might be unconstitutional because at that stage he was doing more than just arbitrating in accordance with criteria laid down by a statute.  He would then be exercising what would, in effect, be a judicial discretion and the provision might consequently be unconstitutional. The Minister said that he would look at it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one point which I would like to make. It is a point which has already been covered by Senator Cooney but I would like to make it clear because I think it is a very important matter.  The position under this Bill is that where any lease is made for commercial purposes, say for example, I lease to the Minister five acres of land for the purpose of the erection of a factory and for some reason or another the Minister wishes to get out of his contractual obligations, he can do so simply by the erection of a dwelling because the Bill provides that where a dwelling is built on land that is held under a lease made after the passing of the Act the erection of that building would make the lease void.  The Minister for Fisheries agreed to look into that.  It is a very wild consequence, to say the least of it, if in fact this can happen.</P>

      <P>I am relating the two of them.  I am entitled to do it.  I know that when the Coalition Government were in power the general movement was towards liberality and anti-democratic practices and in the final analysis the Opposition might have found themselves in jail.  We know that but I am pointing out to the former Minister for Justice and to his young Senator colleague, Senator Molony, a statement made by Senator Cooney during the course of the Second Stage debate on this Bill.  If we are talking about where affections lie in relation to John Citizen or otherwise, I think that this statement by Senator Cooney is high in the grasp of class distinction.</P>
      <P>In column 212 of the Official Seanad Report of 8 February 1978, Senator Cooney said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point, which raises a matter of principle, is the question of extending the powers of the Bill albeit in a limited way, to local authority houses.  The original Bill excluded local authority houses from any of the changes proposed for other types of dwellings.  This was done in recognition of the fact that this situation of a purchaser of a local authority house is not analogous to that of a person purchasing a private dwelling.  In the case of a local authority house, the site would be provided by the community and the house would have been built by the community.  In the case of the private person he would have bought his own site and he would have built his own house.  It is clear that there <Col N="1032" /> is no analogy between the two situations.  Because the community was involved in providing these houses, the community should be left with control over those houses. Very often there is extreme pressure of space in urban areas, and it is important that local authority houses should be kept under the control of the housing authority, so that they be kept available as residences.</P>
    <P>I will let that quotation speak for itself. When Senator Molony makes allegations against me of the nature that he has made in the context of this Bill, he should have as good a memory as I in relation to what was said.</P>
    <P>In relation to undertakings given by the Minister for Fisheries, Deputy Lenihan dealt with the Committee Stage very effectively, and properly said, in his own reasonable fashion, that he would examine certain points made by Senator Molony and Senator Cooney.  The Minister examined in consultation with the Minister for Justice, his officials and the draftsman, the amendments proposed by the two Senators.  I am coming back now to deliver the message that the amendments proposed are unacceptable. However, there are a number of undertakings which I must discharge on behalf of the Minister for Fisheries in relation to points raised by Senator Cooney and Senator Molony.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (5) (a) of the Bill gives a person, a builder or developer, who on the date the Bill becomes law, has leasehold land in the course of development for dwelling houses the right, for a period of one year, to acquire the fee simple under the 1967 Ground Rents Act.  Section 2 (5) (b) excludes in such a case the provision for a maximum purchase price for the fee simple in section 18 (1) (b) of the 1967 Act. The Opposition amendment that was debated on Committee Stage would have removed from the county registrar the function of arbitrating on a disputed price in a section 2 (5) (a) case and would have given to the Circuit Court direct&mdash;instead of only on appeal &mdash;the function of determining that price.  In the course of debate this <Col N="1033" /> amendment and another amendment which would remove from arbitration and give direct to the Circuit Court the apportionment of a rent under section 2 (7) (c) (ii) of the Bill, were withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Fisheries undertook to consider the question of the constitutionality of leaving to the arbitration of a country registrar the determination of a purchase price in a section 2 (5) (a) case and, more generally, the constitutionality of the whole arbitration function given to the county registrars by section 17 of the 1967 Ground Rents Act.</P>
    <P>The matters have been examined extensively.  As regards the constitutionality of section 17 of the 1967 Ground Rents Act generally, it appears that the Minister for Justice in the previous Government had the advice of the Attorney General of the time on this question.  I understand that this advice was that the arbitration functions given to county registrars by the 1967 Act are &ldquo;limited functions&rdquo;. within the meaning of Article 37 of the Constitution and are constitutionally valid.  The then Attorney General, now Judge of the High Court, Mr. Declan Costello, pointed out that a non-judical tribunal should not have powers &ldquo;of far-reaching effect and importance ...calculated...to affect...in far-reaching way the... fortunes of those against whom they are exercised&rdquo;, and he was satisfied that the purchase by payment of a capital sum of an annual rent does not have that kind of far-reaching effect on the &ldquo;fortunes&rdquo; of a landlord.  The Attorney General also advised that the functions of nonjudicial tribunals should not only not be far-reaching in effect but also should not be numerous.</P>
    <P>Because that advice was given by an esteemed lawyer who in his own right has a very high and significant understanding of the law, it should be accepted.  The answer to Senator Cooney's query is given by his former colleague, the then Attorney General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the removal of the maximum price limit alter the position?</P>

    <Col N="1034" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not, as I understand it.  In the light of this advice not only is the constitutional validity of section 17 of the 1967 Act reasonably certain, but also the minor extensions of the arbitration functions proposed in section 2 (5) (a) of the Bill and in section 28 of the Bill as amended in Committee by Seanad Éireann.  The Attorney General in giving the advice referred to was quite prepared to concede that the arbitration functions given to county registrars by the 1967 Act might be enlarged without danger of constitutional invalidity.  The only remaining question is whether the new function proposed for county registrars in section 2 (5) (a) and (8) are or are not &ldquo;far-reaching&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (7) deals with ground leases, one void and one valid.  Section 2 (8) deals with appointment of the rent between the two.  Apportionment of a ground rent is already a function of county registrars under the 1967 Act, and is clearly a function even less far-reaching than the determination of the purchase price of a fee simple. Section 2 (5) (a) also concerns, in effect, the purchase of the fee simple by a person already having the interest of a ground rent tenant and it is incorrect to suggest that very large sums of money could be involved.  This may be more clearly seen if one considers the position of the builder or the developer in a section 2 (5) (a) case who waits until he has built his house before acquiring the fee simple.  In that event he can acquire the fee simple as a ground rent tenant entitled to do so under the 1967 Act.  Builders would be at a loss if they had to wait in that manner; hence the right of purchase given in section 2 (5) (a).  However, the building of the houses in no way affects the rights of superior owners and cannot effect the price to be paid for the fee simple.  In the section 2 (5) (a) situation the really important financial transactions have been concluded before the position becomes applicable.</P>
      <P>Senator Molony mentioned a lease extending back to 1679 or thereabouts and said in some way the provisions of this Bill would freeze that land in the Rathfarnham area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised an important point which the Minister completely overlooked.  The Minister for Fisheries promised that he would look into and let me know on Report Stage what the position is.  I do not want to let this Bill go through without receiving a definite answer to this question.  The proposition I made is that under the provisions of this Bill it is possible that where a lease is granted for the purpose of the erection of a factory, for example, for commercial purposes instead of for the purpose of building dwelling houses if the lessee for one reason or another wishes to get out of his obligations under the lease, all he has to do is to erect a dwelling house, even if there is a covenant in the commercial <Col N="1036" /> lease prohibiting the erection of a dwelling house.  I have read the Bill several times and it is mind-boggling that that could be a consequence of it.  It seems absolutely clear that that could happen.  I would ask for a specific answer to that question. The section I speak of is section 2 (3) which reads:</P>
      <P>the construction of permanent buildings for use wholly or principally as a dwelling on land which is held under a lease made after the passing of this Act shall render the lease void if the existence of the buildings, as so constructed, immediately before the making of the lease would have rendered the lease void under subsection (1).</P>
      <P>Reading it in the context of subsection (1) makes no difference to the fact that it was never intended to be a lease for the purpose of building dwelling houses.  It was intended to be a simple commercial lease of which there are hundreds of instances in commercial life.  I would ask the Minister to give a specific answer to that.</P>

    <P>This Bill does nothing of the sort; it is farce in that respect.  We mentioned on occasions various legal instruments that would in effect get around the provisions of the Bill and in that context <Col N="1037" /> I would refer the Minister of State back to the Committee Stage debate in this House where the Minister for Fisheries agreed that the Bill was in that respect grossly unsatisfactory.  The Minister said that he had considered the introduction of this Bill before but had decided that it was so difficult or so almost impossible to achieve the purpose, that he saw no point in introducing it.  That was back in 1967 when the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act was passed, but I have in my hand a document which in effect is a transfer subject to covenants which is being used regularly at present in Dublin obviously with a view to the passing of this Bill and the effect of which is to grant the fee simple subject to covenants.  By any standards that is a lease but it is not called a lease; it does not come within the definition of a lease under the 1958 Act on which we rely for a definition of a lease.  In effect, there is no difficulty in getting around the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The other and more serious point is that the Bill has dangerous consequences to it&mdash;I speak simply as a solicitor when I say that.  There are consequences to it that will cost a lot of people money through consulting with lawyers or going to the court as the Minister envisaged earlier in the discussion this afternoon.  I would ask the Minister to plead with the Minister for Justice to keep this Bill under review after it becomes law, so that efforts through new legislation will be made to close any loopholes that appear to be causing big problems. Perhaps at some future date we will see legislation to cut out the whole problem of ground rents altogether because it will become apparent in the course of the next few years that developers who lack a social conscience can find ways of getting around this Bill by producing documents like this transfer subject to covenants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what Senator Molony has said.  The purpose of the Bill, with which we are all in agreement, is to end ground rents.  It was decided for technical drafting reasons that the only way to end ground rents was to end leaseholds <Col N="1038" /> generally.  I accepted that view when I was in office but having debated this Bill and having considered the consequences of ending ground rents by abolishing leases I see that we have devised a very imperfect piece of legislative machinery.  It would have been possible to end ground rents by merely making the provision in a lease reserving a rent void.  Ground rents would have been caught by that, the other consequences of the lease would have been retained, and we would have avoided the legal consequences which have been exemplified here time after time in the course of this debate.  I grant that there is a social argument for the desirability of retaining covenants in leases.  These are covenants which are, by their very nature, inherently objectionable, which provoke emotional antagonism on the part of some lessees, but there are many covenants which are for the benefit of lessees, which ensure a high standard of maintenance of property, which consequently work towards maintaining the value of the property.</P>
      <P>Having listened to this debate and having read the debate in the other House I have come to the conclusion that the balance of the argument was in favour of abolishing provisions in leases reserving rents while retaining the other provisions of leases.  The Government, despite these arguments, have decided to go along with the method of abolishing ground rents by abolishing leases on dwellings altogether. Apart from the arguments I have already mentioned, this is defective legislation because there are too many loopholes available to lawyers under existing law, which permit the retention, in effect, of the covenants which the Government want to abolish as a matter of principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not much point in having a principle and legislating for it, if that legislation does not close loopholes which are so many and varied that the principle is totally avoided.  The nature and extent of these loopholes was conceded by the Minister for Fisheries here, in his comments at columns 863 and 898 of the Official Report of 19 April to the effect that numerous devices are available to lawyers which <Col N="1039" /> will permit the continuation of all sorts of restrictive covenants on householders. Once that consequence can come from a Bill the purpose of which is to end covenants the Bill is patently defective.  In addition, the Bill has many adverse consequences for various groups of citizens</P>
    <P>We gave practical examples of how the Bill will operate in practice. which were not controverted by the Minister on the grounds that they were extreme, unlikely or impossible, because they were patently practical examples of things that can happen in ordinary commercial and legal situations, and we pointed out the adverse consequences that those situations would have for the citizens caught in them.  It is a matter of great disappoint-to us that the Minister did not controvert the argument inherent in giving those examples, by telling us that these consequences would not occur.  In effect, the Minister accepted that these consequences will happen but the Minister is quite prepared to process legislation through Parliament which by tacit agreement will have adverse consequences on citizens, and refuses to accept amendments which would avoid or diminish substantially those adverse consequences.  That is bad legislation.  This has been a very disappointing debate.  Arguments were not controverted.  If arguments were controverted, our amendments deserve to be rejected, but our arguments were not even answered.  It was a most inadequate debate from that point of view.</P>

      <P>The simple truth is that the Fianna Fáil Government introduced this legislation as a piece of social legislation to benefit the house purchaser in purchasing a home for himself and his family.  The consequence of this legislation is that the house will be his absolutely and that is good legislation.  In relation to the suggestion that it is imperfect and is riddled with loopholes, we did not reject the Opposition's amendments out of any sense of malice or ingratitude. We examined closely the amendments proposed by the Opposition, and we found that they did not fit in to bring about the results we want from this legislaton.  That is our prerogative.  We should not be dismissive of the Opposition, and we do not say that they have no right to put down amendments.  That has not been the general tenor of what we have been saying.  We have been saying that our legislation as perfected and drafted by us is the right legislation for what we as a Government want to achieve. Only time will tell whether we have achieved what we set out to achieve. That is the reality of our obligation. We feel we have discharged our obligation.</P>

    <P>Senator Molony suggested that in some way I had overlooked a point that he had raised during the course of the debate.  I apologise to him if he thought that, but I did not do it deliberately.  Senator Molony argued that if an industrial site were leased after the Bill had become law, and if the lease contained no prohibition on the construction of a dwelling house that if the lessee for some reason wanted to be free of his involvement in the lease he could erect a dwelling house, rendering the lease void and so escape from his obligations under the lease.  The Minister for Fisheries undertook to have that argument examined to see if the provision could be abused in any fashion.  My advice <Col N="1041" /> is that there is no danger that the provision can be abused.  Once the lease is made void possession of the property is recoverable from the lessee.  The lease was by definition a ground lease, that is, the buildings were erected and paid for by the lessee, so what the lessor recovers is a property substantially improved by the construction of buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Tourism (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to make provision for a further stage in the liberalisation of road freight transport.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the Bill itself I would like to dwell briefly on the events which led up to the proposals which it contains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The merchandise licensing control restrictions which have seriously inhibited the development of the private sector of the haulage industry were introduced by the Road Transport Act, 1933 and have not been changed fundamentally since then.  Because the control system was so seriously restrictive and because it remained almost unchanged for virtually 40 years it had not been possible, as yet, to dismantle it to any significant degree for fear of causing an upheaval in the haulage industry which could easily negative <Col N="1043" /> any well meaning but unduly hasty effort to make the necessary changes. The process of liberalisation which the 1971 Act initiated entailed the removal of area and commodity restrictions and certain restrictions on vehicle weight from the main stock of general haulage licences, but a final control on the specific number of vehicles operable by each licensee was retained.</P>
    <P>More than 500 general hauliers are confined to one vehicle; about 150 are allowed two and 70 or so have numbers ranging up to 22.  These authorisations reflect in most cases the sizes of the original undertakings involved in 1933.  A number have, however, grown through the acquisition of other businesses, which has been the only means of growth open to them.</P>
    <P>For some years before the 1971 Act there was a change of approach in the adoption of a less restrictive view of the then existing legislation than had been applied in earlier times.  The change of approach got its impetus from the finding, following a special survey in 1964, that the overwhelming bulk of road freight transport was performed by the owners of goods using their own transport.  This is usually called own account transport. Only 20 per cent in tonnage terms was carried by licensed hauliers; of this, CIE accounted for some 8 percentage points and private licensed hauliers for the remaining 12.  That finding, taken with the fact that the railway share of freight transport was virtually frozen to a few traffics especially suited to rail, demonstrated that the restrictive legislation maintained for over 30 years with the objective of securing freight traffic for the railways, or the railway owned road services, had totally failed in its purpose.</P>
    <P>These circumstances in which the road freight transport industry is virtually an &ldquo;own account&rdquo; industry and licensed hauliers carry only about 20 per cent of road freight tonnage compares very favourably with the situation in other countries where data of the same type is available.  For example, in Germany, France and Belgium the corresponding figure is about <Col N="1044" /> 40 per cent, in the UK and Italy it is roughly 50 per cent and in The Netherlands a little over 60 per cent. Luxembourg is the only other EEC State where we know the figure to be as low as 20 per cent.  Since the 1964 survey the situation in Ireland has changed to the detriment of licensed hauliers, and it has been estimated in recent years that the tonnage of road freight carried by licensees may now be as low as 10 per cent&mdash;half the figure disclosed in the mid-sixties&mdash;which was then thought to be a startling one.</P>
    <P>This can hardly be regarded as a healthy situation for the road haulage industry and it is one which must, in very large measure, be attributed to the restrictive legislation which has prevented that industry from providing an attractive alternative to the own account operator who so often must feel that in using his own vehicle he has no option but to accept the penalty of one-way only laden journeys and other significant under-utilisation of vehicles, not to mention the consequential unnecessary diversion of effort and resources which this entails.  Apart altogether from the loss in potential business which unnecessary own account operation represents to the haulage industry such operation calls for the use of excessive numbers of vehicles since, in so many cases, it is necessary to have two to do the work of one.  It also involves an unproductive diversion of scarce capital which is badly needed and should be left available for investment in manufacturing plant or job creation.</P>
    <P>The immediate policy aim is, of course, to free the licensed haulier as far as possible from any unnecessary legislative restraint and to allow licensees sufficient scope to tailor service to demand with more efficient transport at economical rates.  In this way the licensed haulage industry will have the same opportunity as the other private sectors in the economy to manage its own affairs in the manner which it considers best suited to the circumstances.  I will be disappointed if hauliers do not take this opportunity and I will watch developments in that regard very closely.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> The proposals in this Bill do not stand alone in attempting to promote conditions conducive to the emergence of a first-class haulage industry.  The EEC Access Directive, which came into force on 1 January 1978 will ensure that newcomers to the haulage industry will be of good repute, have sufficient financial resources for the business and be professionally competent, and that those who entered the industry in recent years will also have to prove their professional competence. Two provisions in the Bill are directly related to this directive.  In addition the vehicles used in the haulage industry will be made subject to quality requirements to be drawn up under EEC auspices.  It can be seen, therefor, that there will be a new emphasis on quality both as regards the capability of the haulier and the standard of the vehicle he uses.</P>
    <P>These in outline were the considerations which governed my approach to the framing of the proposals in the Bill.  If the proposals are considered by some to go too far and by others not far enough this is inevitable when so many and to an extent conflicting interests are involved.  Like all such proposals, if enacted, they depend for success on an adequate response from those whom they are intended to directly benefit.  The measure of this success will depend on the degree of response.  The hauliers, who hold the key to such success will, no doubt, be anxious to respond, both because of the opportunity which the Bill presents to the haulage industry and also because of the responsibility which the industry has to the rest of the community.  The manner in which future policy is developed and the nature and pace of further amendments to road transport legislation will naturally be affected by the way in which the industry develops under the more favourable regime which the Bill will create.</P>
    <P>In view of the foregoing considerations and of the emphasis which has been laid on the part of the haulage industry is expected to play, you will readily appreciate that the principal proposal in the Bill is one which is intended to give the necessary freedom <Col N="1046" /> to the haulage industry to play its full part.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill proposes that the number of vehicles presently authorised for operation under each general haulage licence be multiplied by six but that any one licensee may not operate more than 80 vehicles.  At the moment each licence specifies a certain number of vehicls which may be operated under the licence.  In most cases that will be one vehicle so that the new permitted number will be six in those cases.  What this means in practice is that the haulier will be able to take his own decisions and actions in relation to the development of his business within that limit.  The ceiling of 80 will be a safeguard against unrealistic investment or attempts to dominate the market, while the minimum of six will ensure that no one is compelled by a legal restraint to operate a business which by being confined to one or two vehicles is, on the basis of his own assessment, incapable of giving him a fair reward for his enterprise, labour and investment.  In general, I will be providing the industry with a new open framework within which I will be able to monitor its development and allow it to review its objectives.</P>
    <P>As these developments get under way I will, also, be able to observe the effects of other provisions of the Bill which initiate new and more flexible techniques in the regulation of the road freight haulage industry.  The most important of these arises with the creation, as is proposed in section 6, of new licensing areas to supersede the existing exempted areas, which are being abolished and to grant licencs, as of right, in those areas on the sole basis of the qualitative criteria in the EEC access directive which I have already mentioned.  People who were operating in those areas prior to 1 January 1978, will be entitled to their qualifications, in full or in part, under the EEC directive but new entrants will have to fulfil all the necessary requirements.  The radii of the new areas, based on the discontinued exempted areas at Dublin and Cork will be 20 miles as against 15 miles at present while the new areas based on those being eliminated at Waterford, <Col N="1047" /> Limerick and Galway will have 15 mile radii as against ten mile radii as of now.</P>
    <P>Review of the exempted area is, of course, long overdue.  The initial justification for them, which was to allow free transfers of goods between ships and the railway ceased to exist many years ago.  If they are to be regarded as devices which ensure adequate road freight transport services in the major urban areas they no longer reflect the expansion which has taken place over the years in those centres.  For example, there has been pressure to allow hauliers in the exempted areas access to the building sites and industrial estates which are just outside or a few miles outside the exempted areas. Although a reasonable case has been established in favour of the grant of such an extension, it is not an acceptable proposition simply to extend the exempted areas to facilitate such hauliers and the appropriate alternative is to license them to operate in somewhat larger areas than the existing exempted areas.  It is worth stressing, I think, that the proposal in the Bill will make use of the exempted area concept under which there has been no restriction on entry to the haulage business as a basis for a type of pilot scheme in qualitative licensing. This, I think, is an important step.</P>
    <P>I will be able to experiment in another way in relation to our position in the international haulage market.  The liberal policy exercised in relation to the grant of merchandise licences for international refrigerated haulage and the outstanding performance of Irish haulers in that field encourages me in the belief that past restrictions have kept out of haulage people of real energy and enterprise who, if given the necessary freedom, could contribute enormously to the development of an Irish international haulage fleet.</P>
    <P>In section 4 of the Bill I propose to take powers to grant licences for international haulage to Irish hauliers without having to refer to the restrictive licensing provisions in the 1944 Act which at present inhibit and would, indeed, permanently inhibit the <Col N="1048" /> development of any flexible licensing system.  These licences would be the reciprocal of the import/export transport licences at present granted to foreign hauliers under the 1971 Act. I may exercise the power to grant these licences on a rather experimental basis while the full potential of its use is being assessed.  I attach particular importance to this provision because we need to strengthen our position in international haulage and lessen our dependence on outsiders in the event of any significant changes occurring in the international haulage market.  It will not, of course, be possible to grant these licences to applicants who do not comply with the EEC access directive.</P>
    <P>I am very impressed by the rate of progress being made by the international sector of the road haulage industry and I want to encourage the industry to develop further in that field.  In this connection I attach great importance to the negotiation of bilateral road transport agreements with other countries.  The bulk of international road haulage is carried out under bilateral permits and it is normal practice for countries to conclude bilateral road transport agreements with one another with a view to facilitating the operation and development of this traffic.</P>
    <P>My Department are currently negotiating a series of such agreements with a number of European countries. Agreements with France, Belgium and the Federal Republic of Germany are already in operation.  The agreements enable Irish hauliers to obtain, direct from my Department, the necessary permits to operate to, from or in transit across the countries concerned, instead of having to apply to the transport authorities of those countries.</P>
    <P>Work on the negotiation of further agreements is proceeding.  Talks with the Italian authorities, which commenced last year, on the conclusion of a bilateral agreement are to be resumed very shortly.  Draft agreements received from the UK and the Netherlands are being considered in my Department. As the need arises the question of opening negotiations on similar <Col N="1049" /> agreements with other European countries will be considered.</P>
    <P>As part of the liberalisation of international road transport, agreement is reached from time to time both in the EEC and the ECMT and also in the course of the negotiations of bilateral road transport agreements for the exemption from licensing control of certain international road freight or road passenger transport operations. The necessary exemptions in relation to EEC liberalisation measures can be made by way of ministerial order under the European Communities Act, 1972, but there are at present no statutory provisions which would enable me to make similiar exemptions in the other cases I have mentioned.  The purpose of section 5 is to remedy this deficiency.</P>
    <P>There is a very important provision in section 2 which provides for the exemption from licensing controls of vehicles under 2.5 metric tons unladen weight subject to a maximum weight of six metric tons fully laden.  This type of exemption is found in a number of European Community enactments and is one which I am sure will solve many of the problems to which local transport needs give rise particularly in rural and especially in remote areas. The large truck favoured by the licensed hauliers has not been really suitable or capable of being economically used for such traffic because of the nature of the traffic and the short distances normally involved.  After the passing of this measure it will be open to enterprising local men in each area to provide the light vehicle road freight services that may be needed locally. In doing so they will be able to get valuable experience which should be very useful if they subsequently wish to enter the haulage industry at national or international level.  It would also give full freedom to those who wish to provide groupage or express services to do so within the terms of the proposed exemption.  In fact, I also see the light vehicle service as a complement to and a feeder service for the heavy road vehicles which represent the major business in road freight transport and, indeed, for the railways as well.  In all the circumstances I am satisfied that there is not <Col N="1050" /> now any justification for statutory control of haulage in the smaller units.</P>
    <P>Section 2 proposes another exemption from licensing requirements to cover the carriage of wheat, oats and barley during the harvest period.  I am opposed to commodity exemptions and would not have considered this one except that there had been for many years what amounted to an all year round exemption for the carriage of wheat.  For technical reasons this was discontinued following our entry into the EEC and while administrative arrangements to provide an assured supply of transport were made in succeeding years amended legislation was clearly preferable.  It was also clear that to make new statutory arrangements for the carriage of wheat without providing for barley and oats would be very difficult to justify.  It would also be very difficult to justify an exemption for all cereals for the whole year.  If all cereals were to be provided for then the better idea seemed to be to confine the exemption to the harvest period.  I feel sure that with their new freedom licensed hauliers in general will be able to offer a more comprehensive service to the farming community than they have done before and that the farming community will respond accordingly, resorting to the exemption only in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>The licensed hauliers have made representations to me in relation to penalties for illegal haulage.  The provisions of the 1933 Act and the Transport Act, 1958, are complicated, in that they involve doubling and redoubling of fines for repeated offences up to a maximum of £320, and unrealistic in that they include forfeiture of the vehicle used.  There are provisions for both minimum and maximum fines and the whole arrangement is difficult to interpret and administer. Considering the value of road haulage vehicles nowadays I think a penalty of forfeiture of vehicles would be impossible either to defend or impose and I see no justification for retaining an enforcement provision which no one would contemplate invoking.  Section 2 of the Bill proposes the simpler, more realistic fine of £250 for a first <Col N="1051" /> offence and £500 for second or subsequent offences.</P>
    <P>I should add that it is my belief that the need for severe fines will diminish as illegal haulage becomes less attractive through licensed hauliers being in a position to offer a better deal than they now can.  Moreover, intending hauliers who have committed repeated offences will find themselves unable to comply with the EEC access directive and thus debarred from being granted licences even on transfer, while new licensees may find their licences invalidated if they commit excessive breaches of the law.  I expect a changing picture in the enforcement field over the next few years and will keep the needs under review.</P>
    <P>Every licensed haulier is required by law to have a vehicle plate affixed to each vehicle in use under his licence. Under existing legislation the plate has to be made of metal and be of uniform pattern irrespective as to whether or not the relevant licence is restricted as to area or commodity or in any other such manner.  There has been pressure particularly by the hauliers for a change which would require the use of a distinctive plate on a vehicle in use under a restricted licence.  The case has been made that this would help the Garda in enforcing road transport legislation and thereby help to curb misuse of vehicle plates in cases where, it is claimed, vehicles are being used illegally in connection with haulage which does not come within the scope of the licence held.  I accept generally the validity of the argument made.  The provision which I propose in section 7 would give me the necessary scope to prescribe different type plates for a particular type of carriage, for instance, or for the use under a restricted licence.</P>
    <P>I have decided that it is desirable that the Garda Síochána, who issue vehicle plates, be given authority to present evidence in court by way of a certificate signed by a chief superintendent or a superintendent acting on his behalf as to the issue or non-issue of a vehicle plate in a particular case. This would obviate the need for the attendance in court of a member of <Col N="1052" /> the Garda to give such evidence and would be in line with a similar provision in existing road transport legislation for the presentation of evidence in relation to the issue or non-issue of a merchandise licence to a particular person or company.  Section 7 contains provisions accordingly.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 9 of the Bill tackles a problem that has existed since 1956 when, in effect, it became illegal to use a hired vehicle to carry one's own goods.  The purpose of the 1956 Act was to prevent people who had no licences from using their vehicles for reward by hiring them out &mdash;a loophole which existed in the legislation of the time.  This measure was passed before leasing as we know it today became commonplace and we now have had, for many years, the serious anomaly that a businessman can lease all the premises, plant and equipment required for his business except for transport equipment.  The barrier to vehicle leasing is also, I believe, unique in the EEC.</P>
    <P>Repeal of the 1956 Act would, of course, open again the loophole which it was intended to close in the first place and could also lead to an upsurge in own account transport which would run counter to the objective of the present measure.  On the other hand, some easement may enable firms who have been commiting capital to own account vehicles to diversify their approach and commence leasing as a stepping stone to the increased use of professional transport.  Change could also ensure the release of capital from transport investment to investment in manufacture and job creation.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I have decided to provide for vehicle leasing within the framework of the merchandise licence system by making it legal to lease out vehicles if the lessor holds a merchandise licence.  The 1956 Act will remain in force but I will have power to regulate leasing outside the provisions of the Act by the attachment of appropriate conditions to the merchandise licences.  I might add that decontrol of vehicles up to 2.5 metric tons in weight as is proposed in section 2 effectively repeals the 1956 Act in regard to that category of vehicle. <Col N="1053" /> The situation in relation to leasing will be an evolving one and I will keep developments under close review.</P>
    <P>In preparing these legislative proposals I have taken into account the consideration that the structure and circumstances enforced on the road freight industry of Ireland have deprived able and hard-working members of the industry of any real opportunity to earn a just reward for skill, hard work, enterprise and investment.  We owe to our hauliers an opportunity to demonstrate what they can do for the Irish economy before considering measures of liberalisation running beyond those contemplated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There will be an immediate cost saving for hauliers who want to extend their businesses.  The present position is that the enterprising haulier who wants to expand say, from two vehicles to three, can do so only by acquiring another business at a very high cost.  The measure now proposed will allow him to expand without having to undertake that financial burden so that a very substantial cost saving will have been achieved.</P>
    <P>Unless we have changes the defects of the existing system will remain and probably increase.  CIE and the other licensed hauliers would be competing for a diminishing share of the market and own account transport, which represents the real competition for them, would continue to develop with its adverse cost implications.</P>
    <P>The present measure offers a positive approach to current road freight transport problems.  It seeks to achieve a better balance between own account and professional transport and to lay a foundation for a new regime less costly than it might otherwise be which would meet national road freight transport needs on an improved basis with corresponding benefits to the licensed hauliers, including CIE.  This main objective will have beneficial side effects of several kinds including the prospect of avoiding excessive increase in vehicle numbers on the roads and achieving a market and rapid improvement in some sectors, notably in relation to rural transport.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be of direct benefit to <Col N="1054" /> the holders of the main stock of merchandise licenses and the enterprising hauliers who are prepared to enter international transport.  This is only as it should be.  The haulage business of to-day is based on the former; the latter represent the hopes for its future. It is up to them to take full advantage of the opportunities which the Bill affords.  The matching purpose is to secure benefit for all transport users not only with an improvement in the supply of transport but also from the greater efficiency and economy which the Bill should make possible in transport services.  The freedom which the Bill offers for the use of light vehicles is potentially a great benefit for rural areas and along with others already mentioned should lead rapidly to a new and welcome era in the development of the Irish transport industry.  I am satisfied that the package is a good one.  It offers progress on many fronts and it take full account of existing difficulties.</P>
    <P>I confidently commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address myself to this Bill.  Substantially this Bill replaces the Road Transport Bill of 1976 which was introduced when the party of which I am a member were in Government, by Deputy Peter Barry and which lapsed on the change of Government.  Fundamentally, it is much the same Bill with the difference that the Bill we had proposed at that time went somewhat further than merely phasing in the liberalisation of the road transport system.  It is an area of life in this country in which a great many anomalies have grown up to make completely nonsensical the Act of 1933 with the various amendments to it which we have inherited since then.  It is true to say that the objectives of the 1933 Act have failed to a very large extent.  There has been overwhelming reason to introduce amending legislation which we on this side of the House welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some general observations which should be made to show the extent to which the objectives of the 1933 Act were not achieved.  One of <Col N="1055" /> the main objectives at that time was the protection of the place of the national transport system in the road haulage world or in the freight world in general, including railways.  Yet, we have the situation today that statistically about 80 per cent of all haulage is done privately by companies or individuals owning their own trucks and the balance of 20 per cent is shared by CIE and road haulage contractors operating under licence. This is vastly different from the position that obtains in most other countries in Europe where the percentage of carriage done by people who own their own transport is of the order of approximately half the percentage in this country.  This is a vast difference which shows the extent to which the objectives of 1933, regardless of how meritorious they were, have not been achieved.  We have the highest percentage of what is called own account transport in Europe.  To a large extent, the high proportion of private transport is due to the anomalies introduced where haulage contractors were concerned.  A freight haulage system obtained within this country because of the various restrictions which were obviously to the detriment of commerce and industry and agriculture.  Any liberalisation in this area&mdash;we can disagree about aspects of it, about the extent to which that liberalisation is taking place&mdash;is welcome and in general terms this Bill is obviously welcome and for that reason we support it.</P>
    <P>I noted that the Minister in the Dáil was critical to an extent of individual transport people who carry for themselves. There were suggestions that it was inefficient and suggestions that there were duplications.  I do not accept that criticism.  It may have been in a speech drafted by the people in his Department. I think there is undue criticism in that field because in the private sector there was no alternative other than to get into the transport industry for the moving of goods.  In the first instance, CIE had, to an extent, a monopoly position which worked efficiently and very effectively on mainline areas.  In other words, if you were living adjacent to rail lines within this country <Col N="1056" /> where goods could be moved to and from major centres, they gave an excellent service.  I stand in admiration of CIE against many of their critics because I am personally aware of the level of efficiency that obtains in their industry, which is an extremely difficult one.  The problem for the private people in industry or in farming or in business was that when one got into the outlying areas CIE were placed in a most appalling position.  If one went into Galway or Westport station and if CIE had a statutory requirement to provide a road transport service to outlying parts of Connemara, Belmullet or Louisburgh, they were in a most appalling position which led to a great many anomalies. In addition there is the situation where, with the restriction on the number of licensed haulage plates and with the particularly unique means of expansion for licensed haulage people, the only means of expanding was buying another business at immense capital cost.  There was not, obviously, a sufficient availability of keenly priced transport to offer the service.  As a result of this there was a huge increase in the private sector.  I do not agree that it has been inefficient.  The point has been overstated by the Minister in his speech in terms of his criticism of those people because there was no alternative.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the easing of the restrictions the Minister could have gone even further to allow for certain outlying areas.  Apart from CIE having problems many of the licensed hauliers will have problems in providing an efficient service to many outlying areas in west Donegal, west Kerry, west Cork, west Mayo and west Galway. In areas such as those there is a very strong case to be made for allowing those people who are in agriculture or business generally in such areas when returning from, say, Dublin with an empty truck&mdash;I am speaking personally and not for my party in this regard&mdash; to help out neighbours by arranging a full load.  In certain circumstances it is the only efficient means of operation. If one goes from west Donegal or west Kerry to a haulage contractor in Limerick to do something where <Col N="1057" /> there might not be back-loading or where there might be a limited tonnage involved, one is not making the position any more efficient.</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular the introduction of a section which will mean that in future the Minister will authorise exemptions from licensing controls for small trucks.  My quibble with the Minister in this regard is that he does not go sufficiently far.  Under section 2 the Minister proposes to allow such an exemption from licensing controls of vehicles of under 2½ metric tons unladen weight or a maximum of 6 metric tons laden.  That is most welcome because it is a common-sense, practical measure where within a small radius there are needs to be met for the farm, shop or local factory it is eminently sensible that there should be freedom from restrictions in this area. The situation that legally had obtained regarding licensed haulage contractors geared for larger trucks and larger movement of goods, or CIE with the problem they had in such outlying areas, left an utterly impossible situation where goods would simply not be shifted had the law been adhered to. The facts of life are that for the last 20 years a coach and four was being driven through that law.  So, obviously, bad laws needs amendment, and I welcome that amendment.</P>
    <P>The authorities, through the years, were reasonable.  There was a common-sense policy adopted throughout the country by the Minister.  However, the anomaly needed to be corrected legally and that correction is welcome. The Minister, in this section, does not go sufficiently far.  If we are talking about large volumes of goods being moved, about a maximum of 6 tons laden weight with a maximum of 2.5 metric tons unladen, we are talking about the carriage of 3½ tons of goods. I grant that there must be a cut-off point, but I do not accept that the cut-off point in terms of tonnage of 3½ tons in this age is reasonable.  We are in an age of much more intensive agriculture and the movement of goods. With more intensive agriculture we are talking about larger tonnages.  One could easily have increased that exemption from possibly a maximum of <Col N="1058" /> 6 metric tons laden to, for example, something around the 10 ton mark without anybody being hurt, because presumably the only purpose of the exemption in the first place was to help those people in the business, the licensed haulage people and CIE.  I do not think CIE, or the licensed haulage contractors, would have been hurt in any sense had the maximum been raised from 6 metric tons to 10 metric tons.  I would welcome the Minister's comments in his reply in regard to this matter, because it is deserving of amendment.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that in this section the comment is made by the Minister that we are following what has been enacted in many EEC countries before this.  To a degree we are dragging our heels in this section, and it is another example of the benefit of the EEC to us in that we are finding out in many areas of life that to get into line with what has been established practice for a number of years this type of amending legislation is required. I would certainly welcome an increase in that sector.</P>
    <P>In this section the carriage of cattle. sheep and pigs is made exempt, and again that is welcome.  So also is the period of the harvest for newly harvested wheat, oats or barley.  It is possible that this might have been drafted in a broader fashion.  The liberalisation here is sensible and, indeed, very necessary because in harvest time with the movement of grain there is the position where there is a vast tonnage to be worked during a limited few weeks and during that limited time the licensed haulage trade which is geared to year round business, and CIE with freight potential which is limited also, simply cannot, in practice, cope.  It is absolutely vital that through the harvest time if wheat, barley or oats has to be shifted, it must be shifted on the day it is needed to be done.  It is sensible that that should be liberalised.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not take exception if I introduce a personal interest; I am not speaking for my party in this specific area.  In the west of Ireland there is an industry with which I am connected, the seaweed <Col N="1059" /> industry.  I am declaring my interest so that it is not suggested at a later stage that I was speaking from personal motivation.  In that industry there is a road haulage problem as well.  A number of prosecutions took place in the courts some years ago which were completely anti-social. The reason they were anti-social is that if one wants to move seaweed fromt the foreshore to a seaweed factory in Connemara, Clare or Mayo and if the system that obtains generally is one in which in a particular village one man owns a tractor and traditionally he has used that tractor to carry in the seaweed of his neighbours as well as his own in circumstances in which CIE or licensed hauliers would not have the least interest in going onto the foreshore, there is a very bad law if he is not catered for.  Having said that, there has not been a problem because the authorities have been helpful in not pressing the issue.  When talking about legislation of this type I wonder if it would be possible for the Minister to accept an amendment under which the carriage of seaweed for these very sensible human reasons would be exempt.  It is a small aspect of national life but it is important where we live.  It is such a tiny factor nationally that an amendment in this area would not, in my view, be creating a precedent in relation to any other type of commodity.  I would be most appreciative if the Minister could look kindly at what I have been saying which, indeed, is to the general interest of the semi-State company involved in this sector also.</P>
    <P>The lifting of the restrictions for the licensed haulage contractors is desirable because we had farcical anomalies which were completely outdated where individual haulage people had plates, for example, for one vehicle licence and under which, if this person was a keen person providing a good service he could only expand in his business by purchasing other businesses.  That was an unacceptable position.  The fact that the Bill proposes to authorise six vehicles per licence for those who had one vehicle licence previously is most <Col N="1060" /> welcome.  The extension of that by a multiplier of six down the line is very sensible and should provide a much more efficient road transport service, which will be welcomed by the private sector.  It might at last help to achieve the desired objective of a lesser volume of traffic on the roads which would be more concentrated in the hands of professional people.  Certainly, the restrictions which we have had to date have had a counter-productive effect.  In my view the more one liberalises in this area the more one is going to have the possibility of achieving the objectives in an age where our roads are more than inadequate for the traffic they are bearing.</P>
    <P>The international haulage market issue and the liberalisation there in so far as refrigerated haulage and other export transport is concerned is also welcomed by my party, because in that area we are not in the national arena and we are not talking about competition within this island.  We are talking about the possibility of building up what could effectively be termed a new industry.  It seems to me that the more we encourage Irish companies to get involved in international haulage the more we are directly creating more jobs in a new sector and, of course, we are providing a much better service for the vital links which we need in export fields as an island which is vitally concerned with the issue of exports.  There is scope outside as well.  Liberalisation there is necessary.  The effects of lesser reliance on hauliers from other countries which this should have are most welcome.</P>
    <P>With the two views which I expressed contrary to the Bill&mdash;the possibility of increasing under section 2 the exemption from licensing authorities and, the consideration that the Minister might give to increasing the 2.5 metric tonnes unladen and 6 metric tonnes laden to perhaps the ten tonne mark&mdash;I welcome it.  What I have suggested could be done without hurting anybody and would make for better law.  Frankly, my view is that while the Minister is easing the position by introducing this section, <Col N="1061" /> for the future the law will still not be adhered to and a coach and four will continue to be driven through that section.  It would be more realistic for the Minister to face that fact now.  We know the history.  We had a 1933 Act and we had amendments in 1971. Effectively, this is the last year in which we are talking about amending road transport legislation for perhaps another decade and it would be, in my view, wiser of the Minister to think in terms of the 1980s in this area.  I would welcome his views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to speak on this Bill.  As has been said by the previous speaker there is a great need for rationalisation and liberalisation of our transport industry. When the first Bill dealing with transport was brought in in 1933, the needs of the transport industry were very few because they were servicing a small industrial sector.  As industrial expansion has taken place there is a need for a very professional attitude towards transportation.  The support that is given to industry by the transport industry is not often taken cognisance of by many people.  One will hear a lot of criticism of the industry because of the size of their vehicles, the speed they travel along the roads and the damage they do on the roads, but in effect the damage done to the roads is not caused by the vehicles but because we have not got a road system capable of holding these vehicles which are a necessary support to every industrial enterprise here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we have an efficient transport system we can have an efficient industrial sector because our goods will be transported quickly and efficiently from place to place.  We need a professional transport industry.  I welcome the Bill which allows for the liberalisation of the road hauliers' licensing system and gives them an opportunity to multiply their existing licences by six.  It was proposed by the Coalition Government that there should be complete liberalisation in this regard and that all road haulage licensees should have an unlimited number of vehicles per licence.  I do not think this would lead to an efficient industry.  There <Col N="1062" /> must be a cut-off point and the Minister has reached it in six.</P>
    <P>The road haulage industry is becoming more professional and in the liberalisation to six vehicles per licence the efficient operator will have a way of adapting his fleet to the needs of the area he serves.  Up to now because of the single licence system he was possibly stuck with operating within one area.  He did not have the capability of adapting his fleet for the varying types of commodities for which he was sometimes asked to contract.  One needs flats, articulated vehicles and low-strung vehicles.  One needs a lot of different types of vehicles to deal with the varying items which have to be hauled on our roads.</P>
    <P>A more professional road haulage system would give the operators scope to make the profits which are needed to maintain the fleets in the manner in which they should be maintained.  I agree with the Minister that the transfer from own-account business to road haulage transporters is a necessary one because too often in the past it has been the case that own-account people have felt that the transportation of their goods was a necessary evil and the last thing they felt should be maintained in their company in a reasonable manner was the truck or the series of trucks used to haul their own goods.  We have found that a lot of the vehicles used by own-account people were not of a high enough quality to be on the roads and, in actual fact, were a danger in many cases.  This is not always the case. Some of the own-account hauliers are amongst the most efficient in keeping their trucks in order.  I would not like every own-account person to be tarred with the brush of being inefficient in the maintenance of his vehicle.</P>
    <P>The Bill must be made effective.  We can bring a Bill in but if it is not effectively policed it is going to be of no use.  At present we have in the Carriage Office what I would consider to be an understaffing position.  This means that there are not sufficient people on the road to check on the use of licences or to check on the vehicles operating.  This is an area which must be looked into.  A Bill is only as <Col N="1063" /> effective as the operation of it.  There must be a proper means of checking the use of the extra licences issued. The extra licences give the haulage contractors the necessary leeway to increase their fleets without the severe burden which was placed on them in the past of having to purchase licences at very inflated rates.  This must lead to efficiency in the industry.  They can now invest their money in the fleet rather than in purchasing new licences.</P>
    <P>It is time that a transport authority was set up here to continue looking into the needs of the transport industry. The Minister is of the opinion that this is necessary also.  I sincerely hope it comes into force in the near future. I also feel that the fines to be imposed under section 2 are reasonable considering the liberalisation that has taken place.  However, I feel that they should be mandatory.  It might seem strong to use the word &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; but there is a degree of liberalisation allowed now and I do not think there will be any need for the illegal haulage that was taking place in the past.  The fact that there has been liberalisation will mean that there will be more scope for people to increase their fleets.  In this regard I do not think that CIE in future should be allowed to plate vehicles indiscriminately.  If CIE in future need to bring in outside haulage units to work for them they should use the licensed haulier.</P>
    <P>The liberalisation in regard to the smaller vehicles, the 2½ to 6½ ton, is a very good move because it is becoming increasingly impossible to get small parcels and small amounts of goods transported from place to place. CIE have cut out the carriage of small parcels from place to place where the fast-track-buses or the super-fast-buses operate.  It is virtually impossible, for instance, to get a parcel by bus from Kilkenny to Clonmel.  It now takes three days, and that is only 30 miles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the bus take three days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The bus does not take three days but the parcel takes three <Col N="1064" /> days.  There is a need for liberalisation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator think that six tons is enough?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>One can have a cut-off point in anything and six tons is as good a cut-off point as any.  The use of this will be in the transportation of the small lot, the ton, the ½ ton or the three ton lot.  No matter what cut-off point we have I do not feel everybody would be satisfied.  We will now have as good a cut-off point as any other.</P>
      <P>Though it has caused trouble in the past I am glad there are exemptions in the agricultural area, particularly in the area of wheat and corn during the season.  As has been stated by Senator Staunton it is necessary to get the grain from the field into the mill immediately and it might not be possible in certain areas to get this done by outside transport.</P>
      <P>One section states that vehicles being used by the haulage industry will be made subject to quality requirements to be drawn up under EEC auspices.  This will be helped by the liberalisation, because we will get more professional people in transport and the repair and maintenance of vehicles will be up to the standard required by EEC in this regard.  The transfer of business from own-account to the road haulage licensee is necessary.  It will mean that we will have, more than likely, fewer trucks on the road.  It will help industry to divert scarce resources from transport to the actual business in which they are involved.  They will be able to use the licensees to a greater degree than they have been in the past. There has been liberalisation in the international sector, and this is welcome because the efficient transportation of goods from here to the Continent is of paramount importance, particularly in the refrigerated area of the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a very efficient international haulage association here and they are to be complimented on what they have done in the past towards getting our goods to the continental markets speedily and efficiently.  I am glad to see that the Minister is looking into the possibility of getting over all the <Col N="1065" /> red-tape that has to be gone into by road hauliers in dealing with exports and that he is talking with the Italian authorities about a bilateral agreement.</P>
    <P>This Bill will, to a large degree, satisfy the needs of the haulage industry. There may be small anomalies in it but in general it is a good Bill which will be welcomed by the haulage industry.  If it is satisfactory to the haulage industry it will be satisfactory to our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Minister of two statements.  The first comes from his own party's manifesto which states:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will establish a transport authority to investigate and report on the measures necessary to achieve the most efficient and economic transport system for goods and passengers having regard to the need to maintain a flexible competitive transport system.</P>
      <P>The second quotation is:</P>
      <P>...ours is not to reason why, but to pay up.  Perhaps we should consider putting aside some money and advertising&mdash;&ldquo;Wanted. One transport policy for small country.  Large reward offered.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That quotation is from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 28 July 1973, from an article written by Dr. Martin O'Donoghue, now Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  That was 1973.  Perhaps Dr. O'Donoghue has been converted since then.</P>
      <P>This Bill just is not getting anywhere at all.  It is enforcing restrictions in an industry which if the restrictions were placed by private individuals or private industries would immediately be challenged by the Restrictive Practices Commission.  I am pretty sure we will be forced into the situation by the EEC of abolishing our licences altogether in the near future.  That is what this Bill should have done.  The haulage system is already out of control. Other speakers have pointed out that in certain areas, as far as certain commodities and certain goods are concerned, the law is not being applied at all.  Everybody knows this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as farm produce is concerned people are hauling other people's farm <Col N="1066" /> produce without licences right, left and centre, and they are perfectly right.  Senator Staunton has made that point.</P>
    <P>The original intention of a restrictive licensing system as far as haulage of goods was concerned was to protect our transport system.  As Senator Lanigan has pointed out it was established in 1933 when the whole economic situation was entirely different. We are in the latter quarter of the twentieth century now and I notice in the Minister's speech that he has never once mentioned the need to protect CIE.  Since that was the reason for issuing restrictive licences what is the point in continuing them?  Why cannot we abolish the licences?  The situation is that only a handful of licences have been issued since 1933.  A licence now can change hands at a cost of about £9,000 and that cost is immediately added to the price the consumer has to pay for his transport.</P>
    <P>Those who have held licences have done well out of them since most of them are out since 1933 and I would like to see all those licences abolished. The only licensing system we should have is one of quality of vehicle, safety factors being taken into account. I notice that most of the Western European countries&mdash;if you exclude Portugal and Greece&mdash;we are the only country which does not have regular mandatory inspections of goods vehicles.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of licensing there should be, and there should not be any more restriction.  Hauliers have done well.  The hauliers who are already in business and work efficiently would do even better and those who have not got licences should not have to buy somebody else's business and pay a premium of £9,000 to get their plate. They should be able to run their lorries and haul anybody's goods without restriction.</P>
    <P>I should like to give some figures to illustrate the bad situation we are in relative to Northern Ireland where there is no restriction on vehicle licences.  I am going to give figures for tonnage of cross-Border haulage since 1967 and anybody who travels around the road in the south sees fleets of vehicles from Northern Ireland.  They <Col N="1067" /> are running the stuff right, left and centre all over the country, and the reason for this is because our own licensing system is so restriotive.  Incidentally, if one is talking about cross-Border haulage, I see that the railway across the Border in south Armagh was blown up again last night for the umpteenth time.  It seems to me that those people&mdash;presumably the Provisional IRA&mdash;who blow up railways so regularly in south Armagh must be opposed to Irish unity because they seem to be restricting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a cross-Border haulage problem and it must be dealt with.  If one wants to restrict communication between the two parts of the country one must be opposed to Irish unity.  The figures I wish to give as far as cross-Border haulage is concerned are that in 1967 out of a total of 200,000 tons of cross-Border traffic 100,000 was hauled by carriers in Northern Ireland and 100,000 by carriers based in the south; in 1968 the figures were 180,000 tons by northern based carriers, 110,000 tons by southern based carriers; in 1969 265,000 tons by northern based carriers and 100,000 tons by southern based carriers; in 1970 275,000 tons by northern based carriers, 85,000 tons by southern based carriers; in 1971 257,000 tons hauled by northern based carriers, 95,000 tons hauled by southern based carriers; in 1972 233,000 tons hauled by northern based carriers, 93,000 tons by southern based carriers; and in 1973 269,000 tons hauled by northern based carriers, 94,000 tons hauled by southern based carriers.  Those figures are from the Confederation of Irish Industries Report on road freight transport during 1973-74.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1973 the northern based carriers hauled three times as much traffic across the Border as the southern based carriers.  That gives a clear idea of the state of our transport industry.  We cannot compete. This is not saying that all the goods are coming from the north to the <Col N="1068" /> south, because they are not.  The system of restrictive licensing is holding us back, and I think that all licences should be abolished.  However, I seem to be a lone voice crying in the wilderness.  I know that the present licensed hauliers form a powerful lobby and, of course, this would not suit them.  It might be in the national economic interest.  I would say to the present licensed hauliers that they would do extremely well.  There are very efficient licensed hauliers working in this part of the country, and under an open ended system they would do as well if not better than they are doing at the moment.  The efficient hauliers would score, the inefficient would fail and the economy would benefit because costs of haulage would go down dramatically if we did not have the licensing system.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the <i>raison d'etre</i> for it now is.  It was introduced to deal with the situation in 1933 to protect our own public transport system, and there is no need for that anymore.  The Minister in his address made no case for a continuation of the licences.  He made no case for the protection of CIE and at this stage that case is no longer a valid one, and so we should do what is being done in the other European countries and we will be forced to do that by EEC regulations. We will be forced to open our haulage to allow our people to haul when and where they will.  Essentially, the only restriction will be on the quality and the safety of the vehicles involved. Everybody knows that own account haulage is inefficient because one takes one's own product from one place to another and one supposedly comes back with one's lorry empty, but very few own account hauliers do.  The law is broken right left and centre, and the question is, if the law is going to be changed is it still going to be broken right, left and centre?  No creamery pays any attention to the law as it stands.  Everybody knows people are hauling milk in all directions without licences and they are perfectly right to, because the legislation under which we are operating is outdated and I regret to say that the Department have not had the nerve and they have not taken the plunge <Col N="1069" /> that they should have taken and they have not gone the whole hog.</P>
    <P>We are talking about everybody welcoming the liberalisation of transport legislation.  Yet a Bill that was introduced in 1976 is less restrictive than this Bill.  I cannot see what the reason is.  Nobody seems to have made a case for it.  The only thing that I can think of is that the hauliers' lobby has a good deal of muscle and it is getting these restrictions maintained.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have restrictions all farm produce should be exempt. There is no argument for allowing the transport of livestock unlicensed and in prohibiting the transport of horses.  Fish should be exempt.  It needs to be hauled rapidly in refrigerator transport from one county to another.</P>
    <P>The Minister has some liberalisation of the laws as far as agricultural commodities are concerned, but if he is going to keep restrictive licences he should exempt all of our agricultural produce because agriculture is our most important industry&mdash;it has become so much more important and our agricultural industry so much more efficient since we entered the EEC.  If we are going to maintain our competitiveness, and I have no doubt that the Irish agricultural industry can, then we should help the industry by granting total exemption for all agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>I want to put down a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  We badly need the establishment of a transport authority and the working out of an overall transport policy, because if we do not have that we are going to get this piecemeal type of legislation which is minimal liberalisation of a very much out-dated 40-year-old restrictive legislation, and it is not in our overall national economic interest.  It may be in the interest of certain small groups.</P>
    <P>The position of CIE and the whole economy needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister was here when I spoke on the transport debate before but he may know that I am a keen supporter of CIE.  I cannot find any argument in either his speech in the Dáil on this Bill, or in the Seanad, about the need to protect CIE.  We are moving away from that <Col N="1070" /> situation as far as road haulage is concerned and we need a national transport authority.  We need to work out a coherent national transport policy.  What worries me is that we are going to be forced by the EEC to make radical changes in our transport legislation without making up our own minds.  That is what is going to happen and that is what is going to abolish all these restrictive practices.  It is a pity that we have not taken our courage into own own hands and made up our own minds about the sort of policy that we need before we are forced to make changes by the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just one or two points which I want to make very quickly as there appears to be a large measure of agreement on this Bill on both sides of the House.  The basic aim of the Bill is to try to encourage people who are involved in private transport, what has been called own account transport, which I see from the Minister's speech accounts for up to 80 per cent of freight in this country, to use CIE and to use other licensed professional hauliers.  It is very touching to here Senator West worrying about protecting CIE because from my reading of this Bill and from reading the Minister's speech in the Dáil it is clear that one of the purposes of the Bill is to attract business to professional hauliers.  In doing that one will of course attract business to CIE as professional hauliers.  I see the Bill as being of considerable help to CIE and to professional hauliers generally and not, as Senator West was pointing out, in any way damaging to CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has been made on a number of occasions, and it is well worth making again, that private transport, or what is being called own account transport, is very uneconomic here for the reasons given, the fact that one carries to one area and perhaps not back and all of these other inefficiencies in the system.  It also adds to congestion on our roads but with professional hauliers like CIE and the other private professional hauliers there is no reason for the plethora of trucks on our roads.  If we can attract them away from this and get <Col N="1071" /> them to use the professionals in the business it will be to our advantage and that is well worth bearing in mind. That is the overall purpose of this Bill and if we bear that in mind then we will not get ourselves into legal knots and tangles about multipliers and so on.  Figures from Northern Ireland have shown that when they started to liberalise the transport there that it led to a reduction in the total number of vehicles on the roads and I can only hope that we achieve a similar result here.  I believe that we will.</P>
    <P>Another point which I would like to make is that most companies here, particularly small companies, could apply their funds far better than by providing their own transport and this is so if there are top class professional hauliers available for them.  They could put their money into areas which will more directly affect the job-creation programme.  If the problem of providing their own transport is taken off their backs then I believe they will be able to do that.</P>
    <P>I have a personal worry here which is probably the subject for another debate, perhaps under the heading of the environment, but I would like to mention that I am very concerned about the bigger trucks on our roads, the juggernauts.  They are dangerous, they damage the roads, they damage the health of our people generally.  When we come to discussing environment in this House that is something we should take into consideration.  The juggernaut is a modern social monster and is something that all of us as a community in this country will have to look at closely in the years ahead. It often struck me as an ordinary individual travelling up and down to the west and down to Cork that the mainline rail should be used a lot more by people who want to haul stuff around this country.  It does not make sense to be stuck behind a stream of trucks going down to Cork and at the same time there is a railroad going that same way.  There is no reason why CIE and all the interests involved could not organise it so that freight travels by rail as much as possible, particularly on mainline routes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> While CIE are relatively efficient in that area, road hauliers, including CIE, would have to reach a very high level of professional competence because their job is to induce people to come from private owners and do business with them.  This Bill is helping them in that and CIE and the other professional hauliers should at this stage try to increase their efficiency. By doing that they will induce people to do business with them.</P>
    <P>Some 70 per cent of the haulier firms operate one-vehicle fleets.  Senator West said that this Bill was not really a liberalisation Bill.  It is clear that if there is a large investment needed to expand to up to six vehicles per licence this is going to be difficult for most of the one-vehicle owners.  If this legislation is to achieve what it set out to achieve then it is necessary that they get the encouragement to take on that expansion.  If these one-vehicle fleets can expand to the extent of what is being permitted in this Bill, and even that leaves them a long way to climb, then it is sufficiently liberalising.  Senator West has nothing to worry about.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope we can very shortly have an overall review of transport in this country to co-ordinate better the freight services by train, bus, plane and so on and to discuss the future developments of our roads but, I appreciate this cannot be done under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in their election manifesto promised to introduce a transport consultative commission and I know that the Minister is anxious about this and is pursuing it.  I would like this commission at some stage to take a long hard look at the type of problem which I have outlined briefly, particularly in regard to what I can only describe as this modern social monster of the juggernaut.  In general, however, this is a very good Bill.  It goes a long way towards improving our haulage industry.  I thank the Minister in particular for an excellent introductory speech, some 18 pages of an introductory speech, which clearly lays out the problems and the solutions as he sees them.  It shows the <Col N="1073" /> respect which the Minister has for the Seanad when he has produced a document like this.  It is very well put together.  It is a very good Bill.  It is a start to revolutionise the haulage business and that can only be to our benefit in the end.  In the long term we in this community must all sit down and take an overall look at the problems on our roads, the clogging up by trucks and all the environment problems.  I hope at some future stage in this Seanad that we can tackle that grave social problem which we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>Few people will deny that some degree of liberalisation was desirable, if not necessary, in this question of freight haulage.  However, knowing that this Bill will be particularly welcome to professional licensees at the moment who see in it certain opportunities for themselves, I think it is the business of this House to look at the reasons behind these liberalisation measures, and try and tease out the implications of such liberalisation not only for the business of commercial haulage but also for its effects on the environment.  I am glad that Senator Brennan has raised the matter of environment because it is impossible to isolate such liberalisation as is embodied in the provisions of this Bill from the consequences on the environment.  It is rather sad to find that there is as low as 10 per cent of freight haulage carried by the professional licensees, and the Minister has attributed this largely to the restrictive legislation which has existed to date.  But I wonder if that small percentage by professional licensees, including the semi-State body of CIE, can be largely attributed to restrictive legislation.  There may always be a preference on the part of business people and manufacturers to have their own transport for the haulage of freight and I wonder if in the past they have been inclined to provide their own transport because it was more convenient; also on the grounds of cost and perhaps even more important on the grounds that they would do the operation more efficiently than professional hauliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is any validity in these aspects of convenience and efficiency, <Col N="1074" /> and even cost, I wonder whether the provisions of this Bill will altogether eliminate these as the reasons for the low percentage carried by professional hauliers.  Will the professional licensee provide a more attractive proposition for the owners of businesses?  I think these are the sort of questions we should try to tease out for answer. Another question that can be asked is &ldquo;Will this Bill stop illegal haulage?&rdquo;. I am afraid we will always have an amount of illegal haulage no matter what provisions or what legislation we bring in, even though the Minister feels that this Bill will reduce the need for severe fines as illegal haulage becomes less attractive through licensed hauliers being in a position to operate more extensively.  I repeat, I am afraid we are always going to have people trying illegal haulage and it is on the question of fines that I find myself at odds with the provisions in the Bill. It is rather strange that the fine will now be a maximum of £500 as against a maximum, for the past 20 years, of £320.  The penalty of forfeiture has been abolished altogether.  I would have thought in the circumstances of this abolition of forfeiture that the fine should have been much higher than it will be.  Threats of fines are not in themselves sufficient as a deterrent for illegal haulage and there must be very visible signs of action in this respect and there must be conviction, if the rationalisation we all seek in freight haulage is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>If, in the long term, this rationalisation is achieved, I feel that unfortunately in the short term we are going to see a vast increase in the number of freight haulage trucks on our roads. That could mean that we are going to have much greater freight road use than is desirable in the context of our present environmental problems particularly in regard to roads.  We should have, even now, a greater amount of freight haulage put on our railway lines to relieve the roads.  The Minister sees in his and my native county of Louth certain problems in regard to the condition of the roads in that county being suitable to carry present volumes of freight haulage.  He knows as well as I do that roads such as the Dundalk/Castleblayney road, Drogheda/Navan <Col N="1075" /> road, Ardee/Mullingar road, and even parts of the national primary routes are not able to carry the frequency and the volume of freight haulage which is at present experienced.</P>
    <P>I think this is an example of the implications involved in the liberalisation measures in this Bill that have not been seen through by the Department to the point of realising the effect such liberalisation may well have.</P>
    <P>I also wonder at the risk involved with the increase in the number of vehicles per licence which this Bill will provide, namely, that a licensee can now have six vehicles on the road with a single licence.  It could well lead to a speculative position with regard to this question of licence acquisition, and licence purchasing.  That in itself could lead to inflation in the value of licences which could well result in an increase in the costs of freight haulage, and start a vicious cycle in process which might well undo a lot of the good work which is envisaged in this liberalisation.</P>
    <P>The question of the effects on CIE has been raised.  I fear there may be a further diminution in the amount of freight haulage operated by CIE.  We know the restrictions and constraints within which this semi-State body have always operated in regard to sufficient Exchequer funds being available for the performance of their services.  The liberalisation envisaged by this Bill which will certainly lead, even in the short term, to an increase in the number of vehicles by professional individual hauliers could well result in a diminution in the haulage which CIE will be asked to carry, and in turn to a reduction in employment.  The qualifications for eligibility for a licence have already been laid down by EEC directive.  I would ask the Minister if this directive is at present in operation or will it be brought in on a phased basis?</P>
    <P>I would put to the Minister the position in regard to foreigners coming into this country and taking out licences and putting up to a maximum of 80 vehicles, permissible under such licences, on the road.  We appreciate <Col N="1076" /> that in the Irish context that might not be open to many Irish persons at present but certainly there are such people within the EEC countries who no doubt are capable of coming in and putting such a vast fleet on the road.  This could lead within a regional basis to a monopoly situation.  I wonder has the Department looked into this and seen the implications that could be inherent.  I notice that the EEC directive on vehicle testing and vehicle safety on the roads will not be fully operational until 1983.  What is the degree of the phasing in of this directive between now and 1983?  As I foresee a big increase in the number of vehicles going on the roads in the haulage business in the short term, I think this question of vehicle safety and vehicle testing is most urgent and important.  I would ask the Minister if he could give us the present position, and the likely outcome of the thorny question of tachographs which in the case of the UK has led to a pending court case.  Where does Ireland stand in this regard?  This tachograph system &mdash;where the drivers of haulage vehicles must comply with certain checks and controls as to safety rules on day-to-day operations&mdash;is a most desirable input into this industry and I would hate to think that there would be much of a delay in regard to its introduction in this country.</P>
    <P>Summing up, I feel that this Bill will be welcomed particularly by professional hauliers who will be in a position to avail of its opportunities but I do not think that should deter us from spelling out the implications in regard to the large increase in vehicles which will be going on the roads in the short term as a result of the Bill; also the effects of delay in vehicle testing which will not be fully operational until another five years; the problems which the increase in haulage vehicles will bring to our roads which are vastly under-equipped for the volume and frequency of haulage traffic at present.  The motivation behind the Bill certainly is a reasonable one.  There have been restrictions, but I think the Bill is largely a step into the dark and only time will tell us exactly how beneficial it has been in achieving that long term rationalisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill in that it is controlled liberalisation of the transport industry.  I would specially refer to the fact that it is controlled because it has been said the thing to do is to liberalise it completely without any future control. That would not be a good thing to do. What was intended in the legislation in 1933 was to control haulage so that CIE could expand and so that those already in the haulage business could expand.  Over the years that did not work.  Therefore today we could decide to liberalise transport completely. We might not be exactly right in our decision and thereby we might lose control.  Having had control over the industry for so long it would be completely unfair to relax it and leave it wide open immediately.</P>
      <P>Two main things have happened. One is that our transport has been taken over to a certain extent by vehicles from outside the country.  We have been given figures on this by Senator West.  Secondly, own goods transport has increased considerably. How did this happen?  Naturally transport from outside was able to take up the slack, because we had not the vehicles on the road due to the control of our transport.  But why, then, has own goods transport in creased to a certain extent?  It has been said that it is inefficient.  I agree with that, because one has the situation where a load can be sent from Dublin to Cork and the vehicle will come back empty and a load will go from Cork to Dublin and the vehicle will come back empty, whereas one vehicle could do the work of the two.  That does not cover the whole situation.  There is also the question that own transport has come in because goods can be delivered from the factory right to the points at which they are wanted.  This is not always possible with public transport.  Also, if specialised vehicles are needed for certain goods which require volume not load, special vehicles are made for them.  Today there are special carriers for cement, flour, oil, liquid gas and so on.  For that reason own goods transport has increased.  It cannot just simply be replaced tomorrow by licensed hauliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> What does this Bill do?  This Bill will obviously increase the number of our vehicles to make our hauliers competitive to the vehicles coming from outside the country, but it will not necessarily solve all the problems.  The Bill will create the condition to solve the problems, but it will be essential when this Bill is law that all hauliers carefully survey the market and relate their haulage and the facilities they give if they are going to convert the trade.  Therefore we look to an efficient haulage industry so that eventually when, as the Minister says, there will be agreements with other countries in the EEC we can take our place and expand into international haulage as well.  It has been said that this will increase the number of vehicles on the road.  That is not what is intended. This should reduce the number of vehicles on the road, because if we halve inefficient own haulage and gain the haulage done by hauliers from outside the country, we are merely replacing the vehicles.</P>
    <P>I look to the day when we can have a discussion on not alone transport but on transport relating to the environment, because we have a problem there which must be discussed at some length. I welcome this Bill as a movement towards the liberalisation of transport and not something which could create chaos, as complete liberalisation would probably do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not welcome the Bill completely, but I am at any time prepared to welcome a liberalisation of the laws or regulations which govern road transport.  We had restrictive regulations which over the years did a certain amount of damage to our economy by holding up progress in manufacturing industry and agriculture to some extent and by putting people into a situation where they have had to provide their own transport in parts of the country that were not very well serviced by licensed hauliers or by CIE, who were not all that interested or were not in a position for one reason or another to give the sort of service that was required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome a situation in which industry will be able to relieve itself of the responsibility and burden of providing <Col N="1079" /> transport.  At present, with the cost of a unit possibly in the region of £20,000 or more, it is easy to see that even a small fleet of lorries requires the sort of investment that would establish a worth-while industry in which people could be employed. Very often the brains and the initiative that would otherwise have gone into improving manufacturing industry and services of other sorts have been taken up with the provision of transport. Transport does not need a big financier, a big businessman, or a semi-State organisation to deal with it.  We always had too many people offering transport.  There were always illegal hauliers looking for an opportunity at the fairs and the marts.  Because they had no other opportunities, they saw the possibilities.  A lorry could be bought on hire purchase by almost anybody who could get a guarantor or who had any property.</P>
    <P>Therefore people were always prepared to provide that service.  The vested interests may say that it was an inefficient service, that if competitors are allowed in freely they will undercut prices and eventually end up providing a most inefficient service.  What we need in this industry, I believe, is to allow people in to complete freely. I am not saying there should not be any restrictions at all, but today we are moving towards a liberalisation of transport.  Deep down we want to get rid of the restrictive situation we have had; but on the other hand, we are not prepared&mdash;we seem in some way to be apprehensive about it&mdash;to allow in all comers who have the initiative and the ambition to do the job.  We are in one sense opening it up, but on the other hand we are restricting the privilege.  We will not necessarily have the people with the ability to do the job, or people who are anxious to get into business and who see transport as an area where they might be able to give a service and earn a living.  We will have the people who are already in the business, who inherited it.  We will have the people who have held on to a licence they have not used maybe for years but who now can acquire perhaps six licences and can offer the lot for sale to somebody who <Col N="1080" /> must pay a big sum of money for what is in fact a Government licence. That is an aspect I do not like.  In the past Government licences have been offered for sale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>A person who has a licence but who may not use that licence at the moment, and may not be intending to use it, will be able to apply for six licences which he can sell at a very high price.  It is not a good situation automatically to give to somebody a ready-made asset which can be put on the market and sold at <Col N="1081" /> a very high price, thus increasing the cost of transport.  It is wrong that people should have the option of selling a licence given to them by the State.  The Minister has indicated that perhaps this is a liberalisation of the laws.  I take it that the Minister sees himself introducing further measures which will remedy the whole situation. We must bear in mind that legislation which goes through the Houses of the Oireachtas is not very often any sort of a temporary measure.  It takes time to introduce legislation and a lot of people have to be consulted.  Much work will have to be done before another Bill will be introduced.  We usually have legislation like this for too long.  At this stage it would not have been amiss to introduce something more radical, something that might require a little bit more courage and might have, perhaps, annoyed some vested interest.  In the interest of the economy we should have gone a little further.</P>
      <P>The other point that arises relates to giving the opportunity to people to invest in vehicles and engage in international haulage.  We must consider the very high cost of purchasing vehicles here compared with cost in the countries from which our competitors come.  This has put an undue burden on the whole haulage industry. The high cost of vehicles including spare parts and so on has been unjustified. It is depressing for some people in this part of Ireland to realise that just a few miles away they can buy spare parts and new and secondhand vehicles at a fraction of the cost that they are forced to pay for them here.  What I am saying is probably not entirely in order, but it is relevant to what we are discussing. In the context of international haulage, it should be realised from the beginning that we will be at this disadvantage.</P>

    <P>Another factor was not taken into consideration in the whole calculation. We get easily enough the figures of the number of companies that have their own vehicles, the number of plates that are around and the amount of transport done by CIE but there is another big question mark.  Nobody <Col N="1082" /> knows exactly what the situation is in the industry, because there is quite a bit of illegal haulage going on.  There are quite a number of industries which, because they simply cannot afford to tie up the requirements in cash, do not have licensed hauliers available and prepared to give them the right service, and the alternative is a sort of illegal system of haulage of which nobody really knows the extent.</P>
    <P>These people who buy lorries on the hire purchase system are probably the most efficient people in the business. I have seen young men who are manager/owner/driver, accounts departments and so on being forced to operate under the handicap of the risk of detection knowing that they are breaking the letter of the law if not the spirit of it.  There are a lot of these people.  People in this position should not be forced to carry on outside the law while other less deserving people get complete facilities handed to them so as to engage in the industry.  When we hear figures for the amount of haulage which is being carried on by the various interests involved, those figures cannot be accurate because we just cannot know.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fact that the smaller lorries of under 2.5 tons are being given the opportunity to operate without a licence, this is a useful idea which will have some effect for the better.  The bigger lorries have come in for a lot of criticism lately, but if we look around at our factories and industries which we have built up over the past 20 years we will see that they are established in locations where only big lorries can bring goods in and out. If we had not dismantled our system of railways a lot of these industries could have been located along the railway lines, and new, bigger industries, and co-operatives as in other countries could have been built along the canals and railways which would have provided an alternative.  At the moment it does not seem that we have any easy alternative.  In the last few years the number of lorries and cars using the roads have increased and lorries have got bigger.  The roads have not kept pace with this development. It is harder to drive on the roads today because we have tended to neglect our <Col N="1083" /> roads.  It is obvious to anybody, particularly those who are a long way from the seaports, and in the west of Ireland, where goods have to be transported, that we must take this situation very seriously.  The answer is not to take the juggernauts off the roads.  We cannot do it, and if it was done we would have to replace them with a big number of smaller vehicles. Nobody has calculated that that will produce less noise or less pollution of any sort, or that they will be less of a hazard on the road.  The juggernauts may be anti-social, the cars whistling past at 70 and 80 miles an hour are also anti-social, and the number of cars on the road is anti-social. Many things are anti-social, but we will have to fit the roads to carry the sort of traffic which industry requires at present.</P>
    <P>The cost of labour and administration has become so great that there is no alternative to putting bigger loads behind single engines driven by as few people as possible.  We may not like it but that is a necessity if we are to survive.  We can only improve the situation by providing the sort of roads on which these vehicles can travel with the least possible obstructions.  It sounds liberal and it apparently catches the ear of the media to condemn the juggernauts and so on, but that is not a solution.  What we have to find is a means of transporting goods with the least possible cost, because that is what we must do if we are to compete and to save and create jobs. We must solve the problem and condemn, out of hand, vehicles that make noise.  We should work towards a situation where those vehicles are as clean as possible, take up as little space as possible, and have the sort of engines that can take them up hills without holding up traffic.  We have also an obligation to spend money on roads, because there are a lot of roads here where one articulated lorry can hold up 50 cars for seven or eight miles. There is no point in blaming the lorry, we must invest money that is required to enable traffic to move more freely.</P>
    <P>There is another area which should have been looked at.  I spoke about <Col N="1084" /> illegal haulage in the context of the ordinary industrialist who cannot afford to tie up so much cash in vehicles.  He tends to employ people who are prepared to buy a lorry and haul, perhaps without a licence.  This has been done more in the agricultural industry than anywhere else.  In every area the co-operatives have been using agricultural vehicles because some of the work is seasonal, and tractors can do a morning's hauling of meat for the co-operative delivery and can take back a load of meal or manure and so on.  In most parts of Ireland one would have to be blind not to see that a vast amount of goods are being handled in this way by part-time farmers who do this job on the side for the co-operatives.  At this stage we should have cleared the road for these people.  We should have legalised what is going on.  Maybe they are not being prosecuted as they used to be, and they are not being checked on, but the industry requires that they be allowed to continue.  They give a service that will not be given by the bigger licensed hauliers and certainly will not be given by semi-State bodies or bigger companies.  They are a necessity as far as the agricultural community and the co-operatives are concerned.  Under this Bill I would like to see them being cleared of the guilt under which they have operated for the past few years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it is a certain measure of liberalisation, but it is being done in the wrong direction. We could have done a better job if we were prepared to take a little risk and show a little more courage.  The situation has already done considerable damage to our economy.  We have had far too many lorries going the roads empty because, for one reason or another, when goods are delivered to the city, lorries go back empty a 100 miles, or maybe 150 miles to the west of Ireland because they could not legally take this, that or the other.  We should have a complete opening up of the whole haulage business.  I would like to see a situation where people in the industry here could compete on equal terms with people from outside. The sooner that situation comes about the better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome the change in legislation.  Basically, we are bound to agree that after a period of 40 years without any new Bill on this subject, the type of legislation we may now get might be imperfect but it provides a framework from which to work.  There are a lot of new areas to be covered.  Every Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas could have a different solution to the problems as they see them.  I see the Bill as contributing to the alleviation of a big national problem.  We have outdated transport legislation, and as a result, both our public and our private transport are far from being competitive in the European sense.  The Bill provides for both private hauliers and public transport to get themselves into a competitive position.</P>
      <P>I live in an area where I certainly am in a position to judge what outside transport is doing to this country.  I can comment fairly accurately on the type of transport and some of the reasons for the difficulties our transport system experiences.  As a result of more liberalisation such as is provided in this Bill transport in Northern Ireland and in Britain has actually flourished.  The private haulier has huge fleets of trucks, Northern Ireland carriers have a very substantial fleet of vehicles and are doing a very healthy business.  I think the public transport and the private haulier in Northern Ireland are very, very aggressive, with modern vehicles, and they are doing a good job.  In other words, transport in Northern Ireland is healthy and is soundly based while here the restrictions have left it without incentive and not a business with great attractions in which either CIE or private hauliers want to spend a great deal of effort and money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new legislation sets guidelines and it gives hope to those who were earning their living in the past by transport, of expanding their business and of having a more soundly based business.  I am pleased that the legislation has now been introduced and, as they say, I do not expect that it will provide a complete answer because you could come back in six months' time and see where the legislation <Col N="1086" /> did not cover certain areas. That is to be expected.  In general, I am satisfied that it does a good job. I would like to ask the Minister, and I shall be very interested in his reply, first of all about restrictions.  There were no restrictions on certain goods and the Bill provides that the carriage of wheat and some farm products is not under control: I am asking the Minister now if he thought of widening this area because transport now forms a big part of the cost of any product.  I could give a list, but lime, which is certainly a big item as far as the agricultural industry is concerned comes to mind first.  The cost of lime at the lime quarry is very small in relation to transport costs. Some of the lime quarries or lime producing companies have their own transport and they have got licences in the past.  I wonder are they affected?  Will the licences that have been issued to lime quarries or lime producing companies be eligible for multiplication?  If that were so, actually it would be quite a serious blow to those depending on drawing lime for part of their income and I think it would hit CIE; certainly it would hit them very severely in my county.</P>
    <P>Most members of the Seanad who make a contribution would have, like myself, wide interests.  I have basically an interest in those who are employed in CIE and public transport in County Donegal, the truck drivers, their helpers, their mechanics in the garage and those who service the vehicles, the office staff, right across the board, the whole structure of administration of public transport in county Donegal and in the North West.  I am satisfied that this Bill will encourage CIE to do what they should have done a long time ago&mdash;and I make no apologies for criticising the lack of initiative as far as CIE are concerned.  CIE sat back while they had plenty of money to back them up, at least they could have got the money.  They sat back to let the European haulier, the British haulier and the Northern Ireland haulier come in and take the business from under their feet.  It is fair to criticise CIE for having allowed this to happen.  Some of the speakers on the other side of the House could <Col N="1087" /> have usefully recognised that the restrictions placed by the previous Government on the expansion policy and the restriction on employment by CIE contributed to the lack of initiative by CIE, because when our entry into the Common Market should have been matched by a big expansion by CIE of their road freight business, when the whole opportunity presented itself and the whole area opened up, there was certainly a very poor response from our public transport here.  The results have been very devastating.</P>
    <P>Our public transport and our private hauliers have a lot of leeway now to make up.  This Bill makes a useful contribution because it recognises under many headings that there has been a lack of progress in public transport in this country.  I am hopeful that a new approach will emerge after the introduction of this legislation.  I also welcome the provisions under section 4 whereby the Minister now has powers to grant licences for international haulage. That strengthens the hauliers greatly in so far as it puts them on a sound competitive basis and we will no longer be depending on those that have been well equipped with 40-foot and longer vehicles with very well established container traffic.  I have quite a lot of experience of this.  I see factories and industrial estates; I see the awkward raw material&mdash;I am talking of rolls of steel and I could give lists of other awkward material which is difficult to draw&mdash;and CIE get the haulage from the ship to the factory of this difficult traffic and they are not equipped with containers to take the finished goods out. Some companies are even coming from Germany to collect the finished goods here.  The fact that the Minister is now empowered in the Bill to grant licences for international haulage will encourage people here in the transport business to expand and to take on this side of the business as well.  I am satisfied that that establishes a new footing here for the haulage industry and a new, healthy approach to the haulage of goods that are being manufactured here for export.</P>
    <P>The Minister was also wise in freeing the small vehicle; the two-and-a-half tonner will now be free.  This is very <Col N="1088" /> useful and it is also practical.  A two-and-a-half tonner in the transport world is a very small vehicle, and no useful purpose could be served by licensing those small vehicles.  It leaves a commercial sector of business that would be using small vehicles fairly free to expand&mdash;it does not place restrictions on them&mdash;and it is a useful contribution that will help industry.  It will help small transport users now to base their business more solidly and ensure that they can stay in business and will not be hampered with restrictions.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to clarify one other point regarding removals.  At present, we have quite a big business in removals.  I am not sure that it is clearly covered here.  We are now in a changing world where officials are moving from one country to the other and some are moving across the water, and this is quite a sizeable business.  I would ask the Minister to clarify the position more fully in that context. There is quite a lot of illegal work going on as far as removals are concerned. To me this is the most lucrative side of the whole haulage business and it could go unnoticed.</P>
    <P>Another part of the Bill that I welcome deals with the standard of vehicles.  The Bill has to provide fairly strict standards for vehicles that are being used on the road and those of us who are driving on the road continuously see the 40-foot container vehicles travelling at very high speed. I only hope that we are in a position to implement all the restrictions that the Bill proposes because I see some of the container vehicles driven at 70 and 80 miles an hour.  If any man travels from here to the north, as I do and if he is driving at 60 miles an hour in a car, he is sure to be passed out by at least a half-dozen heavy container vehicles doing anything up to 80 miles an hour.  Sometimes they travel in twos and threes right up close to each other, within a hundred feet of each other at 70 miles an hour. I only hope that the Bill, with its restrictions on the type of vehicle, the condition of the vehicle and the overall restrictions that the Bill can now impose will also make provision for the implementation of these restrictions. <Col N="1089" /> We have a big obligation here.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides the legislation and I only hope that we have the backup to implement it as far as the type of vehicle and its use on the roads here are concerned.  It is popular to talk about the juggernauts on the road but all of us realise it is just part of increasing traffic.  We do not seem to be as active as we should be or could be in regard to tests on vehicles.  I have seen films recently in relation to traffic between Britain and France and I saw where in France they are waiting to do tests on the vehicles.  They do fairly extensive tests.  On certain days every vehicle is tested.  I only hope that we here are no less vigilant in our attention to the problems that we have here.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome the Bill.  I am certain that it provides an opportunity for both public transport and the private haulier to make a better contribution towards the whole haulage industry.  I can see the Bill as an improvement because&mdash;we have to face up to it&mdash;the day is gone when you meet a man who is prepared to deliver goods with an inferior type of vehicle whether it is a case of poor tyres or a poor type of vehicle which may be taxed but may not be insured. That haphazard way is gone. There is need for a very efficient transport system and the Bill encourages that.  I certainly welcome it.  I am sure it is not perfect but it is a good start.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much to say on this Bill except that in certain respects I welcome it.  The whole concept of road haulage is due to be looked at.  It is important that the ideas and the ideals that imbued the minds of those who first nationalised CIE should be considered in the light of the effect this had in time on the lives of the people.  The variety of standards, of occupations and of circumstances of our people is such that road haulage affects some of them to a great extent while it does not affect others except to a very small degree.  The ideal for an economic road haulage system would be a service which would be immediate and economic and which <Col N="1090" /> would provide a reasonable standard of living for the people engaged in it as well as provide the services necessary for the people availing of it.</P>
      <P>Looking at this Bill in that context, certain snags may arise in consequence, for instance, of multiplying by six the number of vehicles in the present ownership of a transport operator, the right it confers on the company or whatever sort of concern is involved.  It appears to me that there are many people in the country who have one of two lorries on the road and it is very much a family structure, where perhaps two brothers or a brother of an owner and a brother-in-law or somebody who is closely associated with him is in a position to operate just this number of vehicles.  We will have to admit that he cannot, for financial reasons or by reason of the scope that he can apply, the hiring of staff or the equipment associated with the maintenance of trucks, avail of the provision for the multiplicity of six.</P>
      <P>That will have the effect that his wealthier colleague up the road or 50 miles away will be able to say: &ldquo;Here is so-and-so down in Ballybofey or whatever the place is, and he is in a small way in this business; he is not going to multiply and we would like to avail ourselves of the opportunity of coming in on whatever share he is unable to provide and taking over that area of goods delivery or transport that he is now covering or would be likely to cover if he had the appropriate number of vehicles.&rdquo;  These people will then start doubling or trebling or acquiring whatever number they will be able to put on the road and the small haulier will be just squeezed out.  That is one of the things that you can be certain will happen.  Where the economic structure is of such a standard and is a family-operated system which is not able to meet financially the challenge of the big operators I can see the small haulier pushed off the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various aspects of haulage in the country where the big haulier, if he had a monopoly or a near monopoly in an area&mdash;and he does not have to have a monopoly like CIE; he <Col N="1091" /> could have it in Connacht or in Leinster or in Ulster&mdash;and if somebody else has to come a long journey to provide service in that area and therefore is not able to do it economically, the other gentleman will start setting as his target the same uneconomic charge as his rival and exploiting the public by reason of the extent that he is able to control the area of operation. This is a circumstance that I think the Minister should try to avoid.  If the Minister were to enable whoever had a smaller vehicle to have the right to purchase six or 12 against two and that right did not extend to anybody else, the monopoly-minded operator would not become excited to the same extent.</P>
    <P>I had a complaint which I brought before the Minister, not the present Minister for Transport and Power but his predecessor, about goods that were sent out from an industrial firm in Cork and consigned to a trader in Granard, County Longford.  They were paid for and they were sent out and they came to Dublin where they remained for more than two weeks, and other goods that the same trader bought in Dublin were allowed to remain for almost two weeks more before they were forwarded.  CIE admitted that in their system of organisation they have plans to make every journey an economic journey and that in consequence of there being a small number of items in the orders of the particular trader, they have to wait until the volume of goods will enable the vehicle involved to be used economically.</P>
    <P>If that is economy it is economy at the wrong end.  It is not economy in the sense of enabling people to get the service that they should get at the time that it is reasonable for them to get it.  If there was competition in that regard, the position might be improved. I do not say that CIE should be wiped off the market; I recognise that a national transport system is vital to this country, but it is also vital that people who are in a position to give an express service for certain kinds of goods, particularly perishable goods should not be forced to have <Col N="1092" /> them transported through CIE or through any other system where delay is detrimental and where early delivery is important to the condition of the goods and service required by the consignee and the people by whom it was consigned.</P>
    <P>The ordinary farmer buys lime subsidised by the Department of Agriculture and the Department subsidise the transport of lime from quarries in Roscommon more than 25 or 28 miles to Granard and at the same time they transport lime from County Cavan which is only eight miles away 27 or 28 miles into south Westmeath. These are circumstances where economics seem to be cast aside and where providing lorries for haulage over a distance and collecting from the Government a sum appropriate to the distance travelled is apparently the ideal towards which the management of CIE seem to be aiming.  This sort of haulage is what we will find when you have a monopoly situation.  CIE had a monopoly for the transport of lime, at least when I was buying it, and they had it to the extent that if a quarry owner owned one lorry he could use that lorry for whatever he could transport in it but he could not improve that set up; he could not buy a second or a third one or could not put his own fleet of lorries into the work.  That is the sort of circumstance that arises with a national monopoly. It becomes ridiculously out of step with the reasonable expectations of the people of the country.</P>
    <P>If tomorrow somebody sets up a transport system to the extent of going to the Continent and delivering goods and coming back to Manchester or London or elsewhere and picking up containers with goods and taking them to Ireland, that person seems to be doing something that he would not be allowed to do at home.  In other words, he can go into another country, collect goods, take them here and deliver them and he has a right to do that.  It appears to me ridiculous that if he comes from Greenore or from Newry or elsewhere when he comes into the authority of this State, if there are goods available he should not have the right to collect them and deliver <Col N="1093" /> them in Dublin or in Athlone or in Galway or elsewhere.  These are the sort of uneconomic structures that have this country in a very difficult situation in regard to the people's services and transport.</P>
    <P>As far as larger lorries are concerned, we have a lot of criticism now of the juggernauts and the condition of the roads in consequence of the transport of 20, 30, 40 ton loads over them.  These road conditions warrant proper and fair criticism and I think we must live with this situation.  This is part of our commitment in being in the EEC, and if foreign hauliers are entitled to come here to deliver or collect goods, take them out of the country with huge vehicles requiring a road maintenance system far above the standard that we have, we are not enitled to say that Irish interests should not have the right to do the same thing.  This country is in the EEC now and I think we are attaining full membership, and if we have full membership and have a full commitment I think that the circumstances associated with haulage in this country ordinarily ought to demand from the EEC authority appropriate assistance to maintain the condition of roads bearing EEC traffic.  They have, at the present time, at any rate, almost a monopoly of this juggernaut-container system of haulage.  They have such a high percentage of the haulage business that they are entirely responsible for the difficulties that arise as far as public authorities are concerned by way of maintaining roads, bridges and so on over which they travel.</P>
    <P>I know that this is not a debate on roads.  I know it is a debate on road transport, but, with the indulgence if it is necessary of the Chair, I might refer to an aspect that I have seen on certain roads in my county of the haulage of these deadly heavy containers from EEC countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked for that indulgence. It is a serious expense on the State to maintain the thoroughfares. We have to look at whether or <Col N="1094" /> not our concept of road transport is the one that is going to serve the large farmer or the small farmer.  We have to look at the extent to which we inconvenience him and see what immediate services we can give him.  We must see if we can give such services to farmers in remote areas.  We must see to it that those who are prepared to give such a service do so at an economic price.  It is not economic to have a haulage vehicle carrying 15 or 20 tons of lime into a remote area. It is not economic for the State to subsidise goods so hauled.  If we are to accommodate the sort of haulage required in this sector of our economy we ought to give a free hand to people with small trucks to do this haulage from points of collection nearest to them with due regard to the provision of a service for perishable goods.</P>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that many people in remote areas do not want public haulage.  They prefer to get a neighbour who may have a lorry or somebody with a smaller vehicle who is in a position to take the goods they have to transport without great delay and at little expense. That sort of a haulier, unfortunately, has been classified as an illegal haulier. I have seen at Longford fair gardaí watching a neighbour of mine who wanted to bring home eight cattle in his lorry.  It was six hours before he was able to turn the cattle down a backstreet and load them.  Care had to be taken when letting them off because there were gardaí at his destination. Anybody who said at that time that the gardaí were not doing the right thing and that the Government were not enforcing the law, was liable to be put out.  Later that was abandoned. A lot of other concepts associated withe the haulage of goods will have to be abandoned also.  It will not be possible to continue to compel people to pay high costs for a service because a similar service is operated by CIE or by a transport system. The man next door who is in a position to give the same service has the same right to live and earn his bread here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what Senator McGowan said.  Driving to Dublin about four <Col N="1095" /> weeks ago I was behind three articulated trucks.  They were not loaded and for that reason they were travelling at a considerable speed, up to 50 miles per hour.  When they came to a certain part of the road they slowed down and travelled at between 20 or 25 miles per hour.  Twenty cars, and mine, had to keep behind those vehicles for about 16 miles.  Such a situation is often experienced by motorists.  If there are two, and one attempts to pass them out one is putting oneself in danger. Many of the tragic accidents we read about occur when motorists try to pass out such long vehicles.  Those are circumstances that one associates with everyday driving here.  If we are to have a haulage system we should have it with a restriction on speed.  We must also have an economic structure obtaining in relation to charge and an immediate service appropriate to all goods in any area.  The Minister, before we consider the Bill on Committee Stage, should bear in mind the points raised by more intelligent speakers than I on this matter.  There is no reason for having a straight-laced stereotype transport system which will be subject to some abuse.  For instance, a haulier who buys six vehicles, decides to start a limited liability company and automatically sells to that company his interest in five or six of those vehicles acquires a fortune of considerabe dimension.  The Minister should consider introducing some amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí uilig a labhair ar an mBille seo agus a d'fháiltigh roimhe.  Cé go bhfuil an Bille féin gearr, tá an t-ábhar an-thábhachtach.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé ina chuidiú sna blianta atá romhainn.</P>
      <P>I was pleased with the number of Senators who spoke on this Bill and I should like to thank them for their contributions.  Although, as I said in Irish, the Bill is a relatively short one transport itself is not an easy subject even from the relatively detached viewpoints of the legislator and the administrator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> Those who are directly involved in transport face surprisingly complex tasks and even at the level of the small firm they must possess a stock of practical knowledge in matters as far apart as principles of contract and maintenance of vehicles.  There has been a tendency in the past to underrate the capabilities of our hauliers and the demands that are made on them and I am glad to have an opportunity to prepare and submit for the consideration of the Oireachtas this Bill which, as well as proposing changes in the law affecting the haulage industry, recognises its potential for performance. Senator Staunton suggested that it was much the same Bill as the 1976 Bill but it is true to say that this one is not susceptible to the criticisms which gave rise to the opposition encountered by the 1976 Bill.  This is because it differs from that document in an essential respect by containing safeguards against monopolisation of the market by either a home or a foreign haulier in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the licensed hauliers who, of course, include CIE and their employees as well as the railways.  It also introduces the principle of qualitative control in relation to licensing in a positive manner not provided for in the previous Bill.  This will have the gradually increasing back-up of the EEC directive on vehicle testing which I mentioned in my opening statement and which will be phased in by 1 January 1983.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey referred to the possibility of a foreign haulier coming here and buying up a number of licences to provide himself with 80 vehicles.  Of course, this would be a very expensive matter because, as I have already pointed out, a licence which has only one vehicle on it at present will be entitled to only six vehicles under this Bill.  Therefore, this would be a pretty expensive operation.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton suggested that I was critical of own account operation in my speech in the Dáil but he possibly misunderstands the situation. I accept what he says in relation to the fact that the people who are utilising own account had little alternative in the past but to have <Col N="1097" /> transport vehicles of their own.  What I was referring to was that in itself that type of transport is bound to be inefficient because, as Senator Jago pointed out, it means transporting goods in one direction only and coming back light.  This is something which would not be the case where we have a licensed haulier operating. It was only in that sense that I was critical of the efficiency of own account.  The fact that we are permitting licensed hauliers to have more vehicles on their licences than they had previously should in itself help to overcome the problems which own-account operators faced in the past when, as Senator Staunton said, they had no alternative but to have their own vehicles.  My attitude in this Bill is to try to have a highly efficient professional haulage industry. Its basic purpose is to encourage in so far as is possible many of the people who are presently involved in own account to engage professional hauliers so that the capital which they of necessity had to invest in the haulage in the past can be invested to much better effect in their business so as to develop it so as to produce more jobs.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to the fact that I did not liberalise transport to the extent that it had been proposed to liberalise it under the previous Bill but I gave careful consideration and thought to the best way of easing out the present restrictions. I could not accept the substitution of total de-control for the present number specified.  This would be just as much a rush to change as a rapid transition to a new type of control, something for which I believe we were not prepared.  I looked at such experiences, as were available to me in Britain, in Northern Ireland and in other member states of the European Community as to the size of the firm likely to be most remunerative or likely to evolve in a relatively free haulage market and to use whatever knowledge might be available to set up what might be called a size-bracket within which our general hauliers can carry out their operations.</P>
    <P>As to the optimum size of road <Col N="1098" /> haulage firms, studies touching on the question have taken place in the original member countries of the EEC and also in Britain.  There is virtual unanimity in the view that the very small firm with one to three vehicles is likely to be the least remunerative in cash terms.  This could be because the firm trying to build up would be content with lower profits or because small hauliers are willing to sacrifice some monetary reward for their independence.  The indications, even though they are not conclusive, are that for all the countries mentioned the most remunerative size of firm in general is the one in the five to 20 vehicles bracket with the most successful of all probably at the lower end, that is roughly from six to ten vehicles.</P>
    <P>For those who are a bit worried about the fact that we were liberalising and worried about the effect that this might have on the smaller type firm, the one with one or two vehicles, I should like to mention that in Northern Ireland there is a comparatively free market.  Road freight haulage has been subject to qualitative control only since 1966 and after ten years of that regime only three firms in the private sector had more than 50 trucks and none had reached 80. Strange as it may seem, the dominant type of firm remained at one vehicle and that is the situation even today. In Northern Ireland the vehicle numbers on licences in 1976 were, with one vehicle only, 968 operators, while with over 50 and under 80 vehicles there were only three operators.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton also referred to the six metric tonne laden weight and suggested that we might have a higher weight but, of course, as other Senators mentioned, it is impossible to decide on any specific one which will satisfy everybody.  We would begin to impinge possibly on the rights of others if we were to increase it beyond that level.  As many Senators said, this concession will be a very useful one, particularly in rural areas. The six tonne gross vehicle weight exemption is common in the EEC countries for certain kinds of traffic. To go further than that would be <Col N="1099" /> encroaching on the preserves of licensed hauliers, particularly of CIE.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to the fact that under this Bill each haulier would get an opportunity of adopting his fleet to conditions in his area. This is true.  He also mentioned mandatory fines.  My advice is that the courts are never very happy about mandatory fines.  I have produced a reasonable situation in relation to fines.  Some Senators believe that the fines are not heavy enough.  They relate this to the fact that the vehicle itself could be forfeited under previous legislation.  The reality of it is that no court has ever, I think, decided that the vehicle should be seized and, certainly, in the present time when the cost of vehicles is so high it is just not real.  For that reason we should not have in legislation something which is most unlikely to be used with regard to the law.</P>
    <P>Senator West referred to the manifesto and to the transport authority. Some other Senator mentioned that we are setting up a transport consultative commission and a considerable amount of the ground work has been done in relation to it.  He also suggested that we should abolish the licensing system altogether.  It should be remembered that licensed hauliers&mdash;there is a considerable number of them here, including CIE&mdash;and those, excluding CIE, have been very restricted in what they could do up to now.  They had no opportunity to expand.  The vast majority of them had one vehicle on the licence.  There was little or nothing the haulier could do to improve his business.  But these are the professionals, and at this stage it would be wrong to allow a <i>carte blanche</i> in relation to this type of situation because, after all, licensed hauliers who have borne the brunt of the day in a very restrictive situation should be entitled at least to prove themselves.  They are getting this opportunity here.  I would also mention that unrestricted input into the licensed hauliers' situation would also, in all probability, have a detrimental effect on CIE.</P>
    <P>What I have in mind is that more <Col N="1100" /> and more of the own-account people would see an advantage in employing the licensed haulier, and the more that this change in attitude takes place the better for CIE.  At the moment we have the licensed hauliers and CIE together competing for 10 per cent of the total haulage here.</P>
    <P>What I want to see is the own-account people change.  In many instances it is not possible for own account to change the system they have, for a variety of reasons, but quite a number of them would be only too glad if they got an efficient service from the licensed hauliers or from CIE to change over.  The opportunity is being given here to the licensed hauliers to do this.  I will be watching carefully to see how they proceed.</P>
    <P>The Senator also gave quite a number of figures in relation to what is happening to the amount of business acquired by the Northern hauliers as compared by the hauliers in our own area.  Here again, that just underlines the fact that it is vitally essential that we should liberalise haulage.  From the quotation he read I can recall the article it was taken from and, frankly, there were quite a number of inaccuracies in that article.  I would like to be dealing with this on its own but, unfortunately, I cannot.</P>

      <P>Senator Markey referred to the problem in relation to the environment.  I believe that because of the Bill we will have less rather than more vehicles on the road for the reasons I have already given.  Own account must almost always send two vehicles to do the job of one.  Under the licensed hauliers that would change considerably.  Senator McGowan referred to the situation in relation to lime and I should like to tell him that <Col N="1101" /> under the Bill there will be no change from the present situation.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with most of the points raised.  I did not deal with them individually because the points were raised by a number of Senators.  I hope I have given generally what the Senators would regard as a reasonable reply.  I should like to express my thanks to the Seanad for the manner in which they dealt with this Bill.

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter which I wish to raise concerns planning appeals and the difficulty interested parties to planning appeals are faced with when they ask for an inspector's report.  The situation at present is that to obtain an inspector's report to a planning appeal, if one is an interested party, one has actually to take the Minister to court.  This is ridiculous, because the matter has already been decided by the courts.  In a judgment delivered on 14 July 1972 by Mr. Justice Walsh he ruled overturning a judgment by Mr. Justice Kenny in a case Murphy v. Dublin Corporation and the Minister for Local Government that it was possible for parties interested in a planning appeal to be given an inspector's report.  However, that was 1972 but since then the situation has not, regrettably, changed.  I have a letter here dated 9 March 1977 from the Department of Local Government <i>re</i> a planning appeal in County Dublin. That letter states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to refer to your letter of 21 February 1977 and 1 March 1977 in connection with the above and I am to state that it is not the practice to furnish copies of inspectors' reports.</P>
    <P>The parties had to go to court and through considerable litigation.  The judgment was in their favour and they were allowed to see the inspector's report and the costs were given against the Minister.  That is a ridiculous situation. Because it is a minor administrative matter and it is within the Minister's competence to do so, I ask that the Minister take the power to give the requisite directions to An Bord Pleanála concerning planning reports.  I would like to quote section 6 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, subsection (1):</P>
    <P>The Minister shall, from time to time, give to the Board such general directives as to policy in relation to planning and development as he considers necessary.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Board shall in performing its functions have regard to any directive under this section.</P>
    <P>(3)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to any particular case with which the Board is or may be concerned.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where the Minister gives a directive under this section the following provisions shall apply. namely,</P>
    <P>(a)  as soon as may be the Minister shall cause a copy of the directive to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas,</P>
    <P>(b)  the directive shall be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the Minister shall cause a copy of the directive to be sent to each planning authority.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to so decide that the inspectors' reports to planning appeals can be made available to interested parties.  This is the situation in the United Kingdom.  I would like to quote from the rules set down for the inquiry <Col N="1103" /> procedures.  The inspector is referred to as the appointed person.  Rule 12, subsection (1) states:</P>
    <P>12.  (1)  The appointed person shall after the close of the inquiry make a report in writing to the Secretary of State which shall include the appointed person's findings of fact and his recommendation, if any, or his reason for not making any recommendations.</P>
    <P>Rule 13, subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>Where a copy of the appointed person's report is not sent with a notification of a decision, a notification shall be accompanied by a summary of the appointed person's conclusions and recommendation; and if any person entitled to be notified of the Secretary of State's decision under the last foregoing paragraph has not received a copy of the appointed person's report, he shall be supplied with a copy thereof on written application made to the Secretary of State within one month from the day of his decision.</P>
    <P>The situation there is quite clear.  There would not be a cause for complaint had Mr. Justice Walsh not ruled quite clearly that it was within the legal rights of an interested party at planning appeal to see a copy of the inspector's report.  He overturned the judgment of Mr. Justice Kenny who upheld a claim of the Minister which said that the report was within a class of document which on grounds of public interest ought to be withheld from production or disclosure and that &ldquo;on the grounds aforsesaid I am instructed by the Minister to claim privilege therefore&rdquo;.  That was originally upheld by Mr. Justice Kenny and then, on appeal, it was overturned by Mr. Justice Walsh.  He said, and I quote from the Law Reports:</P>
    <P>Once it was shown that the document was relevant, the onus of establishing that the document should not be produced would have had to have been borne by the person making that claim; and that the claim to withhold production <Col N="1104" /> would have had to have been made in relation to a particular document or documents and to have contained the statement of the grounds for the claim.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Walsh made it clear in his judgment that the Minister could not claim privilege and therefore was not entitled to withhold the copies of the inspectors' reports from the interested parties.  The situation has remained like this and the Department of Local Government still will not allow parties to see the inspectors' reports without going to court.  Because of the judgment of Mr. Justice Walsh, when they go to court it takes considerable time, the judgment is granted in their favour and costs are made out against the Minister and they eventually see the report.  I would like the Minister to exercise the powers that he holds under section 6 of the Planning Act, 1976 and allow An Bord Pleanála to direct them to make inspectors' reports available for interested parties to planning appeals when they wish to inspect them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator West's motion refers to inspectors' reports in planning matters. Inspectors' reports arise in a range of planning matters, as I shall indicate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1976 contain the basic legislation governing the planning process.  The 1963 Act which came into operation in October 1964 provided that before any development, other than exempted development, commenced it would be necessary to obtain planning permission from the local planning authority. The function of deciding appeals against decisions of planning authorities was assigned under the Act to the Minister for Local Government, now the Minister for the Environment. The 1963 Act was amended in 1976 by the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976.  The 1976 Act provides for the establishment of an independent body to conduct planning appeals and other matters and as a consequence on 15 March 1977 An Bord Pleanála took <Col N="1105" /> over responsibility for a wide range of appellate functions.</P>
    <P>The only appellate functions arising under the Planning Acts which now remain with the Minister are those related to building regulations which may be made under section 86 of the 1963 Act and those relating to extinguishment of public rights of way under section 76 of the 1963 Act. However, as the provisions relating to building regulations have not yet been brought into force the question of appeals in the matter does not at present arise.  The provisions of the 1963 Act relating to extinguishment of rights of way were amended by the 1976 Act and now provide that where objections to the closure of a right of way have been received and are not withdrawn an oral hearing must be held before the Minister may decide on the local authority's extinguishment order.</P>
    <P>All other appeals arising under the Planning Acts are now the responsibility of An Bord Pleanála.  The principal types of appeal dealt with by the board are those arising under section 26 of the 1963 Act, that is, appeals against decisions of planning authorities on applications for permission or approval to carry out development.  In addition, An Bord Pleanála are also responsible for adjudicating on such matters as appeals against a revocation or modification of a permission previously granted; against a notice requiring removal or alteration of a structure; against a notice requiring discontinuance of use; against a tree preservation order or a conservation order; or against an order creating a public right of way over land.  An Bord Pleanála also determine references as to what, in any particular case, is or is not exempted development and adjudicate on other disagreements or disputes.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Senator is chiefly interested in the cases dealt with by An Bord Pleanála rather than in the few items still to be dealt with by the Minister.  But I may say that the board and the Minister follow the same practice in regard to inspectors' reports. That practice is not to make the inspector's <Col N="1106" /> report available except where it is required for a court case.  The case for this was gone into when the Bill which became the 1976 Act was being debated in the Dáil.  The relevant debate may be found in Volume 280, No. 8 of the Dáil Official Report for 7 May 1975.  An amendment seeking to have such reports made available generally to the public was withdrawn following the explanation by the Minister at the time, Deputy Tully, having regard to the case against it.  I should say that the matter was mentioned briefly on the Second Reading in the Seanad by Senator, now Deputy, Horgan but was not followed up.</P>
    <P>There are good practical arguments for maintaining the present practice. In the case of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála it is the board which take the decision and, while the board are required by law to consider the report, they are free to take a decision which the inspector did not recommend.  This is provided under section 23 of the 1976 Act.  The law now provides that the board must give their reasons for every decision, one to grant as well as one to refuse, and this is the issue which is of importance and relevance to the public.  That is covered by section 39 (8) (g) of the same Act which is an amendment of the 1963 Act. In the 1963 Act it was not necessary to give a reason for the grant of permission.  Issuing the inspector's report in addition could well confuse, and indeed might involve delay in the planning process.</P>
    <P>The reason reports are produced for court cases follows court rulings on that specific issue is that it would require new regulations to compel the board to publish inspectors' reports as a general rule, although they would be free to adopt such a practice of their own accord.</P>

However, due note will be taken of what the Senator has stated in this debate and I shall in particular <Col N="1107" /> ask the board to consider it.  The Senator mentioned section 6 of the 1976 Act with regard to matters relating to policy.  Section 6 (3) states:</P>
