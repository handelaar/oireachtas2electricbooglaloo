      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points which occur to me.  One detects a frantic element with regard to getting this Bill enacted.  We must not regard ourselves as being in a situation in which the soldiers are surrounding Leinster House if we do not do something radical very quickly.  We have to look at the Bill to see if there is anything in it we do not like.  I wish I had more time to look at it than I have had.  If there are any points that occur to us as we go through this, it is vitally important to doing our job properly that we consider them and not just simply note them on the basis that they will be taken care of in a comprehensive Bill which will come forward God knows when, with all the good intentions that one allows to everybody. There are all sorts of obstacles to the realisation of good intentions in the business of these two Houses.  One of the obstacles is getting things into a queue and getting them marching along.  The Minister and everyone else in the House will be glad to hear that I have not too much to say about it, but I should like to feel I am not just wasting my time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated that she will be proposing a new section, section 36, and it seems to me that a new prohibition is to be proposed in that section.  The prohibition is directed at an animal known as an investment trust company. <Col N="110" /> We are now at the definition section of the Bill and it would be extremely useful if the definition section contained, as the Central Bank Act did, a definition of what an investment trust company is. Not getting into the merits or desirability or demerits or undesirability, of the section when we come to it, at least we ought to know before we get on to that section, if we do prohibit an investment trust company, what exactly we are prohibiting.  We will know when we get to the section what we will be prohibited from doing.  We should have a definition of an investment trust company.</P>
    <P>I do not know that I necessarily agree with the definition in the Central Bank Act, because it is defined in the Central Bank Act as a company whose main business consists of the investment of its funds in securities.  I am not aware that the Central Bank ever operated any section with regard to investment trust companies and perhaps it failed to do so because of the perhaps excessively extensive nature of the definition.  An investment trust company as defined in the Central Bank Act, and as it might hereafter be held to be without definition under this Bill, might be any family company, or any company holding shares in a group of companies.  It might be at the peak of a whole apparatus, a whole structure of industrial and commercial activity which engaged, as so many of these companies do, in the double exercise of providing management expertise all over the field, the group itself, the individual units, being assisted from the top which does this planning and which is a holding company holding these securities.</P>
    <P>Something might be proposed which, with regard to the prohibition of deposits, was so extensive in its impact that it hit at all sorts of institutions which cannot be in our mind as bodies whose activities we require to control to ensure that the mischief is cured.  In this section there should be a definition of an investment trust company.  Perhaps that definition will receive better consideration when we come to hear the Minister on the proposed new section 36.  Allied to that is the absence of a definition of deposits.  In the Central Bank Act the matter is dealt with and it is so defined <Col N="111" /> as to include both time and current deposits.  It is of importance to know what we intend when we are engaging in prohibitions.  It may be necessary, if the legislation is to be successful, that the courts will not be required, when faced with the criminal consequence of breaching the prohibitions, to give a narrow definition to deposits.</P>
    <P>In the part of this Bill which will impose controls on the taking of deposits, it will be any kind of deposits, whether current deposits, or deposits repayable on demand, or repayable in one month, or three months, or whatever, or on the happening of a specified event, or condition, or whatever it may be.  The Bill may seem to be frail in the objective it is intended to secure, if there is no definition of deposit which indicates the full extent of the prohibition which it is intended to impose on industrial and provident societies who are, in fact, caught by the provisions with regard to the taking of deposits.  It may be that this could be done in this interpretation section, or when we come to the reference to deposits, by which time I hope I will have found out the reference to deposits in the Central Bank Act.  Some other Senator might be able to assist me on that.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a prohibition on investment trust companies doing something, we do not want to create a greater mischief than we are trying to cure.  Say, for example, somebody has an investment trust holding company for his family, and say a member of the family has £5,000 and he wants to place it on deposit with the investment trust holding company, is it intended that that should be an illegal act, that the company should be in breach of a statute, that the officers should be guilty of criminal activities if they have never read this?  It cannot be thought that the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Bill will be read by people running family holding companies.  Certainly it will not be read by them, or even by all their advisers, to put them in a position where they will find themselves criminally liable?  Presumably there will be criminal liability, or there ought to be, if we are serious about the prohibition.  A <Col N="112" /> breach of the prohibition should give rise to an offence.  It will be no answer to me to be told the prohibition will not give rise to an offence which will be prosecutable because then we are letting a toothless animal roam around and we might as well not have the prohibition.  If there is not an offence as a result of a breach of the prohibition, we might as well not have the prohibition, because people will breach it.</P>

      <P>First of all, a Chaothairleach, Senator FitzGerald mentioned that there was tremendous urgency about this Bill.  When we talked on the Second Stage of the Bill all of us realised what the tremendous urgency was about.  I should not like Senator FitzGerald, or any other Senator, to feel I was trying to stymie discussion at any stage of any Bill, regardless of its urgency.  Senator FitzGerald above all other Senators must appreciate that. Senator FitzGerald has had cooperation from my Department at all times on any Bills which have come before this House as, indeed, that cooperation would be available to any Member of either House of the Oireachtas if he felt he had constructive criticism to make on any Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald made a point that the investment trust companies are now being included under the new section 36 which is proposed in a Government amendment.  He felt the definition of an investment trust company should be clearly set out in section 2.  Under the new section 36, we are defining what an investment trust company is.  Therefore, I do not think it is necessary to re-define it in section 2.  He made the point as well that &ldquo;deposits&rdquo; should be defined in section 2.  The word &ldquo;deposits&rdquo; is used in other Acts, for example, the Central Bank Act, the Credit Union Act and the Building Societies Act, and no definition is given.  Senator FitzGerald is busily going through the Central Bank Act to find a definition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 of the Central Bank Act reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;banking business&rdquo; means business which consists of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the business of accepting deposits payable on demand or on notice or at a fixed or determined future date, but excluding deposits with a trader from persons employed by him in his trading business or from his customers in the normal course of his trading business and deposits or instalments in respect of the letting or selling of goods under a hire-purchase agreement or a credit-sale agreement....</P>
      <P>In each case it has been left to the courts to decide in fact what the definition of &ldquo;deposits&rdquo; should be.  I feel it would be best to leave it again to the courts in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 of the Central Bank Act refers to deposits within the definition of what a banking business consists of, and makes it clear that banking will be carried on whether or not the deposits are of a current nature.  It does not leave it to the courts to do so; it excludes deposits which are regarded as appropriate for exclusion in a code relative to banking.  It excludes deposits with &ldquo;a trader from persons employed by him in his trading business&rdquo; and so on.  I do not know whether, if we take the definition of an investment trust company from the Central Bank code, that is at all sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not deal with the point I made and I should like her to deal with that point.  She did not deal with the question of the definition.  I was remiss in not seeing the amendment which arrived at 2 o'clock today.  The definition in the Central Bank Act does not deal with the point that it catches private investment trust companies as well as public ones.  In the Central Bank Act, it at least excludes deposits from traders with such companies.  Even the definition in the Central Bank Act, in my view, is far too extensive for what is intended to be done in this Bill.  This Bill is presumably concerned to deal with the <Col N="114" /> particular type of industrial and provident society engaged in taking deposits all round the place.  Why do you need a definition, whether or not you extend it to an investment trust holding company, unless you are trying to catch&mdash;which no doubt is what you are at&mdash;conversions of industrial and provident societies into investment trust companies? On that definition an investment trust holding company resulting from the conversion of an industrial and provident society is such as to be caught by this prohibition.  That is a very simple amendment and it does not have this wide-ranging effect.  The Department do not know the consequences involved. They cannot possibly know the range of actions affected by this, or the range of people who may find themselves, even if only technically, in breach of it.  It is no use telling me they will not be prosecuted. It is not a very good system of running the country to say people will not be prosecuted for committing offences. It needs a narrower definition.</P>

      <P>The whole question of investment trust companies is coming up in a new section, section 36.  Perhaps discussion about them, and about what should be covered and what should not be covered, could best be left until that amendment is being discussed.</P>

      <P>A point has been made in the Dáil with regard to the use of the word &ldquo;insubstantial&rdquo;.  Is there any precedent in the Statute Book for the use of this word &ldquo;insubstantial&rdquo;?  The words &ldquo;not material&rdquo; are very well understood by the courts and I should have thought very much better words.  Could I draw the Minister's attention also to this?  What is to be looked at to discover <Col N="115" /> what is insubstantial is not merely the acceptance of deposits; it is acceptance of deposits and the making of loans.  What do they look at?  What is the guide?  What is insubstantial?</P>
      <P>The Minister may give me a quick answer on my last point, that is, why is it only the agricultural co-operative societies that can get rescued and not the fishery co-operatives?  I am sure there is a simple answer to that under subsection (3).</P>

      <P>The term &ldquo;insubstantial&rdquo; which has been raised by Senator FitzGerald was also raised by his colleague in the Dáil.

      <P>I have given some indication to the Minister that I would be asking this question.  I am not clear what the position is of an external <Col N="116" /> society incorporated before or after the date.  How is it caught by any of the provisions of this code?  I genuinely do not know the answer to that question.  I note that there are provisions for the registration of an external company under the Companies Act.  I know the Central Bank Act requires any such company with banking objects to supply additional information, but I just do not know what the position is here.  In Britain industrial and provident societies are not allowed to take deposits except to a very limited degree.  Say we have external body corporates or bodies corporate, whatever you call them, how does this code deal with them, or is it intended that it should?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of external industrial and provident societies is quite simply that, if they have a branch in this country which is registered here, then they are caught by the Bill.  We have no power to stop people here from investing in an industrial and provident society which is, as the Senator suggests, in a different country or in a different place, outside the jurisdiction of the State.  I am not sure if that answers the Senator's point&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain to me how the external society is caught?  Under section 15 it is proposed that the Registrar will have power to appoint a person to the society's management committee.  How can that be done?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The exemption from the 1971 Act refers to industrial and provident societies in our jurisdiction only.  Therefore any foreign society and any other legal entity operating in a banking business here are governed by the Central Bank Act 1971, if they are registered here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>How are they effectively governed?  How do you appoint people, particularly in management, to produce books if they do not wish to do so?  How is it enforced against them?  We are talking about strange animals that may be wandering in from <Col N="117" /> Europe but who never thought of doing so to date.  We have long since provided for such creatures under the companies code.  They cannot come in here.  We can catch them for an offence under the Companies Act if they try to do business here without being registered.  As external companies they must do so.  We can catch them by making them comply with the requirements.  They have to tell us if they are carrying on business here, whom we can sue and whom we can make responsible for breaches of the law. There is no procedure under the industrial and provident code or generally in relation to bodies corporate other than companies, whereby we can find out effectively how we can go after the fellow who is doing business here in a manner that we do not allow our own institutions to do.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister and everyone else understands that I am not opposed to the principles of this legislation.  I am not opposed to the idea of introducing these prohibitions or to stopping what is desired to be stopped.  I am interested to see how we protect ourselves from activities that we disapprove of.  We have no procedure requiring them to register; no procedure whereby they can give us local names and it is only local names whose bodies will be here and who are going to, in effect, see that they comply with our laws.  This is a very important point.</P>

      <P>The Central Bank Act does catch bodies corporate within the Companies Act but it does not seem to catch other institutions similar to the Industrial and Provident Society one.

      <P>The Central Bank Act, Part II, section 7, covers any person inside or outside the State.  Section 7, subsection (1) reads:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act, a person, other than the bank, shall not, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person in or outside the State, carry on banking business or hold himself out or represent himself as a banker or as carrying on banking business unless&mdash;</P>
      <P>and there are various conditions: he is the holder of a licence or he maintains a deposit in a bank.  Therefore, the foreign companies or societies which Senator FitzGerald refers to are covered by the Central Bank Act and are not a function for my Department or for the Minister. They are under regulation by the Central Bank Act and by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>My point is rather oblique to what has been going on between the Minister and Senator Alexis FitzGerald and it is more the responsible layman's view.  It seems that in section 5 the people whom the Act sets out to protect are to a certain degree penalised.  I would like the Minister to explain this point because people who have invested already with existing deposit-taking societies could be at risk by the very stern provisions of section 5.  I am referring in particular to the clarification of that that is in the Minister's speech on the Second Stage.  I quote from column 9 of the Official Report 1 November 1978:</P>
      <P>The effect of section 5 will be to leave an existing deposit-taking society with three main options on enactment of the Bill.</P>
      <P>(a)  First, to gear itself towards applying for a banking licence from the Central Bank,</P>
      <P>That is fair enough.  If they get that it is fine.</P>
      <P>(b)  Secondly, to arrange alternative sources of finance, for example, bank loans, to enable it to continue with its lending business, or</P>
      <P>(c)  Thirdly, to arrange for an orderly running down of its business.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> No matter how orderly that running down of business is, and running down businesses tends to be a disorderly affair and get out of control, surely the people who have invested with that society are going to be at risk.  I find it very hard to see how they would not. The Minister goes on to say:</P>
    <P>To ensure, however, that the interest of investors are, as far as possible, borne in mind by such society, whatever the option chosen by it, the registrar is being given sufficient powers in subsequent sections to monitor its affairs effectively and on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>That is fair enough and it sounds reassuring. The question I am putting to the Minister is: is there not a danger in this Bill, which seems to be admirably adapted to protect the little man and the people who have invested their savings in such a society as this, that there will be casualties with the rather stern provisions under section 5 and that, these small investors may go to the wall and suffer losses in their investment where this is happening?  If that is not the case, I would be very glad to have it explained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole purpose of the Bill is to ensure that investors are protected and that societies such as these do not go to the wall in the morning because&mdash;it was to avoid this type of situation that the Bill was introduced in the first place&mdash;depositors would be severely hurt.  The fact that the Bill allows for the orderly running down of the business within a period of five years with the option to extend that period if necessary means that the orderly running down is done under the jurisdiction of the registrar.  Naturally one of the registrar's functions will be to ensure that investors or depositors are not hurt under any running down of a business.  I feel that, at all times, his job would be to minimise the risks involved for investors.  That is the job of the Bill itself.  I would agree with Senator Martin that there are risks.  It is not possible to remove them altogether, and we have to be fair and acknowledge that.  Most of the risks will be removed by the fact that <Col N="120" /> they have five years to ensure the orderly running down of the business, and this would be done under the careful eye of the registrar to ensure that investors whom we are trying to protect will be treated fairly and will not stand to lose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the registrar is a splendid person.  Does this mean that the normal code of <Col N="121" /> priorities&mdash;wages and salaries, social welfare payments, value-added tax and pay-as-you-earn money deducted from employees&mdash;is to be dislodged and that the registrar can authorise one payment rather than another?  This cannot be the right way of doing it.  We are reversing the priorities here.  The priorities of the Department of Social Welfare and the priorities of revenue in relation to pay-as-you-earn, are ahead of the depositor. The priority payments must be paid or there will be a most disorderly state of accounts.  Why is the registrar not told to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; by putting it into the section rather than having the complete administrative nonsense of getting his permission to make payments?  The officers concerned may be committing offences if they do not make these payments.</P>
      <P>Perhaps between now and Report Stage the Minister will be able to get together a proper subsection on that.  It is a complete prohibition on payments, particularly when there will be an offence. We are going to make it a criminal offence for the manager of an industrial and provident society to pay back tax that he has deducted from his employees and which is due to the registrar without the registrar authorising it.  It would be bad law to make something an offence without clear provisions as to evidence that it has been committed.  There should be something in writing if a person is to be indicted.  It is outrageous to make it an offence for people to do what the law at the moment obliges them to do.  I am only talking about these payments.  There may be other kinds of payments.</P>

      <P>The registrar would have to authorise all payments.  I am sure we could depend on the dictates of common sense to ensure that what the Senator refers to as priority payments would be made.  On the other hand, it is important to remember that the repayments to depositors would certainly be priority payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Either that is the law or it is not.  Where is it the law that depositors of an industrial provident society will displace the money that <Col N="122" /> may, if that society is bankrupt, be due to the employees by way of, for example, arrears of holiday money?  Does that mean that the depositors of such a society are going to be ahead?  This requires a great deal of consideration.  It says here that it is an offence to make payments which at the moment are due and which if not made will themselves constitute an offence.</P>

The very genuine fears which the Senator expressed are shared by all of us.  The registrar would have to take all matters into account when he would be authorising payments whether they would be made to depositors, employees or whoever else may be involved.</P>

      <P>If your landlord is due the rent today and makes a distress on the office furniture one cannot stay there at all unless one pays the fellow his rent.  He will get the sheriff out. It is an offence to pay off the sheriff.  No person should be put in the position where he can force somebody into a position where he will be committing an offence.  It is unrealistic and impracticable. There should be somebody who is entitled to go in and make the payments that have to be made, if that is the situation in certain cases.  If the window is smashed it has to be repaired.  If the roof is leaking onto the deposit books that the registrar will be wanting to look at, is he not to pay whoever is required to repair it?  Do the people who are working sit down and do no more?  It is impracticable.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a situation where straightaway there is a crisis situation in every one of these societies. We have been told there are 14 of them getting deposits.  I do not know how many people are employed.  We have not been told.  We are enacting legislation largely in the dark.  We are aware of the general financial problems.  We are aware of the fact that this sort of situation ought not to have been allowed to grow over the years.  Now that it has grown we should be coping with it in a sensible and practical way.</P>

It does not seem to me that the Minister has the answers quite crystal clear at her fingertips.  I do not blame her for this because it is a very subtle point and one that should be looked at.  I would like to know just for the sake of clarification as a layman, what would be the availability of the registrar?  Supposing one takes the situation dramatised by Senator FitzGerald that there is a creditor literally on the doorstep or that the sheriff's men have arrived.  I am trying to visualise the registrar's office.  The proprietor or the managing director rings him and looks for this kind of <Col N="125" /> clearance.

      <P>I am sorry I have not had time to study this adequately. Subject to that, I think the Minister is better surrounded by advisers to do this.  If it is required, I will try my hand at an amendment&mdash;not that I want to.  It is very wrong not to have this situation provided for.  What offends me about this is that we are going to make it an offence for people to do what may be a matter of life and death for them to do. To survive and make their case to the registrar about their scheme of repayment may involve them making a payment. What are we afraid of?  Is it a scheme of repayment for depositors? Any payments to whom?  In order to be helpful on an amendment, what payments are we afraid of?&mdash;that they will give it to their brothers and sisters in alms?  Is that it?  It is easy enough to make that a much graver offence than anything we have been talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am talking about the ordinary human situation which may arise.  The Companies Act, for example, gives <Col N="126" /> priority to all wages and salaries, whether or not earned wholly or in part by way of commission.  There may be other people employed getting these deposits on commission for all I know. They may not be in on the loot involved but their daily bread may depend on their getting their commission on the deposits.  They have priority.  Are they to be told: &ldquo;I have been committing an offence unless the registrar authorises me to pay your commission&rdquo;?  It does not make sense.  If there were 25 registrars, it would not make sense.  There must be a scheme for the registrar himself for his own protection.  What if he authorises payments to 25 customers and disallows payments to 25 more and subsequently the society goes into bankruptcy and somebody tries to make the registrar liable for having authorised payments that led a displacement of priorities or fraudulent preference of somebody? Fraudulent preference is a concept which does not connote fraud.  It merely means an act of preference of one creditor over another.  It has certain very serious legal consequences.</P>
    <P>Holiday remuneration, wages and lots of other things are given priority.  In relation to pay as you earn do not forget it is the employee's tax we are talking about. Why should the employee's tax be given to any depositor?  I accept Senator Martin's proposed assignment to me but I would much prefer if the Minister would do it.</P>

      <P>Section 12 (i) would be the request by the registrar of certain information which he would be requiring on a regular basis from time to time and (ii) would deal with specific information that would be requested by the registrar at any particular period or at a particular time.  That is the difference. The first one would be to deal with a regular return of information which would be required and the second one would be when the registrar would ask in writing a society to submit to him specific information.</P>

      <P>Again, a question of information here.  That part of section 15 which is concerned with the appointing by the registrar of somebody to the board of one of these societies looks like a good provision.  It seems to me that the spirit of the matter is that if a society are in the process of, to quote the Minister's speech &ldquo;arranging for the orderly running down of its business&rdquo;, that one of the means by which the registrar can supervise that obviously is to make sporadic raids and also to look for the kind of information that Senator FitzGerald has been talking about, to ask for regular returns and so forth.  In other more difficult situations he would insist that one of his nominees or somebody that he would suggest or appoint would sit on that board and intervene actively in the day-to-day running of the organisation, which on the <Col N="130" /> face of it looks like a very good way of protecting both the investor and indeed what is left of the company.</P>
      <P>It strikes me that the kind of person needed for this kind of job would have to be a very sensitive and intelligent person, and I am wondering if such a person would be drawn from the ranks of retired civil servants, whether it be somebody active in business or whether he would be an academic, an economist or somebody of that kind, what would his hours be?  What kind of responsibility would he have to the company other than the protecting of the interests of the depositors?  In other words I am asking the Minister for, if possible, a kind of identikit, the kind of people which the registrar would have available to call upon to handle this delicate business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The first person to be appointed would more than likely be a financial expert.  This would be desirable because a person might be appointed in a situation where a society was partially or marginally insolvent and where the registrar would be doing his utmost to ensure that they managed to get back on their feet again.  Therefore, the person appointed would have to be somebody who would be a financial expert. He could be taken from anywhere. We would not necessarily have to be a retired civil servant or be from the registrar's office.  He could be somebody from the Central Bank who would help and advise.  It is important that the power would be there to appoint somebody just as the bank have at present whereby if they give a substantial loan to a company they may demand to appoint somebody from the bank to the board of the company.</P>

Before we get to the section that concerns me I would like to know why have we all these sections. What is the background that we would have to think about?  What is the background to the situation?

      <P>I do not think that on the Second Stage reading I gave reason for doubt on the part of the Government in regard to the credit union movement.  All of us would encourage its development and its use as a movement.  It is an excellent movement. I said at that stage that with the considerable amount of money involved, something in the region of £60 million, being handled by part-time people on a voluntary basis, dangerous situations and risk situations can arise.  I think the Senator would agree that it is better to avoid those type of situations now and to provide for happenings of this kind to prevent them happening.  It is better to do that now rather than wait until we have a bad situation and then try and rectify it at that stage.  I think Senator FitzGerald will accept that.  This provision has been welcomed by the Credit Union League.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express a general unhappiness about a number of these provisions.  I think there is a different situation here too because of the nature of the credit union definition&mdash;part-time people managing funds&mdash;but there is no question of these being anything other than their funds, funds created by themselves, those who share these common bonds, common bonds of occupation, common bonds of residence or employment or <i>bona fide</i> organisations such as residential organisations or families.  We are dealing with a kind of body that industrial and provident societies originally were concerned to encourage but you do not encourage by way of mandatory movements. <Col N="133" /> There is nothing like this in the old industrial provident code.  Given all the money that is involved in credit unions there would not appear to be justification for providing that all of them must be subjected to investigations. We ought to have more information, as much as the Minister may have, especially as there are common bonds of a family for example.  It arises in a later section, section 25, that where the registrar is to be entitled to appoint somebody to the management of the credit union, somebody, a total stranger, may come into your area, come into your factory, come into your family or whatever, where the justification in relation to the industrial provident societies, was that they were getting money on loan and advertising for deposits.  They have called in the company.  Therefore, they have a right in the public interest to control them.  There is no public element. They are genuine credit unions.  There is a privacy situation.  They are even more private than are private companies.  We do not have any power whereby the Minister for industry, Commerce and Energy may appoint people to boards of private companies.  We do not have any analogous power at all.  Here we have got situations that we wish to encourage. If people are subject to restrictions which are unnecessary they will not perform well.  It is one of the great virtues of freedom that people may make mistakes and if they make mistakes they face their families or fellow workers, their partners or people who reside in the same area with them but I would require to hear a lot of facts to justify that they should receive a more severe treatment than private companies operating for profit. These people as far as I know have invested their money in each other for the benefit of those who are in need at any given time of the savings in question.  I do not see how any outsider is damaged by that.  Maybe they themselves may be damaged but that is the price of freedom.  They should be left free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying we should give power to appoint somebody to the board of directors of a private company, because if a lunatic happens to be in charge of the affairs of the company or if we think <Col N="134" /> he is not well equipped to run the company, is it right that some civil servant should put some other civil servant in to look after the private company?  I think that is a very dangerous principle.  I certainly would need a lot of convincing that it should be done now.  I know I shall be told we have got something similar in the building societies' code and in the industrial provident societies with regard to loans, but they are different situations.  There is a public element in these cases which is not here.  They are not going to be credit unions under the Act unless they have these common bonds binding them together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the Minister agree that perhaps it is particularly important that for some of the reasons Senator FitzGerald has mentioned, if we have a credit union in a neighbourhood or in a works, factory or whatever, it is particularly important that there be some way in which an outside person if necessary can be put in? Are these not in many ways particularly unsophisticated investors who are putting up deposits of money?  I would think it is particularly important that there should be, if anything, very stringest measures for the supervision, control and inspection under these circumstances and this section is particularly useful in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>

      <P>Credit unions, as I have said, are excellent bodies and have been encouraged by everybody on all sides of the Houses of the Oireachtas for many years.  As Senator FitzGerald rightly said, they have many members, one must remember that credit unions are run by elected members, and these are few.  If we have few people operating or managing large sums of money such as £60 million then we must ensure that it is being run effectively and efficiently.  Credit unions are <Col N="135" /> run by elected members who operate in their spare time, who need have no business experience whatsoever, and the presence of someone on the board who has a business or managerial acumen could help to introduce efficient organisation and prudent management systems into the running of what might be an ailing credit union.  Expert advice of this nature could help greatly in setting an ailing credit union back on to its feet.  I think it should accommodate the injection of outside expert help where a credit union is beset by bad management, which may happen.  There have been problems in the movement in the past and, as I said, if we are going to have problems, the time to try and rectify the problems or to prepare for the eventuality of a bad problem arising is now in this legislation and not to wait until the problem has arisen, when we would have to deal with an emergency situation.</P>

      <P>Recognising the part the credit unions have played in the social development of this country since they were set up in the early 'sixties, I wonder are we not ignoring altogether the function and the part which the Credit Union League has played in this whole credit union development, whereby the registrar can go in and carry out an inspection notwithstanding the wishes or the observations that the Credit Union League may have in regard to the matter.</P>

I did say, of course, that the Credit Union League had welcomed the provisions under this particular section which is important.  Of course the registrar would co-operate with the Credit Union League in the event of inspection being necessary or whatever investigation might be necessary, but the particular paragraph in the Bill and the subsections are necessary now.</P>

      <P>I am a little concerned about subsection (2).  I am afraid I weak-mindedly agreed to having this debated today.  I have not had a chance to collate this with the Companies Act at all.  I do not think that refusing to answer any question in the case of an investigation by an inspector gives rise to an offence.  In the case of a company, if I remember it correctly, it then goes to the court to decide whether it is an offence of contempt of court.  It is a matter for court determination as to whether it constitutes a contempt of the court.  We are always talking about the rights of silence.  There are all sorts of situations where a man may decline to incriminate himself by refusing to answer.  We have it in the Offences Against the State Act.</P>

      <P>In fact it was a colleague of Senator FitzGerald who pointed out the error which was in this in the beginning.  If the Senator would look under section 14 (2) he will see that when this section was introduced in the Dáil Deputy Kelly pointed out on Committee Stage its invalidity constitutionally in the light of the findings of the Supreme Court in the case of <i>in re</i> Haughey 1971.  Subsequently, on making inquiries from our legal advisers, Deputy Kelly was found to be correct and this is the reason for the subsection now.</P>

      <P>With respect, the Minister had a subsection along these lines already and this is a reformulation of it to make it a constitutionally correct one.  My point is a different one.  It is whether or not we had anything similar.  My memory of the Companies Act is that if one did not <Col N="137" /> answer a question in the course of an investigation one could be guilty of contempt of court but it was not an offence under the Companies Act apart from that.  Maybe I am wrong in that but that is my recollection.</P>

      <P>I am not happy with this without more limitation, more restriction than there is in it.  For the reasons I have given, I think this is a very private situation.  There may be a considerable number of credit unions and there should be some clearly defined procedure whereby these powers are exercised in any given individual case so that no individual credit union may feel there is any power to trespass and that a total stranger will come in and be equal to them in relation to their own affairs.  It may be well that in modern circumstances that kind of approach may be more desirable, what I would describe as the administrative approach rather than the judicial.  I do not agree with unnecessary court procedures at all but I would <Col N="138" /> like to see a very strong <i>prima facie</i> case to justify the exercise by the Minister or the registrar or anybody of the power of putting somebody on the committee of management.

      <P>I made the point on this and Senator Donnelly, who I am sorry is not here, made a helpful and useful contribution.  He is quite right too.  He presented a true and fair view. But I would say with regard to it that it is not sufficient.  As we have it at the moment the auditing orbiting of the societies is governed by section 13 of the Principal Act and the accountancy bodies&mdash;which include the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Association of Certified Accountants, the Institute of Cost and Managing Accountants&mdash; made representations to the Department with regard to section 13 and expressed surprise that this legislation did not include proposals to amend section 13 which specifically requires the auditor to state whether the accounts are in accordance with the law, whereas the Companies Act requires the auditors to state whether in their opinion the accounts give the information required by the Act; there is an important distinction and I think this should at least be contained in this section.  I am not at all satisfied that this cannot be done and done adequately within the time which is there for it to be done, particularly as it will be going back to the Dáil anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also extremely unhappy at having this situation.  We are talking about very large concerns with very substantial business; increasing business; increasingly successful business.  These <Col N="140" /> businesses very much affect the interests of the economy and many other people operative in the economy.  We are here going to have in relation to them a situation in which, on the one hand, they can be required to produce any type of accounts in any form that the registrar may determine; they may be required to produce much more than is required for the company and on the other hand, they may be required to produce much less.  Whatever it is proposed that they should be required to do they will be in the unique position that the legislature would have no voice, their elected representatives would have no voice in considering what the requirements should be.  They would be uniquely so because, even if it is coming from Brussels in the form of directives, the Joint Committee of the two Houses is in a position of commenting on the draft directives, of considering how the directives should be implemented, of looking at and criticising and examining the actual implementation.  If it is a matter of the Companies Act, it is set out and the Companies Act can only be amended in this matter by another Act which we will consider.  In this case it is not even the Minister who will make an order.  We will not have even a draft order; we will not have an actual order, let alone a draft order.  We simply have a registrar who will be without criticism from anybody on behalf of the people; he will possibly be somebody who is in the executive and whose mind may change.  He would have benefited from listening to me or anybody else here for example before he decides what he should put in the order.  He will not have this benefit or the benefit of any views other than those he chooses to collect himself.</P>
    <P>This is not an adequate way of dealing with such an important matter.  We are not dealing with something small; we are dealing with something very large, very significant.  It is something peculiarly Irish in its shape and in its history.  There are third party interests involved here as well as the individual interests of members of the co-operative movement itself.  I do think that their accounts in whichever form they should be, should be considered by the Legislature at one stage or another.  I would object to it if it <Col N="141" /> were in the form of a ministerial order. But I put the view very strongly everywhere I had a chance to express my voice on this that this kind of thing should be in the form of Bill.  I have done at all stages no matter who was in power.  I would be of the same opinion always because it is extremely important. If it is in public there would be an opportunity for every affected person to express an opinion.  There would be an opportunity for all informed people to become aware of this.  As things stand now the informed people will not necessarily know what the registrar is proposing to do with regard to this.  The hope would be that he would do it all right but there are all sorts of questions where there would be issues that were in debate between accountants which will have to be judged, questions of principle as to what is in the national interests with regard to these as to whether we make the accounting more or less easy.  That is a matter for political judgment in the largest sense of that word.  This ought not to be a matter to be left in this form.</P>

      <P>There will, of course, be full consultation with accountancy and other representative bodies which is of course happening at the moment under the Building Societies Act with which the registrar is dealing as well.  On the other hand I would say that, as Senator FitzGerald rightly says, auditors have operated under the constraints of a particular section since 1893 and, I am afraid, may have to do so for another while.  I did mention in the course of my Second Stage speech that I would like to have included in this Bill this item regarding accounts and very many other matters.  Senator FitzGerald has agreed with that point of view.  But in the time available it was not possible to prepare that type of Bill; it would take too long.  It would be my hope that these matters would be included in a consolidation Bill as soon as priorities permit such a Bill.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 13 and 14, before section 36 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>36.&mdash;(1)  An investmen trust company shall not accept or hold deposits.</P>
      <P>(2)  Notwithstanding subsection (1), an investment trust company incorporated before the 4th day of October, 1978, and which on or before that date had accepted or held deposits shall not hold deposits after the end of the period of two years commencing at the passing of this Act.</P>

      <P>This provides a new section 36 which caters for the inclusion of investment trust companies, which in this case has the <Col N="143" /> same meaning as that stated in the Central Bank Act, 1971.  The effects of the amendment are threefold.  It prevents investment trust companies from accepting deposits after the date of enactment. Secondly, it obliges an existing investment company, that is one which was incorporated before 4 October 1978, which is in fact the operative date of this Bill, which on or prior to that date had accepted or held deposits to repay them within two years after enactment. Thirdly, it prevents usage of the device which Senator FitzGerald mentioned himself here earlier that an existing deposit-taking society could convert into or amalgamate or transfer its engagements to an investment trust company.</P>

      <P>That is the only thing that justifies the section.  I am totally opposed to this and I think it is completely wrong.  It is the wrong way of doing it.  A very common situation arises with people of money whereby there are funds flowing in, money is lodged to the company account or the individual account. That will be a deposit.  The company will be in breach of this Act.  It will be an offence for the company to take the deposit and the people will be liable to be prosecuted for a criminal offence. The thing is completely insane.  It is stretching out to hit all sorts of situations which cannot be intended.  I did think it was a weakness in the Bill when I read it that it had not contemplated the conversion of an industrial and provident society into a company which is the simplest thing in the world, as the reverse operation is.  I wonder if the possibility of that has been considered.  This is not the way to do it.  One has results from conversion of an industrial and provident society into a company if this is solely what one is after.  But if there is more to it than that let us then define what deposits are; let us then define more precisely investment trust holding companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to launch a campaign in the interests of physically handicapped persons so that easy means of entry may be provided for them to shops, offices, churches, school buildings, hotels, restaurants, places of entertainment and public transport; and requests that the Government itself give the lead in this campaign by ensuring ease of entry for such persons to all State premises to which the public are entitled to have recourse.</P>
      <P>The Chairman of the Irish Wheelchair Association, Mr. Liam Maguire, in making his address to the Union of Voluntary Organisations conference in Wexford on 14 to 16 October, 1977, covered a very wide range of problems affecting the physically handicapped.  He dealt with them in regard to the implications for them and suggested remedies that might be needed.  He said that until the legislators of the country can claim that they have done their duty towards the physically handicapped then his address was an accusation rather than a request.</P>
      <P>He entitled his address &ldquo;A fair deal for the handicapped&rdquo;.  My colleagues and myself in the Labour Party are putting down this motion to try to get people to start moving along the lines advocated by the Chairman of the Irish Wheelchair Association in his address. That is to move towards giving the physically handicapped a fair deal in society.</P>
      <P>When putting down the motion we were conscious of the fact that it is a long and winding road, but we believe that the way forward must begin somewhere.  We also believe that the best means of making progress in this matter of a fair deal for the physically handicapped is to request the Government to give the lead on one aspect of the total question of the problems facing the physically handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ask the Government to set an example by ensuring ease of entry for the physically disabled to all State premises to which the public are entitled to have <Col N="146" /> recourse.  It is interesting to note that since the motion was circulated a ramp has been fixed outside the main hall entrance to Leinster House.  This may, or may not be, coincidental.  I do not know but it is worth saying that if somebody in the public service sees the need for a ramp to provide easy access for the physically handicapped to the main hall of Leinster House then one is entitled to assume that the need is already recognised by responsible people in the public services.  There is a need to provide this kind of easy access to all State-owned and public buildings on the part of the public service.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out at this stage that I am reliably informed that the promise to put down this ramp was given approximately ten or 11 years ago. Neither the Fianna Fáil Government when in office nor the Coalition Government when they were in office gave effect to this.  However, the ramp is there now and it will set an example to the other people concerned with the question of providing such facilities in State-owned and public buildings.</P>
    <P>From that admission of the need we, in the Labour Party, would envisage that certain things will happen in this type of campaign.  For example, we see no reason why a date should not be set by which all existing buildings and services occupied by Government Departments and local authorities should be made fully accessible to the physically handicapped. The national building code, when it finally arrives in its full state, should embody adequate provisions for accessibility for the physically handicapped. There would be nothing wrong with having punitive measures written into such provisions, for example, withholding grants where such were being provided. Those are a couple of examples of how the Government could start the campaign requested.</P>
    <P>Arising out of that the question may be posed that if we remove the frustration of the wheelchair users who become frustrated by steps, narrow doors, tiny lifts, revolving doors, high kerbs and so on, are we doing this for the benefit of the one person in every thousand of the population who are the wheelchair users?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> I have to refer to the speech by the Chairman of the Irish Wheelchair Association, and he gives the answer.  He tells us that people pushing prams, pregnant women, people with heart or respiratory ailments, the elderly, people with sight defects, amputees, people propelling trolleys, furniture removers and people on crutches are all suffering from the frustrations public buildings represent to them from the point of view of easy access.</P>
    <P>If you put the same frustrations experienced by the users of wheelchairs together with the frustrations experienced by the other categories I have mentioned, you are talking about a very substantial proportion of the population.</P>
    <P>The figure I have to hand is that one in five members of our society can expect to be disabled at some stage in their lives and will be denied easy access to public buildings.  We will all get old and doddery and I hope we will not be confined to the house.  However, if this continues and the campaign is not put into action, then the one out of every five I have referred to, supported by their public representatives, will rightly level the accusation that if the Government fail or refuse to give a lead in this campaign, the rest of the nation is failing to work towards a fair deal for the handicapped, an obligation, which we feel, lies squarely on the shoulders of every Government.</P>
    <P>On many aspects of the problems affecting wheelchair users it might not be a straightforward matter to introduce legislation.  I submit this motion presents no such problem.  The motion is clear cut in its intent.  The emphasis is laid on the latter part of the motion in connection with the campaign requested.  Let the Government take the lead, as the motion suggests.  It will not be too difficult to deal with the offices, shops, churches, school buildings, hotels, restaurants and public transport once the example has been given.  There will be difficulties but the example must be set and the campaign must be started.  We will not solve the problems at once but at least we will make them less acute on the whole.</P>
    <P>It astonishes me that architects, designers and planners go to no end of <Col N="148" /> trouble in drawing up plans for elaborate buildings to make sure that those buildings are visually powerful, that they are attractive to visitors and have a selling point.  They deal with all the factors which attract attention such as fire hazards, density, volume, height, and so on.  Technologically, you could say they always look efficient.  For some reason or other they ignore the need to make provision for easy access for wheelchair users, or if you want to put it another way, one out of every five members of society who will be physically handicapped. I fail to see, as do my colleagues in the Labour Party, that two-legged able-bodied people would be at a disadvantage if the architects, planners and designers tried to cater for all the people.</P>
    <P>Does this mean that the architects are not conscious of the structure of the population?  Does it mean they look upon handicapped people as a sub-group who comprise a distinct population and have not the same rights as the rest of us in this respect?  Do the architects and designers limit this question of planning for accessibility to the building of old people's homes?  If the answer to these questions is yes, then the architects are guilty of discrimination.  But are they alone guilty?  Are we to take it that the archiects are not conscious of the fact that accidents can make people physically handicapped temporarily and cripple people, and that disease can handicap people temporarily or cripple them?  All those people, together with the other handicapped groups I referred to, are locked out of offices to which every other citizen has easy access?  In other words, they are locked out of public buildings to which they are entitled to have easy access to conduct their business like any other member of the population and with the same dignity.</P>
    <P>Even though I have spoken about architects and planners, the problem in regard to the question of planning and designing probably can be found at the educational level, the diploma and degree awarding bodies, and the general curricula and examination levels, because these may not have regard to accessibility for the physically handicapped. I do not know because I never had third level education.  In fact, I have <Col N="149" /> never been to the second-level, so I do not know.  I suspect that as in many other cases the problem begins at the educational level.  While this question of the curricula may not be relevant to the specific request at the end of the motion, it is quite reasonable to refer to it, because we are asking the Government to give a lead in this campaign and to start the campaign by providing ramps and easy access to all State and public buildings.  That is emphasised in the motion. The point I made about the degree awarding bodies who give degrees to architects is relevant to the overall terms of the motion.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to refer it to the appropriate Minister as soon as it is practicable for him to do so.</P>
    <P>As a priority, I ask the Minister when replying to this motion to make a statement of intent that all existing buildings occupied by Government Departments, local authorities and other State bodies will be made fully accessible to the physically handicapped as an example to the rest of the nation.  If the Minister is not in a position to go that far, then I hope the tone of his contribution will give some indication of how far it is practicable or possible to co-operate in this campaign.</P>
    <P>I have laid greater emphasis on wheelchair users than on other physically handicapped people.  My own research is the cause of that.  I spent some time perusing a book called &ldquo;Design for the Disabled&rdquo; by Selwyn Goldsmith and I discovered one very important thing.  As he puts it, the wheelchair user is handicapped three times over.  First, he has a disability that puts him in a wheelchair.  Secondly, he is obliged to function at a lower level than standing people, and always at the same level, which is constraining both physically and psychologically.  Thirdly, he has to roll around in a cumbersome, awkward way in a space consuming, distinctive, inelegant vehicle.</P>
    <P>When you look at the problem from this point of view, it demonstrates in a very positive way the need to have it brought home forcibly that those citizens are being discriminated against in the sense that all buildings have been <Col N="150" /> geared to suit two-legged able-bodied people.  This is a great indictment on any Government, whether they are a Coalition Government or a Fianna Fáil Government.  It is discriminatory.  Unless some start is made by way of the suggested campaign requested in the motion, there will be no change in this attitude in the future.  If the Government give this request their blessing in a practical sense, many other things will follow and perhaps even the question of the curricula may take on some meaning.</P>
    <P>The United Nations General Assembly adopted in Resolution 3447, a declaration on the rights of disabled persons in December 1975.  Article 8 reads:</P>
    <P>Disabled persons are entitled to have their special needs taken into consideration at all stages of economic and social planning.</P>
    <P>If this lead were given by the Government, we could then reasonably expect them to move on to giving fuller effect to the terms of Article 8, Resolution 3447. There is a little more in it than the sentence I quoted for the benefit of the motion.  We hear many complaints from people in new housing schemes about proposed developments being incomplete. Although the local authorities are statutorily obliged to provide a range of services to the community within their functional areas they cannot deal with unco-ordinated and contradictory proposals from private developers which fail to provide for wheelchair users.  If this is the case, there is little hope of getting to grips with the idea of planning to create the socially just environment about which we so often speak.  That means suffering for the handicapped.</P>
    <P>I believe&mdash;and my colleagues agree with me&mdash;that if the Government agree with us and launch this campaign, the necessary legislation will follow.  We would then no longer be paying lip service to the idea of a socially just environment but we would be putting it into practice.  We have not spent much money on the problems of the physically handicapped in the area of making public buildings accessible to them.  In 1975, the Dutch spent 25 million <Col N="151" /> guilders&mdash;£5 million&mdash;to create an environment suitable to the needs of the physically handicapped without affecting the rights of two-legged able-bodied people.  When you provide accessibility to public buildings for handicapped people you do not in any way inhibit or legislate against two-legged people. They are capable of using the same facilities.</P>
    <P>Referring back to Selwyn Goldsmith's book &ldquo;Design for the Disabled&rdquo; to give emphasis to the point I made earlier, he also said that buildings always have been and always will be geared to suit two-legged able-bodied people and not people propped up on sticks or rolling about in wheelchairs.  This is the reality. If we get a debate like this going, whether we get full agreement or full acquiescence is irrelevant.  It would be equally important to get acquiescence in the areas where we cannot get agreement, and agreement where we can get agreement.  In that sense there would be a beginning to the end of discrimination against wheelchair users.  We can do this by tackling the curricula and by seeing that the diploma and degree awarding bodies make provision in their examinations for accessibility for the physically handicapped.</P>
    <P>One in every five people will be handicapped at some stage of their lives. The campaign we request to be launched in our motion can be much more readily dealt with than the other questions posed, the question of the curricula, the examinations, and so on.  Our request could well be given speedy attention in the areas where it is practicable rather than promising a crumb off the whole cake like the ramp provided outside Leinster House after 11 years.  I would prefer the Minister to reject the motion on the basis that everything I said is impracticable rather offering a crumb.  I do not think the Minister will say that, because the motion is not all impracticable, although it may be in certain areas.</P>
    <P>To offer anything less than the full terms of the motion would not be satisfactory but at the same time if we could adopt most of the motion there would be some cause for satisfaction.  It <Col N="152" /> would be an insult to our fellow members of society if we said: &ldquo;Now you have a ramp outside Leinster House, we will put another ramp outside another public office building and do nothing again for 11 years.&rdquo;  We are not talking about the problems of mentally handicapped people.  We are talking about giving the handicapped the same facilities to conduct their business as ordinary citizens have.  My colleagues and I would have liked to put down a motion very much wider in its implication.  For example, we could well have put down a motion to the effect that the entire physical environment should be designed to cater for all people indiscriminately.  I do not have to tell anybody in this House how far-reaching that type of motion could be.  Because I had to leave school at 12 years of age I can only do my sums one step at a time, so this is the way I decided to approach this matter, and my colleagues agreed with me. However, we chose this one aspect of the whole problem which is the easiest to give effect to, and we did so to avoid getting into an area which might militate against any speedy solution the Minister might be willing to consider.</P>
    <P>We believe the motion will not bring the Minister into conflict with local authorities and other public bodies.  It would be a brave public servant who would say that the one in every five in the population is to be discriminated against indefinitely.  We do not see the cost factor as being very substantial relatively speaking and, in any case, the money must be found to do the job because the right of easy accessibility is a global right for all men.  One member of the Government has launched a public campaign very successfully.  This motion asks for the launching of a campaign to ensure that members of society who are physically handicapped get their rights in accordance with the Constitution. Let us avoid the major issue for the moment and let us see what we can do with this motion.</P>

      <P>I was most interested to hear what Senator Harte said.  In <Col N="153" /> many ways I agree with what he said.  I believe that really he is painting too dark a picture.  That might come as a surprise to some Senators who know that I have worked with the physically handicapped for 27 years.  Things have gradually become better over those 27 years.  I say better, but we need best now.  There is just one example.  Several years ago the National Rehabilitation Board, which is a Government sponsored board, brought out a guide to Dublin for the handicapped and it shows where there are facilities for getting into libraries, theatres, cinemas, shops and churches of all denominations.  It is a very useful little book indeed.  That is only for Dublin. Maybe other cities and towns have them too.</P>
      <P>Senator Harte mentioned one very important point but I would like to stress it again.  I refer to the dignity of a person in a wheelchair.  Unless you have sat in a wheelchair for a long time you do not realise that it is a terrible thing, because people always talk down to you.  By talking down to you, they then think you are mentally handicapped as well.  This is really not so in most cases.  Let us all realise that people in wheelchairs and people on crutches are just the same as we are and they deserve everything we get and perhaps a little bit more.  The handicapped person has as much right to work as an able-bodied person.  It is also true to say that very often a handicapped person is a more thorough worker than many others, because it lifts him up to the stature of other people if he can work and take home at the end of a week a wage packet like his brothers and sisters.  This is very important indeed.</P>
      <P>The other important thing to remember is that, as Senator Harte said, people in wheelchairs&mdash;and I am in a wheelchair at the moment&mdash;want to get along the streets, to cross over at lights. This is very difficult in Dublin.  I have just come back from New York, and there at every street corner where there are lights the sidewalks are levelled down and then levelled up on the other side so that people in wheelchairs can get from point A to point B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> This book is excellent.  It tells you the places you can get into, but it does not tell you how you can get there unless somebody will either carry you or get you there by special car.  I have a feeling that this Government are especially interested in the physically handicapped. They are trying to do more and more for the semi-voluntary groups who are interested in trying to help in a medical way people in wheelchairs, but also they realise very much, and the Minister realises, the necessity for getting from A to B.</P>
    <P>About five years ago we had a very bright wheelchair boy of 15 years who was offered an excellent job with good wages but he could not keep it because he had to take a taxi every day and when he got there he had to climb up two flights of stairs of ten steps each.  So he had no job.  Yet he was bright enough to have one.  The Government are not forgetting the handicapped.  The Department as a whole are doing the best with the money they have.  I do not think we can aspire to being like New York where they have every facility, because we have just not got the money.  More thought should go into new buildings. Architects are gradually learning that there is a percentage of human beings who have to be in wheelchairs.  The more this is discussed either here or outside the House the better.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte has highlighted many things that are very dear to me and to the people I and many others help to look after, but they do not want to be looked after.  They want to look after themselves.  This is most important.  In order to look after themselves, they have to be able to get into buildings where they can work or where they can go for recreation.  I know the Government will do what they can.  I could go on for a long time telling the House about various different cases, but I will not bore Senators.  Nowadays people are beginning to understand that people in wheelchairs are human beings like ourselves and should not be looked down upon, but should be treated as equals, and, as far as possible, given an equal chance to work and an equal chance to play.</P>

      <P>May I say that neither I nor any other member of the Government would quarrel with the spirit, the thinking and the objectives behind this motion.  It is right and proper that our citizens who suffer from physical handicaps should be encouraged and assisted, as far as is practicable, to live a full life as members of the community.  For their part, their demands generally are not unreasonable. What facilitates the paraplegic to move readily around his home as one of the household and to circulate within his neighbourhood as a member of the community will equally assist the old and frail and persons who may not be confined to wheelchairs, but whose medical conditions make it difficult for them to climb steep steps and stairs, or who might appreciate special bath, toilet and other domestic facilities.  I feel that amongst people generally we would find a consensus on this attitude.</P>
      <P>Senators may justifiably question, therefore, why more positive public action has not been taken to help eliminate the barriers which have prevented physically handicapped persons from enjoying a fuller participation in the day-to-day life of their neighbourhood.  This is a valid attitude, but I suggest that, to put the position into proper perspective, one must consider first the scale of the problem&mdash;only about 1 in 2,000 of our population is confined to a wheel-chair&mdash;then the degree of public awareness of and involvement in the amelioration of the problem, and also the cost and other implications of the remedial measures which would be involved, taken in conjunction with the many other urgent causes with competing claims on public resources.</P>

    <P>Over the past decade or so there has been a growing awareness of the needs of physically handicapped persons and an increasing appreciation of the public responsibility to meet those needs adequately. Unfortunately, this acceptance of the public duty which rests on us all has developed rather slowly and the provision of services specially to assist physically handicapped persons has tended to grow in a rather haphazard <Col N="156" /> fashion, usually prompted by the efforts of voluntary bodies concerned mainly with particular aspects of the overall problem.</P>
    <P>While I would hope that the general question of public aids for physically handicapped persons would not be seen as a political issue, I must remind the House that practically all of the more significant developments in this regard have taken place under Fianna Fáil Administrations.</P>
    <P>One of the most important developments of the Health Act, 1970, which the late President Childers, then Minister for Health, steered through the Oireachtas was the delegation of responsibility for the management and organisation of the health services to eight regional health boards.  Within the new structure a separate programme was introduced to provide for people and needs which could be met within the community rather than in an institutional setting.  Under this community care programme the aim was to develop services which would ensure and maintain a high level of care within the community, thereby reducing the necessity for people to go into institutions and reducing the length of stay for those who needed this form of care.  Prior to the Act, resources in the field of physical handicap lacked proper co-ordination and were, to a considerable extent, institutionally based.  That imaginative policy has been showing commendable results in relation to physically handicapped persons.</P>
    <P>Housing presents perennial problems, not alone in Ireland, but in practically every country.  For the physically handicapped person the problem is particularly complex; it is not just a question of adequate shelter but of housing which is suited to his special needs.  As the motion states, it is desirable that a handicapped person should not be prevented by high steps or other obstacles from entering public buildings or places of resort.  It is an even more fundamental need that he should be enabled to enter and leave his own home, to have door opes sufficiently wide to allow a wheelchair to circulate within the home, to have switches, taps, door locks and handles at a level accessible to the <Col N="157" /> person in the wheelchair and have appropriate bath and toilet facilities available there.</P>
    <P>Appreciating this fact, the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Molloy, introduced a scheme of housing grants in February 1972, specially intended to help households with one or more handicapped members, to adapt the dwellings so as to allow for ready circulation within the four walls and for the use of all the facilities there by a person in a wheelchair and to eliminate his possible isolation from participation in the social life of the community, within the limits of his disability and his own aspirations.</P>
    <P>When introduced in 1972, the Department's grant was £400 and it was left to the county council or county borough corporation to match this with an equivalent amount, except in respect of a non-vested local authority dwelling when the authority could meet the full cost of the work.  That grant remained unchanged until the Fianna Fáil Administration resumed office last year, when it was trebled&mdash;from £400 to £1,200&mdash;again with power for the local authority to meet all or part of the residual cost.  Taken in conjunction with the greatly increased ordinary house improvement grants and the house improvement loans scheme which, I hope, will be validated by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1977, which has been introduced in Dáil Éireann, this should provide a big incentive for families with physically handicapped members to carry out the necessary and desirable works to make the homes more convenient for the less fortunate members of the household.</P>
    <P>Following that increase in grants, I had a circular issued to each city and county manager on 30 December last, drawing their attention to complaints which I had received from bodies representing the physically handicapped in regard to delays in processing applications and a lack of uniformity amongst local authorities in the administration of the scheme of grants.  Having regard to the genuine individual need for the structural adaptations concerned, I urged the <Col N="158" /> authorities to give prompt attention to the processing of applications and the payment of grants.  I did not lay down precise guidelines for the local authorities in regard to the determination of eligibility and the works which might be approved; this I left to the discretion of the various authorities. However, I did enjoin them to examine their existing procedures with a view to eliminating any unnecessary delays or formalities.</P>
    <P>In other fields of public activity the Government have given attention to measures which would help to integrate physically handicapped persons into the general community.  For example, steps have been taken so that large comprehensive schools in Dublin and Cork will be physically accessible for handicapped children and special transport facilities are made available for such children attending these schools.  On the wider front, I understand that the Department of Education encourages school managers to adopt an accommodating and flexible approach towards facilitating physically handicapped pupils to have access to, and within, their schools.  Undoubtedly this must present problems in some cases, particularly in older schools, but regard is had to this factor in designing and building new schools.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of transport, the regional health boards operate a scheme of grants to assist physically handicapped individuals to purchase cars.  The maximum grant was increased very recently from £500 to £1,000.  This grants scheme, which should be of particular help to disabled persons who wish to go out and work, has opened up new possibilities generally in the field of mobility for these persons.  As a further encouragement, the owners of such cars have been exempted from all road tax and get special concessions in relation to the purchase of petrol and to parking fees.</P>
    <P>Finally, I come to the question of access by physically handicapped persons to shops, offices, churches, hotels, places of entertainment and public transport.  If I have tended to digress from the basic theme of the motion, I would ask Senators to accept that my purpose has <Col N="159" /> been to exemplify the fund of goodwill towards physically handicapped persons which has motivated the present and previous Governments and to suggest that, in so far as it may be practicable, our aim will be to see that, in the course of time, the objectives of the motion will be implemented.</P>
    <P>Draft building regulations were prepared by my Department and made available for comment by interested bodies.  These have been the subject of detailed and generally helpful submissions by many organisations.  The draft regulations propose to make special provision to facilitate access to all public buildings by physically handicapped persons.  Amongst the more important submissions made in relation to the draft has been a memorandum bearing particularly on this subject and presented on behalf of the National Rehabilitation Board and the Irish Wheelchair Association. I can assure the Seanad that in preparing the final draft of the regulations special consideration will be given to this submission.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the needs of the physically handicapped in so far as accessibility to public buildings such as offices, banks, shops, theatres, cinemas and so on have been brought by my Department to the attention of local authorities who, in their capacity as local planning authorities, can substantially influence the design of buildings to be newly erected or reconstructed.  The authorities were advised that the special measures for which provision might be made include the provision of at least one level entrance or, if necessary, a ramp instead of steps and the provision of sufficient and suitable handrails.  Within the buildings, ramps and handrails might also be necessary, doors and lifts should be wide enough for a wheelchair to pass through, and the lift controls and door handles should be positioned at a height suitable for a person in a wheelchair. Where parking facilities are to be made available, the needs of disabled persons should be catered for in the provision of means of access from the car park to the building.</P>
    <P>It has been emphasised to the local authorities that I am anxious that they <Col N="160" /> should give a lead in this matter and that not only should these provisions be made in any new public buildings but they should also consider measures to make their existing buildings more easily accessible to handicapped people where this can be done at a reasonable cost. The fact that local authorities are planning authorities has been emphasised in order that they will avail of the opportunity to bring these matters to the notice of developers and architects and, if necessary, to impose suitable conditions when granting permission.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have also been specifically advised by my Department of the necessity to provide for the needs of handicapped persons in the case of swimming pools, and the appropriate arrangements were indicated in a guideline specification circulated to them.</P>
    <P>The motion requests that the Government take the lead in this campaign by ensuring ease of entry to all State premises to which the public are entitled to have recourse.  I am sure that the Office of Public Works, whose responsibility it is to provide and maintain State buildings, will have regard to the requirements of the physically handicapped in so far as new buildings or existing buildings being renovated are concerned. For example, as Senators may be aware, ramps for wheelchairs have been provided at the Kildare Street and Leinster Lawn entrances of Leinster House, as was mentioned by Senator Harte, and the lifts in the office block are adequate to take wheelchairs.</P>
    <P>Before I make way for further contributions by Senators, I must pay a tribute to the personnel of the voluntary bodies&mdash;especially, and without being invidious, the National Rehabilitation Board, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the National Federation of Social Service Councils and the faculty of social services in UCD&mdash;which have done so much to stimulate public awareness of the special circumstances and needs of physically handicapped persons, and to press central and local authorities to provide for those needs, not on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, but in a co-ordinated way.</P>
    <P>I would like to express also my appreciation of the sterling work of Access, which includes in its membership a <Col N="161" /> number of very prominent architects and engineers and which provides advice on the subject of access to, and circulation within, buildings by disabled persons. This subject was also the theme of a useful seminar in Dublin last spring, under the auspices of the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped, which established that, in many cases, the necessary structural works and other adaptations could be effected for a relatively light expenditure.</P>
    <P>Finally, different public Departments and various local authorities are concerned with the problems which this motion raises, but the dedicated individuals who comprise the voluntary bodies have done a great deal and will, I am sure, continue to do much to secure a comprehensive public approach to the problems of the physically handicapped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We must all be grateful to Senators Harte and McAuliffe for tabling this motion and drawing our attention to the problems in it.  The figures given by the Minister show that the numbers to whom the motion applies are comparatively small in relation to the total population and, as a result, may not be high in our public consciousness. Having regard to the undramatic but, nevertheless, graphic way in which Senators Harte and Goulding described the predicament of these people, the motion is useful in highlighting their high level of need and the need for the rest of us to be aware of their predicament. Having heard what they had to say about the psychological disability that follows the physical disablement, it is incumbent on the rest of the community to assist these people to the maximum degree possible.  The motion calls on the Government to launch a campaign in the interests of these people and requests they give the lead in the campaign by ensuring ease of entry for such persons to all State premises to which the public are entitled to have recourse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must be somewhat disappointed at the Minister's speech having regard to the specific terms of the motion.  The motion is asking for a lead from the Government.  The Minister in his speech indicated plenty of sympathy and, in <Col N="162" /> what I would see as an unfortunate lapse of taste, has tried to assume a certain political bouquet for himself and his administration in regard to their past dealings with this problem.  In his speech, the Minister indicates a general sympathy with the problem but did not show the sense of urgency which the problem deserves in its own right and having regard to the picture painted by the mover of the motion.</P>
    <P>The comparatively small numbers involved have tended to prevent this problem from being high in the public consciousness.  It would be a pity if that aspect were to be the cause of the Government or any of us long-fingering the problem.  I suspect this is what may happen.  We will all be unanimous on the merits of the motion but nothing of significance will be done following its acceptance by this House.</P>
    <P>At the moment the responsibility for improving the lot of the handicapped with regard to public places mainly depends on private initiative, to a lesser extent in regard to premises in control of the local authorities and what they might do, and, unfortunately, very little on the part of the Government with regard to buildings under their control.  Hopefully, the planners of new buildings, encouraged by the requirements of the planning authorities, will incorporate into them the necessary means of access. The encouragement of the Minister's Department in that regard is important.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that it has been emphasised to local authorities that they should give a lead in this matter.  I hope that that emphasis is continually repeated to local authorities and that their activities are monitored on a continuing basis to see if they are paying proper attention to this element and to ensure that the problem arising from the small number of people and the perspective that this may cause us to have on the matter does not become unduly large in the consciousness of the local authority.  Even if the number is small the problem is essentially great.</P>
    <P>That is in so far as the problem relates to new buildings, but the motion is directed mainly to existing buildings. There is opportunity here for the Government to give a specific lead.  It <Col N="163" /> can be given in very practical terms by initiating the physical works required in the alterations to existing buildings.  The commitment of the Government and the measure of their concern, as representing the entire community, can be gauged by the financial and personnel resources that they are prepared to make available to start, from the next financial year, the alteration of existing public buildings.</P>
    <P>It is pathetic that the only example that could be given to the House was that of the ramps in this building. Probably there are more that I am not aware of but the Minister did not provide further examples.  Casual observation in this city and, certainly when one moves outside the city, will show that it is very difficult to get further examples. I am depressed by the phrasing in the Minister's speech when he said:</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Office of Public Works whose responsibility it is to provide and maintain State buildings will have regard to the requirements of the physically handicapped in so far as new buildings or existing buildings being renovated are concerned.</P>
    <P>We all know the demands on the Office of Public Works are myriad but the rate of achievement and traditional approach of that Office, while thorough and having workmanship of a high standard, is something that gives rise to apprehension and dissatisfaction from time to time.  This is not the place to go into the reasons for that, but it is a fact.  All the Minister can say to this House is: &ldquo;I am sure that the Office of Public Works ...will have regard....&rdquo;  I am certain that the Office of Public Works will have regard to these problems.  I suggest to the Minister, and through him to the Government, that that is not enough for dealing with the problem which has been described so graphically by Senators Harte and Goulding.  There is no sign of a commitment to ensure that the Office of Public Works, which has the control of the buildings of the State, will lift its little finger to make any changes in any public building.  There is not even a commitment to ensure that in new buildings <Col N="164" /> the provisions sought in the motion will be provided, because all the Minister can say is that he is sure that they will have regard to the requirements of the physically handicapped with regard to new buildings.  There is a greater level of commitment required from the Minister and the Government than was displayed in his speech notwithstanding his pointing to the past record of Fianna Fáil Administrations in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Goulding was pessimistic, because of financial constraints, of progress being made, an honest pessimism if I may say so.  If we are to be serious about our appreciation of the problem it becomes a question of priorities.  How high are the handicapped to be in the priorities of a caring Government elected by a caring community?  I will not bore the House&mdash;lest they might think I was descending into mere politics&mdash;by going through the list of commitments to which public funds have been committed for which people say they should not have committed. Here is a cause to which we are unanimous there should be a commitment, and a financial commitment would, having regard to the size of the public budget, be comparatively small.  If the Government accept this motion there should be a commitment in next year's budget to ensure that the spirit of the motion is implemented in a visible way, not just in Dublin city but throughout the country.  While the problem is small in terms of numbers it is gigantic in terms of humanity.  The motion deserves and will get the full verbal support of the House.  What we really want is a financial and personnel commitment from the Government that will honour their verbal acceptance of the motion.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an rún seo agus thaitin an méid cainte a chuala mé go mór liom le linn na díospóireachta.  Thaitin i slí faoi leith óráid an Aire féin.  Is duine fior-chineálta é agus tá fhios agam go ndéanfaidh seisean, pé scéal é, a sheacht ndícheall teacht i gcabhair ar na daoine a bhfuil cabhair uathu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this motion as every right-minded person in the House welcomes it. The handicapped, like the poor, we will <Col N="165" /> always have with us.  They, too, are made to the image and likeness of God, and we who have the use of our limbs should do everything possible to ease the burden of our handicapped brethren. Somehow these things have gone unnoticed for quite a long time but, thanks to the work of voluntary organisations and kind hearted people, a certain amount of alleviation has taken place in recent years.  One thinks of the work of such organisations as the Wheelchair Association, Central Remedial Clinic, National Association for Celebral Palsy and Cork Polio and General After-Care Association.  They have done tremendous work and brought tremendous joy and succour to so many thousands of our handicapped.</P>
    <P>On the matter of handicapped people in public places, I could not help thinking this morning as I was boarding a train at a well known railway junction in a town in Munster, that, far from being a handicapped person, one would want to be an athlete in great condition to get on the train and, certainly, one would want to be a super athlete to get off the same train with the floor at least 2' 6&rdquo; to 3' over the platform level.  How much more, then, is it necessary to have facilities for our handicapped people?</P>
    <P>I would make a particular plea on behalf of handicapped children many of whom attend special schools.  They have to travel in special buses or mini-buses and I would ask the Minister to take particular note of that to see, as far as lies within his power, that every facility be provided on these buses for the safety of these people.  Some time ago one of these organisations I mentioned wrote to the head office at Heuston Station in connection with the matters I have referred to.  He mentioned such things as seat belts, appropriate markings on school buses, fire extinguishers, escorts for children who require them going to and coming from school and then the question of unreasonably long journeys. These matters are very important so far as small children are concerned; small handicapped children do not have the same control over their limbs or bodies as children who have the full use of their limbs.  I would ask him to pay particular <Col N="166" /> attention to these points, and with that I commend him for his statement.  He certainly gives hopes and we give hope to the various organisations I have mentioned. I have no doubt that his Department will do everything possible to come to the aid, financially and otherwise, of those who most need it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the words of the Minister which were very far ranging but I do not think they really add up to a commitment to the handicapped.  I do not think there has been any commitment to the handicapped down through the years.  We are all unanimous in our approval of organisations which help the various handicapped people.  Many of us are members of these organisations and some of us, like Senator Goulding, give a great deal of time to organisations like these.</P>
      <P>Politicians generally pay a great deal of lip-service to this.  At the end of this month the Taoiseach will indicate the admiration of politicians for these people by presenting the people-of-the-year awards which are organised by the National Rehabilitation Institute.  A lot of these people are usually workers with the handicapped but it should not end there.  Having regard to the enormous power politicians have for the planning of society and to the control they have over money which is handed out for planning purposes, it is extremely important that we devote ourselves very seriously to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past planning has been left to the professional planner.  No more than us, the professional planner is not all-seeing, and it is because of that human capacity of planners that years after the event we find that housing estates, for example, are found to be unsuitable for the people who live in them, namely families; likewise, the needs of the handicapped. A large minority of the population, not a tiny minority because we must widen the definition of handicapped, have been ignored by non-handicapped planners.  We must address ourselves to the undoing of the damage. Some things have been mentioned here like steps, narrow doors, tiny lifts, revolving doors and high footpaths. They are very frustrating elements not <Col N="167" /> only for wheelchair users but I would mention also such people as pram pushers, people with heart trouble, the elderly and the very young.  Access is difficult for some and absolutely impossible for others to very many public buildings, offices, factories, theatres, schools, telephones, polling booths and public toilets.</P>
    <P>Something which is rarely mentioned but which constitutes a handicapped element is the situation of mothers of small children.  How dare we allow supermarkets, or large shops to put up signs reading &ldquo;no prams allowed&rdquo;?  They should have to provide a pram-parking area which is safe and visible to the shoppers.  Hospitals, too, should have to provide facilities for the young children of mothers who might wait for hours at outpatients departments.  You expect hospitals to do this and to provide facilities for the mothers of very young hospitalised patients who are immensely handicapped because they cannot speak for themselves.  Indeed, the other day it came as a great shock to me that in 1978 a hospital I persuaded to accommodate the mother of an 18-month-old baby girl had never heard of such an arrangement.</P>
    <P>As it happened when they were persuaded to accommodate the mother they found it worked very well and they were absolutely delighted with the whole idea. How they never heard of it, is beyond me.  We might just briefly remind ourselves that other countries occasionally find the will and the commitment to do something about these problems.  For example, in 1975 the Dutch Government allocated £5 million for the adaptation of existing public buildings, in particular libraries, post offices, railyway and municipal offices. This money was used in 18 months from the time the Dutch Government allocated it.</P>
    <P>I might mention the employment potential of such a large programme in a time of a great difficulty with the employment figures.  Indeed it is very strange that we can hand the present of car tax to able-bodied car owners without enabling those who cannot move about freely to do so more easily.  Public <Col N="168" /> transport is an area which we must look at.  In December 1976, 25,000 people were in receipt of disabled persons' allowance.  We must ask how did they get about or if they get about at all.  They certainly do not get about on CIE buses. As Senator Cranitch remarked, most public transport is designed for the young able-bodied adult who has a good grip and one hand free.  That is a fairly restricted number of people.  I would suggest that that is a substantial minority of people in this country.</P>
    <P>I understand that the technology to adapt bus designs to make them suitable for the handicapped and for wheelchairs is available and is not staggering in terms of expense.  I would very much like to know what CIE are doing about it. Senator Cranitch mentioned children.  It is very important that physically-handicapped children who have normal intelligence should be educated with their able-bodied peers and should not be put in special schools, whereby there is a widening of the gulf which already exists and which cuts them off from society.  This also ensures as a side effect that the able-bodied child goes through life unaware of how a great many people have to cope with their lives.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that we compartmentalise the handicapped so easily.  We compartmentalise children far too easily in schools, not only in terms of handicap but in terms of sex, religion, financial status and so on.  It is a pity that we should include physical ability also. Another figure which should give us cause for thought is that AnCO, with millions of pounds of European Social Fund money available to them, in 1977 trained 150 handicapped people out of a total of 12,837 people.  This is a very small proportion and it is also a very small number out of the 25,000 who are getting the disabled persons' allowances.</P>
    <P>Information on this question of how many handicapped people there are and of the kind of handicap they have is quite limited.  This makes it very difficult to approach the whole question in an organised manner.  I would like to suggest that this should be included in the next census which I hope will come up when it is supposed to come up and not <Col N="169" /> be postponed as it was before.  I cannot see why that cannot be included as a requirement in a census form.</P>
    <P>Finally, I congratulate the Senators who put down this motion.  I look forward to a genuine response by the Government to this very desperate cry for help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, there is not much that may be added to what most Senators have said here today. This motion is very much more important than what we understand it to be; probably even more important than the Senators who put it down understood when they tabled the motion.  It is important because the definition of handicapped persons is a definition which we are taking too narrowly and a definition which perhaps we are taking too lightly. The Robbins Report estimated that there are about 100,000 handicapped people in the Republic.  The 1971 census showed that there were some 330,000 persons in the Republic over the age of 65.  Allowing for some overlapping and a broader definition of the handicapped to include the aged and the ageing, we are talking about 10 per cent of the population. We have under-estimated somewhat, even in this debate, the extent to which this is an issue and a problem in this country and throughout the world. If you want to work out some more figures on this&mdash;and a number of Senators have put this forward&mdash;you could certainly reach a fairly staggering figure of the number of people who require assistance in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Harte mentioned expectant mothers.  If you include also some 300,000 or 350,000 fairly young children, you are reaching a realisation of the large number, perhaps as many as 600,000 or 700,000 who are not in themselves handicapped by any definition but are certainly handicapped by the design of our public transport and our public buildings.  If a four-year-old has trouble getting on a bus, then so far as he is concerned he is handicapped by the design of that bus.  If an old person has trouble getting into the post office he is <Col N="170" /> handicapped by virtue of the fact that he cannot get into the building.</P>
    <P>If we broaden the debate and not just look at the people in the wheelchairs as it were, but at the broader community who are handicapped by the thoughtlessness that has gone into design for a long number of years, we might begin to grasp that this is a problem of some proportions and not one we can take lightly.</P>
    <P>Some Senators dwelt on the question of public transport.  They are correct in this because if you cannot travel&mdash;if you cannot get there&mdash;then the other problem becomes a secondary one, that is the problem of getting into the building.  Today CIE have been asked by this House, and I reiterate this request, to take a long hard look at their plans for the future in this whole area.  We hear talk of a complete new transport system for Dublin in the future, rapid rail and so on, but I hope that the long-term planners in this area are giving adequate thought to design because I believe, and I am sure most of the Senators share my belief, that it should not be any more expensive to put some thought into designing buses, buildings and so on than it is to have bad design.  In the cases of houses that are badly designed&mdash;very straight long stairs, switches which are out of reach, slippery floors and so on&mdash;it would not be any more expensive when designing them to give some thought to the number of people who will use them.  If a lot more thought was put in at design stage in all of this we could achieve great strides at much the same expense.</P>
    <P>I hope that this debate is reported fully and I hope that in being reported fully it will help to stir the national consciousness in regard to this type of difficulty. I do not accept that it is fairly isolated.  I feel that it is a fairly widespread difficulty and one which future generations will not thank us for if we do not put some thought and expertise into it now.  It is not simply a matter of money.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey mentioned something with which I agree.  She pointed out that the technology is there.  There is no doubt about that.  We are in the generation <Col N="171" /> when men can walk on the moon. We have the technology to tackle a problem which, compared to that problem of walking on the moon, is relatively simple.  In Sweden, for example, a considerable number of bus stops are raised so that when the bus pulls in the actual footpath is at the same level as the edge of the entrance to the bus.  That just required a bit more thought and it is something we should look at.  In the United States, for example, there are now what are known as kneeling buses which I am sure a number of you have seen in rather expensive cars in this country.  It is an air suspension business which allows the bus or the train when it pulls up to the platform to sit down as it were and be reinsulated.  It just takes three or four seconds to do that.  It is becoming fairly common now and again it is something which, in the long term, need not necessarily be any more expensive than are very heavy buses with built-up platforms and so on.  There was reference, too, to the problem of escalators.  That is something which has to be looked at because some old people in particular who are not in wheelchairs are genuinely frightened of escalators, of trying to get on them and trying to get off them.  This is literally a nightmare, not only for the handicapped but particularly for old people.  Our stores, shops and modern supermarkets that have this modern equipment should give some thought to the people who are going to use them.  Despite the pronouncements of this party we are not all out jogging and totally fit, and able to jump on escalators.  It can be a difficult business and a nightmare for old people. In general, a new approach is needed to design.</P>
    <P>Overall a new attitude is needed to the whole question of designing public buildings and public transport with an eye to the fact that it is not just a few thousand people who are in wheelchairs who must be considered but that it is a broader and bigger question.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest&mdash;and I am trying to be helpful&mdash;that as a very specific measure some of the environmental scheme money which is being <Col N="172" /> allocated by the Department of the Environment should be spent in this area.  I hope this debate receives some coverage because the public want to tackle this problem; they are concerned about it.  It would be a pity if it were just seen to be another motion which was debated in the second House of the Oireachtas.  It is much more important than that and I thank the Senators for putting it down and the Minister for State for his enlightened contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate and I commend my two Labour colleagues for putting this motion on the Order Paper.  The importance of it is appreciated. Certainly it was given priority over some other Labour motions, it being the turn of the Labour Party to have a motion discussed on this monthly-rota basis.</P>
      <P>I agree very much with the sentiments expressed on both sides of the House and in particular with those Senators, like Senator Hussey and Senator Brennan, who want the matter to be examined in the broader context of what we mean by handicapped.  I would very much endorse that.  We mean, also, those who are aged, those who are very young, those who have not the kind of major physical handicap that requires very particular treatment, such as being confined to a wheelchair.  They, of course, are people who deserve and must have particular sympathy.  We mean the whole range of people and I certainly agree with Senator Brennan that the implications of this are very far-reaching, that we have to consider our planning and approach in putting people first and not putting economic considerations or cold planning considerations which are not concerned with the types of people and the types of user that these buildings and facilities will accommodate.  Of course, if we adopt that approach then we have to re-examine our whole approach to housing estates and to amenities for people so that we no longer merely think of the bald economic cost of building a certain number of houses without thinking of the type of facilities which would be essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own contribution is going to be <Col N="173" /> brief because I share so deeply and basically the sentiments which have been expressed by other Senators.  One of the values of having the debate in the Seanad is that the Minister has been prepared to come into the House and make his contribution to it and that his advisers are present to hear the views expressed by Senators.  In the course of his contribution to the debate, the Minister referred to the draft building regulations which were prepared by his Department and on which he has detailed submissions. Could I ask him if he is prepared to say to the House when these building regulations will be passed?  It would be helpful to have that on the record.</P>

      <P>There is another matter which I do not think the Minister can respond to because it is a rather broad issue, but which I think is relevant here.  In his contribution he laid emphasis on the part that can be played by local authorities in this matter, for example, the contributions towards grants for adaptation of a house and the support that can be given at local government level.  I think that that may be changing in a negative way because of the Bill before the other House which will remove a great deal of the possibility of financing at local authority level. Also, because of the abolition of rates there will be much less financial autonomy at local authority level.  We will have an opportunity, in this House, of debating the consequences of that legislation for local democracy, local initiative and local authority approaches to a problem like adapting buildings for the physically handicapped and of trying to take special measures at local level. But the fact that this is going to be a development and the fact that there is going to be much less possibility of any financial initiative at local level makes it all the more imperative that the Government does take a much more committed and practical lead than was evident from the Minister's contribution to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion calls for a campaign to be launched by the Government in the interests of physically-handicapped <Col N="174" /> persons and in the interests of people generally in regard to their access to public buildings and to their own homes, shops, offices and places of recreational facilities.  There is going to be a greater onus on the Government at central government level to launch this initiative in a financial sense as well as expressing sympathy and issuing Departmental circulars about the matter.  In this context also the Minister has paid tribute, and I think rightly, to the voluntary work which has been done and to the voluntary organisations involved in this area.  The voluntary organisations would be greatly assisted by some State assistance, whether it be by way of subvention of salaries for the full-time workers or otherwise but certainly concrete measures which would help them in the immense initiative and continuity of work and support which they give to physically-handicapped people.  This is another area where it should be possible to give practical assistance.</P>
    <P>Regarding the possibility of using the special category of assistance available under the Social Fund, once again, as a country with limited resources, with a limited base from which to make these kinds of changes, we should use to the full the potential of the Social Fund in terms of the possibility of training the physically handicapped and use it in a more creative way through the resources of AnCO and even outside the direct structure of AnCO training courses. These are practical responses that we can make.  I think the debate itself is useful.  I agree with Senator Brennan and I believe the approach is right.  It is an approach to planning of our environment which places people first.  Once we start thinking in those terms we have a very long way to go.</P>

      <P>I only wish to make one comment and it is in the form of a question although I do not expect to get an answer.  Listening to some of the contributions made this afternoon, especially that made by Senator Goulding, when she said that a person who had a job failed to be able to take the job because of the means to get to the job, what would be the position, say of a <Col N="175" /> person whose mobility was a wheelchair and who was elected to Seanad Éireann?  Whose legal liability would it be to get him into this Chamber?  Would it be the responsibility of the authorities here or of the Office of Public Works?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wish to add my voice to that of the other Senators in supporting the motion before the House. I agree with what several of the Senators have said today about our public transport. Many of us have become handicapped temporarily at some time through involvement in motor accidents and we know that to attempt to get into a train or a bus in any kind of a handicapped condition and while using a crutch or a stick is certainly a feat and not one that somebody at the post-athletic age like myself could easily achieve.  The technology to deal with this question is there but the money to deal with it is not.  When I refer to handicapped people I do not mean wheelchair people alone although the emphasis has been on people in wheelchairs.  I was glad that Senator Brennan widened the debate to take in handicapped people of all types.  However, I would not go so far as to take in able-bodied children because they are far from being handicapped when it comes to getting into public service vehicles or to climbing an apple tree.  Our public buildings, our county council offices, our Government buildings and so on should have easy access facilities.  One would need to be quite active to get into the Department of the Public Service, for instance.  This is the type of thing that I think the debate should bring home to the Department of the Environment particularly.  It should go out to all local authorities throughout the country from the Department of the Environment that in the planning of any public building or in the planning permission being given for a cinema, a dance hall or any place of entertainment that planning permission will not be given unless a ramp or some facility is in that building to allow handicapped people to get in.  This is something that should start now, and the lead should be given by the Government. <Col N="176" /> The planning authority have the power to refuse permission for any building or house.  At local authority level in Mayo where houses for old people are being built they are being specially designed and built.  In a certain number of the houses openings are larger than usual to enable people who use wheelchairs to get in.  This is a simple case of the planners having the idea beforehand and telling the local authority, telling the architect and the contractor that this is what they have to do to ensure that handicapped people will be able to get in and out of the building.  There is no insurmountable problem here.  The Government must take the message that goes out from the Seanad here today.  It is time that something concrete was done and done as soon as possible.  There are many and varied means of doing this but they have it at their fingers' ends in being able to control things at planning level.</P>
      <P>We want to give due credit to all the organisations that have widened and opened the social conscience of this country.  Without the organisations that have been doing this the social conscience that we have particularly shown today might not have flowered as it did. These people did it at their own expense. I know people who have dedicated their lives over the past 20 years to doing something for the handicapped.  Little by little they have broken through that psychological wall which resulted in such neglect.  Let us face the fact that handicap in any family in the past was something that was hidden.  It was something that was shoved under the carpet.  Nobody was proud of it, particularly psychiatric handicap but also physical.  It is only in the last ten or 12 years that the social conscience of this country has been awakened to its responsibilities.  I hope this social conscience is going to be awakened more and more and that in the future we will not have the need for such an excellent motion as was put down here today.</P>

      <P>I am not involved with the physically handicapped but I have served with the mentally handicapped field for the past 17 years and I agree with what Senator Lyons has just <Col N="177" /> said.  It would be a good thing if we took a look at the amount of work that has been done.  I support the motion entirely. It is a very good motion.  I am not involved in the field of the physically handicapped but I would like to say how much has been done in the mentally handicapped field.  It would be a good thing to recognise what we have achieved in the last 20 years and to ask for the future planning to help us.</P>
      <P>I attended a seminar of the United Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped last Friday night and I was amazed when a lawyer stood up and said that he had got an appointment with a State outfit and when he underwent his final medical check he was knocked out of the running because he had a particular handicap.  That really shook me as a Member of this House and as somebody very committed to the mentally handicapped.  It is, of course, something that I will look into.  I have not the answer.  I do not know why it happened.  We are very conscious of what has to be done.  I fully support this motion.  It was excellent of my two colleagues to bring it into the House today and I thank them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to be associated with the motion.  It is too easy for most of us to ignore the plight of our less fortunate brethren in this respect until we see them <i>en masse</i> in wheelchairs on some organised outing and it is brought home to us how great are the problems of logistics in that situation or until we see how well they are provided for in other countries or until we reflect how almost perversely designed many of our public buildings are.</P>
      <P>I had a brief look at the book which Lady Goulding mentioned, the guide for the handicapped in Dublin City.  Whilst one praises the intention behind the book it is also a rather sad book because so much of the information consists of forewarning the handicapped as to how many steps there are in the National Library or in various other public buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion mentions the word &ldquo;campaign&rdquo; and, while the Minister's statement is full of sympathy with the terms <Col N="178" /> of the motion, I do not think that it conveys the precise and vigorous response to the actual motion.  There is not a suggestion in it of accepting the principle that a campaign is needed.  It seems that, since the campaign of the Minister for Health has been so successful and has impinged so much on the public consciousness, the Government might devise some way of having a campaign which would be a corollary to that, raising public consciousness among those who are so fortunate as to be healthy to keep it in the forefront of their minds to make it a matter of public and continuing and constant concern the needs of their less fortunate brethren.</P>
    <P>I compliment the humanitarian spirit and public mindedness of Senators Harte and McAuliffe in bringing this matter before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Senator Harte and I are very pleased with the standard of debate here in connection with this matter.  We are very glad that we brought it before the Seanad.  It has been greatly enlightening to sit and listen to the contributions that were made by the various Senators.</P>
      <P>The people who design new buildings, architects, and so on, should take notice of what was said today.  In my own county the planning authority is very much involved in all public buildings, schools, churches and so on.  The first thing they try to eliminate are steps because it is impossible for a person in a wheelchair to negotiate steps.  I have referred to people in wheelchairs but I really mean all disabled people.</P>
      <P>There may be people who have MS and are not using a wheelchair; they may be using a walking aid or crutches or a stick; there are people who have Parkinson's disease or arthritis.  These people seldom use wheelchairs; they stay out of them as long as they can because the last thing a person wants to do is to go into a wheelchair.  He feels down and out the day he has to use a wheelchair. There are also people with spinal diseases, and these too are among the handicapped people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the old people as well and the young married mothers with young <Col N="179" /> children who have to be brought about in prams.  Here is where the local authority should pay great attention to their footpaths.  I was in a town a few days ago in the west and at every gateway the yards at the back were much lower than the street.  There were three steps down to the gateway and three more up.  People coming along with prams had to go out in the street, and the streets were narrow with cars parked all along and it was a hazard to go along these streets.  It is surprising the number of towns where one finds steps on the public street.</P>
    <P>We have our own House here; the new part was not in use when I came into this House.  There was no consideration given there to the handicapped.  One would want to be an acrobat to go from the front door to the restaurant.  I would like to say that the staff here have been wonderful when any handicapped person has come into the House.  They have played a great part in looking after them. But the extraordinary thing about the handicapped is that they really do not want to be helped.  They resent it.  If there was a ramp there, even if it was fairly steep, they would prefer to try that on their own sooner than be hoisted up a few steps.  I have seen this.  I have reason to know it.  There are very few families who have not someone who is handicapped.</P>
    <P>I do not think the figures the Minister gave us today are exact because if we include all the handicapped it would work out at one person in every five.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed, too, with the regional colleges.  They are all built in similar style, that is, a ground floor and a first floor.  Nowadays more adults than third-level students attend regional colleges. I would estimate the proportion at two to one.  There are handicapped people included in this number and the rooms in these colleges are about 12 feet high so that one must negotiate two flights of stairs in order to get to the first floor.  In every such college or school there should be a lift and it was a grave omission not to include lifts.  Quite a number of the buildings housing schools are being extended at present or are <Col N="180" /> about to be extended and the Department would be well advised to ensure that lifts are installed in such extensions, as they can very easily be installed when a building is extended.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say any more except how pleased we are with the reception our motion got.  I would also remind the Minister that this is a campaign and sympathy is not enough.  I would like the Minister to ensure that enough money is made available for the improvement of facilities for the handicapped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I would first like to take this opportunity of thanking Senators Harte and McAuliffe for putting down this motion for discussion here in this House.  It is a motion which deserves the support of every Member of the Seanad.  It is not a political motion.  I fully support their views.</P>
      <P>Very recently at a meeting, not in this chamber but elsewhere, I made a statement that in anything that involves the health services or people's suffering as a result of any handicap I would never count the cost.  I hope, and I gathered from the debate here, that the Members of Seanad Éireann are of the same view in this regard.  I am glad to see that the Government have given a lead here by installing a ramp at the entrance to Leinster House recently in order to facilitate the physically handicapped.</P>
      <P>Senator McAuliffe said, and rightly, that these are not people that ask anything from the community.  Even though they have a disability they fight it and they like to be independent.  I am sure that they do not want any sympathy from us as public representatives either at local level or here in the Houses of the Oireachtas but certainly my sympathies lie with them and anything that can be done should be done to help them in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing I would say&mdash;and I hope I am in order in saying it&mdash;that the motion mentions that there should be a campaign launched by the Government. Whilst not speaking politically&mdash;and I have covered that by referring to the fact that in anything to do with the health services we never count the cost&mdash;the <Col N="181" /> Department of Health have successfully launched an anti-smoking campaign. Unfortunately I am one of the people who took no heed of it; I would probably be better able to stand behind the microphone and speak here if I did not smoke.  But I would ask the Minister for the Environment to launch a very strong campaign in support of the resolution that was put down here today by the two Senators who have, I am sure, the best intentions in the world and every Member of the Seanad is behind them in their action.  I would hope that the fact of our voices being raised here in the Seanad will be taken note of by the Minister for the Environment and that that campaign will be launched.</P>

      <P>I ask the indulgence of the Members of the Seanad to be allowed to speak on the motion again.</P>
      <P>Personally I was very impressed by the contributions from both sides of the House.  It is my intention to bring to the notice of my colleague, the Minister of State in charge of the Office of Public Works, the case made by the Senators for proper access to all State offices and other public buildings.  I intend also, as a result of the debate, to circularise again local authorities and request them to make their own offices, libraries and public buildings accessible to physically handicapped persons and to use their powers as planning authorities to see that the plans and designs of places of public resort are similarly accessible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I would like to thank Senator Eoin Ryan for his liberal allocation of time for the discussion of motions put down by the Opposition.  It is a little bit more than a concession and it would be unfair of me if I did not say that this motion was received much more readily here than it was in the other House.  I also want to thank all of the Senators who contributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possibly when putting down the motion I was a little naive in trying to confine it to specifics.  Possibly I was carried away by the fact that I treated it <Col N="182" /> as though I were acting as chairman of a trade union meeting ready to rule somebody out of order if he went slightly astray.  But I am delighted to have been wrong because it has given scope to the Seanad as a whole to broaden the issue and in some respects the Minister's reply facilitated this.  It might well be that if we did not tie down the debate we might start taking issue with one another, but as it is I am delighted with the way the debate developed.  It is a very healthy sign and there is no question but that things are going to happen from here and the latest statement from the Minister that he will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister of State in charge of the Office of Public Works is very encouraging indeed. The Minister also referred to the draft regulations and made them available.  He also, in reply to a question, said that he expected developments in this direction in 1979 and that is quite satisfactory from my point of view.</P>
    <P>In view also of the general urgency in this debate I would ask the Minister if he could place more emphasis on the urgency of this matter, not in the sense of replying to it or making some statement today, but in the sense of bringing it to the attention of the Department and of conveying to the Department that there was no area of disagreement at all in regard to the principle of providing easy access to public buildings.  If that were done we will have done a most satisfactory day's work here in this Seanad.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister laid too much emphasis on dealing with the structure of new buildings.  I would ask him to emphasise the urgency of doing something about the existing buildings rather than the planning of new structures.</P>
    <P>This debate has been a very worthwhile exercise.  I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank Senator Goulding for her contribution even though I may not have seen eye to eye with her totally.  The intent was completely correct and she was completely in sympathy with the motion except that she appeared to think I was saying that nothing was being done for the physically <Col N="183" /> handicapped.  I would like to assure her that I do realise and I take the Minister's word for this, that a great deal has been done, but in this area we could do a lot more and it should be done with a great deal of urgency.</P>
    <P>Members of the House may wonder why I did not broaden the debate.  If I had I might not have spoken only about the question of easy access to buildings; I might also have made a lot of comments about how physically handicapped people get out of a building if there is a fire.  There are many areas that need to be covered, but I am very satisfied with progress to date.</P>
    <P>I thank the Leader of the House for making available the time to discuss motions of this nature and I hope this plan continues.  Since we are largely in agreement it would be superfluous of me to go over the whole ground again and delay the Seanad, and since it has been agreed to take the Report Stage of the Industrial and Provident Societies Bill at 7 o'clock I would like to reciprocate the generosity of the Leader of the House by sitting down at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I indicated that my own views on membership of the Community and our activities in the Community had changed somewhat over the last year. From being sternly anti-EEC I have come to accept that our membership is a <i>fait accompli</i> and my view is that we should make the best of it in the national interest.  I would apply that to the direct elections.  Therefore, while I have a certain sympathy with the boycott groups, with those groups who propose with very inadequate resources I am sure to lead a &ldquo;Boycott the elections campaign&rdquo;, I really do think it is a rather negative attitude since we have to elect 15 to the Assembly and they should be the best 15.</P>
      <P>I intend to vote for candidates, irrespective of party, who assure me that they are realistic about the Assembly, that they do not exaggerate the importance of the elections and who moreover among the candidates available are most opposed to a further surrender of our national interest to the Community.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise again the strength of feeling here on the issue of neutrality.  It arises out of the reports and the Minister's statement in connection with the section on disarmament. The Government should be under no illusion as to the deep strength of feeling in the country on the issue of neutrality despite the desire of people in certain important quarters to condition our people otherwise and prepare them for a great modification if not an abandonment of our traditional policy on neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I point out here is that our traditional policy on neutrality was not simply a piece of expediency during World War II, that it has deep historical roots and that it had fruitful expression in the 1950s and early 1960s.  So I fear the way in which the Ministers of the Nine are aligning their foreign policy positions has already resulted in fact in a diminution of our independent stand in world affairs, especially in relation to the Third World.  We must beware of the threat to our neutrality inherent in any talk of a European defence union and in recent statements by politicians here that if the EEC were attacked we would be <Col N="186" /> obliged to join in its defence.  In fact we are in no way committed by the Treaty to participate in a defence union and there must be no abandonment by stealth of our position on neutrality.</P>
    <P>On the question of enlargement, one can view it in different ways.  I have heard people seriously claiming that the admission of Spain, Greece and Portugal would represent a welcome cultural shift in the spirit of the Community; that the EEC at the moment is essentially northern, predominantly Protestant perhaps, in the cultural sense, and that bringing in the Mediterranean elements would bring us nearer to a realisation of the total spirit of Europe.  That is an interesting, although somewhat romantic view, about enlargement.  There is another and less romantic view about enlargement, that it represents the anxiety of the EEC to achieve some kind of impressive political coup to compensate for its lack of progress in other areas, for its loss of vision, for the stagnation which has characterised it in recent years, that enlargement would be a kind of spectacular achievement in itself, and perhaps the Community have not considered sufficiently the problems which would attend enlargement, that they are impressed by the very idea, so to speak, of bringing in the Mediterranean countries.</P>
    <P>When the EEC says it would welcome these countries in the interests of democracy&mdash;and this, in fact, was the prime reason for admitting them&mdash;this means not only that the EEC wants to prevent a return of right-wing dictatorship in these countries, but that the EEC also wants to ensure&mdash;and this is not given the same publicity in the grand talk about the interests of democracy&mdash;that these strategically important areas do not move too far in the direction of socialism.  The concern about democracy extends very much to a leftward direction as well as to a right-wing direction.</P>
    <P>In regard to the EMS, since I am not one of the six people who understand it I simply want to say that it looks to me as if its implementation will further advance the hegemony of West Germany already so prominent in EEC affairs.  After all <Col N="187" /> we must realise, although it is not regarded as polite to say so, that West Germany desperately needs respectability. There is, for all her wealth and all her progress, still a feeling of insecurity about her acceptance by the other European countries.  On two grounds West Germany needs to gain and continue to have the respectable attitudes of other countries.  One is that the memory of World War II is still quite fresh in parts of Europe.  The other one is that there is considerable jealousy of German efficiency and German prosperity.  To balance this potential distrust of and antagonism towards West Germany, she needs the Community very badly indeed, the kind of respectability which the EEC provides, while she continues to be the most prominent economic power in the Community.</P>
    <P>Looking at the EMS from an Irish point of view, or rather from a governmental point of view, our Government must be greatly tempted by the prospects held out by the EMS because, living like Micawber from day to day, hoping that something will turn up, they must be strongly attracted by the hope that the EMS will lead to a greater willingness by banks and Governments, especially in West Germany, to lend us more money.  If membership of the EMS will involve some belt-tightening, then that will fit in very nicely indeed with the hair-shirt policies which are already being heralded by Government Ministers. In this sense, the EMS would be welcome for getting Fianna Fáil off the hook of the lavish promises made in the manifesto.</P>
    <P>When I moved the adjournment last week, I was raising the point that newspapers in recent weeks, particularly <i>The Irish Press</i> on 1 November, reported that the Commission in Brussels was expressing dissatisfaction with the buy national campaigns, with our own Buy Irish Campaign, and presumably with similar campaigns in other countries to buy national products.  When the Irish Goods Council launched that campaign some months ago, I remember speaking enthusiastically in its favour in Cork, and subsequently here in the Seanad, but I also warned that it seemed to me that <Col N="188" /> the Buy Irish Campaign was an anachronism in EEC terms, that it represented a form of economic nationalism and, therefore, it was incompatible with the European spirit as it is conceived in Brussels.</P>
    <P>According to newspaper reports this indeed has happened, and according to these reports Brussels has expressed dissatisfaction. Mr. Vivian Murray, according to the same report in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 1 November, the very able director of the Buy Irish Campaign, said there was really no substance in this, that the EEC Commission had no reason for opposing the Buy Irish Campaign, apparently because there was not any protectionism as such in it. Nevertheless, it seems to me to raise a very important question.  I am not sure whether the Government have already clarified elsewhere this important matter, but I should be very glad indeed if the Minister would refer to it in his reply, namely, whether the Buy Irish Campaign is in conflict with the spirit of the EEC, and whether the EEC has indicated this.</P>
    <P>More than once in recent months reference has been made by Government Ministers to the direct elections and their possible relationship with Northern Ireland and North-South relations.  If I mistake not, the Minister last week expressed the hope that common membership of an assembly North and South, 18 seats from all Ireland so to speak, would bring about a situation of closer co-operation and closer understanding between the MPs, between the European Assembly members from Northern Ireland and our own 15 here.</P>
    <P>We should be very realistic about this one.  I was talking to representatives of the applicant countries at a seminar recently, and the Greeks and the Spaniards are under no illusions that their membership of the Community will any way help them to solve their internal political problems.  The Spaniards realise that the crisis among the Basques and in Catalonia is something for themselves to try to solve.  The Cyprus problem will remain a bilateral one for Greece and Turkey.  I do not think common membership of an assembly will advance <Col N="189" /> substantially North-South understanding or reconciliation.</P>
    <P>We remember the referendum campaign in 1972 when it was suggested that common membership of the Community would somehow help to bring the North and the South closer.  There is no evidence for this.  The problems between North and South and the problems within Northern Ireland are for Irishmen to solve.  They do not depend on, nor will they be mitigated in any substantial way by, common membership of an assmbly. Where the Rev. lan Paisley will to continue to glare at the Papist representatives from the Free State.  After all, if common membership of the Council of Europe, or the United Nations, has not advanced our Irish problems in any way, it is unrealistic to expect that common membership of the assembly will help to solve our problems.</P>
    <P>This leads me to a more general and concluding point, a point actually made by Senator Brugha, which I should like to reinforce.  He said that the great danger next June is that candidates will exaggerate the importance of the assembly, will exaggerate the importance of what they can achieve within the assembly. Of course, there will be a real dilemma for candidates here.  Here they are asking the people to vote them into a job with magnificent salaries and expenses, and they will have to give very strong reasons why the people should be sufficiently interested to turn out.  It seems to me that the danger is they will exaggerate what the assembly can do and what they can do within the assembly.</P>
    <P>I fully support Senator Brugha's plea for truth and realism in the European elections next June.  It is always a mistake, of course, and it always creates cynicism when politicians promise more than they can deliver.  It will be as true next June as it was in June 1977.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the various Members of the Seanad who contributed to the debate on the Eleventh and Twelfth Reports.  I am pleased, indeed, <Col N="190" /> at the interest Senators have shown in the Reports and the quality of their various contributions to the debate and all matters relating to the European Community, not specifically the Eleventh and Twelfth Reports.  However, we are dealing with the Eleventh and Twelfth Reports at this time, and I will now reply to the various and indeed varied points made during the course of the debate.</P>
      <P>I will deal with them under various headings: (1) institutional matters dealing with enlargement, direct elections, the question of the Three Wise Men which I understand was raised by Senator Mary Robinson, and the European Council; (2) company law; (3) agriculture; (4) regional policy; (5) social policy; (6) EMS; (7) EPC, including the Middle East, the CSCE, and terrorism and defence.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal first with the general question of institutions.  Senator Robinson raised the question of the institutional structure of the Community and was concerned in particular about the role of the European Council.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, one of the arguments made when Ireland joined the Community was that the institutional structure was geared to the protection of the interests of small countries.  That is still our belief, and this belief that the institutional balance provided for in the Treaties must be preserved is shared by our partners.  In believing that the decision-making procedures can and ought to be improved, we are in no way implying that a fundamental change is necessary.</P>
      <P>We have been concerned with this question of the functioning of the institutions, particularly in the context of enlargement, and at every opportunity we have consistently stressed the fact that enlargement will require certain adaptations.  We have consistently made it clear that this must be done within the existing institutional framework.  This view is shared by our partners and, indeed, by the Commission, which has made some proposals in the matter.  One of the ways of improving decision-making might be the greater use of majority voting in the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> The question of examining the functioning of the institutions is at present under discussion in the Community, as Senators will be well aware.  Senator Robinson in her long and detailed exposition of what she thinks is right, and what she thinks is wrong, and where she thinks the strengths lie and where she thinks the weaknesses lie in relation to the ECC, voiced concern on the &ldquo;Wise Men&rdquo; proposal by the President of France.  It is a concern shared by many. On the other hand, it is agreed that the functioning of the institutions must be examined in the context of enlargement and that enlargement is likely to exacerbate any existing problems.  We have satisfied ourselves that there is no intention in the present proposal to call into question the fundamental principles and objectives of the Community, and whatever kind of committee of &ldquo;Wise Men&rdquo; emerges, whether it be three or four or some other number, we are satisfied that the Treaty of Rome itself will not become a subject for discussion.</P>
    <P>This matter is under discussion in the Community and I do not wish to speculate on what might emerge from these discussions.  The matter will be discussed by the Foreign Ministers at their meeting later this month.  However, I can assure the House that the only intent of the proposal was to promote reflection on the functioning of the Community institutions in the context of forthcoming developments such as enlargement.  If it does bring people's minds to bear on that particular aspect of these matters, it will have performed an important function. Senator Robinson was right to raise the matter and I believe my explanation will satisfy her.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson also mentioned the European Council, and mentioned the fear that was voiced elsewhere that it lacks the safeguards to protect our interests in that it is not a proper Community institution as such.  The intention behind the establishment of the European Council was that it would deal with really major issues which were not capable of being adequately handled at a lower level and that it should provide an impetus at the highest level for the development of the Communities by laying <Col N="192" /> down broad guidelines based on an overall approach which would take into account political and other factors.  It was not intended that the European Council should in any way develop into a court of appeal against decisions taken by the Council at ministerial level, or that the Council of Ministers should avoid its responsibilities by referring decisions to the European Council.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson will be aware the Commission participates at meetings of the Council.  The European Council has achieved to a degree some of the objectives, particularly an overall approach to internal and external matters and a certain cohesion of the activities of the Community.  Despite the concern properly raised by Senator Robinson, a concern about which we should be careful, we must accept that the European Council is a fact of life.  It is a body with the potential to do good work for the development of the Community.  It has another very important prominence in that here we have the heads of the Nine member states coming to meet from time to time.  It is important that the leaders of the countries within the Common Market should have the opportunity of meeting from time to time to discuss various common problems. After all, they are the leaders of their various countries and it is proper that they should be seen to be actively involved in the running of the Community. I am not offering any apologies for the existence of the European Council; rather would I welcome its continuity and its functioning.</P>
    <P>In regard to the European Parliament, the major development is, of course, direct elections and the rôle which a directly elected Parliament might play in the Community.  Direct elections, as such, will not, of course, mean any new powers for the Parliament although it can, I think, be expected that a directly elected Parliament containing more than twice the number of members in the present Parliament is likely to seek to assert itself, even within the existing powers, which in the budgetary field are, indeed, significant.  I do not wish to speculate on what powers the Parliament might have or should have.  Nobody would have <Col N="193" /> predicted ten years ago that the present Parliament would have the budgetary powers it has today.</P>
    <P>The introduction of an element of democratic supervision into the Community must give rise to a changed rôle for the Parliament, although that will be a gradual process, as all these processes are, indeed some might say painful processes.  At the end of the day generally what emerges is good and for the benefit of all.  One of our hopes is that a directly elected Parliament will be more aware, in deciding on budgetary allocations, of its responsibility to bear in mind the priorities of under-developed regions. This is where the 15 elected members from this country will have an important rôle to play, not only on behalf of the urban communities but on behalf of the rural communities and the less developed areas within the rural structure of our nation.</P>
    <P>In relation to institutions generally, we recognise that the prospect of adaptation in the context of developments such as enlargement calls for careful consideration of ways to ensure that these adaptations will ensure the effective operation of the Community.  We believe that the approach to such consideration must be firmly on the basis that the balance of the Treaties cannot be altered to create any upper tier of member states for the purpose of decision-making.  We have consistently stated this and our partners are fully aware of our position in this respect.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have drawn attention to the significance of the election to the Parliament being held in both the Republic and Northern Ireland on the same day.  The respected Senator from University College Cork brought up this subject and I agree thoroughly with the views expressed by him.  It gives us the opportunity for the first time to operate within a democratic parliament as a whole island.  This is a very important and significant step forward towards the unity which we all so urgently desire and require for the eventual peace of this land of ours.</P>
    <P>Those elected, from whatever part of the country they may come, will, indeed, <Col N="194" /> have a unique opportunity to work together for the benefit of all the people of this island.  In the many areas of Community activity where the interests of both North and South coincide, there will be ample scope for fruitful co-operation between members from both sides of the Border.  The result will surely be a distinctly Irish contribution to the work of the Parliament.  Politicians from all political parties and structures on this island will be meeting together in the council chambers of Europe, not to mention the European Parliament itself.  That will give them an opportunity to discuss their common problems with one another and to break down, in direct personal confrontation, the doubts and fears they might have about one another's point of view.  There is nothing like a cup of tea or a glass of beer sometimes to cure doubts one might have about one another.  Here is a golden opportunity, I believe.</P>

      <P>It would.  It is not so bad.  Senator Murphy is not that bad off the field of play.  He is a decent man in every respect.  This is not, of course, to reflect on his contribution in the Seanad, quite the contrary.  What I am saying is that it gives us this opportunity for the first time and we should take full advantage of it.</P>
      <P>Under the heading of company law, Senator Robinson asked about our intentions in the company law area and, in particular, regarding the implementation of the Second and Fourth Directives. Plans for a comprehensive review of company law have not been possible because of the pressure of EEC work. However, when the review takes place the establishment of a Select Committee of both Houses to examine the question of reform of company law will be considered. In the short-term, it is planned to bring in a Bill which will implement the Second Directive, revise the First and make important technical amendments to the 1963 Act.  The implementation of the Fourth Directive is likely to take place within the next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the very important front of <Col N="195" /> agriculture, Senators have acknowledged the significant benefits which have accrued to the agricultural sector in Ireland from the operation of the common agricultural policy.  Senator Staunton mentioned that some areas have benefited more than others, specifically the west of Ireland.  I say good luck to the west.  They can benefit more than others.  Somebody is doing the work very well.  While the CAP must not be confused with a regional policy, and the Government are committed to the pursuit of a comprehensive regional policy, I would accept that every possible effort must be made to ensure that all areas of the country benefit from it.</P>
    <P>Senators are undoubtedly aware that Commissioner Gundelach, the Commissioner responsible for agriculture, has indicated that he intends to introduce a special package of measures to assist in the development of agriculture in the west of Ireland.  Consultations between the Commission services and officials of the Department of Agriculture on the scope of the measures to be introduced are continuing, and I would hope the Commission's proposals will emerge very soon.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton has also drawn attention to the difficulties which Irish farmers face, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the EEC Farm Modernisation Scheme, and to the fact that many of them are classed as &ldquo;transitional farmers&rdquo; and are unable to qualify for the higher range of development grants.  The Government have expressed their concern on this matter to the Commission, which has committed itself to a reform and improvement of this and other socio-structural directives.</P>
    <P>On regional policy, several Senators spoke on the question of the current position regarding the Community's regional policy, or more precisely, the lack of such a policy, as well as Ireland's small share of the European Regional Development Fund.  I agree generally with the remarks which have been made. Those concerning the inadequacy of the present Regional Fund, and indeed our share of that Fund, are, of course, perfectly valid, and it is quite clear that the Fund alone cannot contribute effectively to tackling the Community's <Col N="196" /> regional problem.  While the present Fund represents an increase on the previous one, it remains hopelessly under-endowed in relation to the tasks it has to accomplish.</P>
    <P>However, the recent developments at Community level justify a certain amount of optimism as far as alleviating the Community's regional problems is concerned. Here I have in mind the renewed commitment to finding a solution to these problems which is implicit in the communiqué issued following the meeting in Copenhagen of the European Council.  I also have in mind the proposals regarding Guidelines for Community Regional Policy which, I believe, could be of enormous importance, although, of course, their benefit is likely to be felt only in the medium or long term.  Nevertheless, they represent the first real beginning to a Community regional policy.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson inquired about the use of the non-quota section of the Regional Fund which is the principal innovation contained in the revised Fund Regulation.  The regulation is at present the subject of a conciliation procedure between the Parliament and the Council, but this is expected to be completed shortly.  While the quota distributed part of the Fund will continue to support the regional measures of the member states, the intention behind the creation of the non-quota section is that it should support specific actions designed to take account of the regional effects of existing and future Community policies.  I should mention here that only 5 per cent of the funds will be devoted to the non-quota section.  Thus, only £60 million will be available over the three-year period 1978 to 1980 for the Community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Regarding possible uses of this non-quota section for Ireland's special needs, I should mention that the range of actions which are to qualify and the financial arrangements which will govern the granting of aid are to be the subject of proposals by the Commission to the Council.  We shall make every effort to influence the type of measures which the Commission will propose.  I should add, <Col N="197" /> in this connection, that we are conscious of the possibilities of the non-quota section in the context of Community aid for cross-Border projects since its introduction. Following demands by our delegation the Council agreed to an entry in the minutes which allows for consideration by the Council of a proposal from the Commission regarding a request for aid from two or more member states for aid relating to border problems.  This will, obviously, be one of the uses of the non-quota section which will have a particular interest.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of social policy Senator Robinson made two specific inquiries in the social policy area to which I would like to reply.  Firstly, the proposals regarding the use of the European Social Fund to help alleviate youth unemployment are still being actively discussed.  The June Council of Ministers for Labour and Social Affairs failed to reach agreement on the text before it, principally because of the opposition of one delegation to certain elements of the proposals, and the German Presidency duly raised the question at the Bremen European Council in early July.  This, having confirmed its view that improving the employment situation is a crucial objective of the Community, called on the Council of Ministers for Labour and Social Welfare and Social Affairs to decide on measures to combat youth unemployment so that such measures can come into force on 1 January next.</P>
    <P>Following this the Presidency initiated a series of bilateral contacts involving Ireland amongst others and there were further discussions at an informal meeting of the Social Affairs and Labour Ministers in Frankfurt in late September. The item will be discussed at the Council of Ministers for Labour and Social Affairs, which is scheduled to meet at the end of this month.  I am hopeful that this Council will result in a positive decision in this matter which is, of course, of utmost importance to this country.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson also asked about the current state of play regarding the draft directive on equal treatment for men and women in the field of social security.  The draft text, which was circulated <Col N="198" /> early last year, was only discussed briefly at the social questions group level at that time.  Discussions were, however, resumed on it since July and a great deal of progress has been made since then.  Some points still remain to be agreed to, and it is hoped that the directive can be adopted at the Council of Ministers for Labour and Social Affairs when it meets on 27 November.</P>
    <P>Given the interest which the formulation of the proposed European Monetary System has engendered at all levels within the Community it was quite natural that it should have been the subject of such extended comment in the debate on 11th and 12th Reports.  I shall confine myself to elaborating on and perhaps recasting, if necessary, certain of the points made, within my competence.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton drew attention to the fact that we should be alert to possible pitfalls which might exist for us in some of the major issues arising in the Community at present.  Allow me to assure the House and Senators that as regards EMS we have subjected the proposals to an exhaustive and detailed examination and continue to do so on the domestic, bilateral and multilateral fronts.  The potential rewards of a successful EMS, while impressive, have not blinded us to the reality that membership of the system implies greater economic discipline all round and this will apply in particular to the less prosperous member states.</P>
    <P>Our examination has shown that we will need Community assistance if we are to cope successfully and satisfactorily with membership of the system.  The figure of £650 million is an indication of the order of magnitude of what we think is needed.  We wish to participate in the EMS without having to engage in deflationary policies as a result.  In asking for Community aid to assist our entry, we have stressed our positive attitude to the EMS while, at the same time, calling attention to our rate of economic development compared to the Community average.</P>
    <P>The scheme, to be effective, must combine exchange rate measures with the application of the correct internal <Col N="199" /> measures.  Our case for aid has been confined solely to the EMS context.  This I think strengthens our case.  We would envisage utilising the funds received in infrastructural and industrial development, thereby adding to the productivity and competitiveness of our mostly export orientated companies, and assisting us to overcome any adverse effects arising from participation in the EMS.  Community assistance will not, however, relieve us of applying strictly domestic policies on joining the system.  As Senator Whitaker correctly pointed out during his contribution, if we are to enter and remain in the system without embarrassment, it must be on the basis of tougher policies at home, particularly in relation to costs.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with Senator Robinson on the need for real and substantial progress on the balanced regional development.  We feel, however, that it is best to pursue our demands in this area outside of, but parallel to, our request for assistance in the EMS context to prevent our having to resort to unwanted deflationary policies.  EMS is not EMU or even EU and does not require the sort of enlargement of the Community budget which EMS would require.  I would think, however, that the more favourable climate in the Community which EMS could well trigger off might be conducive to the adoption of real measures to reduce regional disruptions.</P>
    <P>While many of the detailed technical provisions of the new system have, at this stage, been elaborated, this has for the most part taken place at the level of officials.  The decisions to be taken on EMS, including the transfer of resources questions, are, ultimately political and rest with the politicians.  These are political questions to be taken by the leaders of the various Community countries in the European Council.  The competence of the European Council to unscramble what is essentially a very technical question and to get to the political core of the matter should not be doubted.  At the meeting of the European Council last December, for example, a solution was found and decisions taken in relation to an exceedingly technical matter&mdash;the precise budgetary contributions <Col N="200" /> to be made by the member states this year and next.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson made certain remarks regarding the general diminution of power of the European Commission. If she meant this to apply also in the EMS context I would point out that while the proposed system has emerged essentially as a result of the Schmidt-Giscard initiative it must be seen very much against the ground prepared by the Commission proposals on the EMU submitted to the European Council last December, and indeed the Florence speech of the President of the Commission, President Jenkins, the previous October, in which he made a plea for the positive leap in the monetary area, was significant.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson counsels caution in our approach to EMU and indeed, having drawn attention to the difference in outlook on the system between here and Brussels where, in her own words, and I quote: &ldquo;the clear advantages to Germany and France of this device are seen&rdquo; proceeds to chide us gently in her own civilised way for being &ldquo;dramatically more confident&rdquo; at the prospect of the imminent approach of EMS than, for example, either Italy or the United Kingdom.  I can only speak for this country and reiterate that our positive approach to EMS is based on the fact that the proposals are important not only in their own right but also as a move towards greater integration in Europe.  We wish to enter the system and hope that the conditions will enable us to do so.  As I have said, Senator Robinson counsels this caution, and I would like to assure her that we are doing our bit in that respect.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson again requested information on whether the EMS is to be operated through the present institutional framework of the Community.  Firstly, in respect of the Community assistance of £650 million which we have requested and which I have already mentioned, it is envisaged that this should be a transfer from the Community budget over a five-year period. This transfer is not, however, to be confused with the credit and other support arrangements envisaged for the EMS.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="201" /> The Bremen European Council agreed that, not later than two years after the start of the new system, the existing credit arrangements and institutions would be consolidated in a new institution, the European Monetary Fund, which would replace the present European Monetary Co-operation Fund. Pending the establishment of the European Monetary Fund, the European Council envisaged interim arrangements for deposit of reserves and for expansion of credit support facilities.  It is envisaged that these interim arrangements will involve each member state depositing 20 per cent of its gold and dollar reserves with the European Monetary Co-operation Fund, receiving European currency units in return for settlement of debts between central banks and arising from the currency intervention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Germans going to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope so.  The system as outlined at Bremen contained a proposal in regard to the establishment, in the interim period, prior to the setting up of a new fund, of a new credit support scheme based on contributions of national currency by each member state in an overall amount equivalent to the amount of reserve deposits, namely, about £17 billion.  It is, however, likely that if the EMS is to get under way early in 1979 it will not be possible to work out the details of this particular arrangement in time.  The credit support from the commencement of the EMS is more likely to be made available through expansion of the Community's balance credit facilities&mdash;the short-term monetary support scheme and the medium term financial aid scheme.  Decisions relating to the short-term monetary support scheme will be taken by the Central Bank Governors meeting within the European Monetary Co-operation Fund, while decisions on the medium term scheme will be taken by the Finance Ministers within the Council.  I do not feel that, particularly in the interim period prior to the setting up of European Monetary Fund, the institutional <Col N="202" /> arrangements as described need to give rise to any cause for alarm.</P>
      <P>In concluding on this subject, I would wish to reiterate that the decisions of EMS are essentially political ones to be taken by the European Council and by the various leaders of the nine nations involved in that council.  As the decisions must inevitably be influenced by the present round of bilateral meetings going on in the Community, Ireland is not sparing any effort in bringing home to our partners the particular considerations we have in relation to this proposed system.</P>
      <P>Under the heading of the Middle East, I should like to refer briefly to some points which were raised in the course of the debate concerning current developments in that unsettled part of the world. I am happy that Senator Staunton has welcomed the Camp David agreements and sees them as offering the possibility of progress towards a just and comprehensive peace in the area.  This is the view already expressed by the Foreign Ministers of the Nine.</P>
      <P>Senator Staunton, in his remarks, rightly touched on the issue of the Palestinians as a basic one in a just and comprehensive settlement of the Middle-East problem.  Indeed, the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his address to the 33rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly on 28 September referred to the necessity, in arriving at any full settlement of the problems of the area, to respect the legitimate rights of the Palestinians as one of the essential components of any such settlement.</P>
      <P>The question of development of settlements for Israel in territories which it has occupied since 1967 was discussed at last year's session of the UN General Assembly.  The Nine, in a common intervention delivered by the Presidency, stated that they considered the establishment of new settlements to be contrary to the norms of international law.  They stated further that the policy of establishing settlements in the occupied territories aggravated tensions in the region and created difficulties in regard to negotiations leading to a just and lasting peace.  They expressed the hope that obstacles would not be placed in the way of the peaceful settlement which now seemed a possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> The process of peace has taken a step further this year.  However, the pursuit of policies such as the expansion of existing settlements and the creation of new ones, which give rise to further complications or cause additional difficulties in the negotiating process, is to be regretted.</P>
    <P>On the question of terrorism, Senator Robinson referred to the agreement among the other member states of the EEC concerning the application of the European Convention on the suppression of terrorism.  As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in his speech to the House last week, Ireland agreed to the opening for signature of this agreement at a meeting of Ministers for Justice, attended by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, on 10 October last and member states are currently considering the legal and constitutional implications of signature and ratification.  As far as our country is concerned, the Government are hopeful that we will soon be in a position to sign the agreement. Ratification is, of course, a matter which would then come before the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I would point out, in response to Senator Robinson's remarks, that an important feature of this current agreement is that it embodies the principle of <i>aut dedere aut judicare</i>, which gives Governments the option of either trying persons accused of terrorist offences in the jurisdiction where they are apprehended or of extraditing them.  As the Senator will be aware, it was the absence of just such a provision in previous agreements of this kind which presented constitutional difficulties for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of defence, Senator Murphy referred in his remarks to talk of a new defence union for Western Europe and of our own involvement in any such hypothetical union.  I agree entirely with him that the question is hypothetical.  There is no common defence policy in the European Community and, indeed, no indication that there will be one in the foreseeable future.  Any talk of such a policy is somewhat premature and remote, to say the least.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy also mentioned the <Col N="204" /> matter of the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, and he asked for a specific reference to it in any reply forthcoming from Government speakers or any speaker on behalf of the Government.  As I understand it, we have received no indication whatsoever and we have not been told by anybody, least of all the Commission, that the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign is in conflict with the principles of the Treaty. My own belief, and that of the Government, is that the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign is a success and this House has an absolute obligation to support this campaign in the national interest.  Senator Murphy very properly paid tribute to the director of the campaign, Mr. Vivian Murray, and I, on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, would like to add my words of praise to the work being done by Mr. Murray on behalf of the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  There is something psychologically in our makeup which, in some way, makes us go for goods other than Irish goods.  Personally, when I go into a shop I ask for an Irish-made product, and the only way in which this campaign can be a success is to get it into the minds of the men, women and children of this nation that when they go into a shop or supermarket they specifically direct their minds to quality Irish products.  In the event of there not being acceptable Irish products, then they are entitled, in any democracy, to go outside the country to buy whichever product they are looking for.  I certainly enthusiastically endorse the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign and believe it is in the national interest.  This House has an obligation to secure the national interest.</P>
    <P>In connection with another matter which Senators may, inadvertently, not have referred to, the United Nations Peace Keeping Force&mdash;the Irish troops serving this country abroad&mdash;I pay particular tribute to our troops who are serving with the United Nations interim force in the Lebanon.  This mission is a difficult and dangerous mission.  It is a mission which has to be peopled by brave soldiers who know where their final duty may lie and will understand that.  It is a taxing one but they have been acquitting themselves honourably <Col N="205" /> with integrity and dedication on behalf of the nation.</P>

      <P>Senator Brugha mentioned a significant point during his broad contribution to this debate: the question of propagandising the direct elections and bringing to public attention the extent to which European institutions have been working over the years since the commencement of the Treaty of Rome.  It is fair to say that to some extent the population and the public have been misled into believing that the Community is a vast bureaucratic amorphous mass and rather remote from the daily lives of the ordinary man and woman.  It is fair to say that we, as politicians, have not done anything to encourage public awareness in the minds of the people.  If there is any blame, it lies with us collectively.  I agree with the Senator that we will need to make a serious effort to let the people know.  That is the slogan which will have to be uppermost in the minds of the politicians who will be bringing to public attention the direct elections.  There will have to be a &ldquo;let the people know&rdquo; campaign. What the Community is and how it affects us in our daily lives.  I hope that the direct elections campaign will provide us with an opportunity of mounting an information campaign which would achieve that.  The Community is conscious, as indeed are the political parties, of the need to bring to the attention of the people the relevance of the institutions and the relevance of the EEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to raise what I regard as a very important issue on the Adjournment this evening.  It concerns the continuing failure by the Minister for Social Welfare to make the necessary regulations under the Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare) Allowances Act of 1975 to provide for the procedure and rules for determining appeals under that Act. First of all I want to make a legal point about this failure by the Minister, and then I want to draw attention to the very serious and harrowing situation that results for people who are extremely vulnerable.  It affects people who are at the lowest end of the scale, people who are in circumstances of great poverty and circumstances of great need, and I shall illustrate how harshly and unfairly it affects them.  I particularly wanted the Minister to be present because this is not the first time I have drawn his attention to the matter, and would like him to hear and to respond to what I am going to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="211" /> The Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare) Allowances Act, 1975 came into operation on 1 July 1977.  It therefore coincided more or less with the term of office of the Fianna Fáil Government. The Act was intended to effect an important change in the whole approach to the welfare payments at the most minimal level: the replacement of the old home assistance by a scheme of supplementary welfare allowances.  The qualitative change that was intended was to abolish the discretionary home assistance&mdash;with its connotations of public charity and its uncertainty for the individual concerned&mdash;and to replace it with a structure of legal rights to supplementary welfare including a right of appeal.  Section 2 of the Act sets out the basic legal entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance to be available to &ldquo;... every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his needs and the needs of any adult or child dependent. ...&rdquo;  In the appendix to the Act, and in successive regulations, the minimum allowance that an adult with or without dependants will get is set out clearly.  It is therefore a departure from the discretionary home assistance which is replaced by a legal entitlement to a minimum supplementary welfare allowance if a person is not getting some other allowance under the Social Welfare Code.  There is also intended to be a supplement if necessary in the case of somebody who is getting another kind of allowance&mdash;such as a disability benefit or a deserted wife's allowance or whatever it may be&mdash;on the basis of an assessment of his needs.  The point at issue here in this motion on the Adjournment is that there is also provision for a right of appeal.  That is contained in section 7 of the Act which I feel I must read for the second time onto the record of the House.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;7. (1)  Where a person who is dissatisfied with the determination of an officer of the health board of a claim by him for supplementary welfare allowance an appeal shall lie against such determination to a person (being either another officer of the health board or a person not such an officer) <Col N="212" /> appointed or designated by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 7 says</P>
    <P>The Minister may by regulations made under section 21 of this Act provide for the making and determination of appeals under this section.</P>
    <P>Since the Act came into force on 1 July 1977 the Minister has been pressed by various bodies and individuals&mdash;including to my personal knowledge, by the Association of Professional Social Workers, by Deputy John O'Connell in the other House, by various individuals, and by me in this House on 8 February last on another Adjournment matter and subsequently in correspondence&mdash;to make the necessary regulations in order to establish a proper procedure and rules for exercising that right of appeal.  During the discussion on the Adjournment on 8 February 1978 I referred to the absence of these regulations in Volume 88 at column 316:</P>
    <P>Regrettably the appeal is to one person rather than to a three-man appeal tribunal, but that is the clear meaning of the section.  However, no such regulations providing for an appeal structure have been made by the Minister.  He informally designated the programme officer in each health board area.  That, again, I would maintain is entirely inadequate when we are talking about rights of beneficiaries&mdash;a right for beneficiaries in very real need&mdash;who are entitled to appeal from what they claim to be a wrong determination of their needs in the particular case.  The whole approach seems to be one of continuing the discretionary aspect and of playing down or indeed disguising the fact that it is a question of rights which includes a right of appeal.</P>
    <P>On that occasion also the Minister was not able to be present for the' Adjournment Matter, but he wrote to me subsequently about some of the other matters I had raised concerning the inadequacy of the forms for supplementary welfare applications.  I replied to the Minister's letter and referred again to the <Col N="213" /> need for regulations establishing the basic procedure and rules for an appeal under this Act.  I received a reply from the Minister, dated 12 April 1978, in which he referred to the matter I had raised and stated:</P>
    <P>As regards the appeal system itself, I cannot agree that I am required by section 7 (2) of the Act to make regulations and I am advised that the section confers a discretionary power.  I agree, entirely, that the rules of natural and constitutional justice must apply to appeals under the Act but these rules apply quite independently of any regulations.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that the present informal system of appeals is causing any serious problems.  However, I have received a number of suggestions regarding the introduction of a more formal appeals' system with more elaborate structures.  I am weighing all the considerations involved in these suggestions and I hope to be in a position shortly to decide on a system which will best serve the interests of the claimants to Supplementary Welfare Allowance.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were present I would like to ask first of all whether the &ldquo;advice&rdquo; he has obtained is the legal advice of the Attorney General's Office, or whether it is merely the internal advice from officials of his Department?  If he has not obtained a legal opinion from the Attorney General's Office, then I feel the issue is such an important one&mdash;on which I disagree basically with the advice referred to in his letter&mdash;that the opinion of the Attorney General should be obtained in the matter.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I do not know whether I move in entirely different circles from the Minister&mdash;I presume I do&mdash;but I fail to see how he can be unaware that the present informal system of appeals is causing serious problems.  It is causing very serious problems indeed for all those who have applied for supplementary welfare, are refused their application, and who then try to appeal.  I believe it is the considered view of professional social workers that the system is not working properly.  What <Col N="214" /> happens in reality is that even if the person who is making the appeal specifically asks for an oral hearing he never gets an oral hearing.  People never get any proper process of appeal in any sense that I understand it.  The rules of natural justice went out the window and were never there at all in relation to appeals against a refusal of supplementary welfare.  How the Minister can try to suggest that they are safeguarded, or that they have any legal significance under the present system i cannot understand.</P>
    <P>Also, what the Minister has done creates internal problems with the staff in that he has informally designated a programme manager who is the superior of the community welfare officer who will have refused the allowance in the first place.  The person who exercises the right of appeal does not get any oral hearing on it, does not know the grounds on which the appeal may be considered favourably, or not, and ultimately does not know the grounds on which the appeal was refused.  Alternatively, he does not know why the appeal was allowed in part but not allowed in full.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to continue now in the presence of the Minister.  I wanted to have him here, to be in a position to respond to the points that I am making.</P>
    <P>It is certainly my personal experience&mdash;and the experience of the members of the Association of Professional Social Workers who have met with officials of the Minister's Department time and again and who also have always raised this question&mdash;that the present system is working very badly because it is not an effective system of appeal.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I take issue with the Minister on the question of whether he has a legal discretion to issue the necessary regulations, and since he is now present in the House I would like to put the question to him as to whether he has obtained a legal opinion from the Attorney General's Office on whether or not he has this discretion.  In my opinion as a lawyer reading that section, once there is a legal entitlement to supplementary welfare and a statutory right of appeal, as there is in section 7, this connotes <Col N="215" /> the establishment of procedures which guarantee that the applicant will have the normal protection of the rules of natural justice including the right to a hearing, the right to be able to put the particular case&mdash;certainly in written if not in oral form&mdash;the right to know the grounds on which it is being considered, the grounds on which it may be refused or on which it may be partially granted. None of these rules operate at the moment. Any request for an oral hearing is ignored.  It may be occasionally that an official of the Department will visit a particular applicant and investigate his circumstances, but that is in no way&mdash;in any sense I understand as a lawyer&mdash;the exercise of a statutory right of appeal.</P>
    <P>I would like to contrast the position of people who try to secure their rights in the area of supplementary welfare with another area where we created a legal entitlement but built a much better kind of structure for enforcement, and that is those who seek entitlement to equal pay. Contrast the position of somebody who tries to appeal from the refusal of her legal entitlement to supplementary welfare and somebody who does not get her entitlement to equal pay.  In the case of equal pay, there is a possibility of referring the complaint to the equality officer, who then actively investigates the matter and issues a recommendation. It may go further&mdash;either to the Labour Court or to the High Court itself. However in the case of the refusal of an application for supplementary welfare there is no structure at all.  There is no set procedure at all, and if the Minister believes otherwise then I think he is out of touch with what is happening on the ground&mdash;I really mean that.  What is happening on the ground is that we are back to the old discretionary home assistance. It is probably worse now than it was because there was the illusion that we were moving away from that.  I believe that the position is worse in Dublin than it is in some other parts of the country and it is certainly very bad indeed in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The problem is that it affects the most deprived sections of the community, so that the need is an acute and immediate one, whether it is help with rent, whether <Col N="216" /> it is help in buying clothing for children, whether it is a need of old people to have blankets for the winter, whatever the specific needs of the application for supplementary welfare may be, or whether it is simply an application for the minimum income under the Supplementary Welfare Act.  The worst problem is the delay incurred through this totally informal and non-legal approach to the exercise of a right of appeal.  Months often go by, and the person hears nothing.  It is only if the person has a lawyer or a social worker to write a letter on their behalf, or persuades a body like the Coolock Law Centre to take up the matter on their behalf, that they may make some progress on it, but usually only after weeks and perhaps months have gone by.</P>
    <P>Again this reinforces the basic point I am making that the Minister must be prepared to issue regulations providing a proper procedure for making the appeal. It would be necessary to have a simple form because the people who want to appeal are not very good at setting out in a letter what they consider to be the grounds on which they would like to make the appeal and there should be a basic form for that.  There should be rules establishing when they will get a hearing&mdash;it can be a very informal hearing but they should be entitled to that&mdash;and rules establishing when they will get a decision.  It is unacceptable that there would be any undue delay so that we should be talking in terms of a decision within a week or at the most a fortnight in relation to most of these applications.</P>
    <P>I was interested during a recent discussion with some social workers to learn that the Department officials had referred on a number of occasions when representations have been made on this issue to the fact that there are only a very small number of appeals.  If so, this is a further illustration of how bad the appeals system is.  There are so many people who do not even know they have a right of appeal; who do not know what their rights are in the matter and who cannot feel encouraged to pursue their appeals because they have no visible sense of anything happening.  It just gets <Col N="217" /> lost in the bureaucracy and the individual may or may not get some kind of letter ultimately saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; or &ldquo;you can have part of what you asked for&rdquo;.  There is no sense of respecting the attributes of the rules of natural and constitutional justice.  Unfortunately this area is not considered to be lawyers' territory. It is not considered to be an area where barristers and solicitors have a primary concern, or where they are building up an expertise.  Otherwise I believe the present system would be tested in the courts over and over again, because it is one of the most flagrant transgressions of what should be the proper rule of law and operation of the rules of natural justice in circumstances where the particular recipients are very poor and deprived.</P>
    <P>If anybody has any doubt about the depth of need, I would refer them to a file of letters which was sent in response to an initiative by some professional social workers who had advertised in the papers to people who are living on social welfare to write in and explain how they budget for the week, to itemise what they spend their money on.  I have a file of some of these letters here.  I am also aware that the Minister was given the file of letters.  No, of course, it is not &ldquo;scientific&rdquo;&mdash;the only people who could do it scientifically would be the Department under the urging of the Minister&mdash;but it is very harrowing and very pathetic.  By not ensuring that the full legal safeguards exist, and by not leaning over backwards to facilitate applicants and to provide access through the existing procedures we are denying basic rights&mdash;basic legal rights, basic human rights and basic social rights&mdash;to those most in need in our society.  That makes us a very selfish society.  Having raised this matter in the Seanad on the 8 February last, having corresponded with the Minister and having tried in other ways to see whether there would be a response by issuing the necessary regulations, I am glad to have the opportunity of hearing the Minister himself on the matter.  It is probably the greatest flaw or indictment so far of his term as Minister for Social Welfare, so I shall now sit down to give way to him to hear what he has to say.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the fact that the supplementary welfare system has given rise to a number of complaints from time to time since its introduction. One of the principal complaints has been that there is a lack of information to the general public about the provisions of the legislation and what their rights are and what the benefits to which they are entitled are.  We have taken a number of steps to try to correct that particular aspect and bring home to the public in general and those who are more specifically in need of this particular service that the service is there and how it can be availed of.</P>
      <P>Recently when there was a strike in one of the employment exchanges in Dublin and a large number of people were likely to be left in dire circumstances as a result of not being able to procure their benefits because of the strike we were able to bring the supplementary welfare machinery into operation very rapidly and ensure that everybody who was discommoded by the strike was looked after.  That was a fair test of the supplementary welfare allowances machinery and it stood up well to that crisis situation.</P>
      <P>I am aware also of the letters which the Committee of the Association of Social Workers received.  They sent me copies of these and I mentioned at the time that I thought it was not a very scientific way of carrying out research because all they did was put a letter into the papers and invite everybody who had a complaint to write to them.  We all know that if you put a letter into the papers asking for complaints from the general public you will be inundated with them.</P>

      <P>I did mention it to them and they agreed with me that it was not a very good type of research, though they did maintain that it gave some indication of the situation throughout the country generally.  I suppose there is a combination of factors involved in the <Col N="219" /> situation.  First, I want to make the point that every deciding officer is bound and is under an obligation to make an applicant aware of his rightful position.</P>

      <P>It is a valid complaint that it does not happen often and it is something we will have to tighten up on but it is there and that is the situation that should obtain.  I would agree that if it is not happening it has to be made to happen.  I have not made any regulation providing for a formal appeals system at the moment because I have not been persuaded that it is the best method but I think we may be driven to it.  A large number of people working in this area would prefer if the whole system like all the other systens would be one system, one scheme, one service where an informal helpful co-operative attitude could prevail.  I do not know whether some people are too impatient.  After all it is a change over from what Senator Robinson mentioned that was the old home assistance system, the old home assistance outlook.  It may take some time for that outlook and that tradition to disappear, but it would be desirable if we could bring about a situation where this was a service which was administered by a caring, competent, considerate corps of officers with a reasonably smooth informal system of appeals where these are necessary. Many people are indicating to me that in their view that it is certainly not happening at present and is not likely to happen. The most I can say to the Seanad on this occasion is that I am on the verge of taking a decision on it.  There certainly should be no problem of providing a formal appeals' system, no legal or other difficulties in the way, and in fact I could make regulations very quickly if I were finally persuaded that this is the right thing to do&mdash;not so much the right thing because perhaps it would be second best. A formal appeal system would be second best to what would be the ideal system.  If it seems that it is necessary <Col N="220" /> and if there is a sufficient volume of complaints to the existing informal system to justify the introduction of a formal system, then there should be absolutely no problem and no particular legalistic or any other sort of objection on my part to introducing it.  I have had draft regulations prepared and I have asked the chief executive officers of the health boards to have a look at them and have them sent out to the union which represents the community welfare officers.  In general the situation is in a very fluid state at this moment because if I am persuaded that this should be done and it must be done, it can be done very quickly indeed.</P>

      <P>Not everybody agrees on this.  However, there will be no formalistic or legalistic objections if we decide to do it; it can be done quite quickly.  We have practically everything ready to do it.  There is one other time factor involved, and that is that the temporary employment of appeals officers who have been appointed to get the scheme under way will end in December and if we are going to do it that might be the time to bring it in to coincide with the termination of their temporary appointments. All I can say to the Seanad this evening is that there is no particular policy objection, no particular bureaucratic administrative objection, to the introduction of a formal appeals system. It can be done and is more likely to be done than not.  In any event a decision will be taken very soon on it.</P>
