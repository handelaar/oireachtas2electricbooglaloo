      <P>Once again I must draw attention to the fact that the Family Planning Bill, 1978, was given its First Reading on 8 November, more than a month ago, and that the Leader of the House has not chosen to order it and has resisted attempts, which have gone to a vote, to secure time for debate of the very important principles in this Bill. When I tried to raise this matter I was assured that there would be a Government Bill within weeks.  Yet, more than a month after this Bill received an unopposed First Reading, there is no sign of the Government Bill.  This session is drawing to a close and because one is never sure when the Seanad will be recalled after a vacation and we tend to adjourn <i>sine die</i>, I feel I must propose that we take the Family Planning Bill, 1978, today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the importance of the issues involved&mdash;important from the point of view of human rights, social and health issues&mdash;in my view this is one of the most important matters on the <Col N="734" /> agenda and the Labour group are very anxious that there should be a full discussion of it.  Apart from that, there is also a build-up of misrepresentation about what the intentions of this Labour Bill are.  The Leader of the House should ensure that when individual Senators put down a Bill they are not left in the situation of having such misrepresentations.  I propose to correct one of those misrepresentations, that is, that this Bill in any way would legalise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, but what I am trying to do is to emphasise that the Labour group in tabling this Bill have a reasonable and legitimate expectation that time will be given for it, unless there is a Government Bill.  The Fianna Fáil Government, with an unprecedented majority, have been in office for 18 months.  The Taoiseach, shortly after the election, promised that there would be a Bill on this issue within 12 months.  That is another promise which they have failed to deliver.  Unlike the Fianna Fáil Party which have opposed every measure in the past seven or eight years to change this law, the Labour group feel strongly about this matter and feel they cannot wait indefinitely.</P>

      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling in this matter but without going into the merits of this Bill, I think it is important to realise that a Bill to amend the relevant law is a very simple matter; there is nothing particularly complicated or involved.  We had just about every model to change the law in the last few years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not irrelevant in one sense.  The reason I make that point is that the impression is being created that there is something very difficult and complex about the preparation of a Bill and this is being used as an excuse for the undue delay in tabling a Government Bill.  Therefore I propose that Item No. 8, the Family Planning Bill, 1978, be added to the Order of Business so that it can be taken either today if the other business is dealt with, or tomorrow or even on Friday.</P>

      <P>I would like to protest that Item No. 21, a motion which calls on the Government to introduce as a matter of urgency a comprehensive scheme of civil legal aid and advice as outlined in the Pringle Report, has not yet been given time for discussion.  This has been on the Order Paper for many months.  I recall raising the matter twice on the Order of Business before the House went into recess last June.  At that time the Leader of the House indicated that priority would be given to the motion. It is particularly urgent at the moment because the only form of civil legal aid that is available to people in Ireland is through the FLAC centres which are run by law students.  These provide a service to many thousands of people not only in Dublin but throughout Ireland and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate that but I shall be very brief.  Let me try to explain how urgent this is at the moment.  It has been reported in the newspapers over the past few days that the free legal advice centres will close down because they recognise that they are enabling the Government to avoid their responsibilities in this matter.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that but I am merely trying to draw the attention of the House to the urgency of this matter. If the free legal advice centres close down an essential service is going to be denied to thousands of people.  Apart from the fact that there was an election promise from Fianna Fáil in June 1977, in this regard, it is a service which is essential and which people have a basic right to.  That has already been decided in the Mrs. Airey case.  I can only&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I second the motion that Item No. 8 be added to the Order of Business.  We were assured that the Government would bring out a Bill within a few weeks.  A few weeks have passed and it is up to us to take the responsibility of giving this Bill a Second Stage reading.  I would like to support Senator Robinson's proposal.</P>

      <P>It is not proposed to sit next week because the House has been asked specially to conclude business this week because of the defects which have appeared in the wall at the end of the Seanad Chamber.  The Office of Public Works want as long a period as possible to investigate this during the vacation.  It is proposed to sit tomorrow, and Friday if necessary, to conclude business this week.</P>
      <P>Motion No. 21 has been on the Order Paper for some time and Fine Gael were next in line for a motion but they allowed the Wood Quay motion to take priority and consequently it has not been reached up to now, but it is next on the list and will probably be taken very early in the new year.</P>
      <P>On item No. 8, I find it difficult to understand Senator Robinson's suggestion that the House is in any way responsible for any misrepresentation which may be made about the Bill.  The House agreed to have it printed and ensured that so far as it could do so, there would be no misrepresentation of the Bill.  If people misunderstood or misrepresented it, it must be because the Bill is in some way ambiguous. Certainly it is not the fault of the House because the Bill is there for everyone to read.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of taking the Family Planning Bill, I did not agree to taking it on previous occasions because I said there was a Government Bill on its way and it would be absurd to have two Bills on family planning before the Oireachtas at the same time.  The Government Bill is on its way and Members will be able to browse over it during the Christmas and it will be debated early in the new year.  Therefore I cannot agree to have the Bill on the Order Paper taken now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure is intended, broadly speaking, to facilitate our export business both in goods and services, to facilitate borrowing from external institutions for major industrial and other projects, and to make legal provision for a number of matters arising in the course of banking business.</P>
      <P>To achieve these objectives the Bill proposes first, to allow banks licensed under the Central Bank Act, 1971 to engage in bonding and guarantee business required by Irish enterprises in relation to their exports or the provision of services outside the State.  Secondly, to allow the licensed banks to engage in certain types of bonding and guarantee business, in order to facilitate the needs of the construction industry both home and export.  Thirdly, to enable the licensed banks to guarantee loans for customers wishing to borrow for projects in Ireland from international financial institutions and to issue all forms of pure financial guarantee wherever the need for such guarantees arise.  Fourthly, to enable foreign, non-licensed, banks to issue bonds or guarantees where such bonds or guarantees are required by licensed banks to enable them to make financial facilities available to clients in Ireland.  Fifthly, to permit the licensed banks to engage in bonding and guarantee business in respect of a number of other matters related or incidental to banking business such as loss of bank notes, documents, bills of lading, and so on.  Sixthly, to provide for an increase in the aggregate amount of the Minister's liability under the export credit scheme from £30 million to £100 million to enable the Minister to meet the growing demand for service under this scheme arising from the increase in the volume and value of exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some years now Irish exporting industries, both goods and services, have been hampered by the fact that some importers abroad, particularly Middle <Col N="739" /> Eastern countries, insisted, for their own good reasons, that bonds whether pure financial or guarantee bonds would only be accepted when issued by a licensed bank.  Existing insurance law precluded this and it was not part of bonding business in which the Irish insurance industry had any real interest.  The wider availability of bonds for exports will no doubt make it easier for Irish products and services to compete on foreign markets and this legislation is the answer to one very real difficulty being experienced by those engaged in the very important work of export promotion.</P>
    <P>Over a considerable period the construction industry has made representations about difficulties being experienced by it in having its bonding requirements met by the insurance market in respect of contracts arising abroad.  This situation has seriously affected the ability of our construction firms to compete in foreign markets and the problem is being accentuated by the tendency of many foreign clients to require that bonds be issued by banks rather than by insurers. In the course of considering this problem and in the light of further representations from the construction industry it emerged that difficulties are also being experienced by construction firms seeking bonding arrangements to cover contracts at home.  I propose under this Bill to empower the licensed banks to engage in this business in future, both home and abroad, and to do what are commonly described as development bonds also.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage in the Dáil I accepted an amendment from the Opposition which would extend the definition of the construction contract to include the development of land for agricultural, mining or quarrying purposes or the exploration or exploitation of the seabed. These are areas closely related to construction work and which it is felt should have full availability of pure financial and performance bonds.</P>
    <P>Provision was also made in the Bill &mdash;in clause (c) of subsection (1) (a) (ii) of section 2&mdash;to ensure that Irish banks will not face legal obstacles in guaranteeing loans to customers wishing to borrow, for projects in Ireland, from international <Col N="740" /> financial institutions or from EEC sources such as the European Investment Bank.  These bodies represent an important source of capital for industry or major projects.  The law as it stands was regarded by the banks as not making clear their power to give guarantees of the kind referred to, and the provision now proposed is intended to put beyond doubt the power of the banks to give such guarantees.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the Bill the licensed banks made representations that provision should be made to enable them to issue all forms of pure guarantee regardless of where the need for such arise.  The Bill now before this House incorporates this amendment.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also allow the licensed banks to engage in bonding and guarantee business in some further areas closely related to banking business such as in relation to lost bank notes, missing documents, bills of lading, and so on.</P>
    <P>Another important area dealt with in the Bill relates to the issue by foreign banks of bonds or guarantees securing financial facilities made available by a licensed bank.  The provision at subsection 2(1) (b) is seen as of assistance to the need of the operations in Ireland of foreign companies.  Such Irish operations often depend on the guaranteed backing of their parent companies' banks when the Irish based enterprise is getting finance from the Irish banks.  In the Bill, the ability at law of such foreign banks to engage in guarantee business is limited to cases where bonds or guarantees are required by the licensed banks as a condition of granting financial facilities, and the provision is no wider than this.</P>
    <P>None of the provisions of the Bill will affect the ability of insurers to continue to engage in the business of giving bonds&mdash;by enabling the banks to issue the bonds specified in the Bill I am reflecting what is widespread practice in other countries.  As a technical operation, it will also be necessary by Statutory Instrument to amend the European Communities (Non-Life Insurance) Regulations, 1976, to take account of the Bill's provisions and to free the banks from the requirements of those <Col N="741" /> regulations in so far as they engage in the type of business provided for by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 3 is to provide for an increase in the aggregate amount of the liability which may be assured by the Minister under the Insurance Acts, 1953, 1969, and 1971 for export guarantees covering the insurance of risks in connection with the external trade.  This increase from the existing limit of £30 million to £100 million is made necessary by the growth in the value and volume of exports being insured under the present export credit insurance scheme.  It is envisaged that the proposed limit of £100 million should be sufficient to cater for the growth in demand for export credit insurance over the next three to four years.</P>
    <P>Export credit insurance enables exporters to insure against loss the risks entailed in selling goods abroad on credit terms.  These risks fall into two main classes: commercial risks arising from default or insolvency of the buyer, and political risks, arising from the outbreak of war or revolution in the buyer's country or from Government action in the buyer's country which would prevent the goods being delivered or paid for. Examples of such action would be the introduction of new import controls or restrictions on payment transfers.  It will be appreciated that the aggregate potential liability of the Minister under this scheme could only fall to be met if the multiplicity of risks covered by all policies issued should materialise.  The possibility of this happening is extremely remote indeed.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this Bill will, I feel sure, be warmly welcomed by the construction industry, manufacturers and exporters and indeed all of us who are aware of the importance of these industries to the nation's overall well being.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is welcome and very much overdue.  It supplies a need which has been felt not for many months but for many years.  It repairs the deficiency in the ability of Irish banks to cope with the needs of their customers, an inability from which <Col N="742" /> their customers and everyone else in the community suffered.  It is a matter for congratulation that the Bill which has reached this House is very different from the Bill as introduced.  If Senators wished to see the full extent of the difference, they have only to read what the Minister said when introducing the Second Stage of the Bill in the other House and the speech which he made here today.  If the Bill had been left in its original form it would be nothing like so good.  It is not merely a matter of credit to the Minister that the Bill is now different because he accepted one Opposition amendment, which I think was and is seen to be an improvement, but he has also accepted as worthwhile the representations which were made to him and to which he referred in his Second Reading speech in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The House ought to look, if only for a moment, at the situation which is unfolded by this long delayed satisfaction of this long known need.  I do not know, and it is not necessary for us to ask, why the restriction which is in the Insurance Act, 1936, was ever there.  I believe insurance companies are satisfied that this extension to the normal powers of Irish licensed banks is not an intervention with the normal business of insurance companies.  But this deficiency in Irish banks did not turn up when Irish construction companies set about seeking contracts abroad.  It did not turn up when exporting became as widespread as it has become in the last 15 years.  It has been known for at least 30 years and longer, and a make-shift arrangement existed to cope with the defect between insurance companies and banks.</P>
      <P>We should ask ourselves why these Houses of Parliament were so slow in repairing this omission and why Irish banking had not engaged in the pure financial guarantee business which is the normal part of banking anywhere. Why has that been so?  Why has it taken so long to effect such a necessary improvement?  I do not know why the improvement has now come about, but one suspects it is because a strong lobby&mdash;not the lobby of the banks but another lobby&mdash;sought the repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to sound captious in <Col N="743" /> relation to this, because I have commended the Minister and his advisers for the manner in which they have accepted the representations which were made since the Bill was introduced.  I am not, therefore, talking about the Minister, I am not talking about even the Department, I am talking about our structure of Government.  Why has it taken so long to correct something so wrong as this was?  It has certainly been there to my knowledge for very many years.  I do not know whether the Minister or Senators can throw any light on that, but it is worth mentioning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome and support this very necessary Bill.  It has been a very severe impediment to Irish firms working abroad or attempting to maintain contracts abroad, particularly in the fast developing Middle Eastern and Asian areas, where it is the practice to have bonds of a nature which it is not usual to have here or in western Europe, the United States or generally.  It is very necessary that we should have this provision if we are to be able to compete effectively in these important markets in which our construction export firms and other industries have a good opportunity of entering.  In certain instances they were effectively and totally excluded by the absence of these arrangements which were by regulation demanded by Government-sponsored and private industries in many of those countries.  I hope the actual cost of these bonds will be kept within limits which are consistent with financial probity and the requirements of the firms and banks involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that under section 2 service industries are mentioned.  Do I understand that the bonds would be available for a service industry such as the dairy industry where it is established that the Government of the country concerned required the appropriate guarantees or if an engineering or management services of some form or other were being provided?  Would the bonds be available?  I believe they would under this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister could confirm <Col N="744" /> if they would cover all circumstances rather than those very narrowly associated with export or construction. There again there is an opportunity for industry here to develop.  It would be a pity to impede it through any lack of the necessary bonding arrangements.  I was delighted to see that the guarantee has been raised to £100 million.  It sounds a vast sum when the existing limit is extended from £30 million to £100 million and, perhaps, under the heading of export guarantee insurance risks it is sufficient. I should like to know if the Minister will have to come back to the House again should it be necessary to increase the limit at any stage.  There are certain types of bonds which are enormously expensive, particularly in relation to our off-shore exploration work. Certain bonds and promises were made appropriately in case of any undue happening in the course of exploration.  The amounts of money concerned in such bonds are vast.  I wonder if they would be covered under the Bill if there was an Irish company or group involved.  Apart from this I must congratulate the Minister.  I do not agree at all with the criticism of the delay.  I am glad to see that the Minister has, at a relatively early stage in this Government, taken it upon himself to bring in this very practical measure, one which has support right across the House as it is basically for the benefit of all our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill wholeheartedly for the reasons admirably expressed by Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  I should like to refer to the need for speeding up the vetting of credit sanctioning, particularly in the area of the export of fast consuming Irish products.  I have been critical of the liaison between our embassies and commercial enterprise in the past involved in the references but I should like to admit that the intelligence work on credit worthiness abroad has greatly improved. I should like to pay tribute to our foreign service in this respect.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank <Col N="745" /> Senators for the warm welcome they have given to this measure.  As far as the comments made by Senator FitzGerald concerning the improvement on the original Bill introduced are concerned I should like to state that this improvement took place after the discussions with the banks.  The necessary amendments would have been put in if the banks had made the suggestions earlier in the original discussions we had.  In relation to the comment about the long delay, I am sure the Senator, from his own experience will agree that short Bills take most time to draft.  The need has become more evident for this piece of legislation as our export efforts have developed over the years, in particular our newly developed construction industry. Senator Conroy referred to dairying and engineering which are covered under section 2 which deals with the provision of any service outside the State for the export of anything.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Conroy's comments on the increase from £30 million to £100 million, obviously we are all pleased with the efforts that have been made by our exporters to continue to sell our products in even greater quantities around the world.  Our economic and social targets can be reached only if our export drive continues and is expanded. At present our exports account for roughly 50 per cent of our total production, and to survive and meet our targets we must export.  That is why the Government are committed to giving every encouragement possible to export effort.  Senator Conroy asked if I would be coming back to the House with an increase above the £100 million, and I should like to state that this increase up to £100 million will cover efforts in the next three to four years.  I would like to return in the morning and increase it further if we could get to that level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senator Lambert for the warm welcome he gave the Bill.  I should tell him that I will have the question of speeding up the vetting of applications for insurance examined to see what can be done within the Department.  I am grateful to him for his comment about the situation with regard to knowledge <Col N="746" /> and examination of potential buyers.  As a nation we are relatively new in the export field.  Our bank of knowledge is not as great as that of other competing countries but it is improving.  I know that will continue to improve in the years ahead.  We are making every effort to obtain as much information as we can.  It is done through normal commercial channels and we are trying to reduce the delay to a minimum.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Senators for the warm welcome that they have given the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill arises as a result of recent difficulties experienced in the grocery trade.  Senators will be aware that a boycott was placed earlier this year on the products of a certain company by a group representing wholesale and retail interests.  Among the issues at the time was the question of retail sales of grocery goods below cost.</P>
      <P>The boycott was a matter of some concern to me, as it was, indeed, to all parties in the trade.  Accordingly, I asked the Examiner of Restrictive Practices, who has a monitoring function in this area, to intervene.  Under his chairmanship it was agreed that boycott activity would cease, at least until the end of November this year, on the understanding that suppliers would, at the same time, withhold supplies from retailers who sold below cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It became clear during discussions that the issue ran deeper than the question of below-cost selling and, since the agreement was only temporary in nature <Col N="747" /> and had implications for existing legislation in this area, the Restrictive Practices Commission became involved in further discussions with all interested parties. The commission, mindful of the fact that the underlying issue related to the whole question of the terms and conditions of supply and also that the independent negotiations on this question would require some time before an agreement could be concluded, first succeeded in arranging a further moratorium on boycott activity, to the end of March, 1979, and then turned their attention to the type of amending legislation required.</P>
    <P>A situation in which manufacturers were, on the one hand, threatened by a boycott from one group of customers and, on the other, were having to give to another group the sort of terms that enabled them to indulge in below-cost selling, would, if it were to persist, most assuredly not be in the economic interests of the country.  In the short-term perhaps it might serve to make certain products available at lower prices for some consumers&mdash;but this would be on a very limited scale.  In the long-term it would almost certainly lead to the loss of jobs in manufacturing industry and the substitution of imported goods for the products of the firms which would have had to close.  And concurrent with such adverse developments, that minority of consumers who had earlier benefited from below-cost selling would be likely to find themselves paying higher prices for their groceries.</P>
    <P>Before proceeding further, I wish to refer briefly to the existing legal position. The first Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, made in 1956, provided, <i>inter alia</i>, that suppliers could withhold supplies of goods from a retailer if the latter resold at or below wholesale price and refused to give an undertaking that he would desist from doing so.  The amending order made in 1973, however, repealed this provision in so far as it applied to grocery foodstuffs. One of the main considerations behind this amendment was the connection which was then seen to exist between advertising of below-cost sales and the <Col N="748" /> practice of below-cost selling itself. Without widespread advertising, most of the impact of below-cost sales tended to be lost.  The advertising of such sales had, moreover, other undesirable features notably that it served to give to the buying public a misleading impression of the entire range of prices being charged in the outlet or outlets concerned.</P>
    <P>In reality, of course, the bulk of prices must reflect a margin which will both cover retailing cost and yield a profit, and advertising of this nature creates overall an unfavourable impression of the prices being charged in independent and small retail outlets, resulting in serious losses in sales.  This automatically tends to facilitate the domination of the trade by multiple organisations.  It was, therefore, considered that the prohibition of a practice which was seen to have a number of undesirable features would also have the effect of eliminating the actual practice of selling below purchase price.  In their report to me, the commission recommended that the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Orders should be amended to reapply, in relation to all grocery goods, the provision in the 1956 order enabling suppliers to withhold supplies from persons who engage in below cost selling.  The commission also recommended that the prohibition on the advertising for sale of goods below cost should be restated so as to apply this prohibition to the advertising of all grocery goods.</P>
    <P>I have accepted the commission's recommendations and an order giving them effect has been made and published.  This explains the appearance of this Bill before the House today.</P>
    <P>In addition to this measure, I can assure the House that the various other provisions of the existing groceries orders will be actively enforced.  I am confident, however, that the various parties in the trade will comply with the relevant regulations and that the situation will be defused to an extent which will create a climate conducive to the early conclusion of negotiations on terms and conditions of supply.  It is my earnest wish that these negotiations will be brought to a successful conclusion as <Col N="749" /> early as possible and I trust that the House, in confirming this order, will share in these sentiments.</P>

      <P>This is a very short Bill and order and I will be brief in my contribution. This legislation passed through the Dáil last night with what I can describe fairly as indecent haste but it was an indication of the serious situation that had developed in relation to the threatened boycott.  It seems to me that legislation like this is not desirable generally but when one reaches a stage where certain wholesalers and retailers can become so big that they can bully their way through a market, obviously something has to be done.  I welcome the order but I regret that it is necessary but, obviously, it is in view of the developments over the past several months.  I wonder, however, whether the Bill and the order actually go far enough.  I appreciate that if somebody who proposes selling greatly below cost is unable to advertise except on his own premises that the impact of his sales will be, to a large extent, lost.  However, at the same time, some of these very big operators, because they attract so many thousands of people week by week into their stores, will be able to attract people to this below-cost selling.</P>
      <P>I know this is an extremely difficult area into which one might bring controls through legislation.  I do not know what terms the Minister was referring to when she said that some of these bigger groups, obviously the groups that were engaging in the malpractice, were able to obtain the sort of terms that enabled them to indulge in below-cost selling.  I presume she is referring to terms other than the actual price of goods.  I do not know what she is getting at but if they are buying at the same price as the other wholesalers and are selling literally at a loss to enable them to attract customers into their store I wonder whether one could introduce legislation to prohibit the suppliers actually supplying such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, the major difficulty with this is one of monitoring.  The Director of Consumer Affairs I gather will be appointed very shortly.  I might say in passing <Col N="750" /> that I am disappointed at the delay.  I recall when the Consumer Information Act was passed here almost 12 months ago that the Minister gave an undertaking that she would proceed as quickly as possible and I do not think a period of almost one year is reasonable in the circumstances. However, the Director of Consumer Affairs when appointed would be in a position to monitor difficulties like this and, where necessary, either through his own agency, through some other agency or through the Department, introduce orders prohibiting suppliers from supplying goods to people who sell at below cost.  It causes great problems.  It reminds me of a story that was told about a shopkeeper in Nenagh some years ago when we were dealing in old money.  He started a very big supermarket which was going well. In order to attract a good Christmas trade he advertised bottles of Irish whiskey at, say, £2.10.0 and they were actually costing at the time five shillings more for him to buy.  He was causing great consternation because a lot of people were attracted to his store.  About three days later a small shop about two doors down put up an advertisement to the effect that they were selling the whiskey at 2s. 6d. less than the big supermarket was selling it for.  The supermarket owner became very concerned about this and made what inquiries he could but could not discover where this man was buying the whiskey. He went to the grocer and said: &ldquo;For heaven's sake, I lose 5/- on every bottle of whiskey I sell because I can only buy it at 5/- more than I am selling it; how can you do it?  &ldquo;The small shopkeeper said: &ldquo;I am buying it from you and it is only costing me 2/6 a bottle when I sell it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That shows that when one gets into this area of cut-price and dirty price wars it is a rat race, a vicious circle that one cannot stop.  I regret that this order is necessary, it obviously is.  I support it fully as all Members of the House will but I should like to ask the Minister whether she is satisfied that nothing further could be done in relation to control. As the order stands a supplier will still be able to supply somebody who is selling beneath cost, and I wonder if <Col N="751" /> something more direct could be done to try to alleviate this.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the Bill.  In any measure like this we are concerned with the benefits to the public generally and the immediate benefits to the consumer.  I do not think that the sort of practice which is being dealt with here is of any real benefit to the public or to the immediate consumer. It is just a form of &ldquo;come on&rdquo; which may receive a good deal of publicity but in the short term it is devised primarily so that the consumer can be attracted in and, perhaps, spend more in the short term.  In the long term it has, of course, the various defects which the Minister and Senator Molony have mentioned in that it is likely, as with all these things, that after a temporary fall there is a compensatory rise.  On a very trifling scale or within a local area this might not matter very much but when it becomes a question of large-scale organisations doing this kind of thing not to the benefit of the consumer but, effectively, tending to stifle competition from smaller shops and also running the risk of interfering considerably with the actual production of goods of this nature by the smaller suppliers it is a different matter.  We have to be very careful that we do not run into a situation here where effectively what is happening is that goods are being dumped at a temporary apparent benefit to the consumer and, of course, a long-term loss and disability to us all.  A number of these practices should be looked at, and I am glad to see that this particular one is being stamped on by the Minister.</P>

      <P>This Bill is one which the Labour Members of the Seanad also welcome because it deals with a specific problem which has arisen and was giving rise to both boycotting of supplies and misrepresentation to the individual consumer and a very difficult position for the small trader.  However, the problem with such a Bill is that its scope is very narrow and limited.  It is brought in as an urgent measure to curtail a particular practice which had been going on <Col N="752" /> in this area, but it is not meeting the major problem which is the primary concern of the Labour Party, the increasing rise in food prices generally and in prices in the grocery trade.</P>
      <P>For a very significant number of people it is not a question of even being able to shop around and look for bargains.  It is that there are no bargains left.  Many items on the grocery bill are beyond the reach of so many families.  This is a very urgent matter indeed and it is one which affects most of the families at the lowest end of the scale, those on the poverty line, those totally dependent on social welfare, the unemployed.  The need is for a sense that this urgency is appreciated in the Department and that the Minister is going to take the necessary initiative and steps to provide a fair deal for the consumer, particularly for the poor consumer here.  If we reflect on the overall position we will see that we are a country where the producers' lobbies are much more effective and better organised than the consumer.  We do not have a strong consumer consciousness and we do not have the voice of the oppressed poor consumer well represented.</P>
      <P>In this Bill the Minister is rightly concerned about the kinds of misleading advertising of low prices which dupe the individual consumer, and render the position of the small trader very hard and uncompetitive and could put them out of business or make their business very difficult to maintain.  The actual terms of the Bill are acceptable, but there is an urgent necessity for an overall examination of food prices generally and, specifically, the prices of grocery products and fresh fruit products which are the products of our own soil.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the scope of this measure is very limited.  It is because of the urgency of the need to redress a constantly worsening situation that, in welcoming the narrow scope of the Bill, I feel that what is required of the <Col N="753" /> Minister is a greater sense of urgency and purpose in her Department.  I agree with Senator Molony that there seems to be a strange lassitude or delay in appointing a director of consumer affairs. There seems to be a lack of appreciation of the hardship and misery of a housewife on a very low income trying to buy groceries for a family.  That is where our priorities should be and where there is a need for more than this immediate short-term and rather technical measure.  The situation is one where there is a need for a much wider appreciation of how bad things have got, how ill-protected the consumer is in Ireland and how much tension is being caused even in the family situation by the inability, particularly of the housewife, to cope on the budget and how many families are now doing without basic foodstuffs.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the three Senators who spoke for their support on the Bill and their understanding of the need for it at this time.  I regret, just as Senator Molony does, that this type of legislation has to be brought before either House of the Oireachtas, but as we know from the background which I mentioned in my speech it is necessary.  The situation will have to be kept under constant review, and if any further remedial action is necessary to ensure that the consumer gets a fair deal then that remedial action will be taken. When I spoke about terms negotiated by certain retailers&mdash;when I speak of retailers I am referring to multiples&mdash;which allow them to sell below cost, I was speaking of terms, including discounts.  All members will appreciate that there are loss leaders and that the big multiples can make up by having greater margins on other products or goods in their stores.  Those of us who <Col N="754" /> live down the country and who represent consumers from constituencies, such as Senator Molony's in Tipperary and my own area in the west, realise that very often the prices which are quoted in the national newspapers by outlets in Dublin are not the same prices which are charged in the same multiple outlets in our constituencies.  This would appear to be contrary to the Consumer Information Act, 1978 and it is a question which I brought up last night in the Dáil and which I said was a matter for the immediate investigation by the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
      <P>I am just as frustrated as anyone else that the director has not been appointed but it has been outside my control for a considerable length of time; it is with the Civil Service Commission and it is not my duty or function to criticise the functions or delays which may occur in the Civil Service Commission machinery. However, I feel, as Senator Molony has pointed out, that the director will be appointed very early in 1979.</P>
      <P>I dealt with the points which were raised by Senators and I would like again to thank them for their welcome for the Bill and for their appreciation of the need for it at this time.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>A major undertaking of the Government's pre-election manifesto was that from January 1978 rates would be abolished on domestic property, the domestic part of mixed property, secondary schools, <i>bona fide</i> community halls and on farm <Col N="755" /> buildings which were not previously exempted from rates.  The Bill is designed to give statutory effect to this undertaking. Its other purposes are to validate the partial relief of domestic rates which obtained in 1977, and to provide for a number of consequential and miscellaneous amendments of the law relating to rating and local government.</P>
      <P>Several investigations and studies of the rating system have been undertaken in recent years.  It is fair to say that these have been prompted more than anything else by a dissatisfaction with the way in which rates bore on householders.  No fundamental solution to the problem emerged, however, until our proposal to give total relief of domestic rates.  For example, despite the last Government's action in phasing health and housing charges from the rates between 1973 and 1977, the average rate in the £ still rose in this period from £6.70 to £9.00. Our initiative has been bolder and more clearcut.  It removes once and for all the burden of rates from over 850,000 householders and other ratepayers benefiting from the new reliefs.</P>
      <P>A rather complex Bill has been required to give legislative expression to the derating proposals of the manifesto. However, the structure of the new rating reliefs is simple enough.  Under section 3 of the Bill rating authorities will, each year, make an allowance to the rated occupiers of the newly relieved properties. Section 4 provides in the same way for the more limited relief of 25 per cent of domestic rates which was given in 1977. From 1978 onwards the allowance under section 3 will be equal to the full amount of the rates which would otherwise be payable on the valuation or part of the valuation of the properties concerned.  The allowance thus has the effect of removing the burden of rates in whole or in part, as may be appropriate. Grants corresponding to the total of the allowances made will be paid each year by the Minister for the Environment to rating authorities under section 9 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main advantage of this approach is that it allows the Exchequer to take over simply and directly the liability for <Col N="756" /> rates on all property qualifying for the new reliefs.  The Exchequer, in other words, is stepping straight into the shoes of former domestic and other relieved ratepayers.  The full cost of domestic derating is being met fairly and squarely by the State and no part of the burden is being allowed to fall directly or indirectly on local authorities or other ratepayers.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines the categories of property which will qualify for the new reliefs and section 2 prescribes the amount of the rateable valuation of these properties which will attract relief.  In case of a refusal by a rating authority to make an allowance in respect of a property, the rated occupier may, under section 7(1), apply to the District Court to have the allowance made.  In effect, then, the District Court&mdash;and the higher courts if further appeals are taken&mdash;will have the role of dealing with appeals about the way in which local authorities apply the new reliefs.</P>
    <P>A domestic hereditament is defined in section 1 as any premises which is used as a dwelling and which is not a mixed hereditament.  The definition extends to yard, garden and the normal domestic outhouses.  Where these carry a valuation separate from the dwelling itself they will still be regarded as domestic, provided the valuation does not exceed £1 in the case of land, or £2 in the case of buildings.</P>
    <P>Use of a dwelling to provide lodgings which are not registered under the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939 to 1975 will not of itself disqualify a premises from domestic status.  This means that houses listed, as distinct from registered, with Bord Fáilte will not thereby lose their entitlement to domestic rates relief.</P>
    <P>Registered guesthouses under the Tourist Traffic Acts are in a different category from ordinary dwellings and, as such, they cannot qualify for relief as ordinary dwellings under the Bill. Where, however, a registered guesthouse contains accommodation specially and permanently set aside as ordinary domestic quarters, it will be entitled to relief as a mixed hereditament in respect of this portion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> Domestic property will be relieved of rates on the whole of its effective buildings valuation and on any adjoining land valuation which does not exceed £1.</P>
    <P>A mixed hereditament means a premises which is used partly as a dwelling to a significant extent and partly for another or other purposes to a significant extent.  The point of the latter qualification is that, if the domestic use of a premises is insignificant, it will be regarded as wholly non-domestic, while if the non-domestic use is insignificant it may be regarded as wholly domestic.</P>
    <P>Unless an application is made to the Commissioner of Valuation under section 7(2), the rateable valuation of the domestic portion of a mixed hereditament will be taken to be one third of the total valuation of the property or £18, whichever is less.  I would like to emphasise, however, that where this formula is felt to bear unfairly, the rated occupier concerned may apply, through the rating authority, to the Commissioner of Valuation&mdash;with appeal from the latter's decision to the circuit court&mdash;to have the domestic and non-domestic elements in his valuation specially apportioned.  The rating authority themselves are also empowered to take this initiative.</P>
    <P>Secondary school is defined as a school not already exempted from rates which is recognised as a secondary school by the Minister for Education. Relief of rates will extend to all of the buildings forming part of the school complex.  Relief will also apply, subject to a limit of £40 valuation on the amount relieved, to land belonging to and used in conjunction with the school.</P>
    <P>The Government's undertaking to abolish rates on <i>bona fide</i> community halls responds to a long-standing aspiration of voluntary groups involved in community work.  Community hall is defined in the Bill as a hall or similar building which is not mainly used for profit or gain but for purposes which both involve participation by inhabitants of a locality generally and are recreational or otherwise of a social nature.  Use of a hall for sports purposes will not of itself make a premises a community <Col N="758" /> hall.  On the other hand, a hall is not disqualified from being a community hall simply because it is normally used by persons of a particular age group or a particular religious denomination.</P>
    <P>Registration of a premises under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904 so as to enable permanent bar facilities to be provided for club members will, however, rule out the recognition of that premises as a community hall.  Community halls will be relieved on the whole of their buildings valuation.</P>
    <P>Relief of rates is also being granted on those farm buildings which, because they were erected before 1 March 1959, do not already enjoy exemption from rates.  Farmers with older non-domestic buildings had to pay full rates on those buildings up to now.  On the other hand, farmers with modern buildings erected since March 1959 were totally exempt.  I am happy to bring this anomaly to an end.</P>
    <P>The definition of domestic hereditament extends to all property used for residential purposes, whether owner-occupied or rented.  The Bill contains a number of provisions designed to ensure that the benefit of domestic rates relief is passed on to the tenants of rented accommodation. The position of rented small dwellings within the meaning of the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928 is dealt with in sections 6 and 18.  These comprise all local authority dwellings and all privately rented dwellings with a valuation of not more than £8 in Dublin and, in general, of not more than £6 elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In relation to these small dwellings, liability for rates fell on the owner, or landlord, rather than on the occupier, or tenant.  Heretofore the landlord could recover the rates paid by a series of additions to the rent spread through the year. Section 18 of the Bill has the effect of removing the authority from 1978 onwards for the rates-linked supplements to rents which were previously levied by landlords of small dwellings. Section 6 makes corresponding provision in relation to the 1977 rate.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill deals with rented accommodation apart from small dwellings. <Col N="759" /> Although the section is long and complex its object is simple.  For a tenant who was not previously directly liable for rates, the section gives the right to an allowance from the landlord equal to the rates element which was in his rent before removal of domestic rates.</P>
    <P>Difficulty may arise in calculating the amount of this allowance where a unit of letting is not separately valued.  There is provision, therefore, for either landlord or tenant to apply to the rating authority for apportionment of the valuation.  An appeal may be taken to the Commissioner of Valuation under section 7 against an apportionment made by the rating authority.  If the proper allowance is not made by a landlord, the tenant is entitled, under section 5, to recover the amount as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The rate reliefs provided for in the Bill have the effect of increasing the proportion of the current income of local authorities which is being met by the Exchequer. In 1976, State grants met 40 per cent of local authority current income; for 1978 the figure will be about 61 per cent.  In 1976, the State paid £1 out of every £4 which would otherwise fall to be raised by local authorities in rates.  In the current year, the State will be paying nearly £2 out of every £3.  The cost to the Exchequer of the reliefs under the Bill is estimated at about £80 million for 1978.</P>
    <P>A financial liability of this size has important implications for the Exchequer, since it has to be fitted in with the needs of other programmes, including the capital requirements of local authorities and the needs of other services financed by the Exchequer, many of which are vital to the creation and maintenance of employment.  There is a need also to take reasonable measures to protect the interests of non-domestic ratepayers, including farmers, small shopkeepers and people with businesses of one kind or another who remain liable for rates.</P>
    <P>Section 10, accordingly, enables the Minister for the Environment, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to issue directions to local authorities <Col N="760" /> limiting the amounts to be provided in their estimates of expenses, and, in the case of rating authorities, in their rates in the £.  If an authority seek to include an amount in their estimate of expenses or in the rate in the £ which is greater than any limit notified, the estimate or the rate stands to be reduced to the maximum amount allowed by the limit.</P>
    <P>Section 11 requires that any decision by a local authority authorising expenditure over and above that provided in their estimate of expenses should have the sanction of the Minister for the Environment. Sanction may be given either generally or in particular cases under this section.</P>
    <P>As a matter of policy, I propose to see to it that, with the responsible cooperation of all concerned, little if any interference will be caused by these new arrangements to the free ordering of priorities by local authorities.  Rating authorities have been able to operate as freely as before within the limit on rate poundages which I notified for the current year.  Last week, in authorising a 10 per cent increase in rate poundages for 1979, I made the particular point to local authorities that it would be entirely for them to decide the priorities which should apply to the services catered for in their 1979 estimates of expenses.</P>
    <P>Among the remaining minor provisions of the Bill, I will draw attention only to section 13 which is designed to simplify the procedure for the making of the rate.  For some time now, at least two meetings of a rating authority have been required: an estimates meeting, frequently extending over a number of meetings, at which the estimate of expenses is adopted and the consequent rate in the £ &ldquo;struck&rdquo; or determined, and a later &ldquo;rates&rdquo; meeting at which the rate as struck is assessed on individual valuations.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see why the law should require elected members to be involved in endorsing the rate on individual valuations. Once councillors have struck the rate and the Commissioner of Valuation has fixed revised valuations, applotment of the rate is automatic and admits of no scope for variation.  The function is properly administrative and section 13 <Col N="761" /> simply recognises it as such.  I must emphasise, however, that the functions of adopting an estimate and striking a rate in the £ remain absolutely untouched by the present section.  These continue to be powers exercisable only by elected members.</P>
    <P>The present Bill contains no provisions affecting the future valuation of new and improved domestic property. The Tánaiste and Minister for Finance has, however, already adverted to the possibility, in the wake of domestic rates abolition, of a global rather than individual valuation of domestic property being carried out for each rating area in future.  It is intended to introduce appropriate legislative proposals in the new year.</P>
    <P>In the knowledge that it fulfils our stated manifesto undertakings for relief of rates, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Bill because it gives complete rates relief on domestic houses and in other areas as well.  The Bill deals entirely with domestic properties, the domestic portion of mixed properties, secondary schools, community halls and farm buildings not already exempt.  We all realise that for years rates were an unfair means of collecting revenue.  They were unfair for many reasons.  There will still be a certain amount of unfairness so far as shopkeepers are concerned.  Under the old system we often made the comparison between a farmer farming 40 acres, living alone in a house valued at £40, and a farmer married and having seven or eight children and with the same valuation and the same amount of land.  It could not be justified that the two of them should pay the same amount of money into the Exchequer.</P>

    <P>Now we will have a small shopkeeper with a valuation of £20 operating in one end of the town and a larger shopkeeper with a valuation of £30 operating in the centre of the town.  The small shopkeeper may be married and have a number of of children, and the large shopkeeper may be a single man.  The same arguments will be made by the shopkeepers.  This will have to be looked <Col N="762" /> at.  It could be unfair.  It is easy for us to talk about the Exchequer giving an increase to the local authorities last year of 11 per cent over the previous year's figure and hoping they would continue to provide services.  They have failed to provide the services.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a local authority for approximately 40 years and I was chairman for the past ten or 12 years and I know the cost of wages went up by 15 per cent and the price of materials went up by 12½ per cent.  How could an increase of 11 per cent provide the same services?  We had to meet a back-payment on wages and we handed out £57,000.  We had to take that money out of the allocation of 11 per cent plus the other amounts we had collected ourselves.  In every county the by-roads are impassable because of potholes. That situation will worsen next year because we have reduced the 11 per cent by 1 per cent.  Some of the potholes on the less major but not actually minor roads make it dangerous to drive a car.  I was travelling through County Cavan a fortnight ago and I drove my car into a pothole.  I burst a tyre and tube, and bent a wheel, and I was driving at 50 miles an hour only.  Maybe this is due to the go-slow by the engineers, but these potholes have been there for some time.</P>
    <P>The house building programme of every local authority will be reduced substantially.  To meet the Government's demands, most local authorities have increased their staff.  In some counties they have employed one or two extra engineers and other staff in the engineering section.  This means there will be more people there to spend less money.  I cannot say what the ultimate effect will be.  The Minister said recently that 16 local authorities did not spend the 11 per cent.  I am sure that is possible.  I am quite prepared to accept the Minister's word.  Those people had a substantial income from increased valuations, and so on, to keep them floating, but in my county the increase in valuations last year was only £6.  That is general to the west.  That increase will not be sufficient to keep the services going.  The income in these counties from the letting of local authority houses is much smaller than <Col N="763" /> that in other counties.  We have a number of people over 65 years of age and the density of population must also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Section 4 refers to domestic and mixed hereditaments.  In a mixed dwelling where people have living accommodation and a shop or an office they get a reduction of one quarter of the total rate, or 25 per cent.  Section 7 provides that, if they are not satisfied with this, they have the right to appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation, or to the courts, to have the property apportioned.  Why not let the local authority and the person concerned apportion the property?  If a property measures 2,000 square feet, and the private part where the people are living takes up 1,000 square feet and the shop or the office takes up another 1,000 square feet, why not divide the rate on that as 50 per cent each way?  If one area comprises 1,500 square feet and the other area 500 square feet why not apportion it as 75 per cent and 25 per cent of the total cost of the rate?</P>
    <P>It is suggested that people can go to court.  People are slow to go to court.  If they go to the Commissioner of Valuation's office and do not succeed, they have a notion that they are holding the court in hell and the devil is presiding.  It is very hard to convince people in rural Ireland or anywhere else to go to court. Under the Bill landlords must pass on whatever rates relief they get to their tenants.  I want to ask the Minister did that happen last year, or does he believe for one minute it will happen next year? In my opinion it did not and will not. There is no point in telling these people they can take a court case against their landlords.  They are afraid to take a court case against their landlords because the landlords will find some means to get them out of the house.  People outside are quite prepared to pay the rent they were paying, if not a bit more. These people will have to be protected by the Department or by the local authority.  If they are not, they are being thrown to the wind and there is no protection for them.  The Minister should take a serious look at this.</P>
    <P>The main point in the Bill is the loss of <Col N="764" /> power by local authorities.  Since I became a member of a local authority, power has seemed to dwindle away.  The day has gone when members of a local authority had any say in the wages paid. We have no say in the fixing of rents. Rents are fixed here and sent down to us.  We have no say in the sale of houses. That is fixed here and sent down to the local authorities.  No matter what they want to do, there is a guideline available in the Department of the Environment for the local authorities, and they must operate within that guideline.  If they do not, they will be in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>Under section 10, if the local authority do not strike a rate the county manager has the power to do so.  This means the day of the power of the local authority is gone.  Managers are trying to collect revenue.  We had the experience of this recently.  Managers have suggested to local authorities who have not got a water rate that they should think of striking a water rate, that if they require more revenue this is one of the ways they can get it.  Other managers have made the suggestion to the local authorities that they should make a charge on planning permission applications. If the money has to be found, the Minister is entitled to tell the local authorities where it is to be found, and how it is to be found.  We all know it will be necessary to get much more money to maintain our house building programmes and our water and sewerage schemes.  Loans on water and sewerage schemes have increased substantially over the past few years, and will continue to increase, and we will find that increases across the board with regard to loans for housing and so on.</P>
    <P>I thought of putting down some amendments to the Bill but I know it would be said they would create a charge on the State and they would be ruled out of order.  Certainly we will have to give some thought to putting down one or two amendments.  Again I welcome the Bill for the relief of rates on private houses it provides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact of political life and political debate that politicians, depending on which side of the House <Col N="765" /> they are on, tend to highlight or cloud aspects of legislation for political reasons.  For those of us in the practice of politics this is understandable.  Far too often it leaves the public in a confused state.  They are dependent on the media and on political correspondents to put the matter into its proper perspective.  It is not surprising, therefore, that the main purpose of this legislation has been sidetracked and all sorts of red herrings introduced to cloud the real issue which is why the Government and the Minister brought the Bill before the House in the first instance.  However, to the extent that Second Stage provides the freedom for a wide-ranging debate, the views expressed on local government in general will be welcomed by both the Minister and the House.</P>
      <P>By and large the views expressed by the previous speaker and by speakers in the other House on local government in general are sincerely held.  The Minister recognises this.  He also recognises that there is a very strong attachment in this country to the importance of the role of local authorities in the work of overall national development.  I say this by way of general comment, I will come back to the purpose and the intent of the legislation before us introduced by the Government to enable them to give effect to the proposals they put before the people before the last general election and which were endorsed so overwhelmingly by them.  This legislation was introduced in response to widespread public demand, and it has brought considerable relief to individuals and communities.  It is a basis on which future national development can take place.  Regardless of the views expressed by some speakers, it is generally agreed that rates on domestic dwellings were a very selective and unfair tax, very often leaning most heavily on people who could least afford to pay.  Even the Opposition admitted this, but they were not prepared to come to realistic grips with it.  We can all cite examples of a husband and wife with a large family trying to educate their family.  Their income does not make them liable for income tax and yet they were compelled to pay rates on their dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> Previous legislation recognised the unfairness of rates as tax and a system was introduced whereby rates could be paid by instalments.  Legislation was introduced to enable local authorities not to levy rates on new properties for a period of seven years.  Over a number of years there emerged the feeling, the desire and the wish that something should be done to come to grips with this unfair tax.  This Bill which got a very rough and lengthy passage through the Dáil came to grips with the problem.  It gives substantial relief to 850,000, householders and to oppose it is, in effect, opposing this relief.  Those who oppose it should say whether they want to see this tax restored again, or what the alternative to it is.</P>
    <P>Much has been said and written about the financing of local authorities.  It is essential for the operation of local democracy that each local authority should have the power and the freedom to finance from their own resources the projects considered essential for their own areas.  This tax should be more broadly based than the present very selective tax system known as rates.  I urge the Minister to give consideration to this matter and to find an acceptable alternative source of finance for local authorities.  In saying this, I know I am not giving him an easy task.  This matter has been discussed at great length by various local authorities and, indeed, by the General Council of County Councils. There are various views and various suggestions as to what the alternatives might be.</P>
    <P>One system appeals to me personally. I am not an expert on finance but I would urge the Minister and his Department to give consideration to it.  A percentage return of the value-added tax should be collected in each county.  This tax is broadly based and easily administered. It should not be an impossible task for the Minister and his Department to work out a scheme whereby each local authority would get a percentage return on the value-added tax collected in each county.  This would provide the independent source of finance each local authority need to embark on any worth-while local development <Col N="767" /> programme.  In this legislation the Government and the Minister did a very fair and straightforward thing by simply picking up the rates bill and paying direct to the county councils the money they would have collected from the householders.</P>
    <P>In the current year this amounts to £80 million.  Nobody can dispute that this is a sizeable transfer of tax from one small section of the community to the more broadly based tax system.  If everybody was fair, it could generally be agreed by every Member of this House that this is a fair and a just thing to do. The Opposition said the Government should not have put a ceiling on the limit to which the remaining number of ratepayers should be taxed.  I think this was a responsible attitude on the Minister's part.  The 11 per cent increase last year and the 10 per cent the Minister announced over the past couple of days is a fair compromise in trying to strike a reasonable balance between the demands of the various local authorities and what the remaining rate-paying public can generally afford to pay.  It is unreasonable to suggest that the Government, having made such a sizeable financial commitment, should not have a say, at least to some extent, in monitoring the situation at national level.  To those who say the Bill restricts the freedom of local authorities to implement their own development programmes I would say to some extent this is true.  I agree with that point of view.  As I have already said, the future financing of local authorities cannot and will not be resolved by the reintroduction of rates and, by implication, this is what some speakers are suggesting.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill whereby community halls can be derated.  I have a particular interest in community development and I am associated with a number of community development organisations.  I know from my contacts with them down through the years how extremely difficult it was for many of them to meet the annual rates bill.  By picking up the rates bill in this instance the Government are not only providing financial relief for those <Col N="768" /> organisations but also providing an incentive and an encouragement to them to continue with their work.  This Bill also makes provision for the complete removal of rates on farm buildings.  This is widely welcomed by the agricultural community.  In many cases they represented serious financial hardship for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill also removes rates from boarding schools and those of us who have had contact with the managers of these schools and the principals of these schools realise only too well the serious hardship that the annual rates bill presented for each one of these institutions. The Government and the Minister are responding to a long-felt need in this area and I am grateful to them for taking this step.</P>
    <P>On the financing of local government, I urge the Minister to speed up, as far as possible, the introduction of the White Paper on local government reorganisation. I hope it will be possible to have such a White Paper before the local government elections next June when many aspiring young politicians will be entering the arena.  It would be nice to think they would have a clear knowledge of what is intended in the future as far as local government reorganisation is concerned. I know I am probably giving the Minister an impossible task in asking him to prepare a White Paper before the June elections.  It is important that we should have a White Paper in the very near future because, as our economic position changes, the structures of our democratic institutions change also to keep pace with our programme of national development.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the local government elections next year, we will have the European elections.  It is a fact of life that the more regionalised we become and the more remote the decision makers become from the ordinary people, the greater is the need to strengthen and build up and encourage local democracy.  One of the very encouraging things about our country at present is that a strong community spirit still exists and this is far less evident in other European countries.  We must ensure as far as possible that future legislation on the reorganisation <Col N="769" /> of local government will not only retain this community spirit but also encourage greater participation by all of our people in the work of local government and local community development.  There is a remarkable blend between the democratically elected local councillors and the officials who administer local government.  As a member of a local authority I never fail to admire the great desire in the part of local authority members and officials at local government level, to unite and be united in their efforts to promote as far as they possibly can, the development of their own county.</P>
    <P>I want to make one passing reference which perhaps is not directly relevant to the Bill.  We are embarking on the election of new local authorities and we are conscious of the demands public life makes on individual members of local authorities.  Because we know from experience the cost of being in public life at present&mdash;the cost of providing services to deal fully with the demand which the public are entitled to make, the cost of telephones, the high cost of postage&mdash;I do not think it is unreasonable to expect the Minister and his Department to make some provision in future for these people who so generously give their time to promote and further the work of local government.  They should not be expected to be out of pocket.  I am not asking the Minister to pay members of local authorities, but one of the great things about local democracy and local government is the voluntary work members put into it.  One has to be realistic.  One has to recognise the financial demands which are placed on these members.  I do not think it is unreasonable to ask the Minister and the Government to recognise that fact by compensating them.</P>
    <P>I hope that future local government reorganisation will strengthen county councils.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;county&rdquo; because I believe there is a commitment and an involvement by members in the county structure.  Whatever legislation is introduced, whatever study is done in relation to local government, the county should be retained as the administrative structure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> One final comment.  I am a member of the General Council of County Councils, as are other Members of this House, and in my opinion we have not fully developed the role of the council in the overall work of local authorities.  I hope that in future the General Council of County Councils can be developed to the extent that it will be the policy formulating body for local government administration. I would ask the Minister to give consideration to this point when preparing his White Paper and in the future reorganisation of local government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the aspects of the Bill that make statutory the relief of rates on domestic dwellings.  This is a development that had been under consideration over a number of years, because it was recognised that this form of taxation was unjust.  The relief of domestic rates commenced with the National Coalition Government when they decided to take the health costs entirely and exclusively off local authority rates, a cost which at that time represented practically 50 per cent of the total rates demand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the other aspects of the Bill go, it is regrettable that the functions and reponsibilities of local authority elected representatives are being pushed further back.  In 1941, under the County Management Act, the powers of local authorities to make appointments, to determine the number of appointments, to determine the wages and salaries applicable, were all wiped out and transferred to the county manager and his staff.  The only remaining real responsible function of the elected representatives, whether they were in a corporation, county council, urban council or were town commissioners, rested with the striking of a rate, for what they considered to be the needs of the community they represented and the capacity of that community to meet the bill they would prescribe in relation to the needs.  There are no better <Col N="771" /> qualified people than those who are elected in a particular area to determine the level of services required by the community.</P>
      <P>When this Bill becomes law, already it is effective through a ministerial regulation, local authorities will be restricted to a particular figure in the extension of their financing to cover the services they provide and this will be a regrettable step.  All of us in public life know that the community are clamouring continually for a growing, wider and better service; whether it is in the field of housing, roads, water and sewerage, refuse collection or provincial library services.  The taking of major decisions in future in regard to the level of financing to go into all or any of these areas will be removed from the local elected representatives as will be the right to determine the level of services than can or will be provided by the local authorities.  This was a very valuable right.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the elected representatives down the years it must be said that since the first Local Government Act of 1898, these people gave their services on a voluntary basis.  This has been very much to the credit and responsibility of those people.  In their wisdom and judgment they made up their own minds, in consultation with their officials, what level of service their community wanted and what was their ability to pay.  That very seldom led to any major conflict.</P>
      <P>At this point we are facing a continuing increasing demand in regard to roads, because of increased traffic, and also in regard to housing because of increased costs.  Many more families will be asking for local authority houses because the cost of sites and the cost of house building have increased beyond the ability of practically any wage or salary earner.  Because of the growing magnitude in these fields local authorities will have considerably greater responsibility and involvement. But if they do not have a major say in the financing of these areas their involvement will not have the effect it could and should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> There is another important aspect I should like to touch on.  Section 11 prohibits local authorities from making excess expenditure.  Every member of a local authority is conscious of the many times throughout the year after striking the rate when it was necessary for them, on grounds of urgency or otherwise, to seek extra expenditure for an immediate and deserving project.  Under this legislation the manager and the elected representatives are hamstrung until such time as, first, an application is made to the Minister and the Department and, second, sanction is given.  In my opinion this was often of an urgent nature, either to finish a job or because of flooding or some consequences of that nature.  I would ask the Minister to keep this in mind because local authorities never sought excess expenditure unless there were good and justified reasons for it in servicing their local community.</P>
    <P>I agree with a previous speaker who asked the Minister to examine the position of the small family shopkeeper in relation to domestic rates relief.  The one-third relief in this case is generally small because we all know that the small family shopkeeper in today's world is fighting many odds.  He has to contend with the supermarket and VAT returns, all of which are a strain on his resources. As his competitor has a private residence removed from his business on which he has total rates remission, the Minister should give serious consideration to the plight of the small family shopkeepers who are scattered throughout the towns and villages of rural Ireland and realise that there is a case to be made for greater relief than that given in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Another section of the community the Minister should look at again, and they are very small in number, are those in registered guesthouses where they form the normal family home which is used during the tourist season&mdash;June, July, August and September&mdash;as an adjunct to tourism and to which they are making a tremendous contribution.  Where this is exclusively a tourist and family development, the Minister should consider giving the same rates relief as is given to those on the supplementary farm guesthouse list.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> We certainly welcome the Bill in relation to its relief of domestic rates and I hope during its passage here that all its aspects will be thoroughly and sincerely thrashed out in the interests of giving this country the best possible structure in local government administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I said here and elsewhere a number of times that I recognise rates to be a burden that rests unevenly on different sections of the community.  People living in the same street with each house having the same poor law valuation found that because their circumstances varied so greatly the rates burden rested very heavily and unjustly on some of them. That was recognised on all sides of the House.  Some time ago a Minister for Local Government introduced a waiver of rates scheme.  This was a welcome relief to some sections of the community and was greatly appreciated.  The second step was the removal of the cost of housing and health from the rates by the National Coalition Government.  That was another step forward and this is the third step which can fairly be described as the most decisive.  It removes the burden of rates from the domestic house and therefore is very welcome.  I join in the welcome extended to it by other speakers.</P>
      <P>There is one sentence in the Minister's speech that I do not think is accurate. He said:</P>
      <P>The full cost of domestic derating is being met fairly and squarely by the State and no part of the burden is being allowed to fall directly or indirectly on local authorities or other ratepayers.</P>
      <P>I take it that the £80 million not being collected from rates will have to be collected by some other means and that, ultimately, a share of it will fall indirectly on ratepayers.  That does not take from my welcome for the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every time this Bill is discussed the same question comes up about the rates relief not being passed on to tenants.  It has been said in reply that there is a certain difficulty in having that done.  It is well to admit that this rates relief is not <Col N="774" /> being passed to tenants.  When it is said that tenants have no means of righting this injustice it must be remembered that housing is in such short supply and in such keen demand in many of our towns and cities that people are very glad to get a flat or rooms, as the case may be, and are not likely to antagonise the landlord by immediately looking for their rights with regard to a share in rates relief.  This matter will demand a lot of attention as time goes on because there is not much justification for saying that that difficulty does not exist.</P>
    <P>With regard to the 10 per cent limit of expenditure by the county councils this year, it is fair to say that the man who pays the fiddler is entitled to call the tune.  That has always been accepted. But when we take into account the increases in wages and materials, it is doubtful if this 10 per cent will be adequate. There are counties where the restriction of 11 per cent imposed last year is already beginning to show results.  Senator Reynolds said that many of our second class roads, by-roads, are in a very bad state of repair.</P>
    <P>It is true that the fault for some of that at least can be attributed to the go-slow by the engineers, but at the same time it is in part due to the limitation imposed on the councils.  That is bound to hit some counties more severly than others, for example, in counties where by their very nature, the surface is so boggy that roads are very hard to maintain.  There are parts of County Cavan and Leitrim, for example, where it costs much more to maintain a road than it does in Meath or Louth.  That is a problem.  Other counties because of their contours have a very high road mileage.  Because of the number of lakes and hills in County Cavan we have an unduly high road mileage for the area.  There are complaints in parts of Cavan about the neglected state of the by-roads.  I want to be quite fair; this did not happen in only the last 12 months or in the last few years; the situation has been getting progressively worse over a number of years.  Areas which face such situations might demand special consideration when it becomes obvious that the allocation of 11 per cent, or 10 per cent, or <Col N="775" /> whatever it might be, is not sufficient to maintain existing services and at the same time achieve a reasonable growth. The figure of 10, 12 or 11 per cent that might be applicable to the whole country should in certain cases be extended.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of work to be done where roads are so narrow that they are not able to cater for school buses, big creamery tankers or lorries with big supplies of fertilisers.  There are people living off laneways who cannot have fertilisers delivered because the roads are too narrow. One-third of the population in County Cavan live in this type of laneway and a good deal of work has been done to bring them up to a reasonable standard.  People now applying to have their laneways brought up to a reasonable standard are on a waiting list of four to five years.  I believe a special case can be made for areas where such a situation prevails.  I am glad to note that the Minister mentions in his speech that matters which are considered to be of great priority by a council would have some hope of getting special consideration.  I hope that in time to come that that will be borne out.</P>
    <P>As has been said by other speakers, down through the years members of local authorities have given good service and have given freely of their time and energy to schemes for the benefit and improvement of conditions in their own counties.  It would be regrettable if the schemes a local authority had in mind, schemes that could be supported by professional engineering and executive staff were not embarked on because of the fixed limit of 10 per cent or 11 per cent imposed by the Custom House.  It would also be a bad thing if the idea got abroad that local authorities were so restricted in their activities by the Minister for Finance or the Minister for the Environment, that they were no better than rubber stamps.  If that were a fact the country would suffer a great loss.  People of ability would be no longer interested in local government and no longer anxious to make a contribution to the development of their local authority area.  If that were to happen, it would lead to more centralisation and less <Col N="776" /> decentralisation and everyone would like to see more decentralisation in the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>When we take into account the increases in wages and materials I am doubtful if the 10 per cent limit for the next year will allow the councils to proceed as they would like in extending water and sewerage schemes.  Many towns and villages are in need of extended or new water and sewerage schemes.  If the 10 per cent limit curtails that development, that will be a pity. Such a course could hinder the development of a county, especially in areas which have a tourist potential.  Lately, the programme of removing very dangerous corners has been slowing down in certain parts of the county.</P>
    <P>In general, I welcome the Bill.  It is good to see rates abolished from domestic dwellings, secondary schools and community centres.  I hope that the question of completely tying the hands of the council to a sum of money decided by somebody in an office in Dublin will not develop to such a degree that members of local authorities would come to the conclusion that they have no further power.  I hope also that we will be inevitably heading for the day of greater decentralisation.</P>

      <P>Cuirim céad míle fáilte roimh an mBille seo.  Bhímid ag feitheamh lena leithéid de Bhille le fada an lá.  It is with great pleasure I express my deep satisfaction at the presentation of this Bill.  Its purposes are clearly stated in the Minister's speech.  He said the Bill was designed to give statutory effect to the undertaking given in the Government's pre-election manifesto, that as from 1 January 1978, if and when the Government were returned to office, rates would be abolished on domestic property, the domestic part of mixed property, secondary schools, <i>bona fide</i> community halls and farm buildings which were not previously exempted from rates.  That gave me very great satisfaction because for many years I have been pointing out that a basic human right is the right to have shelter over one's head and over the heads of one's family.  Even the animals <Col N="777" /> and birds can make provision for shelter such as they need.  In the early days of mankind people were able to get satisfactory shelter in caves and elsewhere, but as civilisation advanced it became more difficult and more costly to provide shelter for oneself and one's family.  I always believed it is a basic human right to have such shelter without having to pay rates for that right and at last this has come about.</P>
      <P>I wish to make one or two more points.  Rates relief is a great relief to secondary schools as many of them have had very difficult times trying to make ends meet.  This relief has been a God-send to them.  There was a wave of emotion throughout the country when community halls were included because no one knows exactly how much voluntary labour went into the building of these halls which are used mostly for the education, development, leisure and entertainment of our young people. Throughout the length and breadth of the State kind people gave their time, money and material to the building of these halls and have done an amount of good for our young people growing up.  I know of many instances where local people were at their wits end trying to make ends meet to keep the hall in good repair, and on top of that they were faced with enormous bills for rates. Some of them were almost driven to distraction by anxiety.  Never was a measure more welcome than this one for community halls.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I should like to ask the Minister when he is replying to state what is the thinking as regards a domestic dwelling where one of the family practises in a small way such things as crafts, such as knitting or crochet work in a part of the dwelling with the object of selling it to supplement the family income or where a member of the family, possibly the father who may be unemployed but has skills such as haircutting gets customers to supplement the family income.  What is the thinking as regards the assessment for rates on such a dwelling?  I welcome the Bill, and the Government deserve the highest commendation for arranging the abolition of rates under the various headings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. There is no doubt that with so many thousands of people involved in the abolition of rates it would only be reasonable to assume that a lot of people are delighted that they do not have to pay rates.  However, that is not the whole story, and it is only reasonable to ask&mdash;never was it so urgent to ask this question&mdash;where will the money come from that was paid by ratepayers formerly.  We are witnessing a revolution here as far as local authorities are concerned. I have reason to believe, from the announcement of the 10 per cent increase in expenditure by the Minister in the last seven days that county councils and, indeed all local authorities, will have as much power over the spending of money as our local ICA branch in Mountbellew have.</P>
      <P>I have come to the conclusion that there is a good reason why the Minister would want to have the final say as far as expenditure by local authorities is concerned.  Rates from private housing is gone and there is a big loss of revenue. Car tax has gone with a big loss of revenue and a host of other things.  It is well known that in County Galway in order to maintain services at last year's level we should be getting 17.9 per cent additional income but now we have to do with 10 per cent.  Not alone can we not maintain our services to a reasonable standard&mdash;not very reasonable in some cases&mdash;but, in fact, they will be less than reasonable.  I put the blame fairly and squarely on the Government and, particularly, on the manifesto that bought votes at the last general election.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the contribution local authorities have made to the progress of the nation over the years has been significant.  The only way they can have any real planning in any area of development is when they have money to spend.  The simple fact is that they will not have that money to spend this year because the Government have not got it. What is thought about us on international money markets was well spelled out for us at the EMS negotiations last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told that 850,000 houseowners have been de-rated, but <Col N="779" /> what about the thousands of flatdwellers in cities who are likely to be flatdwellers for a long time?  What does this particular Bill do for them?  Where we have a wealthy family, as opposed to those living in a two or three-roomed house both have rates abolished, but is that a fair and equitable law?  I had to smile when I hear Senator Cranitch talk about the necessity to have shelter over the heads of our people as a basic human right.  We have now arrived at the situation where because of the price of houses it will soon be a human right to get halfway near a new house.  A lot of the problems relating to this are caused by the monetary code of discipline presently being carried out by the Government.  If we decide to cut off from the Exchequer the type of money we are talking about, it has to be found somewhere else.  Great play was made of the derating of farm buildings.  There is a rumour currently circulating in this House, and in all other areas of agricultural activity, that would suggest that as this derating has happened we are about to see a new rating exercise as far as the valuation of farms is concerned in the next budget.  If we were debating this matter in 12 months time there would be another colour on it. No matter how one juggles the figures around, if it is decided with one stroke of the pen to do away with a certain amount of expenditure in order to keep the servicing of the nation going, it has to be got somewhere else.</P>
    <P>There are only approximately 3 million people here and this has to be divided between them somehow.  Basically, the scheme is a good one but it is not accompanied by a document that will outline to us where the money is likely to be found.  There are a lot of small businessmen here who cannot be too happy about the derating arrangement as it applies to them.  There is no doubt that down the years people with small businesses in provincial and rural towns always had a grouse about rates.  It did not matter what particular Government was in power, but the Government with all the answers have decided to ignore them also.  They are no better off.  It is very important that persons who are trying <Col N="780" /> to supplement their income by means of another type of house-based job such as crafts, as Senator Cranitch mentioned, or indeed a hairdressing outfit are considered.  In small rural towns there are a number of them.  I have had occasion during constituency work to come across a number of them who were turned down as far as rating is concerned and had to pay the full rates on their new dwellings.</P>
    <P>It is also significant to note that because there is such an immense amount of money missing from the Exchequer because of derating, local authorities will have a tremendous task in the next 12 months to try to maintain the necessary services.  Nobody will deny that the condition of our roads has not improved in the last few years.  There is a huge job to be done.  As Senator O'Brien mentioned, a lot of side roads and bad bends need to be improved.  Those rural towns without sewerage schemes can forget about them because the money is not there.  The 10 per cent additional funds to be granted by the Minister for the next financial year will certainly mean for all those community-minded people the end of the story for this year. A great number of people are happy with this scheme but whether they remain happy or not is another matter.  We have two short months to wait until the crocodile tears start flowing again.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill as a great step forward as regards groups of people such as newly married people starting to bring up a family and with a house on a mortgage. It has been an enormous benefit to such people and this is widely recognised.  It will benefit another group of people that we do not hear so much about, older people, particularly widows, who find themselves in a situation in which the mortgage on their house was paid but found themselves in very reduced circumstances. Such people found themselves having to cut down on expenditure of virtually every type, even on basic necessities such as food.  There was one thing on which they could not effectively cut down unless they were to sell or leave the family home in which they <Col N="781" /> had lived all their lives, the rates.  This was a very severe burden to these people. It was an enormous financial demand which they had to meet and which very often took a very high percentage of their income.  There was no way they could effect any reduction.  If for no other reason the Bill was well worth while for this humanitarian point of view.  On those and many other grounds I would like to welcome the Bill wholeheartedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, this is a very important and significant Bill.  It has been interesting, listening to the debate, to hear the number of Senators not just on this side of the House, who are beginning to realise the deeper implications of what appears to be a very popular move, promised by Fianna Fáil when fighting the last general election and seeking the support of the electorate. It is the kind of thing that in a sense nobody can be against.  It is hard to be against the abolition of rates and, certainly, the Labour Party are deeply aware of the hardship and unfairness of the burden of rates down the years. Senator Conroy has referred to the problems of young couples with a mortgage trying to discharge the severe financial burdens and they find themselves in being further crippled by a rates burden.  He has referred to old people who had the burden of rates.  This cannot be disputed and, indeed, the Coalition Government were in the process of removing stage by stage the rates' burden on citizens but Fianna Fáil decided to do it globally and overnight. They decided that it would be part of their manifesto, part of their overall promise to the electorate that rates would be removed in that way.  We need to think very seriously about the implications of that promise which is being fulfilled in the measure before us to day. There are several different kinds of implications we have to look at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to look at this as an overall taxation measure because rates are a form of local taxation and what Fianna Fáil promised to do, and what they are doing in this measure, was to remove that kind of local taxation from private dwellings and from other related buildings such as secondary schools and <Col N="782" /> community halls.  There is no dispute at all about that.  It is, obviously, a measure that must be welcomed wholeheartedly but let us look at the position of removing local tax from private dwellings across the board.  To begin with it is the kind of promise the people can calculate. The better off they are the more they have to calculate.  For those living in Ailesbury Road or Orwell Road, or the better-off suburban areas, the calculation is one that has to bring immediate concrete pleasure to the electorate.  They can actually work out how much better off they will be.  I believe that that was the intention, the motivation behind making this a platform for Fianna Fáil in fighting the election and it was very hard indeed to resist.  It was a measure that was obviously welcome to anybody suffering a burden of taxation.</P>
    <P>We must also think about the other kinds of implications because we cannot look at this measure alone.  We have to set it side by side with the other promises and other measures.  Not only did this promise more to the better off, it is part of a package of promises which promised more to the better off.  It is part of a package of promises which lifted the burden on those in our community who are best able to pay, best able to afford to contribute to the common fund which is the source from which we draw to provide essential services, essential infrastructure, essential relief to the less well off.  It is essential to provide the kind of quality of life, to use that term, which, as a community, we want to see for all our citizens.</P>
    <P>The better off got the best advantage from this global and immediate removal of rates.  There was no attempt to structure it in such a way as to ensure the kinds of values that Senator Conroy mentioned.  There was no attempt to ensure that it would be those least able to bear the burden who would achieve the relief.  If it were an isolated measure I do not think it could be viewed in the same critical way which the Labour Party view it.  As Senator Moynihan, my colleague in the Labour group said, we are not in any way against the removal of the hardship of the burden of rates particularly of those on whom it oppressed <Col N="783" /> most severely.  However, we believe that this measure must be seen in the context of the overall steps and promises made by Fianna Fáil when buying office. Another measure which is totally in tune with the removal of rates across the board favouring those who are paying the most rates for their large houses and private dwellings is the removal of the wealth tax.  It is also in tune with another measure that we will be considering tomorrow in relation to the capital gains tax.  We will be indexing the effect of capital gains tax although nobody is saying we should index social welfare benefits or the benefits at the lower end of the scale.  We will be considering the proposal of the Government to index at the level of the higher incomes and those who are liable for capital gains tax.  It is in tune with the removal of car tax and with the whole approach to taxation policy which does not spread the burden of taxation fairly, does not tax the self-employed in the same way as the burden is oppressing on those under the PAYE system.  It does not tax the larger farmers who are now benefiting most from the common agricultural policy and from the spin-off of the better prices for their agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about a measure in isolation; we are talking about an orchestrated Tory approach to the taxation system.  It is worth looking at what Fianna Fáil have done since they came into office, and it is classic Tory Conservative Party policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Cathaoirleach for his protection in the matter.  My first serious query about this approach to the question of rates, who will bear the burden, and how it will be distributed, is that this measure which favours the better off is not progressive in its approach.  It is not trying in a country with limited resources to ensure that the burden is borne or removed on equitable grounds.  It is an immediate offer of a global relief to all private owners of dwellings so that the calculation could be made, and that the electorate would respond by voting for a Government which offered it that.  A number of Senators, and I join with them, have raised the question: how is the shortfall to be met?  How is the gap to be bridged?  Where is the money that used come in differing degrees from the rates on private dwellings to come from?  That is where we come to the second serious underlying problem in this legislation and the approach of the Government to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a serious one.  It signifies the death knell of local government autonomy in a real sense.  We saw this recently in the directive from the Minister for the Environment last week that the estimates for 1979 would remain within 10 per cent, would not increase by more than 10 per cent.  This immediately upset the draft estimates that the city manager in Dublin had prepared based on the kind of increase that featured the year before, namely an 11 per cent increase.  The city manager, as a very experienced local government official, looked into his heart and decided that this was the very minimum that should be tolerated in order to maintain the level of services to the citizens of Dublin.  It is not his function to be expansionist; it is not his function to propose a draft of the estimates which would set new targets for expenditure.  It is rather his function to calculate on the basis of experience what the acceptable <Col N="785" /> minimum level of increase in expenditure should be.  On that basis he was calculating that an 11 per cent increase was the minimum to maintain the level of services of Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>That manager got this abrupt and brutal directive from the Minister, as did every local authority, to keep within a 10 per cent increase.  This Bill will give the Minister full legislative authority, under section 10, to carry out this kind of directive year by year.  In the case of Dublin this means that £400,000 has to be stripped off the draft estimate.  Where is it going to be pared off?  What services will not be maintained?  What will deteriorate?  What will fall out of the priorities at local authority level?  That is what we mean when we talk about local government autonomy.  I have not had the experience of working on a local authority, but looking at the implications of the Bill as a lawyer, as somebody concerned about local government democracy, I believe that the underlying implications of this measure are very far reaching.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that there has been a serious rethink which has been expressed by representatives of local authorities from the Labour and Fine Gael Parties.  It is widely shared by members of local authorities of Fianna Fáil who now see the implication of what is being proposed in this measure. They see the reality of the fact that the most important reserved function of a member of a local authority has now been rendered very much more a rubber stamp duty than the possibility of establishing local priorities, local initiatives, the capacity of local representatives to know and highlight the real needs of that community.</P>
    <P>We are about to confer, through the Bill, a very significant power not to the Minister for the Environment&mdash;that is clear from the structure of the Bill&mdash;but to the Department of Finance.  This is a very centralising measure under which immense power will be wielded anonymously within the Department of Finance.  That Department will have immense power to decide on the ultimate level and standard of services at local level.  Representatives on local <Col N="786" /> authorities can talk forever and with eloquence about local needs but they will not have the capacity to change the directive within which they must operate.  They will only be able to decide within the overall terms of that directive how they will slice the smaller cake the Minister has imposed upon them.  The Minister will decide the size of the cake. The representatives of local authorities will have some say on how to divide up that smaller cake.  That may be a very difficult and harrowing decision for them to make in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>It would be a mistake to talk about this change in the overall power structure, this stripping of local authorities of a very real power in their reserved function in striking the rate and determining the level of increase needed to maintain or improve local services purely from an institutional or legal perspective.  Let us talk about the reality on the ground.  We have heard about the predicted minimum increase for Galway of over 17 per cent but they are bound by the Minister's directive of a global 10 per cent maximum increase in the estimates. What does this mean?  It is extremely serious, because every local authority is faced with pressing human needs.  A number of them have a sharply increasing population in their area.  They have a need for services which are not just a question of maintaining the level of the year before but require the possibility of improving substantially the range of services within their jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>We have the problem of the larger urban areas.  The situation in Dublin has not only inner city areas but also difficult and deprived streets, or a triangle of streets in a very significant number of areas, not just in the inner city.  There is a need for substantial initiative from the local authority.  Initiative in the provision of youth employment, in the employment of full-time youth workers can, to some extent, be taken by the Minister at a central level.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have the response by the community to the representatives of that community, then a substantial part is going to have to come from the overall budget of the corporation and from the collective decision of the <Col N="787" /> members of the city council.  The problem is of extremely serious proportions. It is illustrated by statistics that people would not believe unless they did research on them and realised that this was the situation.  Statistics show, for example, that there are about one-third fewer youth workers in Dublin now than there were in 1972 to 1973.  Dublin has increased in size.  The proportion of young people in Dublin has increased dramatically.  The problems of the north and south inner city, the problems of vandalism that we hear so much about and the problems that a cycle of deprivation and poverty have aggravated, have increased, but the response in the provision of the kind of services, commitments and full-time expertise on the ground, which should be the concern of a city council in particular, have declined very seriously in the past few years.</P>
    <P>When we talk about local authority autonomy what we are really saying is that when important issues like this are raised or come up as part of a general discussion on a particular estimate, motion or problem at a meeting of a local authority, the representatives of the local authorities can talk until the cows come home, but they will have no degree of real discretion to decide that this is something, which for their area is a very important and critical problem, which is part of the jurisdiction of that authority in the sense that it is required&mdash;an improvement of a service, an initiative to be taken or a serious concern backed up by the expenditure of local moneys in order to redress a problem.  They will see that such are the constraints of operating within the binding directive of the Minister, who himself will be under the thumb of the Minister and the Department of Finance, that they have no leeway or possibility of responding to the need which will be eloquently identified, not by representatives of any particular party or exclusively by the local community representatives, but probably right across the board by all the local representatives there.  They may all agree on the degree of the local problem, on the need and on what <Col N="788" /> should be done, but this measure effectively will deprive them of autonomy.</P>
    <P>The implications of this measure, therefore, must be seen as part of an approach to Government administration and as deeply relevant to the kind of society and power structure that we want.  At a time when democracy is very much an instinctive reaction by us as a people and when there is at least lip service to greater participation in decision-making, it seems to me interesting, not to say alarming, that we would allow a degree of centralisation of immense power over the amount that can be spent and effectively, therefore, over the manner of its expenditure on essential services for many of our citizens.  That is why there has been a substantial rethink on the deeper implications of this Bill since it was tabled and it got its First Reading in the Dáil on 14 December 1977.  Indeed, for a Government who made promises with such enthusiasm and who have a 20-seat majority in the other House, one can only remark that this Bill has not made what might be called swift progress through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I welcome that for the reasons which I have given.  The fact that it has not made swift progress has meant that Deputies and Senators have had more time to reflect on its implications and what better time to reflect on the implications of denuding local authorities of their autonomy in their most important reserve functions than in the run up to local elections.  Elections concentrate the minds of politicians.  A number of those seeking nomination and seeking to stand again for the local elections must be crucially aware that, as they go out and sell themselves, promote their party and identify and speak out on the problems of their constituents, their capacity to act upon and redress those problems are being substantially diminished in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This comes back to the unanswered question of where the money will come from and how to ensure that we do not have the kind of cramping directive which confines local authorities within a much narrower rate of increase in their overall expenditure than would be the case under the old system.  I do not <Col N="789" /> believe, if we had the old system where the local authorities exercised their reserve function in the traditional way, we would have a global restriction to 10 per cent on the increase in the estimates of local authorities.  First of all, I do not believe that we would have a global, single restriction across the board. Secondly, I am convinced that it would not be as restrictive or as rigid and significant a cutback in real terms as the confining to a 10 per cent increase on the estimate for 1979 would be.  There are very significant implications there.</P>
    <P>Another important and worrying aspect of this measure is the failure by the Government to take the appropriate initiative to ensure that the benefit of removing rates on private dwellings was guaranteed to transfer to those who should be benefiting from it.  I am specifically talking about flatdwellers and those in rented accommodations who are not getting the benefit of the relief on rates.  I have tried very hard&mdash;with the advantage of legal training&mdash;to follow one of the most complex and unwieldy sections of a Bill that it has ever been my dubious pleasure to examine and analyse, that is, section 5 of this Bill.  Section 5 deals with allowances by certain landlords to certain tenants.  I hope the Minister, in his reply, will furnish me with some kind of guidance into the intricacies of this section. What it clearly does not do, and this is important, is in any way guarantee or ensure that tenants get the benefit of the removal of the rates from their tenancy.  It places a burden of initiative, a burden of making inquiry and a burden of ensuring that the benefit does transfer to people who, in very many circumstances, are not equipped either to know of the benefit they are entitled to, that they are entitled to relief on their weekly rent to the proportion that the rates have been built into that weekly rent.  They do not know who their landlords are in the first place.  Their landlords are not registered in many instances in Dublin.  If the Minister spoke to those living in rented accommodation in Rathmines he would find that in many cases there is a very one-sided situation. On one side there is the kind of landlord who owns a substantial amount of <Col N="790" /> property in the city of Dublin or elsewhere who acts through local agents, is not registered for the purposes of the rented accommodation and who has a large number of tenants in multi-dwelling houses who pay a weekly rent. Such tenants are the kind of people who are not able to read and absorb the intricacies of section 5.  They are not easily able to ascertain their rights or, if they are able to ascertain them, seek a remedy and ensure that the benefit falls where it is intended to fall.</P>
    <P>I am indebted to a survey carried out by the National Flatdwellers Association in March 1978 for concrete evidence of what I have been saying, for the facts on the ground.  This survey examined the situation of 469 tenants in 51 houses in the Rathmines area&mdash;it was carried out by the Rathmines branch of the National Flatdwellers Association&mdash;and came out with very stunning statistics.  They discovered that a significant number of the tenants concerned did not know who their landlords were.  They discovered that the vast majority of landlords were not registered and they could not ascertain any prosecution of landlords for failure to register where this was required.  If I may give some statistics.  On the question of tenants' knowledge of their landlords, 70 per cent knew the landlord's name only; 20 per cent knew the landlord's name and address and in only 4 per cent of the cases was the landlord resident.</P>
    <P>The situation with regard to the passing on of rates relief was that, in the vast majority of cases, this did not occur.  On the question of the landlords and the law, the survey states that only 46 houses were rated correctly as being entirely let in flats.  Fourteen houses in Grove Park, which were entirely let in flats, were registered as private houses with the Rates Department.  It describes some of these.  The survey goes on to ascertain the question of the legality of conversion to flats and the kind of fire and other safety measures which had been taken.</P>
    <P>This and other surveys that have been carried out reveal that in very many cases where there is not a separate designation of the proportion of the rates <Col N="791" /> which the tenant is bearing and where it is built into the rent&mdash;that is the situation I am talking about, where the tenant pays, particularly in the case of a weekly rent, a certain amount&mdash;all too often, the tenant has not got the benefit of any rates relief.  In some instances that I know about from doing advice work in Rathmines, where the tenants sought to avail of the rates relief and, because the landlord is an unknown entity and not someone to whom they have any direct access, or can check by looking at a register, they made representations to the agent collecting rent and were fobbed off by the kind of version that the relief on the rates would have been set off against a rent increase.  So the figures they are paying either remained the same or potentially they even had an increase in the rent.  Due to the scarcity of accommodation in the area and to the lack of protection of tenants, this is a situation which happened over and over again and for which the tenants all too often had no real redress.</P>
    <P>The tenants in private rented accommodation&mdash;I am not talking about local authority accommodation but private rented accommodation&mdash;are particularly vulnerable because of lack of legal protection.  They are particularly vulnerable in relation to this measure because the Minister, in the structure of the Bill, has not ensured that the intended beneficiary, the tenant of the dwelling, would necessarily receive the benefit of the relief from rates which the landlord primarily would receive as the owner of the multi-dwelling building.</P>
    <P>There are many ways that the Minister could approach a problem like this.  For example, the Minister had an opportunity he might well have seized of using the benefit to the landlord of the relief of rates to require and enforce registration by landlords if they wished to receive the benefit of reliefs as far as they were conceded.  They would only receive that benefit if they could show that the benefit to any rented accommodation within the building had been passed on to the particular tenant.  In that way the onus would have been on the stronger party in the circumstances. <Col N="792" /> The onus would have been on the landlord who by the nature of things has more access to legal expertise and to the terms and conditions of the tenancy.  It is a very striking feature of a great deal of rented accommodation in Dublin, particularly in congested areas like Rathmines where private rented accommodation is scarce, expensive and exploited, that tenants do not have any knowledge of an agreement or have a dim memory of having signed something when they moved in several years before.  They have been paying rent and it has been going up.  They are still paying a figure which does not reflect at all the removal of the rates in the past year and the advantage which the landlord enjoyed and benefited from.</P>
    <P>This would appear to be a deficiency in the measure which is not, in any case, attempting to be an equitable measure in seeking out those who are most affected by the burden of rates and trying to ease their burden as part of an overall approach to a fair taxation system.  Not only is it not equitable or progressive in that sense but it has positive defects in that it does not ensure, in the terms of the Bill, that the benefit penetrates and is passed on to the tenant of the dwelling, that he or she gets the immediate benefit of the rates relief.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech introducing the Bill, referred to the fact that the Exchequer would provide the amount which would have been available otherwise from rates on private dwellings and other properties such as secondary schools and community halls.  He said:</P>
    <P>The Exchequer, in other words, is stepping straight into the shoes of former domestic and other relieved ratepayers.  The full cost of domestic derating is being met fairly and squarely by the State and no part of the burden is being allowed to fall directly or indirectly on local authorities or other ratepayers.</P>
    <P>What is basically deceptive about that is, first of all, that the Exchequer is not stepping straight into the shoes.  It is stepping into the shoes all right, but at a lower level.  It is imposing a more rigid overall permitted percentage increase. <Col N="793" /> This Bill gives the Minister the legal authority to issue these directives and obliges local authorities to obey them. The Exchequer is not assuming the full burden in the sense of a realistic assumption of it, that the burden would increase with the increase in the cost of living and the increase in the cost of the provision of services for the expanding population that a local autority may be responsible for.  It is not doing that.  The Minister is being disingenuous, to say the least, in saying that no part of the burden is being allowed to fall directly or indirectly on local authorities or other ratepayers. There is almost an assumption that the Exchequer is some sugar daddy or Santa Claus out there who is stepping in in this benevolent way to fill the gap.</P>
    <P>What is the Exchequer?  The Exchequer is the financing which the Government receives and, because of this measure and the range of other measures that I referred to, the removal of wealth tax, the tinkering with the capital gains tax, the removal of rates from cars, a very substantial proportion of that burden is now being borne in an oppressive way by the PAYE employees.  This is something that needs to be said fairly and squarely.  The Minister is not getting rid of a burden; he is just redistributing that burden.  He is making the better off in our society, who used to pay high rates on their large private dwellings, very substantially better off.  The money has to come from somewhere so it is coming from the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the kind of tax system we have and the type of inequities which have worsened since Fianna Fáil took office.  I say that as an empirical fact, the tax system is much less fair, much less evenly distributed, much more burdensome on those who are unable to engage in sophisticated tax avoidance as are other groups in society and therefore bear an unfair share or have to bear a share that should be distributed more widely and fairly in our society.  That is one way the Exchequer is going to make up the gap and the shortfalls: by the global across-the-board removal of rates on private dwellings. The other one, of course, is by borrowing. <Col N="794" /> We can borrow and borrow, extend our vulnerability as a nation and extend the level of our external borrowing.  I understand the current assessment of our overall external borrowing is that it is 13 per cent of GNP.  I think the real assessment is 14 per cent of GNP, not 13 per cent.  It is a very high level of external borrowing.  It seems to the Labour Party that the Government are seeking a desperate last minute attempt to join the European Monetary System so that they may have further facilities to borrow, preferably with a delay on repayments to carry them through the European and local elections.</P>
    <P>This Bill merits very serious consideration. I hope that we will be facilitated by an opportunity to put down amendments and have a substantial Committee State during which these kinds of points can be discussed at length. I would finish by referring to a particular irony of the two elections that are arranged for June 1979.</P>
    <P>At the level of the European elections there has been, and I am sure will continue to be, criticisms of the lack of real power of the European Parliament and, with certain differences of degree and emphasis and certain embarrassment in some instances of the European partners, there would be a general overall consensus that the powers of the European Parliament should be strengthened and increased.  That is part of what we mean by democracy and what we mean by electing people to a democratic forum.  In contrast, we have the prospect of local elections to local authorities from whom we are denuding a local autonomy and a local power of real significance.  We are putting under a very strict financial &ldquo;corset&rdquo;&mdash;that, I think, is probably the word&mdash;a very tight and rigid control the estimates of local authorities and the striking of a rate by a local authority from which they will then determine local priorities and provide a level and standard of service to the local community.  So let us, in considering this Bill at Committee Stage, be aware of all the ironies and circumstances and be aware that this is not just a popular measure to remove rates.  It has very serious implications for the <Col N="795" /> structure of our society and for our approach to how the burden of financing the kind of services we want to see is borne.  There is a great deal about it which is more the approach of a party which seeks to buy votes than the approach of a responsible assessment of how best to provide the sources of funds for their taxing at a local or general level. As regards the way in which the decisions will be taken to disperse these funds, we are deciding that decisions will be taken by the Department of Finance, which will be consulted in the matter by the Department of the Environment. That is a better formula than the statement that it is the Minister for the Environment who will decide, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>One has to see the actual, realistic balance in the matter and realise that this is a very centralising and significant measure.  It is very important for the kind of services, facilities and local standards for the citizens of this country. There are very many serious defects in the approach and very serious questions about what might otherwise appear to be the kind of popular measure which nobody could really oppose.  Nobody could really be against the removal of rates.  I would submit that the manner of achieving that result, the approach, the timing and the relationship with the other measures of the Government make it a very undesirable and very worrying way of achieving that objective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the Minister.  It is very appropriate that John O'Leary, a man who has such local government background, should be with us this evening.  I am sure that the formation of the relief in this Bill was under his scrutiny with the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome specifically the relief provided for secondary schools.  As Senators are aware, most of these buildings are enormous and carry large valuations.  The fact that they pay rates to local authorities is reflected in student fees.  I am pleased with the relief afforded to community halls.  Generally they are <Col N="796" /> run by associations with little finance available to them.  They are unable to pay the high rates demanded for these halls which provide facilities for meetings and various other functions.</P>
    <P>My assessment of the value of this Bill to the nation is that it has attracted criticism from the Labour and Fine Gael Parties.  A sign that a Bill is working is that it hurts the Opposition.  It appears that this Bill is doing so.  We are fulfilling the promises made to the people in our manifesto.  In my county where we have a rate of £14 in the £ this Bill will be very welcome.  We felt there should be rates equalisation in this nation.  With the Mayo rate being the highest and the Meath rate one of the lowest we would expect opposition from the richer counties because their recoupment values were much greater than ours in the west. We have a big geographical area to cover as regards the provision of services, infrastructure, roads and so on. Our recoupment rate was very low and did not bring in the amount of money required to run our county.  For that reason I welcome this Bill on behalf of the people from my area and most of the western counties where the rates were very high indeed.</P>
    <P>There is some worry also about how this will be financed.  I have no doubt that people on the other side of the House are very worried in this connection because they suffered a political financial-coalition collapse on two occasions. If there is a 10 per cent restriction on expenditure by local authorities that is a good thing.  When a company are expending money there must be control from the top.  When the Department of the Environment are spending £2 out of every £3 surely they must have some right of control over expenditure in each county.  Notwithstanding that control, our whole road programme last year, our capital input into roads, drainage, sewerage, water and housing schemes was carried out.</P>
    <P>I doubt the authenticity of Senator Robinson's submission about Dublin Corporation.  I am chairman of Mayo County Council.  I have been a member of a local authority for 23 years.  I want to say to Senator Robinson that I have <Col N="797" /> never yet heard of a draft estimate in any county or corporation.  I wonder where is she getting her information?  If she has access to draft programming in Dublin Corporation suggesting that the introduction of this 10 per cent will reduce the expenditure of that corporation by something like £800,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe there is a draft programme.  If there is, there should not be one.  Last year we had a figure of 11 per cent.  Any manager will gear his estimate towards the regulations he has to adhere to under local government Acts.  The manager in my county refrained from providing any draft estimate until he knew we would have a 10 per cent ceiling.  The estimate is prepared on the strength of information from the Department.  No draft estimate was made and I doubt very much that one was made by Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>In most counties the services were unaltered.  If anything, we provided more services last year than we did on previous occasions.  There must be protection for the people who are not derated under the Bill.  That is very important. The protection provided by the ceiling of 10 per cent will be welcomed by people in the counties that will not enjoy the benefit of this Bill.  It is necessary to have this protection enshrined in the Bill to protect such people.  I welcome the fact that farm guesthouses are also included and guesthouses not registered with Bord Fáilte.  Because of high rates and the revenue demanded from them by the Revenue Commissioners many farm guesthouses were put out of commission. They provide a worth-while tourist service at very short notice.  They provide all the facilities of modern equipment. They must be protected to enable them to give a service to tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson will have an opportunity in June, as we all will, to make herself available at the local elections.  If she gets a mandate she will be in a position to have a say in the administration of the corporation or the local authority. The only way to learn something about <Col N="798" /> local government is to be in there at the hub of the administration.  If the Senator is not certain of her ground, she might do better to speak on the Pill Bill or some other Bill with which she is more acquainted.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that but I would hope I could comment on the statement made which is certainly not in accordance with what I read in the Bill.  I find it very difficult to understand how this Bill causes so much fear and alarm to those on the other side of the House and at the same time they classify it as a very vote-catching Bill introduced by Fianna Fáil.  It is inconsistent to make both charges.  This is one of the best Bills ever introduced, one of the most popular, and one of the least palatable to the Opposition.  It did a tremendous amount of good at the last election for the Fianna Fáil Party and it is the type of Bill people expected from Fianna Fáil.  It is not a gimmick.  It is a proper Bill and it gives legal standing to the promise made.  I join with other Senators in welcoming it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reliefs in the Bill for domestic dwellings, farm buildings, schools, community halls, and so on, are of tremendous help.  People who were burdened with rates recognise it as a genuine attempt to tackle a very difficult problem. I see a need for the problem to be tackled further.  I see a need for rates to be wiped out altogether because the system of imposing rates is not a fair one.  The Minister said there is a need also to take reasonable measures to protect the interests of non-domestic <Col N="799" /> ratepayers.  That recognises that there is a further need.  I welcome that recognition because it is very, very hard to gear your business to pay rates on top of ordinary taxation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there is provision for an exemption from rates for ten years for those who are setting up an industry. That is welcome and very helpful.  I hope the Minister will further examine the remaining system.  That will not be too difficult in view of the fact that £2 out of every £3 is going directly from the central Exchequer towards paying local authority expenses.  In the light of the present achievement of having gone two-thirds of the way, and in the knowledge that hardship is being imposed on the remaining one-third, I would urge the Minister and the Government to continue the good work they have started. When the next election manifesto is being drafted, I look forward with hope to rates being removed once and for all.</P>
    <P>I classify this Bill as being one of the most popular Bills ever introduced because it gives relief to those who need relief.  It is welcomed by members of local authorities.  The Minister is right to retain overall control.  Not all of the local authorities are controlled by the Government party and not all of them are conscious of how necessary it is to keep to 10 per cent.  I, as a Government supporter, and a member of a local authority for 18 years, realise that there are members of local authorities who would burst the Government if that were possible.  Therefore, it is only good housekeeping and wise legislation for the Minister to impose a 10 per cent ceiling. It is no secret that it is necessary for the Minister to impose that 10 per cent. There are members of local authorities who would double the rates in order to embarrass the Government and would care very little about who had to pay them.  The expedience of their own position and their desire to attack the Government would be of greater importance than consideration for those who have to pay rates.  I urge the Minister to further reduce the 10 per cent ceiling. The increased limit should be kept in line with the national income level.  That <Col N="800" /> should be about 6 per cent or 7 per cent. All of us realise that there is no bonanza and nobody will provide finance out of all proportion for any local authority. The Bill is very useful, maybe too useful, and too popular.  That is the only complaint I would have.  The Opposition find it very difficult to make a genuine contribution opposing this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very much a repeat of last year's Bill.  It relates to the administration of the rating authorities, local authorities, county councils and corporations.  The Minister is making provision for a 10 per cent increase.  It is argued by some people that this is not enough to maintain the levels of services provided last year.  In other words, what a county council set out to provide this year has been found by an impartial, judicious, fair public servant in the person of the county manager in my county, to cost 14½ per cent more this year than it cost last year.  Therefore, what has been subscribed to so vociferously by Government Senators is really an attempt by the Government and by their spokesmen to put across the image that the Minister was really saving ratepayers and taxpayers from the actions of an unscrupulous set of people who might be found on this side of the House.  The reality is that an officer paid by the Minister and many of the officials under him all responsible to him, set this figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>County Managers who are paid servants of the public and the <Col N="801" /> immediate agents of the Minister for the Environment, have the responsibility of going over their estimates and seeing to what extent an increase or decrease is warranted in the light of the variation of costs to the council this year.  I am sure the Minister will not deny that.  It is an absolute truth.  Every section of the services, even at Government level, are aware of what is necessary to maintain the services, not to increase them, and not to squander money.  There is no truth in the suggestion that somebody on this side of the House was so unscrupulous that the Minister had to put in this proviso to prevent squandermania at local level.</P>
      <P>County Councils and corporations, as providers of a service, have to make a financial commitment as between what they get and what they spend.  They are obliged to provide a service.  That service must be at an appropriate level or otherwise the Minister will not sanction it.  How can the Minister reconcile the fact that his servants project a figure as the appropriate figure and then he says to the people of Longford: &ldquo;You must do for £14.50 what you did last year for £10&rdquo;.  Is the Minister sincere?  Does he believe this service can be maintained with a 10 per cent increase?  He is aware that the cost of housing has increased by 33? per cent and that people looking for services will be seeking an increase this year at national level, or at local level.</P>
      <P>Somebody here said that he never saw a draft estimate.  I respectfully submit that county councils get a draft estimate which they go through and examine. They may not adopt it; they may reduce it, and then decide on the estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told the elimination of tax on cars was vital and necessary.  We were told a reduction in rates on private property was vital and necessary.  While we agree 100 per cent with eliminating rates on dwelling houses, we do not think we are authorised to reduce or eliminate rates on a structure of vast proportions which is visited occasionally by directors of foreign companies who enjoy the use of two, three or four motor cars at £5 a year tax.  That is not equitable when you consider that a person in a country district with an acre <Col N="802" /> of land and a small country shop in one room has to pay rates.  We have to be equitable and see who is talking for the people, who are getting the benefits and who is talking for those who are in need and require an equitable distribution of the funds available.  These questions must be asked.  I am asking them because unwarranted observations were made from the other side of the House. In all fairness they should not have been made.</P>
    <P>When a county council get a grant, whatever it is allocated for, they should have an opportunity to spend it.  If a trade dispute arises the money should remain with the council and they should have the opportunity of deferring the date in respect of which the work can commence or conclude.  I regret that in the allocation of grants to my county a sum of over £20,000 is going back on 31 December.  I do not want to make an observation as to who is right or who is wrong in the dispute, I am not interfering in that, but the Minister should have the right to say to the council: &ldquo;I will make an order entitling you to defer the expenditure of this money until the dispute is over&rdquo;.  That is the least that might be done.  The giving of employment in respect of which all these grants are allocated are exercises that are 100 per cent necessary.  AnCO training, and everything associated with it, is involved in some of these grants and in local improvement grants.  I appeal to the Minister to set a date when the county councils can again commence to complete the work they were doing.</P>
    <P>I am sorry this sort of circumstance has arisen.  I know it is not the Minister's fault but I want to say that he, and perhaps his predecessor, should have involved themselves to a far greater extent to bring about a settlement in the dispute thereby ensuring that this money will not go back into the coffers of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It is easy for the Government to give my county £20,000 more in 1979 than in 1978 if they take it back.  That, I understand, is the position at this moment. I would love to be able to say that I am wrongly informed but I have it on very reliable authority that this is what is going <Col N="803" /> to happen.  That is happening nationally.  As far as the work being done and the extent to which services are given, as well as training and employment, in Longford are concerned, that money is well spent but it is a pity we cannot spend it all.  In 1978 the Government borrowed £821 million.  It was easy for them to spend it in all directions, but we will not have £821 million in the coming year.  At the end of next year will we be able to say there was only a 10 per cent increase?  Will that 10 per cent be, as Senator O'Toole said, a ceiling?  In my view it is really the biggest increase in rates every applied at local level. When we were county councillors having the responsibility of striking a rate and having to go to the Minister to plead for an increased grant for roads and so on, we were never over 10 per cent.  We should recognise that this is a matter of the Minister saying, &ldquo;Here are my officials, present them with the figure you honestly think will be the cost of providing next year the services provided this year&rdquo;.  If the council say it will cost Longford an extra 4 per cent, or 4½ per cent, and the Minister says, &ldquo;I say it can be 10 per cent&rdquo;, then the people will say he is a great Minister.  The Longford County Council needed a 14½ per cent increase this year to provide essential services.  It is not fair for anybody on either side of the House to say that it is a wonderful achievement to be able to talk about this when in reality because costs have increased, services must be decreased.</P>
    <P>If Longford have to reduce their estimate of 14½ per cent to 10 per cent, as the Minister specifies, that will mean a reduction of roughly one-third of the work for which they are liable in respect of main roads and county roads.  The Minister is responsible for national primary and national secondary roads.  I was glad to see the amount for national primary roads was increased last year, but a high proportion of road surface of national secondaries in my county is being tackled by the engineering service.  I am fearful of what may come in consequence of these works, whether it will be possible to continue the work at the <Col N="804" /> same rate as in 1978.  The Minister as a fair minded person should consider whether taking back this £20,000 from Longford is what he in his heart would like to do.  If possible he could use his good offices to persuade the Minister for Finance to say, &ldquo;I am not going to create a situation where the councils will say they were unable to spend all the money allocated to them in 1978.&rdquo;  He would want to be able to say, &ldquo;I have given this money, go ahead with your training, your AnCO schemes, your local improvement schemes, and any money that is not spent on 31 December I will allow you to defer as heretofore in respect of other services in the coming year.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to the voices of other Members in relation to this Bill.  Taxation is an ever-changing problem, and ever-changing solutions have to be evolved to meet ever-changing circumstances.  The one thing that is evident from this debate is that when in Opposition one appears to have a solution for everything, even taxation; a solution for everything from bald heads to bunions.  Whatever the problem presented to this House or the other House, the Opposition will have a solution, disregarding the fact that on the way they supported the issues now before the House.  The many taxation issues that have come before the Dáil and Seanad over the years have been tackled in different way, by different people and by different Governments and some of them in realistic ways, such as the question of the local taxation or the rates issues that is before us now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember another occasion when instead of increasing the price of the loaf it remained at the same price but the loaf was reduced in size.  That seemed to be the solution of the Government of another day.  People have found devices and means of altering the taxation system that affects the great bulk of the people in many ways, such as the taxation system in relation to the rating system and the measure now before the House, which abolishes rates on domestic property, the domestic part of mixed property, secondary schools, <i>bona fide</i> community halls and farm <Col N="805" /> buildings which were not previously exempted from rates.  The Bill is designed to give statutory effect to this undertaking, to one of the promises made, and I think it effectively does that.</P>
    <P>The Minister states:</P>
    <P>It removes once and for all the burden of rates from over 850,000 householders and other ratepayers benefiting from the new relief.</P>
    <P>During this debate Senator Robinson made some suggestions in relation to the removal of rates.  Maybe she would care to clarify the situation.  She spoke about the well-off section.  Could she identify the well-off section?  How did the Labour Party propose to eliminate rates?  She said they intended to eliminate rates, but we were eliminating rates for the well-off section.  Did that mean there would be a perusal of a person's income?  Would it be on the basis of property?  Would it be on the basis of savings?  Would it affect old age pensioners who had put money aside. Would it affect the thrifty who saved money.  What would be the basis of the Labour Party's removal of rates?  She indicated that they had some other idea and that many people would be caught in the trap.  Maybe she should explain in full what section of the community would be affected and how.  Maybe she could spell out in detail what the Labour Party intended to do, if they intended to do anything.  I do not think they intended to do what she said.</P>
    <P>The Bill has come in for an amount of criticism.  This is an everchanging problem.  One of the things I would like to see happening in future would be that there would be an examination of the rateable valuation system of the country as a whole.  There can be no justification for many of the valuations, when they are compared.  Until we have a revaluation we cannot get to grips with this problem.  The Bill goes much of the way to ensure that the weaker sections of the community are protected.  I will deal with that point later.</P>
    <P>I want to make a plea to the local authorities and to the Minister.  Local authorities are responsible for many essential services for which money is being <Col N="806" /> provided in the rates this year as it was in other years.  The people who operate those essential services are in sheltered employment.  Many thousands of people have been held up to ransom by various strikes that have taken place in local authorities, nothwithstanding the fact that we made moneys available at the estimates meeting to meet the situation. Recently in Dublin a number of people were on strike in essential services and people's lives were put at risk.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that the community are protected and that the local authorities initiate a scheme to protect the people.  It is unfair that people in sheltered employment, whether they are in local authority areas, sewerage and water supplies, telecommunications or the power situation can put the community at risk.  This is an appalling situation. Where money is made available in local authorities I hope that some system will be developed where people would not be put at risk.  If there is a breakdown in communication between certain local authority employees and the Minister, or the employees and the managers, that is a priority which must be attended to immediately.  I made this plea at a corporation meeting recently.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling. Now that the Minister is here I hope he will take this up with the appropriate people and ensure that the people who occupy the houses that have been derated will have water supplies and will be provided with services that local authorities usually provide.  There is no use derating houses if people do not have water or a sewerage service.  This is a global situation and I would ask the Minister to ensure that the community will not be denied essential services which are provided out of the rates.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> Section 5 of the Bill deals with rented accommodation apart from small dwellings.  Although the section is long and complex its object is simple. For a tenant who was not previously directly liable for rates, this section gives the right to an allowance from the landlord equal to the rates element.</P>
    <P>This is very important.  We have had in this city many A1 Capones over the years who deprived many people.  These Rachmans who charged large rents, which contain the rates element, did not give way.  I am glad to see legislation being brought forward that eliminates the type of evil that has been creeping through this city where a small number of people are imposing their will on the people and holding them up to ransom. Because they cannot get local authority accommodation they have to take other accommodation in the meantime.  These people are now having justice given to them by section 5.  These A1 Capones have been active, are active and would be active in the future if this Bill had not been introduced.</P>
    <P>Section 10 enables the Minister for the Environment, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to issue directions to local authorities limiting the amount to be provided in the estimates.  For 22 years I have been a member of a local authority.  In that time the only thing I heard local authority members saying at rates meetings was that they wanted to reduce the rates.  Now we hear the opposite, they want to increase the rates. Through the years I have seen rates reductions take place and I have not heard any clamour for vast increases&mdash;the type of increases that some Senators have spoken of.  When it comes to striking the rate it is a different situation. We know what happens at the local authority meetings.  We know the attitude of members depends on the Government in power and whether the balance of power is with or against the Government.  Where that happens it is necessary that some balance is maintained. The Minister is the balance on this occasion.  The local authorities can plan in the knowledge that they are going <Col N="808" /> to get a percentage increase next year and the year after.  That is something they did not know before.  I was a member of Dublin Corporation when they refused to strike the rate.  We know the circumstances that existed then and what was brought about&mdash;an abolition of the council for purely political reasons.</P>
    <P>Now we have a situation that is clearly charted.  Members of local authorities know exactly where they are going and can make provisions within these limits next year and the year after. As a local authority member I think the provisions are reasonable.  I believe that the essential services must be maintained at all costs.  If essential services were at risk at any stage and a local authority went to a responsible Government, the Minister would have to make moneys available for the maintenance and protection of essential services.  Perhaps the Minister would take note of what I said about the essential services.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Section 13 simply recognises it as such.  I must emphasise, however, that the functions of adopting an estimate and striking a rate in the pound remains absolutely untouched by the present section.</P>
    <P>That is the situation.  I have been at the striking of the rate from time to time. That does not alter the situation.  I can make known my point of view, I can make suggestions to the manager, as I did at the various meetings which I attended recently in relation to the presentation of estimates, and these have been considered by members of the council. The only thing that was wrong with the estimates, apparently, was that the members of the local authority no longer had the enthusiasm to do their job properly.  That came to me from the last estimates meeting.  They said: &ldquo;We cannot get increases in various services.  But nobody looked for increases because they said they could not get them.  They did not want to alter the estimates.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, this Bill does not alter our situation as local authority representatives.  I hope that in the course <Col N="809" /> of this debate the Minister will take note of some of the suggestions made.  There is no point in removing rates if people are not going to get all the services they pay for.  While the removal of rates will release the burden that is placed on people by having to use alternative systems either to heat or light their houses or to provide or carry water, as was the case, I hope that where that comes within the orbit of local authorities the Minister will take immediate action to ensure that this grievance is remedied at the earliest possible opportunity and make some provision to deal with problems caused by people in sheltered employment who hold the country up to ransom from time to time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few short points on the Bill.  With regard to the general nature of the Bill, removing rates on domestic dwellings, one should not look a gift horse in the mouth.  I certainly do not propose to do that.  I wonder if the Minister for Finance is looking this gift horse closely in the mouth at the moment.  Would he like to perhaps reconsider the way in which domestic rates are to be allowed?  He might consider it would be altogether a more prudent financial exercise as far as the Exchequer is concerned if the relief was to be staged over a number of years as the previous Government proposed.  I think that a valid point when all the signs are obvious that there is grave difficulty in fixing the departmental estimates for this year and there is obviously great pressure on Exchequer funds.  I am sure the Minister for Finance might look a bit askance at what was promised in the manifesto and is now being implemented in this Bill.  There are many economic and financial arguments against doing such a thing.  However, there is a great social relief given by this Bill and to that extent it is welcomed.  It is not for us on this side to look a gift horse in the mouth at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two items in the Bill which I would like to raise at this stage and possibly we can deal with them on the section. On the system of apportioning the rates on a mixed hereditament, an arbitrary apportionment of one-third is provided for in the Bill as far as I can <Col N="810" /> see.  This arbitrary figure is already working a hardship on the benefits to which it applied.  We might, for example, take a shoemaker, a handicapped person plying his trade in a room in his house, or there might be a hairdresser supplementing the family income by doing some hairdressing at home, and all that might be involved would be a washbasin in one room.  At the other end of the scale you can have a doctor with a surgery in the house.  His surgery, in terms of floor area of the total house would be small but the amount of activity would be quite large.  To say that each of those activities attracts precisely the same apportionment, is unfair and arbitrary.  I would ask the Minister to consider changing this arbitrary apportionment and give discretion to the local authority, as they would be the proper people to know the scene in their own area.</P>
    <P>That leads me into the next point I want to make.  This point taken up by Senator Reynolds in some detail and I would like to echo it.  I am apprehensive about the wedge this Bill is with regard to local democracy.  It contains within itself a possibility that local democracy is going to be seriously diminished and that local councillors will become totally impotent as far as power within their areas is concerned.  The ultimate power for any elected body is financial power, and the financial power is now gone to all intents and purposes from the local authority.  They are being told this year the amount of the rate they can strike, and they can have 10 per cent over and above last year.  Already we know from many local authorities that this 10 per cent will not be sufficient to maintain even the services of last year.</P>
    <P>I will take the point Deputy Dowling made that local authority members at estimates time were always seeking a reduction and complaining about the rates having gone up.  What they were seeking a reduction from was the estimate presented by the manager who knew he was involved in a certain amount of bargaining procedure and pitched his estimate to allow for a certain reduction so that the procedure of striking a rate could be arrived at.  That procedure is not available any more to <Col N="811" /> the local authority.  They now have 10 per cent over and above last year to do what they like with it.  This is altogether wrong.</P>
    <P>The other serious point in the same context is the power to allow the manager to make the rate where the local authority members do not do so. Again, it was always one of the highlights of the local authority code that there were some critical functions reserved to the elected members, and one of them was the right to make, or not make, a rate.  If members refused to make a rate they knew there were certain consequences, they would be abolished, but that provision is now gone.  Undoubtedly for future Ministers of the Environment it could save them the embarrassment of having to suspend a local authority and replace it by a commissioner.  Merely to achieve that at the cost of taking from the local authority one of their basic democratic functions is bad.</P>
    <P>I would have grave apprehensions as to the future of local government in this country and how it is going to develop. The seeds for its destruction are contained in this Bill and the indications are that those seeds are going to be fertilised and expanded and, through time, local democracy as we know it will be a thing of the past.  There will be more central control.  That is clear already with the directive with regard to the rates to be charged next year and there is already a vast amount of central control as to how the money is to be spent.  I think it is a retrograde step and would like to sound a warning to the Minister and his Department that local democracy is something that has been part of our system for a very long time.  It serves a very useful part and has a very useful place in the democratic process, and if it is interfered with and things become more centralised, bureaucracy becomes more centralised, more impersonal, the people administering it become anonymous functionnaires and we have a plethora of functionnaires in this country at the moment.  These things are not helpful towards the consent of citizens generally to accept the obligations <Col N="812" /> of being governed.  We see all the signs of that at the moment, with lack of discipline right throughout the country. This Bill by introducing this element of taking away local democracy is going to do harm.</P>
    <P>One further point I want to make, and perhaps the Minister would deal with it when he is winding up this debate, and that is in the second last paragraph of his speech where he referred to the law regarding future valuations and made the point that the Bill contains no provisions affecting the future valuation of new and improved domestic property. However, it states that the Minister for Finance has adverted to the possibility of a global rather than individual valuation of domestic property being carried out for each rating area in future.  Obviously, much more than a note has been taken by the Minister of this, because the Minister of State went on to say that it was intended to introduce appropriate legislative proposals in the New Year. We must assume that there are some hard plans for changing the rating system with regard to new or improved change to domestic property.  This, of course, is a most significant change.  It will be a tremendous break with the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister should spell out for us, particularly in the context of what I have said&mdash;the danger to local democracy that this Bill represents&mdash;how the rating system will be changed and what a global system of valuations means, rather than the individual valuation we had heretofore.  How are the areas that will be globally valued be determined and what will be the effect on people living in those areas if there should be a change of user from domestic to business or to mixed?  I should like to hear the Minister on these matters. Would he also touch on what the effect of this will be on the financial position of local authorities in regard to their demand on the Exchequer for their budgets?  It is going to be in ease of the Exchequer or is it going to be in ease of the authority, or what, generally, will be the position?  I suppose it is naive to expect that it is going to be in ease of the local authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> We welcome the Bill in so far as it gives something for nothing, though I do not know if it is a good principle that the country should be trained to expect something for nothing.  That is a disease which can spread and, unfortunately, has spread very widely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend speaking on this Bill but intended listening because I knew there were people more expert than I anxious to contribute.  A point has arisen in the debate which I heard referred to outside the House which is important to analyse and see what value it has.  It has been stated and implied many times that the elimination of rates on domestic property is diluting or eliminating local democracy.  I am surprised at some of the sources from which this criticism has come, particularly from members of the Labour Party.  It seems that they have got themselves tangled up in a strange application of 19th century Victorian conservatism. It seems to be based on a complete acceptance by them that money is power and power is money and that is all there is.  This is an attitude which existed in the 19th century, an attitude which the British Labour Party certainly fought strongly against on the basis of bringing power and revenue into the central government.  They maintained they were strengthening democracy.  Maybe the truth lies somewhere in between.</P>
      <P>It seems extraordinary the rapidity, the ease and the immediate acceptance with which some speakers in the Opposition make this point which is based on this assumption that power is money and money is power.</P>
      <P>Rates as they apply to domestic property were an extraordinary Victorian concept of revenue rating based on the idea again that if one had property one had money, or that property was money, or that, if one had property one had some kind of income deriving from that property, directly or indirectly.  That idea was probably true in the Victorian age but, certainly, out of place in society as we know it today and in the democratic community we have here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> Democracy is much more subtle and, for all the attacks made on it, it is much more healthy than to be capable of reduction to such a crude financial calculation as is implied in this criticism. Democracy depends on the commitment of the people, the public representatives, the level of their information and the level of their local involvement and commitment. There are many aspects to it which make it survive all sorts of attacks, criticisms and misrepresentations. It is something that goes beyond the collection and disbursement of money, important as that is.  It is a strange and ironic side this, because when the Coalition proposed a reduction of 20 per cent in rates on domestic dwellings I have no recollection of them saying to the people: &ldquo;you realise, of course, we are also reducing democracy by 25 per cent&rdquo;.  I do not recall any statement or admission of that on their part.  If one accepts their logic in this matter are we to assume that as more money is paid in to the Central Exchequer the central government becomes automatically more democratic? I do not think they would want to make that point.  Their criticism is based on an extraordinary old-fashioned, simplistic, right-wing interpretation of politics, power and wealth.  It is extraordinary that it should come as frequently as it does from members of the Labour Party.  It is funny that when the Labour Party are not espousing extreme forms of socialism they seem to lapse into the most chronic forms of conservatism in their financial policies.</P>
    <P>What, in fact, did the abolition of rates on domestic property mean?  Over the past four or five years we have had the most cruel and rampant inflation here.  In a debate last week the figures came up, rising from 15 to 22 per cent. People on fixed incomes, very often old people on fixed incomes or pensions that were relatively fixed, had not only to live through that period of rampant inflation but had an increasingly difficult and rising rates burden on their property arising from the fact that they owned it. Was that democracy?  Was that equity? Are we going to say, or would the former Coaltition partners say, as was suggested to them by Senator Dowling, <Col N="815" /> that we go back to the people next June and say we are going to re-impose that burden now in the name of local democracy?  I suggest to them that they would get a very democratic answer.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson referred to flat dwellers.  The same applies there.  Let the Coalition partners tell the flat dwellers in Senator Robinson's constituency, and in my own constituency, that rates will be re-imposed on domestic property and that their rents in turn will go up in the name of democracy.  There is a simplistic and misconceived logic behind this criticism which is out of date and at variance with any concept of equity in a modern democracy.  The relief is a major social advance in equity and justice, something which was considered to be almost impossible for many years.  It demonstrates what can be done by reason, determination and commitment, and, ironically, can only be done with the support of people, which is the essence of democracy and the essential motivation and force behind this major social reform which I am delighted to welcome in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to legalise the major undertaking of the Government's re-election manifesto in so far as that from 1 January 1978 rates would be abolished on domestic property, the domestic part of mixed property, secondary schools, community halls and on farm buildings which were not previously exempted from rates.  There were many interesting contributions to this debate and many queries were raised to which I should like to reply in so far as is practical and feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Reynolds stated that the proposed system would be most unfair to small business people and small shopkeepers.  We must bear in mind the fact that rates are a business expense and allowance is made for rates payments in the income tax code.  The small shopkeeper will, of course, get rates relief on the dwelling portion of his house anyway.  The limit of 10 per cent for 1979 gives a protection to the small <Col N="816" /> shopkeeper against high rates increases, whereas if there was an unlimited increase available I would be worried about the small shopkeeper and small businessman.</P>
    <P>Senator Reynolds also spoke about the fact that not enough money is being spent on roads, but apart, of course, from what is spent from rates within the 11 per cent limit in 1979 the money provided from the road fund grant has gone up from £29 million in 1977 to more than £34 million in 1978.  The same Senator mentioned about the difficulty of tenants getting satisfaction from landlords.  This was raised by a number of Senators but the reality is, of course, that the tenant can use his right to take the landlord to court under this Bill.  This cannot be done until the Bill becomes law.  The retrospective nature of the provisions in the Bill is a fairly tough one which landlords will not lightly ignore.  The enactment of the Bill will confirm the tenant's right to rates relief from his or her landlord.</P>
    <P>It was also claimed that costs, such as wages and materials, have outstripped the 11 per cent increase in rate poundages allowed for 1978.  I do not accept this claim.  The overall rate of price increases for 1978 will work out well below the 11 per cent allowed in rate poundage increases.  Secondly, the average income increase which local authorities derived from rates-linked State grants in 1978 will work out at considerably more than 11 per cent&mdash;up to 14 per cent in many cases.  In fact, that is the most appropriate figure.  In all, local authorities had a record amount of £550 million available to them in 1978 for their current and capital services. This is an increase of more than £100 million on the previous year.  The 11 per cent formula gave them a boost of £25 million over 1977 in income from rates and from rates-linked State grants. Senator Reynolds asked why local authorities, rather than the Valuation Office, should not deal with apportionments of mixed properties.  This is a specialist job based on valuation practice and precedent and, on balance, we felt it best to leave it to the experts in the field, namely the Valuation Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from being short of money in 1978 local authorities had £100 million more than in 1977 between current and capital moneys.  As a matter of fact, 16 local authorities did not even need the full 11 per cent allowable in 1978.</P>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy for portion of the contribution made by Senator Hyland, namely for his wish that another form of local revenue should be found to replace rates.  The hard fact is that successive Governments, despite investigations of all sorts, did not come up with an alternative and it was this Government who grasped the nettle and abolished rates on houses and on other properties I mentioned earlier.</P>
      <P>Senator Hyland would like a White Paper on local government reorganisation before the local elections next June. This does not, strictly speaking, arise under this Bill, but I can assure him, and this House, that the matter is under consideration but the possibility of reorganisation before June next is scarcely practical at this stage.</P>
      <P>Senator Moynihan said that there was nobody better qualified than local councillors to know the needs of their own area.  This is perfectly true in one way but the reality of the situation is that their knowledge, efforts and plans must fit in broadly with national plans, policies and finances in a reasonable way.  The upper limit on rates increases achieves this balance within the ceiling fixed for rate increases.</P>
      <P>Local councils will still have full discretion to decide their programme and priorities.  This is as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien expressed some doubt that the provisions of the Bill designed to pass on rated relief to tenants might not be effective.  I do not accept this claim.  Section 5 spells out a clear entitlement for all tenants who have been paying rates only indirectly. These tenants will have the backing of the courts to secure their rates.  Sections 6 and 18 cover all local authority tenants and all tenants of privately-owned small dwellings.  I am satisfied that these <Col N="818" /> measures are adequate and I suggest that Senators allow the provisions of the Bill some time to work before being too definite in their judgments.  Senator O'Brien also spoke about the need for more money for roads.  I have no doubt that the overall limit of 11 per cent for 1978 has given councils, generally, a fair margin to make a reasonable provision for roads.  This is apart altogether from the direct grant for roads of over £34 million from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien also mentioned water and school schemes.  The truth is that the level of development on these major services depends on the capital expenditure. It is not directly linked to the rates level at all.  Senator Cranitch, Senator Connaughton, and Senator Cooney asked about the position where a portion of a house might be used for non-domestic purposes to a small extent.  The answer is that the definition of mixed hereditament has been drafted to allow a degree of flexibility to local authorities in this kind of case.  Provided a non-domestic use is trivial or insignificant a local authority is empowered to ignore this and to allow full domestic relief of rates.  In case of a disagreement between the local authority and the rated occupier as to the kind of relief which should be allowed to a particular property the matter can be resolved by an application to the district court.  It must be understood, of course, that the local authority must make the decision in each case in the light of the facts of the case as seen in their files and reported to them.</P>
    <P>Senator Connaughton said that Galway County Council would need a 17 per cent increase in 1979 but that they only got 10 per cent.  That is simply not so.  Galway, like other counties, will get the benefit of the increased valuation from new and improved buildings.  This will give 13 per cent taking the country as a whole, not 10 per cent.  I would ask Senator Connaughton to say whether he would wish the farmers and shopkeepers to have rates imposed on them in Galway and an increase of 17 per cent and upwards for the coming year.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson tried to argue that the domestic rates abolition gives a proportionately greater benefit to the <Col N="819" /> better off.  In fact, all of the criticism most commonly levelled at the rating system in the past was that rates applied most severely to people of small or fixed means.  If this criticism was valid, and I think it was, it follows that the removal of domestic rates must be a socially progressive measure.  It favours, above all, people of limited means who could not avoid the rates burden on their homes.  I am convinced that the scheme is weighted heavily in favour of the less well-off section of the community, many of whom could not pay their rates without undue hardship.  Senator Robinson, while welcoming the abolition of rates, criticised the way it was done. The Government have no apology to make for abolishing domestic rates once and for all across the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good system. Senator Robinson also spoke about the 10 per cent increase authorised last week by the Minister.  She related the 10 per cent limitation to local authorities' estimates of expenses.  In fact, the limit does not apply directly to estimates at all.  It relates to the rate in the pound. That is an important difference, and a 10 per cent limit on estimates would mean 10 per cent plus nothing more but a 10 per cent increase in rate poundage will invariably yield more than a 10 per cent increase in rates income.  That is because of the revenue buoyancy deriving from new and increased valuations.  In the case of Dublin Corporation the 10 per cent increase, if fully availed of, will yield an increase of at least 15 per cent, and probably more, in income from rates and from the domestic rate grant. Senator Robinson also spoke about the city manager's estimate having to be cut by £400,000.  This must be seen against the background of the total budget of £102 million as set out in the manager's estimate for 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

      <P>The figure of £400,000 is a fraction of 1 per cent of that total sum.  The same Senator expressed concern about how Dublin Corporation will fare out with their services.  It is a little early for this House to go into that too deeply.  Dublin city councillors can best be left alone at this stage to examine and decide on their own priorities in the services.  Their statutory estimates meeting has not yet taken place, and I shall not interfere with their priorities in any respect.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson also referred to section 5 of the Bill, which was also referred to by many other Senators.  This section deals with the passing on of the benefit of rates abolition to tenants of private accommodation.  The section is certainly long and rather complex but this was unavoidable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator also spoke about the shortcomings, as she saw them, in section 5.  I should like to make it clear that section 5 is only one of the provisions designed to ensure that domestic rates relief will benefit tenants of rented accommodation.  Section 6 deals with the position of local authority tenants and of private tenants of small dwellings.  Between them these probably account for a majority of all tenants in the country.  They are fully and effectively relieved of rates.  Section 5 does not deal with tenants who have been paying rates directly to their local authority. They are entitled to full relief under section 3.  Section 5 deals only with those tenants who have not been paying rates directly but whose rent may be assumed to have included an element in respect of rates.  This rates element in turn may be a separate identifiable sum or it may not. In the case of lettings controlled under the rent restrictions Acts the rates element is always identifiable.  What is more, machinery already exists under those Acts for securing an appropriate reduction in the control of rents now that rates are no longer a lawful addition to them.  A control sector is by no means uncatered for.</P>

      <P>I do not have that figure at present but I could get it for the Senator at a later date.  The 1971 census suggests that more than 50 per cent of that type of accommodation was controlled. In the absence of a further census I can only roughly estimate the position at present.  In all probability, however, controlled dwellings still represent about 40 per cent of the total of privately rented stock.  I do not accept that section 5 will not achieve its purpose in relation to the remaining tenants. For tenants who were continuously in occupation before the start of 1978 a clear entitlement is spelt out.  Tenants will have the support of the courts in securing this entitlement.</P>

      <P>Senator Kilbride is mistaken in thinking that county managers or any other officers of a local authority are paid by the Minister.  Being officers of local authorities they are paid by them.  He should also know that estimates prepared by officials were often in the past pruned and reduced by the elected council.  As a matter of fact many days were spent at estimates meetings by numerous councils trying to prune the rates, and councillors looked upon themselves as great defenders of the rate payers in trying to keep the rate in the £ down to the minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cooney did not seem to appreciate that the one-third mixed hereditament formula is not necessarily the final word.  Where the formula tends to bear unfairly, the occupier concerned may apply to the Commissioner of <Col N="822" /> Valuation and his local authority to have an individual apportionment made of the domestic and non-domestic elements in his valuation.  Section 7(2) is the enabling provision, thus the ratepayer, if he is not satisfied, has a right of appeal to the official valuation authority.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate, some Senators suggested that local authorities were now losing their powers. It was also stated that this Bill meant the death knell of local government autonomy.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We hear of the death knell of a local community or village if it is proposed to close a small Garda station or a small school.  We must bear in mind the fact that councillors will still have 99.9 per cent of their powers and functions, which are reserved functions of a local authority, still available to them when this Bill becomes law.  Councillors can still initiate schemes.  They have power to borrow money.  They have power to compel the manager to do anything he is legally entitled to do under the law.  They can order priorities in respect of expenditure.  They have power to carry out many functions.  This is spelt out in the booklet issued by the Department of the Environment and the Department of Local Government in 1975.  The reserved functions of the councillors are clearly to be seen in this booklet.  A person who studies the booklet would know quite clearly that in no way are the local authorities denuded of power under this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I stated previously, when this Bill becomes law with the responsible co-operation of all concerned, little, if any, interference will be caused by these new arrangements to the free ordering of priorities by local authorities.  Rating authorities have been able to operate as freely as before within the limit on rate poundages which are notified for the current year.</P>
    <P>Lastly, in authorising the 10 per cent increase in the poundages for 1979 I make the point to local authorities that it will be entirely up to them to decide on the priorities which should apply for the service catered for in their 1979 estimates and expenses.</P>

      <P>This Bill provides the Seanad with an opportunity of debating in detail the expenditure covered by the Appropriation Bill, 1978 and for discussing expenditure and financial policies in that context.  As Senators are aware, the purpose of the Appropriation Bill is to appropriate formally the sums voted by the Dáil for the supply services.  In addition, the Bill authorises the utilisation of certain departmental receipts as appropriations-in-aid.</P>
      <P>Section 1, which is the principal section of the Bill, appropriates to the specific services set out in the schedule to the Bill the sum of £2,231,172,560, comprising the original estimates of £2,118,528,000 and supplementary estimates of £112,644,560.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to make a lengthy opening statement on this occasion, but in my concluding remarks I shall <Col N="824" /> endeavour to deal as fully as I can with the various matters which will be raised by Senators during the course of this debate.  I look forward to an interesting and constructive discussion.</P>

      <P>Senators on this side of the House are very surprised indeed at the minimal introduction to this most important debate of the Seanad by the Minister.  The custom has been that the Minister has made a much more lengthy introduction to the debate which clearly allowed Members to cover the various proposals in the Estimates of the Department and to comment on Government priorities and Government performance. This is unprecedented as a very brief introduction. Is there some reason for this?</P>

      <P>The approach of the Minister is rather novel in being as cryptic and as brief.  We appreciate the fact that he is present to listen to the views and contributions of the Seanad in one of the most important opportunities that Senators get to examine and comment on the whole range of Government policies.  We would, however, have preferred if the Minister had set out some of the immediate Government priorities but I accept that he prefers to answer the specific points that are raised by individual Senators when replying.</P>

      <P>I doubt if it was as brief as this one.  I do not have a recollection of this half page with which we have been circulated.  However, that is a minor point.  The Seanad has the opportunity to make its contribution in looking at the Appropriation Bill.  Obviously each of us will decide on our priorities and choose the issues that we want to highlight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> I would like to refer to the provision made in the Estimate for the Department of Justice, a very small provision but, nevertheless, there is some provision made in relation to the report of the Pringle Committee on Civil Legal Aid and Advice.  The reason why I choose this first of all the matters that we might discuss is because tomorrow is the anniversary of the presentation by the Pringle Committee of their report to the Government.  Twelve long months will have passed since the Pringle Committee presented their very urgent, serious and important report to the Government. The Government have been failing very seriously in their responsibility by not even defining their position.  It is not that there is not a draft Bill or that there is not a Bill actually laid before the Dáil and Seanad; it is that the Government have not even defined their position on the urgent recommendations made by this very serious, responsible committee established by Senator Cooney when he was Minister for Justice.  This is a reflection on the kinds of priorities which this Government have been setting.  In the manifesto which Fianna Fáil put before the people they promised a number of things.  Among those things were reforms in the area of family law and reforms in the area of provision of legal aid which were couched in very general language.  When one looks at them now the promises are not as specific as they might have seemed.  At the time they created an expectation that this would be an important part of the Government's programme.  In relation to some specific items there was a commitment given that certain legislation, which was referred to earlier in this House today, to legalise the availability of contraceptives would be introduced within 12 months.</P>
    <P>The provision of civil legal aid is central to the creation of social justice and access to legal remedies in Ireland. It is of an importance that is commensurate with the provision of medical services and access to medical services.  We have to see the whole question of civil legal aid in that context.  If anybody were to suggest now in Ireland at the end of 1978, going into 1979, there would not be access to medical services, that we would abolish the medical card, that we <Col N="826" /> would abolish entitlements to medical care and hospital care and let everybody pay for any health services or any professional attention which he got, it would be regarded as barbaric and as a step back into the stone age.  Yet we have not got out of the stone age when it comes to the provision of legal services. The hardship, misery and social problems that are caused or aggravated are certainly not resolved, because people cannot get access to legal advice and services.  They are a continuing feature of our situation.</P>
    <P>When the Pringle Committee were established in 1974, well over four years ago, they were established because the way in which we would provide a system of legal aid and advice was a complex matter.  I fully agree that it is complex.  It requires serious examination and requires the knitting in of an appropriate system to our own legal structures and to our own resources as a community.  It was both an appropriate and important step for the then Government to establish the Pringle Committee.  I criticised the length of time they took. One is always more impatient when the subject matter of a committee is a matter of deep and urgent social concern.  I criticised the length of time it took the committee to bring out this report.  They did report and the report is a very substantial, thoughtful and considerate document.  The report made it clear that the committee had been requested to recommend an interim scheme if it was not possible to implement the full scheme for civil legal aid and advice.  It is clear on reading the report that the committee felt that the full scheme is the desirable approach.  But the committee, because of the urgency of the situation, because of submissions they received, because of the need in the community, because of the absence of equal access to legal remedies, because of the hardship caused to citizens and in particular vulnerable citizens&mdash;so many dependent wives, so many separated spouses, so many people who have severe landlord and tenant problems, who have a desperate need for this kind of advice and service, consumers who are inadequately protected&mdash;stressed the urgency of bringing in an appropriate <Col N="827" /> scheme.  They spelt out the kind of approach there should be.  They spelt out the establishment of the legal aid board, set out the need for a network of full-time community law centres and presented this report, which had worked out the whole system, to the Government a year ago tomorrow.</P>
    <P>We had a debate in the early part of this year on the whole subject of legal aid and the need for family courts.  The Minister at that time, although he was aware of the detailed recommendations of the Pringle Committee, did not want to make any specific comment or commitment because the report had not been published.  The report was published on St. Patrick's weekend&mdash;one of these non-weekends that happen&mdash;and was released at that time.  Ultimately it got full coverage in the newspapers and received very widespread support for the importance of the framework that was to be established.  It received criticism about the structure, minor criticisms in comparison to the very widely felt and shared knowledge and belief that there is a critical need and that, until we have provided a system of civil legal aid, we do not have even the beginnings of social justice.  We do not have equality before the courts or before the law.  We have no right to hold our heads up in an international context and we are failing the most vulnerable sections of our community who are most in need.</P>
    <P>The Minister should try at least to explain to the House why a full year has passed without this Government, with their unprecedented majority defining their position on the recommendations or establishing the grounds on which they would be prepared to implement a scheme.  This is particularly unacceptable because of the kinds of broad hints and half promises which the Minister for Justice gave in this House when the debate took place last March.  It looked as though decisions could be imminent. This is particularly serious when we have the young population that we have and the expectations of that population.  In a situation where there is already too much violence and a propensity to seek that kind of remedy to the <Col N="828" /> particular problems we call for respect for the law, for our system of courts and for our administration of justice and there is a very serious onus on the Government to make it clear that access to legal services and to the courts and to remedies in those courts is a central part of the system of law and legal administration in Ireland.  I feel so strongly about this absence that I have chosen to begin by highlighting that particular failure by the Government and I have asked the Minister for a specific explanation of why there has not been an official adoption of the Government position within a year of the Pringle Report being submitted.</P>
    <P>For the sake of the logical structure of my contribution I will go on commenting on the estimates and area of jurisdiction of the Department of Justice. This brings me logically on to the area of family law, the law relating to children and to adoption.  Once again, the promises were there and there was a specific reference in the manifesto to the importance of simplified and acceptable procedures for dealing with our law relating to children and the whole area of family law.  This section of the manifesto also lies either abandoned or idle, certainly low down in the order of priorities. We do not have any significant proposals for the urgent reform in the law relating to children that we so badly need.  We still have the predominant Act, being an old Act of the British Parliament, the Children's Act of 1908.  The only innovation in Government policy is the provision of a prison for children by the opening of Loughan House as a detention centre for children from the age of 12 to under the age of 16 so that they could be detained in the custody and care of prison officers.</P>
    <P>Lest I be misunderstood, as I have been before, I would like to make it very clear that my criticism of that proposal and its implementation is in no way a reflection or a slur directly or indirectly on the prison officers themselves, on their role and work and on their need for training in the work that they do.  I accept all of that without any qualification. The Government have run away from one of the primary problems of our <Col N="829" /> society and have come up with a cheap political answer to the increasing incidents of discontent, violence, vandalism and subculture in inner city areas and in certain parts of other areas which are not in the inner part of our cities but which reflect the same cycle of deprivation and poverty.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said that those who opposed, and who continue to oppose, Loughan House are soft-centred liberals who will not face up to the realities of society.  My answer to that would be that Loughan House is the &ldquo;soft&rdquo; in the sense of a dishonest answer to the problem.  It is not an answer, it is not even beginning to cope with the dimensions of the problem.  The real answer is to look very deeply at what is happening in our cities, to look at the way in which they are developing, to look at the lack of any kinds of opportunities or access to education, training or jobs for these centre city kids and to appreciate that the only way in which we can begin to cope is by having a far better sense of where our priorities should be and that it must hurt.  It must hurt because we have to be prepared, as a community, to redirect a considerable proportion of our resources in a very focused way and not in a way that is superimposing a solution from above or from outside.  It must be a way that works with, through and ultimately under the control and decision making by the people in those areas themselves and gives them the kind of support, local industry, housing, recreational facilities and the kind of opportunities which they must have if we are to get out of the present cycle of poverty which has been a feature of our cities and which is worsening and throwing up this incidence of violence and delinquency.</P>
    <P>The problem with the approach of spending £600,000 or £1 million or whatever it was, certainly £600,000 was admitted, on converting Loughan House into a closed detention centre far away from the background of these children is that it has the appearance of being an attempt to cope with a very serious social problem, but it does not cope with it in any significant way.  It certainly is not, and could not be really argued on the experience <Col N="830" /> of people in so many other countries who have an expertise in the area to be, rehabilitative of the boys involved. It is placing them in the custody of people who, whatever training they may get to help them to discharge the responsibility placed on them, are not either primarily or vocationally child care workers.  They are not people who have both the kind of commitment and long-term involvement with difficult children which prepares them to cope and to deal with the most difficult, the rejects from the existing institutions. Again, lest there be any doubt about the principles involved, it should be clear that, as far as I am aware, nobody who is responsibly involved in a working capacity or in a knowledgeable way with the inner city problem denies the need.  It is a small but a genuine need for a closed detention centre to remove at least for some specified time the most difficult boys who cannot be coped with in the existing institutions and who require treatment and help and also require to be removed from being in a position to exert an influence in their area which they have managed, in some instances, to dominate over a period.  It is not in question that there is a need for a certain closed detention centre and the provision of places there to cope with the most difficult of these boys who, because of their age, are not eligible to be sent to other institutions and who are not accepted by the existing institutions.</P>
    <P>The most important and non-negotiable qualifications on that principle are that the closed detention centre should be part of a progressive system, should allow for progression from the closed to the partly-open to the open, within the same complex or in a very linked way with other institutions of child care, should allow for that kind of progression and outlet.  It should be centred in the kind of area and background those children come from. These institutions should be within easy reach of relatives and friends so that the boys detained there can have frequent visits from relatives and contemporaries, which will help them not to become institutionalised and aggressive against the institutions in particular and the whole <Col N="831" /> system as they see it in general, so that they do not become totally alienated from society and grow into hardened recidivists at the age of 16 or 17 years with only one life open to them.  I am speaking about this in very serious terms because the problem is a very serious one.  We must face it in these terms.  That is a non-negotiable qualification on the acceptance of the principle that there must be some closed detention centre.</P>
    <P>The other non-negotiable principle is that the most difficult children, the ones who are reflecting their own background, very often reflecting a multi-problem family situation, very often reflecting the aggressive juvenile reaction to society which appears neither to want to owe them anything, nor to offer them anything, should be placed in the care and responsibility of those for whom caring for those children is more of a vocation than a job for which they are paid a remuneration.  I do not mean that they necessarily have to have a religious vocation.  I am talking about people who have the additional commitment of a personal sort which allows them, enables them and helps them to cope with the very taxing, difficult and at times harrowing responsibility of trying to relate to, help and rehabilitate these youngsters.</P>
    <P>The major criticism of the Department of Justice in this area is that they have done nothing on the positive side, as had been promised in the manifesto, to provide the legislation reforming the law and procedures relating to children, and that the only innovation on the theme is this unacceptable step backwards of opening Loughan House as a closed detention centre for under 16 year olds.  The situation is particularly serious because of the demographic structure of our population.  We have not any time at all; we have not any breathing space or leeway in the matter. We have a very young population, the youngest in the European Community. We have a fast-growing population which is the kind of richness and resource, and also problem to accommodate, that we have not had experience of since we achieved our independence. <Col N="832" /> We have not acclimatised and orientated ourselves as a people to the sort of country we have and where our priorities should be.</P>
    <P>We must be aware of what is happening externally, of external pressures, external criticisms.  We are facing into 1979 which has been proclaimed by the United Nations as the Year of the Child. In Ireland, although we pay lip service to family life, and although it is a very important component in ordinary people's attitude towards their life and their relations with the people in the community, we do not come out well on an examination of the way in which our law in particular, and our institutions, reflect on children.  I was very sorry the Minister for Justice refused to accept the Labour Party's Bill to amend the Constitution in two very important respects, first to ensure the constitutionality of adoption procedure and adoption laws.</P>
    <P>By not doing so, and by not producing a Government Bill immediately as an alternative response, the Government have left at least 25,000 families with this continuing apprehension, continuing and unnecessary tension and fear, that the family relationship which has been established between the adoptive parents and the adopted children may be shattered by the taking away of the adopted child.  The fear is greater than the situation necessarily warrants, because any Government with any sense of humanity would probably intervene very quickly if there were a serious constitutional challenge to our present adoption law and procedure.  We would have the kind of Bill that would go through this House in 24 hours.  We know examples of that.  It is introduced in the Dáil, goes through, comes up to this House and is through in an afternoon.  It is not all that unusual.  It is possible when the situation is a panic one.</P>
    <P>Why do we have to wait for the panic to set in?  Why can we not approach the problem with the seriousness and compassion and concern it warrants? Almost all of us have personal experience of either knowing or knowing of families who are deeply concerned and anxious about the present situation.  Yet the Minister for Justice responded by indicating <Col N="833" /> that the Government would bring in legislation.  How long will it take?  This is a further reflection on the lack of any kind of substantial legislative programme on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>The other side of the Bill is equally important and is a balance to the kind of amendment we need to bring in in this area.  The other important aspect of this Bill would have removed the stigma and status of illegitimacy.  I would hope that when the Government bring in a Government measure eventually to ensure the constitutional security of adoption, they will also in the same measure remove the stigma and status of illegitimacy. This is both appropriate and urgent as we move into this 1979 Year of the Child.  The onus is on the Minister not to remedy one part of that situation because the situation is very closely linked, and one cannot just bring in reform on one part of it and ignore the other part.</P>
    <P>When I say &ldquo;ignore the other part&rdquo; I mean to ignore the very substantial problems of single mothers in our society, problems of a legal, social and economic nature, as they have to face the very difficult decision of whether to keep the child and bring the child up themselves in a one-parent family context, or place the child with adoptive parents.  The balanced approach to that very serious and harrowing problem requires that the two be treated together, preferably in the same measure.  I cannot understand how it is possible to bring in a significant Bill to cope with those two related problems without amending the Constitution.  Perhaps the Minister might enlighten us.  It is certainly a question I am asked a great deal at the moment. When the Government bring in a Bill on this issue, is it intended to be and will it be a Bill which will contain a proposal to amend the Constitution?</P>
    <P>Still on the Department of Justice, one would move on to consider the absence of reform of the family courts.  I say this with a qualification which is important. There has been a very welcome change in the structure of the courts which has happened really for pragmatic and administrative reasons rather than because <Col N="834" /> of a strong Government lead and Government policy in the matter.  There is now a separate building up the Quays from the Four Courts which houses the Family Law District Court and the High Court dealing with family law matters. Undoubtedly, this is a very substantial improvement for those who come to seek remedies either in the District Court or in the High Court in the area of family law.  The facilities are better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be misunderstood.  I appreciate that.  On administrative grounds it was the expenditure of moneys to house the District Court and the High Court to deal with family law matters that has resulted in the provision of consulting rooms, greater privacy for people and also indicated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was positive policy to do this.  It was not a pragmatic chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It was pragmatic policy, and this is what I am getting on to.  It was pragmatic policy because it recognised that there was a need for better facilities.  What I am trying to say&mdash;and I will pursue the point&mdash;is that there are now better facilities&mdash;and this is very important&mdash;better courtrooms, better atmosphere, better consulting rooms, even the development of a special bar to some extent in family law and the full-time services of a judge.  Anybody who thinks we have not got family law problems in Ireland should just go along and see that we have now a judge of the High Court sitting on family law problems all the time, and this is likely to increase rather than to diminish as a workload.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more we move in this pragmatic direction of improving the facilities, the more obvious it becomes that that is not enough.  Providing more comfortable physical facilities, more privacy and better accommodation is no substitute for doing what the Government said in their manifesto they would do, namely, bringing in substantial reform of the family court structure itself, of the approach to family law problems.  The inadequacy of <Col N="835" /> the present system is becoming more evident and not less evident as we improve the physical surroundings and physical environment.  This can only achieve a certain kind of improvement and that is the height of it.</P>
    <P>Since this is an opportunity to range over the performance in the various Departments of Governments, I have probably spent long enough on the Department of Justice.  I should like now to move on to consider the priorities which appear to be emerging in the Department of Social Welfare.  It is interesting to reflect on the fact that the Minister who has that jurisdiction, and who also has jurisdiction for the Department of Health, is almost always known as the Minister for Health.  He is the Minister for Health and the Minister for non-Social Welfare.  The degree of initiative and innovations and opening hospitals that Minister has carried out in a full blaze of publicity is very commendable on his part.  He has been able to project himself as a very hardworking, very concerned Minister for Health.  One might have some differences on his order of priorities, but he projects.</P>
    <P>It is quite a different profile when one looks at the Minister in his capacity as Minister for Social Welfare.  He is showing himself to have too little interest in this Department, not to have the kind of concern for the increasing polarisation and misery that a very significant number of people are living in in Ireland today.  The situation is not holding steady.  It is getting worse week by week and obviously considerably worse during the winter months.  Those in receipt of social welfare benefits have had no increase since last April despite the rising rate of the consumer price index, the rising cost of food, the difficulty of coping in present circumstances.  There is no doubt at all that those who work in any kind of professional capacity, or those who work in a voluntary capacity, with the 20 per cent at the lowest end of the scale could only affirm that they are significantly worse off in this so-called advanced or affluent society of ours. They are significantly worse off in the 18 <Col N="836" /> months since Fianna Fáil took office, in comparison to the better-off sections who are dramatically better off, and in comparison to those who are in employment and who are therefore benefiting from rising wage levels.  They are the forgotten 20 per cent at the bottom. They are the ones who try to subsist on a level of income which bears no relation to prices and the increase in those prices which they have to face.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for us to think of what it must be like to try to feed, clothe and support two or three children on £25 or less than £25 per week.  To just ponder on that is to reveal the impossibility. Apart from the dependent wife, or the widow, or the separated wife, or the deserted wife trying to cope in budgeting for her family, we have to think also of the unemployed, of the very serious deprivation and hopeless situation of a number of unemployed people of different ages; the unemployed middle-aged man with his family he is trying to rear, and the young unemployed without a prospect for the future, without a prospect of getting the security and the status of being employed in our society.</P>
    <P>We should consider very seriously the possibility of indexing our social welfare benefits in the way other countries have regarded it as a social priority to index them.  There are obviously various ways in which the problem can be approached, but it would seem that whether it is a formal linked index, or an automatic Government increase in social welfare benefits, they should not be left at the bottom.  The disparity between the social welfare benefit and the lowest level of earned income should not be widening all the time.  These people should not be left behind in a very serious situation where they lack an infrastructure of a social welfare code which would be prepared to support and assist when necessary.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the other great lack in our present Minister for Social Welfare, a lack of desire to reform the social welfare code by making it a reality in meeting the needs and appeals and demands of those who feel they have been wrongfully refused a particular benefit, or in some cases, abused and harshly <Col N="837" /> treated by the system.  I do not want to dwell on this matter.  It has been raised several times in the House.  The whole approach to the supplementary welfare allowance procedure has been raised several times on the adjournment by me. The last time the Minister was in this House on that subject, he indicated that there was no overriding reason why he should not bring in regulations establishing a proper system of appeal. Since then, I have had personal evidence of a significant number of cases where there was no appeal, where there was just a refusal, no grounds given in very harrowing circumstances where the need was evident and where the person concerned was literally in a situation of degrading and dehumanising poverty and suffering.  The priorities are wrong here with the result that we are getting more polarisation in our relations than we have had.</P>
    <P>I now move on to the whole area of labour and industrial relations.  The handling by the present Minister for Labour, and by the Government generally, of the approach to the provision of a framework of industrial relations which would allow us to develop as an economy, which would allow us to maximise our opportunities of gaining export markets, which would allow us to expand very dramatically the employment possibilities at home has not been correct.  This climate and framework have not been created by the Government. In a succession of measures, they have worsened the situation and made less possible the kind of social contract, coming together of the community, coming together of the social partners to achieve the basis for the industrial relations which the vast majority of people would regard as desirable.</P>
    <P>What we are seeing&mdash;and as we go into 1979 on the evidence available to us already this can only get very sharply worse&mdash;is a rash of industrial disputes greatly worsened by the failure to understand the nature of the complaints or grievances, or the sense of injustice or unfairness, the incredible delay in dealing with very simple complaints or demands for proper terms and conditions. Sadly, some of the worst delays and <Col N="838" /> some of the worst obscurantism are features of some of our Departments.  It would be appropriate to single out the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in the area of industrial relations.  It cannot be an accident or a fluke that we have seen such a serious and permanent condition of severe industrial unrest in the area of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>The whole approach of that Department, the whole machinery, is antiquated and has exacerbated the possibility of a reasonable approach to the resolving of disputes on either pay, or conditions, or whatever it may be.  The failure by the Department to respond to things such as the claim by the day telephonists for equal pay, the failure to seriously assess and respond to that claim, not in the last year or so, but really for the past decade, has embittered many of the female employees of that Department.  I say that advisedly.  It is very difficult to see any alternative but to become involved in the kind of industrial action, possibly leading to serious strike action, which is looming on the horizon at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is instructive to look behind some of these individual disputes and to realise the time that has been wasted, the evasion of responsibility, the lack of an appropriate access to a forum and to a reasonable remedy within a relevant time span.  At the moment we are getting into a kind of phoney situation in industrial relations.  There is a very high degree of union bashing even by the newspapers.  There is great criticism of the very severe inconveniences caused from time to time to citizens, to commuters, to consumers, to families who need light or water.  The danger is that this simplified approach may gain a lot of support.  People may be willing to take the easy way out in a sense and say: &ldquo;This situation cannot go on.  It must be brought under control in some way&rdquo;. That is a facile, dishonest and inaccurate approach to the whole subject of industrial relations.</P>
