      <P>The main purposes of this Bill are to bring up to date the legislation dealing with the requirements for the registration and control of persons engaged in the practice of medicine, including the standards of education and training needed for such registration, and to provide for the better promotion and co-ordination of post-graduate medical and dental education and training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In aiming to achieve these purposes, the Bill provides for the establishment of two new bodies.  The first of these is the Medical Council, the establishment of which is provided for in Part II of <Col N="328" /> the Bill.  The second body is the Post-graduate Medical and Dental Board the establishment of which is provided for in Chapter 2 of Part IV of the Bill. I shall have more to say about the constitution, membership and functions generally of these two bodies later but first I would like to make some general comments about the new legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not aim at preventing anybody from practising medicine in the widest sense.  Most of us do this, to some extent, regularly, either by way of self-medication or by advising our families, our friends or our colleagues.  What the Bill proposes to do, in this respect, is: first, to make certain provisions related to the requirements for the education and training of persons seeking entry of their names in the statutory registers of medical practitioners; secondly, to reserve certain rights and privileges to persons so registered; thirdly, to provide for the mechanism whereby the name of a person can be erased or suspended from any register or have conditions attached to continuing registration and, fourthly, to make it an offence for any person falsely to represent himself to be a registered medical practitioner when he is not so registered.</P>
    <P>The present legislation regulating the registration and control of persons practising the profession of medicine is contained in the Medical Practitioners Act, 1927.  Some changes to this Act were made in amending Acts passed in 1951, 1955 and 1961 but the main provisions are those which are contained in the 1927 Act.  While this existing legislation and the Medical Registration Council which was set up under the 1927 Act, have served the country well, it is considered that the time is ripe for a review and overhaul of the present legislation.  There is considered to be need for change to take account of developments which, inevitably, have come about with the passage of time and to up-date the position generally having regard to modern thinking and knowledge.</P>
    <P>Because of the nature and extent of the changes which proved to be necessary, I considered it better to approach this matter, not by way of <Col N="329" /> amending legislation, but by introducing this comprehensive measure.  I trust that this approach will meet with the approval of this House.  It should certainly facilitate consideration of the Bill and should also facilitate those who will be concerned with its operation once it has been enacted.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are based largely on the recommendations of a committee which my predecessor set up to go into this whole matter.  The committee was representative of the Medical Registration Council, the Irish Medical Association, the Medical Union, the medicine schools, the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Surgeons, Comhairle na nOspidéal, the Council for Post-graduate Medical and Dental Education and my Department.  The terms of reference of the committee were as follows:</P>
    <P>To examine and report to the Minister on the changes necessary in the existing legislation for the regulation of the medical profession, taking account of the directives in relation to medical practitioners adopted by the Council of the European Community, the recommendations of the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Regulation of the Medical Profession in the United Kingdom&mdash;the Merrison Report&mdash;in so far as they affect this country and other related matters,</P>
    <P>This committee produced a unanimous report and recommendations and these, as I have said, form the basis of the proposals now before the House. It gives me pleasure to acknowledge the contribution made in this matter by the members of the committee and, through them, by the organisations which they represented.  It was an example of what can be achieved by the exercise of goodwill and co-operation which, I hope, will augur well for the future working of the various provisions included in the legislation.</P>
    <P>As with any profession, the medical profession properly demands the right to regulate its own affairs and rightly takes pride in the very high standards which it sets for its members and in <Col N="330" /> the strict observance of those standards at all times.</P>
    <P>Turning to the specific provisions in the Bill, Part I deals with preliminary matters such as the short title, interpretations, commencement of the Act, the establishment day for the new Medical Council and repeals.  These are all standard provisions in a Bill of this kind.  The First Schedule includes the enactments which are to be repealed.  They consist of all the existing Medical Practitioners Acts. To the extent that some of the provisions contained in these Acts will still be required, they are to be reenacted in the new consolidated measure which is now before this House.</P>
    <P>Part II provides for the setting up of the new Medical Council which will replace the present Medical Registration Council and for the dissolution of the latter and for the transfer of its assets and liabilities to the new council.  This Part also contains whatever consequential provisions are necessary arising from the setting up of the new council.  These are matters such as the appointment of staff, the keeping of accounts, the setting up of committees and matters incidental thereto.  It also enables the Council to charge fees for services given, including fees for the retention of a doctor's name on a register which is a new provision.  Retention fees of this kind are already in existence for other health professions in this country such as dentists and opticians and the practice is commonplace abroad.</P>
    <P>In relation to the composition of the new council, I would like to say a few words.  The present Medical Registration Council consists of 11 members made up of a representative of each of the medical schools together with two members elected by the practising profession and two members appointed by the Government.  The Medical Registration Council maintains the general register of medical practitioners and it has a regulatory role in relation to the standards of medical education and training at undergraduate level and in relation to what is known as the &ldquo;intern&rdquo; year which a newly qualified doctor <Col N="331" /> must undergo before he can become a fully registered medical practitioner. The new Medical Council proposed in this Bill will differ considerably in its size, constitution and powers by comparison with the present council.</P>
    <P>Over the years there has been a steady development of specialisation in medicine and post-graduate education and training leading to specialisation now forms a large and important section of medical education and training. To take account of the new situation, the new Medical Council is being given duties and responsibilities in relation to standards of post-graduate medical education and training as well as undergraduate education and training.  Membership of the council is being extended to give representation to bodies with functions in the post-graduate field.</P>
    <P>The organisations representing doctors have, for many years, been unhappy about the extent of representation on the existing Medical Registration Council.  It is accepted that the practising profession has a valid case for better representation on the new controlling body and, for that reason, it is being proposed to extend the number of elected members of the new council from two members to ten members.</P>
    <P>The committee to which I referred earlier favoured a Medical Council of 21 members.  It is a difficult problem to give representation to all the organisations and bodies that would like to be represented and at the same time ensure that the council will not be too unwieldy in size, that it will not be so large a body as to militate against its own efficiency and lead to its having to delegate too much of its work either to an executive committee or to its own staff.  In the light of representations received, I decided to increase the membership to 25 to allow for the addition to the following: one member to represent post-graduate interests in psychiatry; one member to represent post-graduate interests in general medical practice; an additional member to be appointed by me to increase representation of the interests of the general public; and, one additional elected member to restore the balance <Col N="332" /> between elected and non-elected members.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think that the constitution now proposed for the new Medical Council represents a reasonable balance in regard to membership. I should point out that there is provision under section 13 enabling the council to set up committees to assist it in carrying out its functions.</P>
    <P>The council will be obliged to establish two committees, namely, a Fitness to Practise Committee in relation to Part V of the Bill and an Education and Training Committee in relation to Part IV of the Bill.  Apart from the Fitness to Practice Committee, the council will be empowered to appoint persons to any of its committees who are not members of the parent council. In the case of the Fitness to Practise Committee, membership is restricted to members of the council including at least one non-medical member appointed by the Minister to represent the interests of the general public.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Education and Training Committee, the council will be obliged to appoint to that committee the representative on the council of each of the medical schools.</P>
    <P>In general, the aim&mdash;which I think will be achieved by this measure&mdash;is to establish a Medical Council the functions, constitution and membership of which will reflect the requirements of the profession of medicine in this day and age.  The powers of this new body, as is the case of any similar body charged with the regulation of any other profession, will derive essentially from its role as the custodian of the statutory register or registers the keeping of which is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with registration and obliges the council to keep what can be called a basic register of medical practitioners.  It also enables the council, with my consent, to establish and maintain a Register of Medical Specialists.  The main provisions in relation to the basic register are the same as obtain at present, namely, provisional registration of doctors who have qualified but who have yet to do their &ldquo;intern&rdquo;<Col N="333" /> year; temporary registration for doctors coming from abroad, mainly for further training, who are not otherwise entitled to be registered and want to come here for a limited period to engage in the practice of medicine, and then full registration.  Here, might I say, a new procedure has been introduced in so far as a doctor will be obliged to display in his consulting rooms the certificate of his registration with the council.  This is one of the measures introduced in the Dáil aimed at protecting the public in that it will help to identify registered medical practitioners.</P>
    <P>It will be noted in section 27 that nationals of other member states of the European Community who have recognised medical qualifications will be entitled to be registered here.  The mutual recognition of medical qualifications and freedom of movement for doctors with the EEC were the subject of the first directives adopted by the Council of the European Community in respect of any professional group in the member states.  In at least one of the member states it is not permitted that any doctor registered in that country should at the same time be on the register of any other country.  This applies to its own nationals as well as nationals of other member states so that it is not a discriminatory practice. Arising from this situation, and for other reasons, I have introduced a new provision in section 33 which enables a doctor to apply to have his name removed from the register.  Otherwise a doctor's name could only come off the register through erasure of his name which could have undesirable connotations.</P>
    <P>Another feature in Part III is the provision in section 30 whereby the council may set up a separate register of medical specialists.  This would be a register which would indicate the doctors who are trained to a level entitling them to be regarded as specialist physicians or surgeons or anaesthetists or psychiatrists or any of the other recognised specialties. Registration of specialists is a common feature in many continental European countries but has not as yet been introduced in this country or in the <Col N="334" /> United Kingdom.  Its introduction in the United Kingdom has been recommended in the Merrison Report, to which I have referred earlier.</P>
    <P>There are very close ties between this country and the United Kingdom in the field of post-graduate medical education and training and what we are really proposing here is to give the new council the necessary enabling powers to go ahead, with my consent, with the introduction of a register of medical specialists at the appropriate time.  The timing of its introduction may be important so it is considered that is a matter best left to the council to make up its mind on. Before I leave this area might I explain that if a specialist register should be introduced it will not legally restrict the practice of a specialty to persons entered in the division of the register relevant to that specialty.  It would be completely impractical if not impossible to restrict, say, the practice of surgery to persons registered as specialist surgeons.  All doctors presumably from time to time carry out some forms of at least minor surgery. The purpose of the register will be to indicate to the public who are recognised and accepted by the authoritative body as specialists in surgery and so on.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with education and training.  The first chapter of this Part provides the new Medical Council with the necessary regulatory powers to enable it to ensure that medical education and training programmes provided in this country are of a standard that will produce persons with the requisite skills and knowledge that will make them suitable for registration. The present council's powers only extend to undergraduate training and the &ldquo;intern year&rdquo; which is required for full registration in the existing register of medical practitioners.  Under the Bill, in addition to the powers which the present council already has, the new council is being given similar powers in the post-graduate field. This is particularly necessary because of the enabling powers that are provided in Part III for the new council to introduce a register of medical specialists.</P>
    <P>Chapter 2 of Part IV provides for <Col N="335" /> the setting up of a new statutory board which would have the function of promoting and co-ordinating the development of post-graduate medical and dental education and training.  This was not the original intention.  The provisions of the Bill as introduced in Dáil Éireann would have enabled me to assign to the new Medical Council the functions of promoting, co-ordinating and organising post-graduate medical education and training.</P>
    <P>The Bill had already passed through its Committee Stage in the Dáil when a joint deputation from the Medical Registration Council and the Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education&mdash;an <i>ad hoc</i> body established some four years ago&mdash;came to see me. This deputation stated that in their view it would be inconsistent with the primary regulatory powers of the new Medical Council if functions relating to the promotion, co-ordination and organisation of post-graduate education and training were also to be assigned to it.  They recommended that what was needed was a new statutory body to replace the <i>ad hoc</i> Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education.  I was convinced by the case made by these bodies representing important sectors of medical and dental opinion and I sponsored the necessary amendment and put it before the Dáil where it was agreed to.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable amount of criticism and, I think, misunderstanding, in relation to the functions of the new Post-graduate Medical and Dental Board and, in particular, in relation to my powers to appoint the 25 members of the board.</P>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance not to lose sight of the fact that the functions of the new board will not in any way detract from the powers of the new Medical Council.  The council will be the body with sole responsibility for the setting and maintenance of standards of medical education and training, both at undergraduate and post-graduate levels and for standards of professional conduct and discipline within the medical profession.  There will, of course, have to be the closest working co-operation between the <Col N="336" /> council and the board, with unquestioning acceptance of the primacy of the council in matters relating to standards of medical education and training and the formal recognition of medical qualifications at all levels.</P>
    <P>With regard to the appointment of the 25 members of the new board, I can honestly say that I see no alternative to my having the power to appoint them.</P>
    <P>In assuming these powers to myself I am not relying on any questions related to funding or public accountability. There are many bodies with legitimate interests and aspirations for representation on this new board. They would include the new Medical Council, the Dental Board, Comhairle na nOspidéal, the Higher Education Authority, the medical schools, the dental schools, the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons and their Faculties, the health boards and public voluntary hospitals involved in medical teaching and training, the Department of Health and the Department of Education, the Irish Dental Association, the Irish Medical Association, the Medical Union, along with many bodies, including the post-graduate training committees, representing the major specialties and sub-specialities of which there are no fewer than 37 alone listed in the EEC Doctors Directives as being disciplines of specialised medicine applying in this country.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that apart from questions of geographical representation, the new board must reflect a fair and reasonable spread of all these interests and that, if the body is not to be unwieldy in size, several members will have to represent more than one interest as is the case in the constitution of the present <i>ad hoc</i> Postgraduate Council.  I can see no way in which this can be ensured if a system of direct nomination is to operate.  On the other hand, recognising as I do the strength of feeling within the medical and dental professions on this matter, I am prepared to give every reasonable assurances that, in making appointments of members of the new board, my aim will be to create a body which will not only be expert and representative but will be accepted as such by <Col N="337" /> the professions.  It is my intention to see to it that all the major interests concerned, especially the medical and dental schools, the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons, the post-graduate training committees, the employing authorities, the Medical Council, the Irish Dental Association, the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union are clearly seen to be represented on the new board.  In turn, I would ask for the full co-operation of all these bodies in my efforts to create a board which, as I have stated, will be an expert and representative body in the field of post-graduate medical and dental education.</P>
    <P>In a further effort to allay the fears and apprehensions of the professions I am examining the possibility of sponsoring, on Committee Stage, some amendments to sections 40, 41 and 42. I have had discussions and correspondence with the bodies concerned and I have every hope that, because of the assurance which I have now given in this House and of the amendments which I would propose to sponsor on Committee Stage, all the interested parties will be satisfied with the provisions, as amended.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of Chapter 2 of Part IV provide for the necessary financing and staffing of the board.</P>
    <P>We now come to Part V which deals with the important matter of the fitness of doctors to continue to engage in the practice of medicine as registered medical practitioners.</P>
    <P>At present there is provision for the Medical Registration Council to erase a doctor's name from the register if he is convicted of crime or if he is found by the council to be guilty of professional misconduct.  In both cases it is the council that makes the erasure and in the case of professional misconduct there is an appeal to the High Court against the council's decision. In order to ensure that the powers of the new council will not run the risk of being in conflict with the Constitution, it is now being provided that any decisions of the council under Part V of the Bill involving the erasure or suspension of a doctor's name from any register cannot be put into <Col N="338" /> effect until confirmed by the High Court.</P>
    <P>A number of new features have been provided for in Part V.  At present the Medical Registration Council has only the power to erase a doctor's name because of conviction of crime or professional misconduct.  The new council will, in addition to erasure, have the power to suspend registration, to attach conditions to continued registration and power to advise, admonish or censure a doctor in relation to his professional conduct.  It is now being provided that the council can take action against a doctor if he is considered unfit to engage in the practice of medicine because of physical or mental disability.  There is also provision for action against a doctor for failure to pay a retention fee, which itself is a new feature.</P>
    <P>Apart from erasure because of court conviction of an offence triable on indictment, decisions of the council to use any of its disciplinary powers are taken following an inquiry and report by the Fitness to Practise Committee. Fortunately it is very rare that steps of this kind need to be taken but I am sure the House will agree that such powers are necessary and every precaution has to be taken to protect, on the one hand, the interests of the doctor who may come under notice and, on the other, to safeguard the legitimate interests of the public at large.</P>
    <P>Part VI largely re-enacts provisions in the existing legislation which are being maintained.  I would like to draw attention to a few of the provisions. In subsection (2) of section 57 a new feature is being introduced whereby the council will be obliged to make the registers maintained by it available for inspection by the public and they will also be available for inspection throughout the country at the headquarters of health boards.</P>
    <P>In section 61 the penalties for making misrepresentations for the purpose of getting on the register or for misrepresenting oneself to be a registered medical practitioner have been considerably increased.  There have been problems over the years with bogus doctors and under existing legislation a person who wilfully and falsely represents himself to be a <Col N="339" /> registered medical practitioner is liable to a fine not exceeding £25.  This has not been an adequate deterrent and, in addition, it has been difficult to prove that a person wilfully represented himself to be a registered medical practitioner. In the new provision the need to prove wilful knowledge has been dropped and the new penalty of £500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both will, we feel, help to eliminate this particular problem.</P>
    <P>Section 68 provides for the continuance for the time being of a reciprocal arrangement between this country and the United Kingdom which is set out in the First Schedule to the Medical Practitioners Act, 1927, despite the repeal of that Act.  Statutory registration of medical practitioners was first introduced here and across the channel by the Medical Act, 1858, and following the establishment of the State, the Medical Practitioners Act, 1927, set up our own Medical Registration Council and conferred on it all the duties and responsibilities which the General Medical Council of the United Kingdom had exercised in relation to Ireland.  At the same time a mutual agreement was entered into between the two countries under which doctors qualifying in either country would be entitled to be registered in the other country as well.  Under the agreement four representatives of the medical schools in this country are entitled to sit on the General Medical Council in the United Kingdom; that council, in turn, has power to inspect Irish medical schools.  The two councils have had very harmonious relations over the past 50 years and have co-operated with one another to ensure proper standards of training and professional conduct in these islands.</P>
    <P>With the advent of the EEC directives regarding doctors bringing with them mutual recognition of medical qualifications and freedom of movement for doctors throughout the member states, it will be seen that quite apart from any questions of national sovereignty, the special relationship which has hitherto existed between this country and the United Kingdom no <Col N="340" /> longer has the same relevance.  My Department, in consultation with the Medical Registration Council, have been in contact with the Department of Health and Social Security in London. There is wide acceptance that the present agreement is no longer necessary. The British Merrison Report has recommended that the Irish medical schools should no longer send representatives to the General Medical Council.  At the same time, they did make it clear that it was their hope that the fruitful co-operation between the two councils that had existed hitherto would continue.</P>
    <P>A Bill providing for the reconstitution of the General Medical Council and for the termination, by agreement with this country, of the 1927 Agreement was introduced to the House of Lords in the United Kingdom on 10 November 1977.  Pending the actual terminations of the agreement, section 68 provides for its continuance; when the time comes for its termination it will be possible to do so by ministerial order.  It is hoped to maintain the present close ties between this country and the United Kingdom in the field of medical education and training, particularly at post-graduate level, on some non-statutory basis.  With this in view it is proposed in section 13 of the Bill that the Education and Training Committee of the new Medical Council can have persons co-opted to it who are not members of the council.  A similar provision is included in the new United Kingdom Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 69, might I say that the new council is being given a new statutory function to give guidance to the medical profession in regard to matters of ethical conduct and behaviour.  It is also being given the function of keeping the public informed on matters of general interest. I look forward to the new council playing an active part in advising the medical profession and keeping the public informed on matters of importance.</P>
    <P>We are indebted to the Medical Registration Council and to the medical profession for the high standards of medicine and ethics that obtain in this country.  I hope that the <Col N="341" /> House will accept the measures which I now bring before it are aimed at ensuring that these high standards are maintained, that improvements are made where possible and that the legitimate interests of the general public are adequately safeguarded.</P>
    <P>I look forward to getting the views of the Members of this House to whom I commend this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a major piece of legislation for the medical profession and I am sure it is satisfying for the new Minister for Health to have the opportunity as one of his first Parliamentary acts to introduce this Bill.  I would like incidentally to wish the Minister well and also success in his lofty ambition to be the best Minister for Health the country has ever known.  I think very few people, even people involved in the Parliament of a country, realise the amount of work that must go into the preparation of a Bill even before the parliamentary draftsman gets his hands on it.  A tremendous amount of work and effort must have gone into the preparation of the report that led to this Bill and I would like to join with the Minister in complimenting the members of the committee set up by Deputy Corish on a job very well done.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has said, the purpose of this Bill is to establish a new governing body, as it were, for the medical profession.  In Ireland every profession has the right to govern itself.  In governing a profession the council of each profession is charged with the responsibility of ensuring the educational standards of its new members, of keeping its members informed of current developments in their profession and of representing the views of that profession to the public.  It is also responsible for ensuring proper standards and conduct of its members in the profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a very interesting discussion in the Dáil on Second Stage on the question of whether a council or a governing body of a profession should consist solely of members of a profession. I am not a doctor but as a professional person I am sure I would not be the most objective person <Col N="342" /> to consider something like that.  It warrants consideration in this day and age and, as a colleague has mentioned to me, it was rather a pity that the committee that made the report that created this Bill did not include outside interests.  I know that the Minister has some powers to ensure that the new council will have some outside interests on it and I compliment him on that.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the number of people from all sides of the Dáil who commented on the fact that the 1927 Act had stood well the test of time. With the greatest respect to all the people who said that, I suggest that the 1927 Act stood well the test of time because nobody ever went about changing it.  The changes proposed in this Bill, and they are very wide ranging and fundamental changes for the governing of the medical profession, were not changes that were necessitated by developments in medicine last year or the year before.  The fact is that there have been enormous changes in the practice and profession of medicine and it was important, perhaps decades ago, that changes be made.  The existing council comprising 11 members in my view could not hope to deal adequately with the problems and the work which the governing body of a profession like medicine would have to undertake.  I do not know how many doctors are practising here but I am sure there are more doctors practising than there are solicitors and the Council of the Incorporated Law Society consists of more than 30 members.  The members of that council have to contribute a great deal of their own time and effort to the work of the council and for that reason the expansion of the new council to 25 members is a good and sensible thing and is something which is to be recommended.</P>
    <P>The proposed membership of the new council is interesting and it reflects the differences that have occurred in the practice of medicine. As the Minister has rightly pointed out, the importance of post-graduate courses in medicine, and the importance of specialist interest in medicine, has caused the necessity to include <Col N="343" /> specialist interest on the board.  I am concerned that the specialist representation on the board has gone a little too far.  It is important that a medical council would represent, in so far as possible, the overall profession of medical practitioners.  It is important that the council should to an extent represent the break-up of the members of the practising profession. I do not think anybody would deny that the general practitioner or family doctor forms the greater portion of all those practising medicine.  The council has many matters of a general nature to deal with and I feel that some of the specialists concerned could have been catered for adequately on committees which the council has the right under the Bill to set up.</P>
    <P>The general practitioners represent the main contact which the medical profession have with the community. They represent&mdash;I say this with no disrespect to other people involved in medicine&mdash;the truly human side of medicine.  They practise the art of medicine as opposed to the cold clinical science of medicine which is practised by the specialists and the academic medics.  Only a minimum of three out of 25 of the new council membership will consist of general practitioners.  One will be appointed by the Minister and two elected.  I am concerned that that is not enough and I should like to give further consideration to this and, perhaps, it is something that might be discussed further on Committee Stage.  Anybody who takes an interest in Seanad elections would be interested to observe the type of elections that will have to take place to the new council because there are going to be more panels and sub-panels in that than ever had to be sorted out in this Chamber.  People interested in future Seanads might take note.</P>
    <P>I should also like to compliment the Minister on the amendment made in the Dáil that of the four members to be appointed to the council by the Minister three of them shall not be registered medical practitioners and shall represent the public interest.  The fact that these three people do not have to be registered medical practitioners <Col N="344" /> does not mean that they will not be medical practitioners of some form or another or that they will not represent quasi-medical interests.  I hope the Minister will use this opportunity to represent consumer interests. There was considerable discussion in the Dáil on this.  The framework that is there at the moment is ample to ensure healthy representation of outside interests but it is going to rest with the Minister to exercise that opportunity and ensure that he ends up with the most desirable product, as far as the country is concerned generally. There is obviously a case to be argued for para-medical groups to be represented on the new council but it is important that outside interests, particularly people concerned in the field of social welfare and that type of interest, should be represented on the new council.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is concerned with registration.  This is of considerable importance in any profession but it is of outstanding importance in medicine.  The fact that it is a crime for somebody to put himself out as a registered medical practitioner has obviously not proved a sufficient deterrent because we have seen many instances over the past number of years of people purporting to be registered practitioners who were, in fact, no such thing.  As matters stand at the moment it is possible for any Member of this House not a doctor to set up in Merrion Square and put outside, &ldquo;Senator so-and-so, Medical Practitioner&rdquo;.  There is no objection to that and there is very little the Minister can do to stop it.  The only control he has is to increase the penalties for people who purport to be registered medical practitioners.  The importance of the register lies in the fact that members of the public who want to see whether a doctor is actually qualified or not can look to the authority of the register and if the doctor is on it he knows that that doctor has satisfied the basic education and training which must be satisfied for the person to achieve the distinction of going on to the register.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the opportunities which exist for tightening up looseness <Col N="345" /> in relation to the register have not been fully used and the opportunities to control matters in a better fashion have not been taken in the Bill.  There was a lot of discussion in the Dáil on this and I do not want to go into the details of it but a simple solution occurred to me.  The procedure as it now stands is that somebody qualifies and then he is entitled to go on to the register.  The Minister introduced a very useful amendment insisting that a doctor display his certificate of entitlement or certificate of registration in his office so that the public can see it.  Of course, one may go on the register this year and come off it in ten years' time, but one still has that slip of paper that says one is on the register.  In our profession, and in other professions, an annual practising certificate is issued to members and there is no reason why the Medical Council should not issue to its members annual practising certificates.</P>
    <P>This would prove a very useful way for employers, be they health boards or other doctors, to check somebody's qualifications.  Anybody who purported to be a registered medical practitioner could as proof of his entitlement to claim such produce this certificate and show that he was currently registered.  This is a problem that arises because of the enormous increase in the numbers of doctors and people practising medicine and also because of the free movement of doctors within the EEC territory.  It is a problem which could become a good deal worse.  The Minister should consider including in the provisions of the Bill an obligation on the council to issue annual practising certificates to doctors.  The position could be tightened further if there was an obligation on the council to circularise details of any doctor who had been struck off in the course of the year for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>The registration particulars in the Bill differ only slightly, and not in any significant way, from the provisions of the 1927 Act.  The 1927 Act was introduced at a time when the numbers practising were very small and when we were a smaller community in terms of contact with each other and, particularly, contact with one professional <Col N="346" /> person and another.  Greater changes are required than the changes proposed in the new legislation.</P>
    <P>Part IV is concerned with the education and training of doctors.  As the Minister has said, there is a very significant change in this new legislation from the 1927 Act.  The council is no longer simply concerned with the undergraduate training of doctors but is now concerned also with the adequacy of post-graduate training.  As I interpret the Bill, it appears that the council's duty in this respect is concerned with the training of those who undertake a formal post-graduate course.  Could the Bill not go a little further than that?</P>
    <P>Most professions provide a service to their members in keeping them up to date with developments in their profession but the existing Medical Registration Council does not do this. In medicine, probably more than in any other profession, it is very important that people are kept informed of changes.  New treatment programmes come up as a result of research; new drugs come on the market and, worse still, there are existing drugs arriving on the market under new brand names.  It is very important that doctors be informed objectively as to the worth of these drugs and as to the advisability and importance of new treatment programmes that may be discovered.  I know that doctors are the target of propaganda and of the advertising campaigns of the wealthy drug industry. I stand to be corrected on this, but I believe that a doctor's main source of information about new drugs comes either from the drug industry itself&mdash; which has a strong interest in the matter&mdash;or from medical periodicals. It has been said&mdash;I am not going to say that it is true&mdash;that medical periodcals are likely to be subjected to some influence by the drug companies because of the tremendous amount of money they derive from advertising revenue.  I am not suggesting that any Irish medical periodicals actually respond to such influence but it is important that we bear in mind that the dice are loaded so far as the purveyors of medical information are concerned.  It is important that <Col N="347" /> some totally independent agency, like the Medical Council, are charged with the responsibility of keeping members of the medical profession informed objectively about new drugs, new treatment programmes and, generally, keeping doctors up to date on developments that take place in research.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the establishment of the postgraduate medical and dental board.  I was pleased with the Minister's remarks to the House on this because a lot of concern was expressed amongst various outside medical and dental interests that this had suddenly appeared at the dying stages of the Bill's passage through the Dáil.  I am pleased that the Minister is willing to consider and sponsor amendments to section 40 and the following sections concerned with this board.  I know he has been in touch with many of these boards and I hope the consultations he had with them have borne fruit and that we will see some changes in these sections.</P>
    <P>The next Part of the Bill deals with fitness to practise, a very important aspect of the work of any governing body of any profession.  The Minister has said that professions have the privilege of governing themselves but that privilege is chargeable with great responsibility because they must ensure that the members act with a certain conduct and standards that befit the profession.  Like other professions, probably even more so in medicine, doctors can do great damage if their standards are not sufficiently high.  We have been extremely lucky here in that the practice and profession of medicine has been extremely high, but it must never be forgotten that the conduct of a tiny minority of misguided practitioners could do untold harm not only to the reputation of the profession but to the public.</P>
    <P>I have already referred disapprovingly to the suggestion that the 1927 Act stood the test of time.  In respect of disciplinary matters, the 1927 Act was a cod and has been a cod for a number of years.  There is some evidence that malpractice of a few doctors could have serious consequences for the <Col N="348" /> public.  About 12 months ago an article was published by the medical correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i> in which he outlined the difficulties that had been encountered by the profession and the public because some doctors were misconducting themselves.  I regard this matter as extremely serious but I understand nothing has since been done about it.  I know there have been reports about it since.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to this problem and ask for the Minister's comments on it.  Doctor Nowlan's article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, of 23 February 1977, stated:</P>
    <P>The activities of 12 family doctors &mdash;eight in Dublin, four in Cork&mdash; are threatening the very existence of one of the addiction treatment programmes run by the National Drugs Advisory Centre.  They are also exposing the community at large to the risk of a relative explosion in the still small number of drug addicts.</P>
    <P>The article went on to detail, in a very comprehensive fashion, the problems they were concerned with, the damage being done by these practitioners and how the problem might be overcome.  It was written in the hope that the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Bill, which was going through the House at the time, would help curb the problem and would give power to somebody to try to put a stop to this malpractice.</P>
    <P>In an editorial published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 30 November 1977, under the heading, &ldquo;Rogues in the Herd&rdquo;, the opening paragraphs read:</P>
    <P>It is nine months since this newspaper carried a report drawing public attention to the fact that a small number of doctors in Dublin and Cork were prescribing addictive drugs more or less on demand for young drug abusers.</P>
    <P>That report was carried not out of any desire for public alarm or sensationalism, but because a number of experts close to the problem of drug abuse in this country&mdash; doctors, pharmacists, Garda officers and health officials&mdash;were deeply concerned about the potential for disaster which lay in this pernicious form of medical malpractice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> It has been shown in Britain that only a hnadful of doctors, either avaricious or woefully misguided, had been responsible for the relative explosion of lethal drug addiction during the Sixties in that country. Their malpractice was virtually identical to what a few doctors in this country have been doing.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Oireachtas passed a useful new Misuse of Drugs Bill, but the provisions of that Act have still not been activated, pending the drafting of appropriate Ministerial regulations.  It is time that those provisions were implemented.</P>
    <P>So far as I am aware, no regulations have yet been made, or certainly have not been published.  Can the Minister report progress in that matter?  It is not entirely desirable that we should have to rely on some agency under the Misuse of Drugs Act to quell a problem like this.  The responsibility for control of members of a profession must lie with the governing body of that profession.  I am not going to blame the existing Medical Registration Council for failure in this respect because they have had difficulties.  The provisions for discipline in the 1927 Act were rigid and are of very little use for application in medical life today. In addition, the existing Medical Registration Council have suffered the same difficulties as other professional governing bodies have with regard to the constitutionality of their actions when functioning as a quasi-judicial body, which is what they do when they sit in judgment on a colleague.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are welcome. There are a couple of small points that concern me and a couple of improvements could be made but I am very concerned about malpractice, small and all as it is.  It is a matter of very serious concern.  I hope we do not have to wait for the passage of this Bill and the establishment of the new Medical Council before a stop can be put to this serious matter.  It is a pity, when speaking on a Bill such as this, that it is necessary for me to highlight the small number of doctors who have been misbehaving themselves. I come from a family in which there are a number of general practitioners <Col N="350" /> and I know that the work which general practitioners, particularly rural family doctors, have contributed to society has been enormous. I know that the work of medicos here at every level has been unselfish and it is proper that they be complimented on their work and I should like in this small way to pay tribute to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill and particularly the proposal to set up this new Medical Council.  Like Senator Molony, I express the hope that consumer interests be given representation on it.  When the Health Act was being considered some seven years ago, I was one of many people who strongly opposed the presence of doctors on health boards. I felt they would be biased in their approach, particularly doctors employed by health boards.  Having served on a health board since its inception, and been chairman of it for a number of years and currently chairman of a hospital executive, I was very wrong in what I claimed seven years ago.  It is obvious to most people that the success of health boards has been due to a great degree to the contribution the medical profession has made to them.  However, if we had only doctors on health boards I do not think they would have been very successful.  The lay people on the boards have made very useful contributions and have contributed in no small manner to the success of these boards.</P>
      <P>On the new Medical Council I hope there will be some lay people to look after the consumers' interests.  The Minister has said that the main purpose of this council is to control the discipline of the profession and the education at undergraduate and post-graduate levels.  As far as discipline is concerned one must consider that when there are complaints against doctors they generally involve lay people and for that reason I hope some voice will be given to them when this council is established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the new Medical Council will investigate some abuses that are occurring as far as the medical profession <Col N="351" /> are concerned.  One is the indiscriminate issuing of medical certificates.  Most of us must agree that medical certificates for days off work are the easiest thing to get.  As a result we are suffering in industry, the civil service and so on.  We are losing a tremendous number of working days. I would like to see a situation here where there would be some form of inspection.  An employer, if he or she suspects that a medical certificate has been issued wrongly to an employee, should have the right to call in a department inspector for a second opinion.  If this was done doctors would be slower to issue medical certificates and patients would be slower to look for them.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see the new Medical Council doing something about the over-prescribing of drugs and medicines.  Most of our GPs are completely over worked and the easiest way of getting a patient out of his or her surgery is to prescribe some medicine.  It has reached a stage where drugs are implanted in people's minds, they read advertisements in the papers every day, and see them on television and they are indoctrinated into believing that unless they get some form or drug their ailment cannot be cured.  I am of the opinion that the over-advertising of drugs and medicines presents as serious a problem, almost, as that of alcohol and cigarettes.  I hope that the council instead of recommending refresher courses for doctors, will make them compulsory at least once every five years.  With changing times it is absolutely essential for doctors to have refresher courses.</P>
    <P>The main point that should be dealt with is the over-working of general medical practitioners.  We find, particularly in rural Ireland, that doctors are completely overloaded.  Many of them take on partners and extend their practice but nevertheless the situation is that a doctor spends five or six hours in his or her surgery before attending to calls.  A lorry driver is not allowed to drive more than eight hours a day and I presume the reason is that he has his own life and the life of others <Col N="352" /> in his hands.  But a doctor may work for 20 hours a day without any curtailment whatsoever.  Surely a doctor is responsible for life and death every hour of the day.  Something must be done about this.  The panels of some doctors are very high and the Medical Council in the first instance should instigate an investigation, a simple matter to do through the payments board.  They would then know exactly how many hours a day a doctor works from the fees he claims and from the times he claims them.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Medical Union should be consulted before an extra doctor is allowed into the general medical service.  I am not aware of the Medical Union ever opposing an extra doctor being admitted into the service but, apparently, if they oppose that appointment the health boards may not agree to the extra doctor. That is wrong and it should be investigated.  I hope the officials the Minister talked about appointing to this council will be lay people.  The officials of health boards have proved to be very independent minded and in the main are very successful.  If doctors are appointed as officials to the council there is a danger that the whole council will be one-sided.</P>
    <P>When the new consultant register is drawn up the Medical Council will have another important role to play. They will be in a position to recommend to undergraduates which field to specialise in, particularly the fields where there is a grave scarcity at the moment.  In the hospital in my constituency we have been looking for a radiologist for two years.  We have advertised in most medical magazines in the world but have failed to get one. There are also vacancies in ENT and in orthopaedics.  There are many specialist fields that undergraduates should be encouraged to go into.  This is something that the Medical Council can do when this register is compiled.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that the Medical Council will also be in a position to control consultants' fees.  At the moment the public have no way of knowing what a consultant may charge. This is very wrong.  This has been a hobby-horse of mine for many years. <Col N="353" /> In 1960 there was a limit to what a consultant could charge&mdash;£25.  In 1961 the limit was increased to £30 and a short time later it was abolished altogether.  We now have a situation that a consultant may charge a patient whatever he or she wishes.  Recently, a consultant told me that his fee to a private patient was entirely a matter between himself and the patient.  I feel that when a consultant has the use of a hospital provided by the State and the use of staff paid for by the State, there should be some control of some kind.  In country hospitals a charge of £150 to £200 for a few days in hospital is astronomical and it is wrong.  I hope when this new Medical Council are in operation they will have a look at consultants' fees.</P>
    <P>I would like to finish by expressing the hope that the Minister has a long and successful reign as Minister for Health&mdash;one of the most important ministeries in the country.  I am very glad to see him back in the House and knowing his record I know he will add a new dimension to his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to start where Senator McGlinchey left off.  I am not sure if the Minister has been in the Seanad before&mdash;if he has I have missed him&mdash;but this is the first time I have had the opportunity of welcoming him. It occurred to me to speculate aloud as to whether he would wish himself a long reign as Minister for Health. He would certainly wish himself a successful one and we all wish him that.  On this first occasion I certainly want to add my voice of congratulations and good wishes.</P>
      <P>What I have to say will be made up of two separate parts.  The first is a rather piecemeal set of comments on the Bill.  I see from the debate as it is taking place in the Seanad and also looking at the Dáil Report that inevitably the debate has brought in other issues.  There are indeed such sections as section 69 of the Bill which permit us to range a little more widely, not in my case in a completely undisciplined way, over the whole question of the role of the medical profession in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make some points <i>seriatim</i><Col N="354" /> about the Bill.  I want to add my voice to those voices which have have urged the Minister in making up the council of 25 persons to use the four persons appointed by the Minister, at least three of whom &ldquo;(i) shall not be registered medical practitioners, and (ii) shall, in the opinion of the Minister, represent the interests of the general public&rdquo;.  I am glad to see that there.  It is not mandatory.  They may or may not be doctors.  I hope that the Minister will ensure that there is the voice of non-medical persons on the Medical Council.  It is perfectly possible to pick people of such general goodwill, intelligence, knowledge of our society and moral intellectual stature who in no way would inhibit or damage the work of the council but would bring a necessary point of view from outside.</P>
    <P>Reputable professions regulate themselves and regulate themselves well. The veterinary context is extremely similar.  Within reason, it seems appropriate that the medical profession ought to do so.  I do not think that the demand for self-regulation by professions ought to be pushed by them to the stage of refusing at least the scrutiny of outside persons who are carefully selected.  I do not think that when a profession considers the cost of contribution that could be made from properly selected outside persons that they in fact would object to them. I hope that my voice, added to the voices of others, will do something to encourage the Minister to choose persons who are not doctors.</P>
    <P>I am skipping to the question of the duties of the council.  There is one aspect of this which I have thought about for many years.  I have thought about it in the context that before turning to the veterinary course I did the pre-veterinary year in UCD, in the mid-forties, in a very large class of some 300 people.  I remember going back in the mid-sixties to find out where they were.  Very, very few were in Ireland.  That was at a time when our third level education was starved for funds; when certain sectors of it were not funded at all, for example, in agricultural engineering.  We were then turning out very many doctors <Col N="355" /> for export.  By the time someone has been through first, second and third level education culminating in a medical degree&mdash;it is very hard to put a figure on it off the top of one's head &mdash;there must be an investment of between £30,000 and £40,000 in that person.  Most of the investment nowadays is by the State, though some obviously is by the family.</P>
    <P>It is not a practical proposition to say to the Medical Association: &ldquo;regulate their numbers&rdquo;, nor is it a practical proposition to say it to the medical schools because they are in the gross business and they will never say: &ldquo;we should limit our intake&rdquo;. They are delighted to get all the students they can get.  It seems that the supreme body of the profession, particularly in the context of the EEC and free movement, ought to look at this question.  If my approximate figure of, say, £40,000 total investment in the individual is correct, the emigration of 25 graduates represents £1 million.  It is not as much as it used to be, obviously, but we are still into significant amounts of money in relation to the total funding of third level education.</P>
    <P>One function of the council should be the use, not of medical people because they are not the people to do it, of economists, sociologists and people like that, to try to make some estimates about numbers and then to try, not in a draconian way but in a rather more long term way, to guide the production of graduates so that it more nearly approximates to the national need.  I say that in the context of the EEC because it is very unlikely, with the structure of incomes in the nine Community countries, that we will see large numbers of Germans, Belgians or Danes or even British people coming to put their plates up in Ireland. It is very unlikely, even if the cultural barriers, the language barriers or the income barrier, were not too great that they will move in that direction.  There is a real possibility that we, as the poorest country of the Nine, would be producing some of the doctors to service the richer countries at our expense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> Senator McGlinchey spoke about the difficulty of getting a radiologist in County Donegal.  That may not be from an absolute shortage but because of the movement of people to areas where pay is higher.  We have to look at ways of seeing that our people are catered for first and that we do not produce very large numbers for export.  If we leave aside the estimate of £40,000 of total cost and say that in the university years there has been something like £10,000 of public money invested in the person then the question can seriously be asked whether they intend to emigrate and practise in another country and if so should they not make some sort of reparation over a reasonable period to the State which invested that much money in them and which will get no return from them if they emigrate.</P>
    <P>In regard to the loosening of our ties with the United Kingdom in an EEC context this is two sided.  First, because those ties have consisted of personal knowledge, friendship, place of study and so on, they go far beyond their past statutory basis.  They will not be broken so easily anyway.  We have the language basis for maintaining them closely.  In fact, what we have gained from a close association with Britain we have lost by being insulated by Britain from the Continent because, to some extent, the excellence of new medicine is a function of the welfare society and it is the richest countries that have the largest volume of the best work, America, Germany, France and so forth.  I hope that the loosening of the ties with the UK will be compensated for by a much greater closeness of contact with the other strands of European medicine which has had such a remarkable history.  Indeed, it might be a function of the council to look into the question of the general education of graduates, the question of a second language in a specialist sense up to a level that they can freely participate in the medical developments of France, Germany or some other Community country.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I understand, has accepted the suggestion to establish a separate post-graduate medical and dental board.  That is wise because the <Col N="357" /> task of a council is a different task from a post-graduate board.  They are sufficiently different that if they were both to be incorporated into a single organisation it would produce inefficiency.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of a post-graduate medical and dental board I would like to make a few observations. I will talk in general terms a little later about the characterisation of the medical profession as it was carried out in the Dáil by Deputy Noel Browne and the response made to him by the Minister when winding up the Second Stage of the Bill.  Whatever we think of medicine we have to be fairly dissatisfied with the dental situation in this country. Dentistry is so technologically related and so rapidly changing that if you do not have very good post-graduate structures, both for retraining people and for pushing out the new techniques and the new materials, you simply are not in line with available knowledge and practice and you have an unacceptable level of dental service.</P>
    <P>In a very rapidly changing context, with the entire pharmaceutical industry and the medical physics industry and all the other new industries related to the medical and dental professions that have grown up, all producing exceedingly rapid changes, as well as the burden of research inside medicine and dentistry themselves, the structuring of both post-graduate studies and the concept of life-long study for practitioners is extremely important.  Therefore I think the separation is right.  I compliment the Minister on doing this.</P>
    <P>I want to disagree a little with Senator Molony.  He talked about a looseness in regard to the register, I say this as a member of a different profession, the veterinary profession, that where two trends, as in medicine, as in dentistry, are to be distinguished &mdash;especially in the medical and veterinary areas&mdash;there are the people who want to tighten the register very much to limit those who may practise.  In our society, traditionally, anyone who thinks he can do mankind good and if he can persuade people to come and pay him for doing it, may offer to heal people.  That is a basic liberty that I do not wish to see restricted too much.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the history of medicine, <Col N="358" /> admirable and high-minded as it is in many ways, one sees the most ferocious resistance, on the part of what you might call the official medical profession, over and over again to innovation.  A time comes when revolution and the innovation of the past become the orthodoxy and indeed, the codified, sterile orthodoxy of today. Let us always keep rules for the fringe people.  I do not know, for example, how acupuncture works.  On the face of it, I do not know that I have ever seen anybody indicating how it works. There are lots of things in orthodox medicine that are pretty magical still and it is not yet totally a science.  It is an art and a science.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator misunderstands my point.  I was referring to the tightening up of the register as it stood for registered medical practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Senator's correction.  I will go on to make the wider point.  I think that certainly one needs a rigorous register but one has to be careful that it is not ever used in a restrictive way or in a way that denies a basic liberty.  I do not want to see the medical profession too closed as a profession.  I do not want to see anything that will restrict the liberties of people who are high-minded, serious people in the fringe area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want also to follow up a thought of Senator McGlinchey.  I remember a time, at the beginning of my awareness and participation in politics, 30 or more years ago, when the question of a public health service supported by public funds was a very hot issue and when the majority of the medical profession who were then profoundly hostile to it.  One has seen in the interval almost a 180 degrees change of direction on the part of the profession because they see two things.  Part of this conversion is high-minded and for the best possible reasons.  It is simply impossible to practise medicine now without enormous state subventions.  Part of it is cynical and opportunist because people find an opportunity to build a monument to themselves with public money.  I say this as someone <Col N="359" /> passionately concerned with the very large funding of health services by the State.</P>
    <P>We are seeing an interesting thing happening all over the developed world.  We are seeing that a larger and larger percentage of gross national product is going into the health services. This is a matter for the whole basic attitude of the profession.  It is almost a moral, certainly an ethical, question for the profession because while that has been happening the actual levels of health have not improved very much.  The readily eradicable diseases have been eradicated. The chemotherapeutic revolution, the marvellous range and effectiveness of the antibiotics have happened and have produced some remarkable results, but we have a movement in opposites.  While this tremendous improvement in the area of infectious diseases has taken place and the eradication of eradicable diseases we have not seen a dramatic improvement in the health of the population.  We see huge amounts of public funds, large institutions, large-scale medical resources of personnel, money and equipment being devoted to preventing people from destroying themselves further than they are at present by the abuse of drink, cigarettes and food.</P>
    <P>I hope I am echoing the Minister's thoughts as I understand them.  It is surely a basic ethical question for the medical profession as to whether this partition of funds is right, whether, for example, the present level of giving certificates, to which Senator McGlinchey referred&mdash;I agree with him&mdash;is right, whether the level of drugs being prescribed is right, whether the extent to which the practitioner now is visited by the drug firm's traveller and receives his information and the drugs from the traveller and they pass with appropriate alteration of the labels over the doctor's desk and into the hands of his patients is right.  I totally support the funding for bricks, mortar and equipment, but we must ask if the existing bricks, mortar and equipment are being efficiently used.  It seems that the explosion in the scale of hospitals, the scale of equipment and the scale of investment, <Col N="360" /> the number of people coming forward now that they can afford to do so, for medical aid and the number of people available to give it has placed management questions on the agenda for the medical profession which they do not seem to be equipped to answer.</P>
    <P>I know of cases where horrendously expensive equipment, the purchase of which I entirely defend and the right of Irish people to have access to it, is being grossly underused because the management structure into which it is being inserted is not adequate.  While we must expect and welcome in our society the growth of spending on health, we must make a demand on the medical profession that they do more than repair the ravages of our stupidity in regard to smoking, drinking, food and the other things we now profess are destroying us.  They must turn in a much more fundamental way of prevention.</P>
    <P>I note in that direction that in section 69 the function given to the council of keeping the public informed on matters of general interest.  I can only add one more voice to those who urged the council to orient the profession in its basic ethics and in its education towards prevention and towards a rigour in regard to the use of the large public funds to which they are entitled, which is not currently evident either in regard to drugs or in the giving of certificates.</P>
    <P>We have had a rather savage characterisation of the medical profession from Deputy Browne, an ex-Minister of Health and a doctor all his life. There was a defence&mdash;I think it is fair to call it&mdash;of that profession in the closing speech of the Second Stage debate in the Dáil by the Minister.  The truth lies between these two approaches. Deputy Browne is angry and is venting anger on a whole profession in an undifferentiated way.  On the other hand, we would be wrong to be complacent. We all know that the GP who works far beyond any normal working hours and beyond any reward, works too hard.  He very often makes no money out of medicine; he charges very little and does not collect half his bills.  We know that that person is giving a noble service to the community. We also know the drunk in <Col N="361" /> medicine, the bigoted ignoramus, peddling the superstitions of his grandmother as contemporary knowledge; we know the shameful people and noble people.  This is perfectly natural inside this profession because this profession has more power than others to change society and is also a reflection of society.  It shows all the complexities, all the superstition on the one hand and all the belief and science on the other, all the greediness and all the nobleness, all the bigotry and all the altruism.  A blanket condemnation is no good because I do not think it is true.  Neither do I think that the general claim &ldquo;What kind people they are&rdquo; is good.</P>
    <P>Dublin, especially, has a very remarkable history in medicine.  It was once one of the great cities in the world.  We did not hold that position; we could not possible do so in economic circumstances.  To go on talking as if we still had a very remarkable medical profession in world terms is to deny the great progress made elsewhere and to become complacent.  We have a profession which reflects our society. There are some excellent aspects of it and some disgraceful aspects.  We have great opportunities now.  I welcome this Bill as being practical, constructive and a real step forward but we must not go on pretending we are still one of the great medical centres of the world.  We must not pretend that we have a profession which is much better than the statistical norm of our society. Neither is it worse.  It is probably a little better.</P>
    <P>We have here a framework for real progress.  I note that this Bill has been received with general approval and that the Minister has been willing to listen to those who make suggestions. The Bill will be the better for it.  Far from the Minister appearing indecisive in that regard, he has demonstrated nothing but an open-mindedness in his acceptance of some amendments.  In general, it is a very good measure but I hope the Minister will use his power &mdash;I cannot see how else it will be done except by the mechanism suggested&mdash; to open a little window to let the consumer and the public at large have a closer look.  I say this in the certainty <Col N="362" /> that when they have a closer look they will be reassured and that the medical profession, as represented in the Medical Council as a controlling body, have nothing to fear from such scrutiny and only reassurance to gain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to welcome the Minister. He has been with us before but this is his first time here as Minister for Health.  His is a very difficult and onerous position to hold in today's world, faced as he is with the natural and just demands for improvement and expansion of medical services, the pro vision of many medical facilities which are available nowadays.  We are faced at the same time with the enormous and open-ended spiralling costs which the provision of such services involve. I note that the running costs alone of a newly approved hospital in a neighbouring country will come to something in the region of £1 million per month. It is a 900-bed hospital.  That is the sort of bill which can be expected in future.  No doubt it will be more expensive when it is ready.  Therefore, the future for any Minister for Health is, an extremely difficult one caught between these two grandstands.  Nonetheless, it is also vital.  Our health is perhaps the most important thing we have.  I wish the Minister well.  I am very glad that one of the first steps he has taken in the legislative sense is to bring in this Bill which will help to lay the ground work for other advances. It is a fortunate fact that it is in itself a necessary and a timely Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in a situation in which the old relationship between Britain and Ireland with regard to medical registration and medical discipline clearly needed overhaul and reconsideration and, indeed, the corresponding committees in Britain and America had recommended that the formal link between us should be broken.  On our side we also consider that the time has now come to break this link, without, I hope, interfering in any way with the very good and close relationships which exist between the medical professions in both countries and, in particular, the very <Col N="363" /> good relationships between the medical professions in Northern Ireland and the profession here.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the procedure is with regard to a declaration of interest in this House, but I should perhaps state that I am a medical man, married to a medical doctor, a professor in one of the institutions named in this Bill and in other ways presumably an interested party. Having said that, I would like to say I am very proud to be a member of the Irish medical profession.  It is a profession in which we can take an enormous and justifiable pride in the sense that we have, as other Senators have said, many doctors in general and hospital practice who work extremely long hours and give very conscientious and devoted service of a very high order.  It has too an international reputation which is fully deserved.  We no longer are, nor can we expect to be, one of the centres of excellence in the world.  The time has passed for that.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, Dublin together with Edinburgh still retains an international reputation which stands extremely high.  Although we cannot compare with the enormous sums of money, huge facilities and great back-up support, that medical hospitals and medical schools in the United States or Germany possess, nonetheless, within our resources, we do an extremely good job.  In particular, we do an extremely good job at teaching. We still have an international reputation for excellence in our teaching. We have people coming from all parts of the world to the various hospitals here to do post-graduate medicine. As well as that, we have an international undergraduate medical school which is one of the largest, and I would claim one of the best in the western world and, indeed, internationally. We are very fortunate in this.  We take it very much for granted but perhaps this is a good thing.</P>
    <P>One other aspect I would mention is the goodwill towards this country which exists throughout the world in no small measure because of our <Col N="364" /> Irish doctors, nurses and other members of the medical profession who have gone abroad, perhaps for a few years before coming back here, perhaps with the missions, perhaps to settle permanently.  No matter where one travels in the world one is very likely to meet somebody who will say: &ldquo;Oh yes, my doctor is Irish, or the nurses are Irish or the matron is Irish&rdquo;. By and large, in fact unanimously, to my knowledge they give a very good account of themselves and thereby do this country a great deal of good.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget the prime purpose of this Bill which is, of course, the protection of the patient.  There are aspects which in effect give protection to the doctors and the medical men involved, but primarily it is for the protection of the patient.  It is with that principle in mind we should first of all examine it.  Here we can reasonably and justly say that the various bodies involved such as the various colleges, medical institutions and the Department have gone to an enormous amount of trouble and work and there has been a great deal of free interchange of information and a great deal of reasoned discussion.  At the end of it all we have a Bill which will serve the purpose of protecting the patient in the best possible manner. It is a very thoroughly researched and carefully worked out Bill&mdash;a Bill which was subject to careful consideration in the other House and people on both sides would, I think, agree that the Minister showed great reasonableness and a great willingness to discuss and accept amendments and suggestions, and in a very non-partisan manner, directed solely towards the benefit and protection of the patient.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the General Medical Act, 1858.  It is the immediate origin of the various Medical Registration Acts, but we should not entirely downgrade ourselves here because a much earlier Parliament, which was, whatever its defects, in some ways our predecessor, passed one of the first, if not the first, Act regarding medical education and fitness to practise.  That Bill was introduced in 1766.  It was a Bill for the erection and establishment of county <Col N="365" /> infirmaries and, associated with it, were provisions whereby the surgeons attached to the infirmaries had to have a certain degree of education and fitness to practice.  We still have the county infirmaries with us today and we can take pride in the fact that we were one of the first, if not the first, to originate the idea that doctors involved in treating people should have certain specific standards laid down for them.</P>
    <P>There are certain new aspects now in medical registration and education generally in relation to the EEC.  We now have legislation enacted elsewhere and the standards accepted by the EEC will be the standards we too will have to accept.</P>
    <P>I am delighted our Minister for Health attended the first and very much overdue meeting of the EEC Ministers of Health.  It was high time the Ministers got together because there are quite a number of implications both in health terms generally and immediately in a Bill like this.  We talk about maintaining the minimum standards.  Allowing for all possible bias, few would disagree that the standards of medical education here, the training and general capability are at least as high as those elsewhere in the EEC.  We must be very, very careful indeed to make sure it is not just a question of our measuring up to other standards.  We must have full input into any regulations or provisions mutually agreed through the EEC to ensure that not only our own standards are maintained but that the standards of those members of the other EEC states who will then become entitled to practice here, if they are not already so entitled, will be of a similar high standard.  There are excellent doctors in other EEC nations. I am not casting any reflection on them.  I am just saying that at the moment we have very high standards and we should make sure that they are not in any way lowered.  For example, there are moves in other EEC states to abolish the clinic examinations and one wonders, from a medical point of view, whether that is a very wise development.  There are many other similar matters which I hope the Minister <Col N="366" /> and his advisers will bear in mind when agreeing precise directives of the other states of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Turning to specific points in relation to the Bill, the council of the medical profession will have 25 members.  The Minister, in consultation, has obviously gone to enormous trouble to ensure that there is wide representation.  This representation must, of course, not only include the various medical bodies involved, the teaching bodies and so on, showing a geographical spread, but must also endeavour to cover the various facets of medicine.  This is extremely difficult to do satisfactorily because the corresponding body in the UK has, I understand, 98 members. Such a body would obviously be far too large but I agree with the Minister increasing the body here from 21 to 25 members.  Even then, there are certain difficulties and anomalies which arise.</P>
    <P>For example, under section 9 (2) there is the question of one person alternately representing the specialties of anaesthetics and radiology.  This is a very reasonable compromise in the circumstances, but let us bear in mind that they are very different specialties. For example, today the anesthetist not only looks after the care of the patient under anaesthetic in the theatre but very frequently he is in charge of the intensive care unit into which a person is taken when suffering from a coronary thrombosis.  He is concerned with some very acute and difficult ethical problems in relation to the treatment of such persons, in relation to such questions as life support systems, when one can turn off, at what point can one decide or agree that a person is in fact no longer living, that he is dead.  It may seem strange but it is very difficult medically to define death.  I understand that the legal profession have the same problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Theologically. We used talk about how long after death the soul left the body.  Once we could simply say that a patient had stopped breathing and therefore he was dead.  Now we know that the heart can go on beating for a few minutes and a <Col N="367" /> person may survive.  Then, for a time, people thought that the various electrical brainwaves indicated very clearly whether a person was alive or dead. In fact a person suffering from barbiturate poisoning is apparently dead because he is not breathing, his heart has stopped and there are no electrical waves.  But such a person can, within a matter of minutes, come back towards life and the brain waves can reappear and he may even survive.  It becomes very difficult to tell just when a person is dead and that has enormous implications when one is talking about heart transplants, kidney transplants and so on.</P>
      <P>Coming back specifically to the Bill and this section, I am not altogether sure that there can be full representation by a person from either anaesthetics or radiology.  We see the same situation in regard to pathology, obstetrics and gynaecology in the next section.  There are many problems&mdash; no doubt the Minister will be dealing with them in another Bill&mdash;with regard to obstetrics and gynaecology.  I am not altogether sure the specialties can be very conveniently put together. However, it has been stated that it will be possble to set up special sub-committees. I would hope that the council would do this to cope with any difficulties of the nature and ensure that a full input of information is available from all the various specialties, including some it has not been possible to mention.  Nuclear medicine is obviously one.  In the circumstances, the Minister has been very wise to give this little degree of extra flexibility, this increase in numbers, rather than keeping it to a very small body of 21 members.  I would agree also that, if you make it too large, it becomes, from a practical point of view, cumbersome and self-defeating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the idea of lay persons being members of the council.  This is a tremendous innovation.  It has been the custom for professions totally to surpervise their own professional bodies and this idea of bringing in lay people is a very excellent one, a very welcome idea and one which might well be extended further.  It is, perhaps, <Col N="368" /> particularly relevant in medicine that there should be this input from people who are not registered medical practitioners, who have not themselves got specific training in medicine, who are representing, as it were the patient. After all, that is what this Bill is primarily about.</P>
    <P>I would hope&mdash;it is not mentioned anywhere specifically in the Bill&mdash;that the Minister would take the opportunity either here or through the persons he appoints, or somewhere else in the council, to ensure also that there should be representation of women on the council.  It is a simple fact of life that the vast majority of the members of the professions, and certainly the vast majority of those in the leading positions, are traditionally, and for various other reasons, men. It is, I suppose, primarily the business of the professions to see that there is some representation of women but I would hope the Minister too would facilitate this representation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken powers to remove the members of the council from office and, although this may be in some way a controversial point, I think it is very necessary that a Minister charged with the duties and responsibilities with which the Minister for Health is charged should have this power.  I would take it that if it were ever necessary&mdash;I hope it never will be necessary to use the powers but it is important that they should be there &mdash;to use these powers any responsible Minister for Health would have some time limit in mind and would within 12 months, or whatever, reconstitute the council.</P>
    <P>To defray the expenses of the council, the council will be enabled, with the consent of the Minister, to charge such fees as it may from time to time determine.  I am not quite sure if Senators fully realise the implications of this or, indeed, the origin of it, but one of the reasons for the Merrison Committee being set up in Britain, with its implications for us, was the considerable dispute which arose when the General Medical Council decided that it would charge annual fees.  There is a considerable degree of emotion behind this <Col N="369" /> particular section here.  Many doctors claim that having paid the fee once for life they should be entitled to continue to be registered.  I think most of us would agree that in this day and age one must expect, and many other bodies expect this, to have to pay an annual fee.  Again, I am just a little concerned here.  I presume the council would obviously be responsible for ensuring that excessive expenses, which could conceivably arise, not only under various other sections but also under section 69, would be kept carefully in check or, if necessary, the Minister would keep them in check, because, clearly, these fees are intended in relation to the registration of doctors and the carrying out of the direct powers of the council and not for other diffuse expenditure.</P>
    <P>The display of the certificate is a very sensible idea.  Perhaps there is something in Senator Molony's suggestion of an annual certificate because clearly problems would arise if someone had lost his certificate, been removed from the register, or whatever. I am just a little concerned here about a small practical point.  Many doctors practise from more than one premises.  The section states that the said certificate be displayed at the place where he conducts the practice of medicine at all times during which his registration continues and at no other time.  What happens to a doctor who has a surgery in the centre of a town and is also practising from a hospital?  I wonder if something like &ldquo;a certified duplicate thereof&rdquo; or words to that effect would cover the point.  I would also like to know what happens if a doctor is removed from the register?  How will a patient know he has been removed?  Will the doctor have to return his certificate or what is intended in practice?</P>
    <P>The question arises under this Part III registration section that the national in any member state of the EEC will be entitled to practise in any other member state and this is obviously reciprocal and I am not aware that the matter has been thoroughly thrashed out.  The Minister has mentioned that one country insists that a doctor should be on one register only at a time.  I <Col N="370" /> just wonder how this would apply if you had a doctor practising along the Border areas.  We should be very slow to agree to any suggestion that a doctor in Ireland should be on one register only within the EEC at any one time. In France they get over this to some extent by the <i>presentation de service</i> which covers temporary practice, but this is very limited indeed.  It really refers to a doctor attending a patient in an emergency, a person with a heart attack, involved in a road accident or something of that nature.</P>
    <P>The situation there has to be looked at very carefully.  There is also the question of linguistic covenants.  This is coming in with relation to temporary registration.  I wonder to what extent linguistic covenants will be relevant if a doctor from the mainland of Europe comes here to practise and makes an error because of his lack of knowledge of the language.  Would he be reprimanded or otherwise dealt with under this Bill in terms of his lack of fitness to practise or should there be a specific regulation to this end?  I understand one or two countries would like to bring this in but I am not quite sure whether, under EEC regulations, it is possible to have any such safeguard.</P>
    <P>Section 28 (1) provides that:</P>
    <P>A person who has been awarded a primary qualification shall not become registered in the register otherwise than by way of provisional registration, unless he has been granted a certificate of experience by the body which awarded him that primary qualification.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent and necessary provision but, at the same time, it is not easy in practice to fulfil this provision satisfactorily.  What are the powers of a medical school over a given hospital as regards the interns? What are the powers of the medical school as regards the experience offered by that hospital?  What are the powers of the medical school if that given hospital decides that the doctor shall spend six months of his time in medicine and six months in obstetrics and none of his time in surgery?  What happens if the given medical body declines to grant the individual a <Col N="371" /> certificate?  I think there would be legal problems here to which the intern might well be able to turn and I would hope the council or, in the Minister's amendment, the medical schools, or the bodies given the primary qualification, could have little more power here as regards the certificates of experience they will not accept.  There is also the question of hospitals overseas. Do we accept the experience gained in a hospital in the United Kingdom or hospital experience gained in Canada or even further afield?</P>
    <P>The register for medical specialists is a very necessary and appropriate register.  There are very considerable differences here between the customs in this country and in Britain as regards specialisation and the customs which have been the norm in France, Germany, Holland and Belgium.  I am not saying that one is necessarily better than the other because the idea of specialists has been very much a European idea.  In this country we have tended to think about consultants and the two words are not necessarily synonymous.  I would hope that in practice it will be possible to work out acceptable arrangements.  I think there are many problems here facing the council and I am glad that the Minister has left something to be decided in the future without coming to any absolute requirement here.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy about one matter in the Bill.  Under section 34 (2):</P>
    <P>Whenever the Council takes any action pursuant to subsection (1) of this section for the purposes of keeping any register correct, the Council shall forthwith notify the person concerned, or his next of kin, as the case may be, of the action taken and of the reasons therefor.</P>
    <P>and we have notifications of change or correction of the register and so on.  I cannot help feeling that for such purposes it should be at least registered post rather than just a notification by pre-paid post.  I have known of at least one individual put off the register simply because of failure in the post.  There should be some more <Col N="372" /> satisfactory and firmer situation here. Perhaps the council will make it its business to do this.</P>
    <P>The Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board is a little unusual in that it brings in the idea of dentistry in what is really specifically a Medical Practitioners Bill.  It has been traditional that medicine and dentistry should in many of these matters be considered together and it is appropriate the board should be considered under this Bill. I understand the Minister will make certain amendments.  I fully understand the difficulties he has with regard to the appointment of members of the board and the necessity to fulfil many different requirements in order to have a satisfactory and comprehensive board.  I do not doubt this will be carried out appropriately by the Minister. It must be noted, however, that the functions of the board under section 41 will be extremely wide:</P>
    <P>The Board shall carry cut such functions, other than functions assigned to it by this Act, as may be assigned to it from time to time by the Minister in relation to post-graduate medical and dental education and training.</P>
    <P>We move on then to the kernel of the Bill, fitness to practise.  Most members of the medical profession and most people who have taken an interest in the matter would agree that this Bill is a vast improvement on the situation which pertained previously. It provides for far greater protection of the patient and, indeed, also of the doctor.  Previously the situation was that a doctor could be brought before the council only for the most grave cause and then the council would be obliged, in effect, to terminate the doctor's ability to practise by crossing him off the register.  Now we have the situation whereby, on the one hand, it will be possible to bring people before the council whose fitness to practise may be in some doubt, without anything very grave having occurred, for the council to investigate the matter.</P>
    <P>It will also be possible to investigate the situation where there may be a doubt as to the physical or mental ability of the practitioner to engage in medicine.  Previously in practice this <Col N="373" /> was very difficult to do.  It will also cover the sort of problem which Senator Molony has mentioned.  In other words, the spread of the Bill will be far wider.  It will give far more protection to the patient and, at the same time, the powers of the council as regards either punishment or advising or somewhere in between are so extended that it will be far easier for the council to provide an appropriate remedy to any situation coming before it.  Again, and here perhaps even more important, is the suggestion that when there is such an inquiry in the process of being set up the person who is the subject of the inquiry&mdash;I am referring now to section 44&mdash;should be given notice in writing by the registrar, sent by pre-paid post to the address of the person on the register.  Again, one would think that at the very least it should be registered post in such very grave circumstances.</P>
    <P>I note that the council will have power to decide that the findings will not be made public without the consent of the person who has been the subject of the inquiry.  This is necessary and correct but I am not clear how it will be enforced.  Will there be any powers of, as it were, contempt of court, or something of this nature, as there are powers as regards the production by witnesses of documents and so on?  I would assume that great care will be taken with any medical records appearing and that the confidentiality of such records will be fully protected.</P>
    <P>In section 46 (a), one can only be in absolute agreement with the situation there but I am a little unhappy about 46 (b) which states:</P>
    <P>Has failed to pay a retention fee charged by the Council under section 25 of this Act after the Council had not less than two months previously by notice in writing sent by pre-paid post to the person, at his address as stated in the register, requested payment of the fee on more than one occasion,</P>
    <P>It is a totally different matter to be crossed off the register or otherwise rightly dealt with, if the practitioner is guilty of professional misconduct, or if, for some reason or other, he is unfit <Col N="374" /> to engage in the practice of medicine because of a physical or mental disability. But to couple these grave causes so closely with circumstances which could merely be an inadvertence of failing to pay an annual fee within eight weeks or so of its becoming due seems to be a rather onerous section. I wonder if this is really intended?  If it is, I would hope that a procedure of making certain the practitioner has been contacted by registered post should be followed.</P>
    <P>There are provisions under section 46 (3) whereby a practitioner can appeal to the High Court with regard to the proceedings here.  This again is a very novel and welcome provision. In this case it is primarily for the protection of the practitioner.  My own feeling about the tendency of the profession has been that having once decided to discipline one of their members they tended, if anything, to err on the side of severity.  It is a welcome and indeed a necessary provision under our Constitution that a practitioner should have the opportunity to appeal to the High Court.  It is protection and, at the same time, it makes it very clear that in effect this council is a court in itself.</P>
    <P>Under Part VI, it is intended that the register should be maintained and published at intervals of not more than five years.  This seems very sensible when it is coupled with an annual supplement.  I would hope that steps would be taken to see that the annual supplement is published as rapidly as possible.  It is ridiculous publishing a copy of the register every year.  An enormous amount of unnecessary trouble was taken and it could be fully and adequately covered by the production of an annual supplement.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in the provisions of section 69 and particularly 69 (2) which states that it shall be a function of the Council &ldquo;to give guidance to the medical profession generally on all matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour&rdquo;.  It is necessary that there should be a statutory body which should have this particular power or function as one of its duties and functions.  There has been perhaps an absence at times of one given body in the profession with <Col N="375" /> this power&mdash;a necessary one which I hope and am sure will be used.</P>
    <P>Finally, subsection (3) refers to the following: &ldquo;...to inform the public on matters of general interest...&rdquo; I presume there are other bodies which will inform the public on health matters generally but there is something to be said for this.  The council tended very much to be an obscure body&mdash;and it is high time that the public should be properly informed regarding the functions and activities of such a body.</P>
    <P>I would have wished that there might have been some consideration &mdash;possibly it will come in one sense or other within the ambit of the council&mdash;of the relationship of the medical profession and the ethics of such matters, not only of the prescribing of drugs but the availability, manufacture and advertising of drugs.  Such matters, with particular relevance to one or two of the speeches today, should come within the ambit of the council, but perhaps that is not feasible under this Bill.  However, I hope the Minister will bear such a possibility in mind.</P>
    <P>There is a very ancient oath of which we have all heard, and it is generally assumed that most doctors take it&mdash;the Hippocratic Oath.  In fact they do not except in a few medical schools.  Nevertheless, parts of it are very relevant today, even though it was first formulated in 400 BC.  It is, &ldquo;The regime I adopt shall be for the benefit of my patients according to my ability and judgment&rdquo;&mdash;that is about all a doctor can do&mdash;&ldquo;not for their hurt or for any wrong&rdquo;.  Then it goes on, &ldquo;I will give no deadly drug to any though it be asked of me nor will counsel such&rdquo;&mdash;that is very relevant today&mdash;and especially, &ldquo;I will not aid a woman to procure abortion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a sensible and good measure.</P>

      <P>I wish to welcome the Minister to this House.  I welcome particularly the new emphasis on preventive medicine which the Minister is placing before the public.  I hope he sees contraception as a logical and <Col N="376" /> essential part of preventive medicine.</P>
      <P>The Bill has got a long and careful passage through the Dáil, which is evident from the Minister's speech and from reading the debates on the various stages.  There is a general determination to make this important council very effective and efficient because it will be with us for a long time In view of the investment which society makes in medicine and the importance of the role of the doctor in the community, this is nothing less than right.  I hope that my comments will be a constructive part of the debate.</P>
      <P>I was very glad indeed that Senator Conroy mentioned his concern that women would be included on this new Medical Council, not only under the section allowing the Minister to appoint four people three of whom shall not be medical practitioners, but right across the board.  I hope that the Minister, who has already demonstrated his goodwill towards the representation of women on public bodies, will perhaps convey to the various appointing and nominating bodies on this new council his concern that there should be an input from women in the medical profession as well as lay women on to this council.</P>
      <P>Women, as everybody is aware if one thinks about it for five minutes, are the vast majority of the patients, the consumers of medicine in this country, because every married woman who has children spends several periods in hospital.  Then if her children need hospitalisation she is the one to bring them, so that women have far more to do with the consumption of medicine in this country and, therefore, they need considerable representation on such an important body as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the Minister to a matter that has come up again in today's newspapers, even though I am sure he knows all about it already.  It is a small example of the importance of women on medical boards like this.  There is a great deal of concern about the plans for the new Beaumont Hospital regarding crèche and playroom facilities. Mothers bring children to hospitals. <Col N="377" /> There are very few women in a situation where there is somebody at home to mind the other children.  They bring a child who may be ill and, therefore, fractious, plus other children, to an out-patients' department and because of the nature of out-patients' departments they sit around for hours.  I see the great problems there are in having an appointment system working but nevertheless there is nowhere for those mothers to get the children looked after in any kind of comfort. I will add to that the necessity for crèche facilities in large hospitals for the children of the staff, men and women.  That sort of concern worries many women in women's groups and in the nursing profession and I would like to see outlets for that kind of social concern on bodies like the new council.</P>
    <P>It is an indication of the problem that in our maternity hospitals all of whose patients by the very nature of things are women and the majority of whose staff are women, the person in charge is called the Master.  What would happen if the person in charge was a woman?  Would she be called a Mistress?  It is an interesting speculation but it is an indication of what the situation is.</P>
    <P>Another feature is the fact that there is no woman on the council of the IMA, one of the results of that being the complete absence of interest in the whole question of contraception at the AGM of the IMA at Killarney last year when they did not turn up to vote.  I think they have failed the women of this country.  Certainly I think the medical profession has a great deal of guilt to bear for its treatment of women in that respect.</P>
    <P>My main area of concern with this Bill is, in fact, in the area of the post-graduate medical and dental education section.  It is an extraordinary omission. I have read as much as I could of all the Dáil debates and I have listened very carefully here today and nobody has mentioned the growing concern in Britain and the lack of concern in this country for the wastage of talent in the medical profession.  In Britain there is a growing debate on the fact that the number of entrants of women into <Col N="378" /> medical schools has grown every year. It has been paralleled in this country. It follows the fact that women could get into medical schools only less than 100 years ago but they have shown by both their determination and high standards that they are very interested indeed in being doctors and very good at getting through the actual training courses.</P>
    <P>I refer to the <i>British Medical Journal</i> in January 1978 which had two serious articles and discussions on this very problem, one by Peter Richards of St. George's Training Hospital in London and the other by Bernese Beaumond, MSC, on a survey of the kind of drop-out rate among female doctors.  These were carried out because the British Government became increasingly alarmed at the appalling drop-out rate from the medical profession of women when they got married.  If I might just mention one or two details of that, the figure I have been given for the cost of training a doctor is £28,000 per doctor, that is as it stands at the moment.  The majority of that is paid in direct grants from the taxpayer to the universities and to the hospitals. Some of that amount is paid by the parents.</P>
    <P>The British survey shows that among British doctors less than 40 per cent of married women doctors are in full-time medicine.  There was an Irish survey carried out in 1975 by Doctor Nessa Joyce which showed the figures to be slightly worse here.  Since there has been a dramatic increase since 1975 in the intake of women into medical school the situation must be much worse.</P>
    <P>The reasons young married women doctors drop out of the medical profession is a very wide area of discussion and I certainly do not intend to attempt to go into it now because I am sure I would be stopped before I started.  It would be a very broad discussion indeed and I think it is a matter for concern.  I would like to give one figure on this, that in 1976 200 young women and 226 young men entered Irish medical schools.  With the help of some medical colleagues and with the help of some figures I have worked out that <Col N="379" /> of the 200 girls who entered medical school in 1976 approximately 140 will graduate eventually.  There is a drop-out rate but apparently 140 or so will graduate, and I might add graduate with consistently high standards.  The standards of girls in gaining gold medals for various things are remarkably high and are equal to if they do not exceed that of the men.</P>
    <P>To train that class of 1976 alone, if my sums are correct, will cost us at least £400,000 by the time they eventually graduate.  That is not allowing for inflation.  It you look at the picture over a period of ten years&mdash;ten years from now&mdash;we are talking about £40 million that we are investing in the future of young women doctors.  That is not allowing for increased costs and is a very low estimate indeed.  The reason I am trotting out economic arguments and figures is that I know they have what is called &ldquo;man appeal&rdquo; rather than the so-called emotional arguments which I consider equally valid but I think we must take note of the economic argument which in these times is the most compelling one.  In my opinion the arguments of self-fulfilment for women doctors and their contribution to the general excellence of the medical profession are qually important considerations.</P>
    <P>I would like to say here and now that I am not advocating that mothers of young children should go out to work full-time.  Far from it; I am certainly not advocating that.  But there is a problem in the medical profession because at the age of about 25 when most young women are getting married and having babies that is the time when the absolutely crucial post-graduate medical training starts and is going on.  In Britain they have been studying various ways of tackling this by making a longer post-graduate training period done on a part-time basis for women doctors with young children.  It has been found to be very difficult but it is a special problem posed by the structure of medical education.</P>
    <P>I was happy to note in the Minister's document on social insurance for the self-employed that he mentioned <i>en <Col N="380" /> passant</i> a possibility of having to consider the ten or so years when a woman would be bearing and rearing children as an input into society and should not be penalised by losing pension rights and so on.  I would submit that this sort of problem in the medical profession is another facet of the fact that women doctors are discriminated against because they have children.  It leads to the situation mentioned by Senator Conroy that there are very few women at the top of the medical tree in this country.  Therefore, on all the medical boards and medical councils they are absent in large numbers. It is an inevitable trend that women want to do medicine.  It is considered that the introduction of honours mathematics as a requirement to get into the medical schools will be a very temporary check on the entrance of girls.  I have no doubt that there was some idea that it might stop girls at least temporarily, but girls are very determined to go to medical schools and will, in fact, get around it and do their honours maths.  When they do them, they do them very well.</P>
    <P>I would be delighted if this problem was under consideration by the medical profession but I am afraid there is no such indication.  The pronouncements of eminent medical men in the last year on the problem of the intake of women into medicine were very depressing.  One man made these comments when he was President of the IMA, the BMA and the Canadian Medical Association, all simultaneously. He said it was a very serious problem and asked what were we going to do about the problem of wastage of women-power and he questioned whether medical schools should consider limiting the numbers of women.  That would be both illegal and immoral.  He could not possibly get away with that and I am glad to say that one of the most prominent medical schools here answered it quite quickly and said they had no intention of doing that kind of thing. It is a very negative way of looking at this.</P>
    <P>More recently the Council for Post-graduate Medical and Dental Education published a report which was <Col N="381" /> most anxiously awaited and there is no indication whatsoever in that report that they are even thinking about this as a problem.  It is most depressing. This is something the Minister must consider when he is setting up a board like this and when we are considering whether or not the profession should regulate its own affairs.  We are paying for the affairs of the medical profession. The Vice-Chairman of that Post-graduate Medical Council is one of the people who made the remarks about limiting women going into medical schools and that is not insignificant.</P>
    <P>I would hope, therefore, that the Minister would bear in mind when he is appointing the 25 members of the postgraduate board the fact that the medical profession needs forcibly to have their minds broadened on this issue and indeed to tackle it.  I would very much like to see the medical profession being made to face this as their problem and not as a problem only for people outside the profession who are, in fact, paying for this wastage.</P>
    <P>I would echo Senator Keating's remarks on the conservatism of the medical profession.  For that reason also I was happy that the Minister did not entertain somebody's comment that in entry to medical schools they might consider the children of doctors if it came to a choice of having to pick suitable people.  What the person concerned actually said was that the children of medical fathers should get preference.  One must not perpetuate a middle-class medical profession or a conservative medical profession the way it is.  As soon as the Minister has set up his new postgraduate medical council which is terribly important right across the board, I should like them to set up a sub-committee to deal specifically with the problem of the wastage of the medical profession by the loss of the young women doctors upon marriage.  Something must be done about this.  I am not a revolutionary feminist; I hope that there are a lot of reasonable feminists, men and women, in this House.  Let us have a peaceful evolution with great benefit all round instead of conflict which only leads to wastage and annoyance generally.</P>

      <P>The vigorous approach of the Minister towards the state of the nation's health, and indeed his very real concern for the problems of individiduals, is like a breath of fresh air in the dusty corridors of the Department of Health.  I find the composition of the Medical Council interesting.  The Bill increases the number of representatives on the council from 11 to 25, nine of whom are to be appointed by the institutions concerned with the education of members of the medical profession, ten are to be elected by members of the medical profession and six are to be appointed by the Minister, of whom three will represent the interests of the general public.  It is a very interesting list but not a comprehensive one since there does not appear to be any provision for the inclusion on the council of a member of the nursing profession.</P>
      <P>I would draw the House's attention to the change in the Title of the Bill. While the 1927 Medical Practitioners Act seeks to make provision for the registration and control of persons practising medicine and surgery, this Bill seeks only to provide for those persons engaged in the practice of medicine.  Are nurses not engaged in the practice of medicine?  Of course the immediate answer is that they have their own representative board&mdash;An Bord Altranais.  But, are they not entitled to be represented on this Medical Council since the Nurses Act of 1950 which set up An Bord Altranais provides that it is an Act to make further and better provision for the registration, certification and control and training of nurses and requires that of the 23 members of that board, while 12 at least must be nurses, six must be doctors.  To say that the nurse in our community plays a very important part is to state a truism.  In fact, with the family doctor she is the medical profession's real contact with the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One notes the inclusion of psychiatry on the list of representative specialities. Psychiatric medicine has become to the layman, at least, a frightening concept for two reasons since we tend to associate it with the indiscriminate prescription of drugs&mdash;I am not talking now about the use or abuse of <Col N="383" /> drugs by young people, but the prescribing of drugs for conditions of stress among middle-aged people, particularly mothers.  I wonder how many of our social ills can be laid at the door of our urban planners who over the last decade have tended to regard the family as consisting merely of parents and children only.  In the last decade our urban planners have torn the heart out of this capital city.  They have uprooted whole communities and have sent them to live in the concrete jungles of suburbia.  They have taken away people's roots and, therefore, their sense of security.  This is completely against our traditions.</P>
    <P>I would like to digress, if I may, and quote from a book written about some of our early inhabitants&mdash;the Celts, talking about the institutions and way of life of the Cetic peoples of Ireland.  It is a book simply called <i>The Celts</i> by Norah Chadwick, published in 1970.  It talks about &ldquo;privilege and responsibility alike, rested on kindred, the Deirbhfhine, of the freeman, extending for four generations.  This tie of the kindred was the strongest of all their early institutions.  The kindred stood or fell together.&rdquo;  We have come a long way from that concept.  In fact, we have even come a long way from the traditional concept of the Irish matriarch telling her beads in the chimney corner.  We now tend to regard her as sitting in the chimney corner taking asprins while she is slugging gin.  Of course there is a great deal of exaggeration in both those pictures but is there not a small element of truth which might tend to make us stand back and regard the problems before we attempt to prescribe in a blanket form for them?</P>
    <P>Psychiatry is rather a mystery to the lay person because lay people tend to equate it with the treatment of the mentally handicapped.  That is, of course, a misconception and it arises from the fact that many mentally handicapped patients, almost half of those being cared for by the State, are being cared for in psychiatric hospitals.  They are there because there is nowhere else for them to go and this is because over the last quarter of a century successive <Col N="384" /> Governments have insisted on treating the mentally handicapped child as a latter day Peter Pan, as a person who never grows up, and have failed to make adequate provision for the mentally handicapped adult.  I hope the Minister will be the person to cut the Gordian knot of red tape and so allay the frustration of parents and of voluntary organisations who have been frustrated so long.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of spending more money, it is a question of spending what we spend in a selective manner.  I have digressed from the point but it does us all good to be reminded from time to time of the need to highlight the rights in natural justice of those amongst us who by the very nature of their disability are unaware that such rights exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I add my voice to the genial chorus of Senators who have welcomed the Minister to the House today and also compliment him on this Bill on which I have very few reservations?  Of course, the full length and breadth of the Bill will not actually be visible to us until we reach Committee Stage.  Like previous Senators I will confine myself, as is customary on Second Stage, to general principles.  The first one which has been touched on a little is the question of the role of the environment.  One of the most important insights that recent decades have brought home to us is the fact that medicine is not merely concerned with the curing of diseases once they have occurred.  In the past ten years or so it has been borne in upon us much more that medicine should be a question of treating the environment as well as treating the patient.  Very often the treating of the environment will preclude and make unnecessary the treatment of the patient.  Two vivid examples of that have occurred in the last two speeches.  Senator Cassidy referred to the fact that whole communities have been uprooted in the centre of the city and ruthlessly sent with their loins girt out to these jungles of concrete in the suburbs. That is one manifestation of an environment which more or less lays down a prescription for illness, <Col N="385" /> certainly for certain psychic instabilities which ultimately will require treatment which will require medicine in the old fashioned sense.</P>
      <P>Another example, which struck me as quite a brilliant example and certainly draws attention to the need for the female intelligence in legislation, was that whole question about the crèche in the hospital.  These things are very relevant to what this Bill is about, the crèche not only for the harrassed mothers who bring in sick children who are already fractious but for the other children to be kept happily out of the way while that child is being treated, very often after a long wait.  That is a human problem that it took the entire Dáil and the length of the Seanad to come up with when Senator Cassidy raised it.  There are important economic arguments lying behind the fact that we have so many drop-outs with regard to female doctors.  That is a very important point and it is also related to the possibility of crèches in hospitals.  It seems a very mundane thing but when one looks at it a little more closely it is utterly central to a larger concept and philosophy of what medicine is about. I presume that is what the Minister for Health has been doing in the past seven or eight weeks with his many vivid appeals to the community to regard health as something one has got if one is lucky and which one treats with respect and intelligence so that one may keep it and that medicine in the very large and most wholesome sense has to do with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently I see section 69 as being very very central to this.  It is the new section brought in and it is the one that I would urge the Minister to see carried through with every possible energy and vitality.  That section allows the council to advise the public with regard to health and direct doctors ethically, medically and in other ways with regard to the discharge of their duties.  For instance, it is a fairly annual event here to have the Central Bank issue various encyclicals to the public about how the money situation in the country is going and whether we should spend more or spend less, or borrow more or borrow less, this, <Col N="386" /> that and the other.  In other words, they sound off from time to time&mdash; I do not know if anybody listens to them but I am sure somebody does&mdash; but they issue these general statements, reassuring statements in some ways to show that at least somebody is thinking about the overall picture.</P>
    <P>I should like to see this Medical Council as reconstituted and particularly as acting under section 69 frequently issuing directives to doctors, to hospitals, the post-graduate and undergraduates area of the teaching operation and to the people as a whole about a whole range of things, not just the dangerous drugs, though they are very important.  We should be told about the tiny drugs that are not dangerous necessarily when taken in small doses, and about the whole question of environmental diseases as such.  For instance, there are very few of us who have not heard either at first hand or at second hand of workers in factories who have had their lungs destroyed by dealing with certain kinds of paint or having to inhale certain kinds of fumes.  These still exist.  I was recently at the funeral of such a man who died at the age of 40 leaving a large family.  At a certain stage of his life he worked in a factory where his lungs had been irreparably damaged.  It was a pitiful thing to see his widow and his young children, very young children.  Certainly that kind of situation arises out of an inadequate sense of what medicine is about.  This large advisory and directive role granted under section 69 seems to be one of the most important aspects of the Bill.  It will only be an important aspect if the council is chosen well, if the Minister insists that that its terms of reference demand from it action, energy, insight and frequent reports.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the Bill which is not quite clear to me is, suppose they want to discharge their duties under that section in a very radical and determined way will the money be available for them?  For instance, will it be possible if this council decides that it wants to secure statistics on certain diseases, recurrent diseases being treated year in year out in hospitals, <Col N="387" /> diseases arising perhaps from industrial situations or arising perhaps, taken on a mundane level, from accidents in the home, or arising from sheer environmental conditions, they will be given money for research? None of us can miss the fact that if one stands in Grafton Street for 20 minutes and the traffic has barely moved within that time that one is inhaling a hell of a lot of toxic elements with the breath of life.  Suppose the council decide to take on that role and pursue it actively will occasional money be allowed to it for research projects of that kind, for the collection of statistical evidence and in how far will its play be backed by the Government? How much muscle will it have if decides to issue directives to teaching hospitals, to general hospitals, to regional hospitals, to general practitioners with regard to certain recurrent diseases which are being foolishly treated in the short term but which perhaps could be tackled in the long term, as we have had to tackle such diseases as tuberculosis in the past? That aspect of the Bill seems to be very important, one which should be enthusiastically welcomed, but on the understanding that it is going to be something that will be more than just a directive or a regulation on paper.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of the Bill, a very important one also, is that which has to do with the general powers referred to in the Minister's speech, the disciplinary powers of the council.  The generality of medical practise here is admirable and is above most other countries. It compares extremely favourably with any countries near to us, but there are abuses in it.  As a matter of fact, there are connected with this, and <i>pace</i> Senator Molony when we come to legal reform, certain areas where there is a mystique surrounding the doctor, and the man of law, the solicitor and very often the barrister, which prevents the ordinary man-in-the-street from reaching him at all.  As an illustration I should like to mention that I know of a solicitor who is sitting on a matter relating to somebody's houses and will not put forward the documents for stamp duty for the past five years.  This man has already suffered <Col N="388" /> loss of interest up to £1,500. He has tried everything short of sending round a couple of &ldquo;heavies&rdquo; or getting in a few men with violin cases from Chicago to deal with the situation. He has no other resort.  Ultimately, he can apply to the Incorporated Law Society but he is loath to do that because even then dog tends not to eat dog in these matters.</P>
    <P>That creates, within the public mind, a great deal of suspicion and frustration. The ordinary person feels that he is not adequately equipped to attempt to bring a man in such a learned, venerable and ancient profession to book.  The means of doing that are very inadequate.  This is where we must again think carefully, and along the lines suggested by the Minister, because we have seen the opposite situation take place in America, and very rapidly.  Within about ten years there the doctor has become the prey to every nut who wants to bring a legal prosecution against him for maltreatment or mistreatment of a patient.  At present, the medical profession in America is terrified of the law courts.  They are afraid to prescribe.  They have to marshal an army of specialists around the unfortunate man in bed so that they can present a unified front when it comes to defending the treatment they have prescribed.  Of course, the assembly of that army has to be paid for by the unfortunate inhabitant of the bed at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>In other words, a situation has arisen where the sacrosanctity of the medical profession eventually was breached by an exasperated public and the result is that the last case is considerably worse than the first.  That kind of situation could develop in Ireland.  There is no sign of it yet.  The disciplinary powers granted and referred to in the Minister's speech are very important. I do not think they should be just occasionally invoked.  They should be frequently and visibly invoked, particularly the provision which is so admirably framed and states:</P>
    <P>The new council will, in addition, to erasure, have the power to suspend registration, to attach conditions to continued registration and <Col N="389" /> power to advise, admonish or censure a doctor in relation to his professional conduct.</P>
    <P>I should like to see those minor powers of censure and admonishment used.  If the public felt they were there and saw them being used&mdash;I do not mean that they be used in a draconian way or in a gratuitously punitive way &mdash;with common sense and frequently, not only would it correct the worst abuses of the medical profession from the point of view of practitioners but it would certainly reassure the public enormously.  It would head off the kind of dangers into which America has plunged.  I believe it is a very serious situation indeed there.  I am sure Senator Conroy could give far more vivid illustrations of this than I can. Again, that is an aspect of the Bill that not only we welcome but which we wish to see carried through genuinely on the ground, to coin a phrase of the late Mr. Faulkner.</P>
    <P>Finally, the only discordant note that I strike is in relation to the Minister's assurance regarding the 25 members for the postgraduate, Medical and Dental Board.  In his view there is no alternative to merely appointing them.  The Minister is a man of noted ingenuity and I wonder if there is not some alternative to it.  For instance, in defending that position he names a whole series of bodies and points out that there is a great range of interests to be consulted in the matter.  Would a number of them be allowed to put forward representatives of their particular interest?  In other words, instead of appointing the entire number and incurring the charge, which will be made, admittedly by malicious, misguided and unworthy people, that this presents the Minister with a spectular opportunity for the distribution of patronage, would it not be better to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are unpaid but people still like these jobs.  There are many people who are quite well off but like the kudos of being in such a position.  I am thinking of the general principle.  I have no doubt whatsoever of the Minister's good faith but I was <Col N="390" /> wondering about the kind of charge which could be levelled.  For instance, the Minister mentioned the huge proliferation of interests.  He named 15 different associations which are involved and which would have a reasonable right to be represented.  Then he named generally 37 other bodies which would claim such a right.  Clearly, there is no way in which all of them can be accommodated.  The Minister pointed out:</P>
      <P>It is my intention to see to it that all the major interests concerned especially the medical and dental schools, the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons, the post-graduate training committees, the employment authorities, the Medical Council, the Irish Dental Association, the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union are clearly seen to be represented on the new board.</P>
      <P>At my computation that is 11.  Would it not be possible for the Minister to grant to those 11 interests the right to elect or nominate one of their number and let the Minister nominate the remaining 24?  That does not seem to be an insurmountable difficulty. Surely it could be done.  As they are unpaid positions and as there is no reason why the Minister should particularly enjoy the job of appointing 25, rather than having some of them nominated by the relevant bodies.  I ask the Minister to think again on that matter.  He has signally democratised the council and it would be only worthy of that gesture if he were to carry it through on to this board for post-graduate training.  It is early days yet, this is only Second Stage and there is time at least to think about that possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those points having been made I should like to join with other Senators in complimenting the Minister on the Bill.  I was particularly struck by the daring and creativity with which he decided on Report Stage in the Dáil to make a change of course.  It seems to be a good change and one which has been saluted from this side of the House.  It takes courage to change one's course at that late stage when a measure is going through and in this <Col N="391" /> case that change is justified.  Indeed, his general posture with regard to his campaign as far as the public is concerned, is that every person is in a sense the custodian of his own health and that a great deal of the unnecessary burden being laid on doctors, hospitals and the resources of the nation could be saved if as a people we learned a little more discipline and enlightenment with regard to the entire treatment of our individual and communal health.  With those reservations I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo agus fáiltím roimh an tAire féin.  Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo ar an gcéad dul síos mar gheall ar a bhfuil ann agus sa dara áit, os rud é go dtugann sé seans do na Seanadóirí, labhairt ar chúrsaí sláinte, ar chúrsaí leighis, ar dhochtúirí agus ar dhochtúracht i gcoitinne.  I wish to refer to the following two sentences in the Minister's speech:</P>
      <P>This Bill does not aim at preventing anybody from practising medicine in the widest sense.  Most of us do this, to some extent, regularly, either by way of self-medication or by advising our families, our friends or our colleagues.</P>
      <P>How true and important that statement is.  As a race we have a longstanding interest in medicine, cures and health in general.  In fact, if all our proverbs on sláinte were brought together we would have a fair guide for the health of every individual, young and old, strong and weak, here and elsewhere.  One thinks of the sean-fhocal &ldquo;Is fearr an tsláinte ná na táinte&rdquo;.  There we have the very basis of the values, health is put before riches and wealth of all kinds.  It is the most important thing as far as the human body is concerned.  I am sure whoever thought of that particular sean-fhocal had in mind not alone health of the body but the health and well-being of the mind also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, we have a sean-fhocal for practically every sort of condition. Even the weakling will always be consoled by hearing that: &ldquo;Is fad saolach <Col N="392" /> iad lucht múchta&rdquo;, those who appear to be delicate and weak are often long-livers for the obvious reason that they take great care of themselves.  We have not alone a sean-fhocal but traditional cures and treatments for various diseases.  In fact, one is never short of finding anybody who can give a cure for any sort of a disease one has.  Even some of our surnames are derived directly from those who practised medicine hundreds if not thousands of years ago.</P>
    <P>In this context I should like to refer to Senator Cassidy's contribution.  She made a very important point as regards the traditional Celtic attitude towards medicine and health.  Some other time we may have an opportunity of developing that point.  We are indebted very deeply to the approach the Minister has been making already as far as the well-being, health-wise, of our people is concerned.  Those of us who have read reports of his speeches in recent months are edified by his approach.  He has given very sound advice regarding good habits and a proper attitude towards our well-being, physically, mentally and socially.  He has helped us to see such things as smoking and drinking to excess in their proper perspective.  I would not be surprised if, as a result, calls on doctors throughout the country will be minimised. That is all to the good because if we want to be healthy we have to know these things and practise them. It is good of the Minister to make these statements and we can only hope that more people will read them and act accordingly.</P>
    <P>There is a big responsibility on a Minister for Health nowadays because not alone must he look after his own Department but various other Departments impinge on his areas.  One thinks of the Department of Agriculture. Food from the farm is not exactly what it used be when I was growing up, because we now have forced vegetables and so on and various artificial manures are being used.  I wonder what sort of effect that will have on the food value of the produce we get. There is also the question of milk. Cows are being treated for all sorts of diseases by injections, drugs and so on <Col N="393" /> and one wonders what effect that will have on milk, one of our basic foods. I am sure the Minister has all those things in view but it is no harm to mention them.  I am sure he will keep an eye on those things and monitor them as he goes along.</P>
    <P>We also have the question of factories that could possibly cause diseases to the workers.  We had a case in Cork recently where there was a big hubbub regarding a factory where asbestos was one of the materials being used.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling, a Chathaoirligh.  I referred to those things because they have to do with health in a big way.  The question of environment comes in with regard to pollution and the question of education also arises.  In years gone by we had elementary lessons on health in our textbooks which the children understood. These lessons were always read by their parents and they had a very good effect.  In dealing with education I should like to commend the wonderful service being given to the schools. Under the schools medical examination, one of the most wonderful things we have, a special physician visits the school every three or four years.  The pity is that he would not come a little more often.  He examines every child in the school whose parents wish him to do so.  It has the great advantage that this doctor examines the child from head to toe looking for something. It is not a question of a person coming along to the doctor and saying &ldquo;I have a pain here or a pain there&rdquo;. He is being examined for that to the exclusion of something else which may be far more important.  As regards school medical inspection, a child is examined and the doctor is looking for something so that he can put it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsibilities of doctors at the <Col N="394" /> moment are indeed very great.  Great pressures are put on them to prescribe more and more drugs.  Indeed, in conversation last year with a young Italian doctor who had other views on healing I came to the conclusion that western Europe is probably oversaturated with drugs.  We become more and more dependent on them, and the great temptation on the part of the doctor is to follow that practice of prescribing drugs.  One sometimes wonders if there is over-prescriptions as far as drugs are concerned. There must be some other means of healing besides taking drugs to excess.</P>
    <P>I wonder if I would be in order in referring to&mdash;this concerns medicine too&mdash;the practice of what we call acupuncture.  It comes from the east; it is a thing that I think should be looked into.  This Italian doctor, of whom I spoke, practises acupuncture. His point&mdash;I suppose we must agree with it&mdash;was that we have not got the monopoly of ideas regarding medicine and healing in western Europe, Certainly the easterns have got something too.</P>

      <P>Ceart go leor. Go raibh maith agat.  We must practise healthy attitudes in life.  Health is, after all, everybody's business.  In trying to be healthy we can give good example to our friends and neighbours. The Romans had the idea right, like our own ancestors when somebody said, <i>mens sana in corpore sano.</i> That is a thing we should aim for. In the Gospel, I suppose, our Saviour seemed to be healing for most of His period on earth, certainly during the last years of His public life.  Here, we must pay tribute to the doctors and nurses, especially Irish doctors and nurses, for their great compassion and dedication to their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great pressure is put on the doctors <Col N="395" /> and nurses&mdash;the breaking-up of our social system was referred to by Senator Cassidy&mdash;to practise such things as abortion and euthanasia, murder at the initiation of life or murder at the end of it, put it which way you like. They are certainly standing up to the pressures and we admire the doctors and nurses for the great service they are giving.  We commend the Minister for what he is doing.

      <P>Any Bill which is for the protection of the patient and also the doctors is to be welcomed.  A review, such as we are given the opportunity of today, is certainly appreciated.  If this Bill is ultimately for the protection of both patient and doctor then the patient must receive first consideration.  It is, of course, in the public interest that there always be an adequate maintenance of high standards in the medical profession. There should be full credibility of acceptance of the medical profession by the public at all times.  Lastly, but by no means least, there is the question of public funds which means, of course, that the person who pays the piper must always be in the position to call the tune.  That, in this issue before us, is the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is giving access on the proposed Medical Council to people representing the interests of the general public.  It is a pity that his predecessor did not give that opportunity on the committee which was established to bring forward the recommendations we have before us.  I see that these recommendations have been adopted unanimously by the members of that committee.  Recommendations, when they come forward unanimously from any profession who sit to deal with any issue, always strikes me as being perhaps a little bit too good in the sense that the profession will not knock itself unduly.  It might well have been to the benefit of this Bill had there been on that committee some members who could be claimed as representing the general public interest.  We could have had certain <Col N="396" /> observations made by them which could have taken the form of minority recommendations before the Minister and which could have seen light in perhaps some amendments in the Bill before us.  I am not unduly concerned about the numbers that will be on the council.  Twenty-five members may well be proved in time to be on the small side.  There is a tremendous amount of work to be done by this council.  If they tackle it in the way in which I think they should they will find plenty of activities in which they could engage themselves.</P>
    <P>The question of communication between doctors and public and <i>vice versa</i> is vitally important.  This will operate mostly through the council.  A two-way communicational system, as envisaged here, must depend, on the part of the public, on a certain confidence that what they have to say will find its way through the council to the medical profession. There is great advantage for the medical profession as regards changing standards or changing medical environment, if the public are acquainted with these changes.</P>
    <P>We must always bear in mind that generally members of the medical profession and their patients come from different social classes.  This is something which is part of our history. There is in that difference in social classes perhaps an in-built reluctance on the part of the public to complain on occasions when they should about certain malpractices and certain failings on the part of doctors.  It is necessary that there should not be an over-respectful attitude on the part of the public towards doctors.  We have in our society something which in this respect we can be proud of in one instance but which brings disadvantages on the other hand when it comes to an open and frank communication between members of the medical profession and the public.  In regard to the question of communication it is essential that whatever language is used, it should be in ordinary layman's language in a two-way communication. Whatever is conveyed should be put in simple form that will not be vague or confusing to members of the public. It is important, in the interests of the <Col N="397" /> medical profession, that they should be conscious of this simplicity requirement. They should, of course, be always conscious of the importance of an adequate public relations exercise on their part.</P>
    <P>It is easy to write into any new system a complaints procedure, but largely how that complaints procedure operates depends on a number of factors.  The first factor here is that the procedure must be simple.  It must be quite open and available to any member of the public who has a grievance, be it a genuine grievance or only a felt grievance.  They should not in any way feel intimidated about putting a complaint to the Medical Council about a member of the medical profession.  If there is this over-respectful attitude, which I commented on earlier, or even this fear on the part of the public to make their own opinions and complaints felt, it breeds certain complacency on the part of the medical profession, which is not good in the overall medical situation.</P>
    <P>It is important that at the end of the road, as regards complaints procedures, the findings should be made public and be made easily understood by everybody concerned.  It is noticeable, in the case of any profession where complaints are made about it, that there is this public feeling that the profession will stand by its own members in the first instance and will always be reluctant to admit mistakes. That is wrong.  There is a great obligation on this new Medical Council to ensure that there is full acceptance of the medical profession by the public.</P>
    <P>The question of the registration of doctors is outlined in the Bill.  It falls on the Medical Council to be quite strict in the implementation of these registration procedures.  There have been instances where people who were not fully qualified were practising as doctors.  We had an instance some time last year where a health board suffered quite an embarrassing experience. It behoves the Medical Council to have very close liaison particularly with the health authorities to make sure this does not happen again.  Even allowing for all the constraints that are written into this Bill to ensure <Col N="398" /> that there is an adequate standard of discipline and an adequate standard of acceptability all round for the medical profession the public will still be a little reluctant to make complaints and to take to court genuine grievances they feel they have.</P>
    <P>We are a small community and we are all acquainted with each other. This breeds a certain reluctance on the part of the public to criticise unduly. Ultimately any advantages there are to be derived from the Medical Council will depend on the willingness of the medical profession to ensure that the regulations which they are given the opportunity to frame for themselves will be imposed and that they will impose disciplinary measures on any members of their profession who step over the line.  I welcome this Bill and I wish it every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Bill and to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and especially for the concern he has for our health. The establishment of the proposed Medical Council for clearly defined objectives is the direct result of an urgent need that has been developing over the past few years and will benefit both the public and the medical profession. With so many doctors and specialists engaged in medical activities throughout the country it is essential that their activities be co-ordinated and regularised in a modern and proper manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will update the law in regard to the registration of the medical profession as well as improving the disciplinary procedures and extending the powers of the Medical Council regarding education and training, especially in the post-graduate field. This is essential because of the immense problems modern medicine has brought into society.  One of the great problems of modern medicine is that the public can go into surgeries and acquire prescriptions for medicine or drugs. There are also major killer drugs such as ethyl alcohol and nicotine sold in a glamourised manner to confuse society.  I am sure that this Bill will control such practices and, which is <Col N="399" /> most essential, I feel the public should be educated as to their great danger.</P>
    <P>I welcome Part III whereby the council may set up separate registers of medical specialists, which indicate doctors who are trained to a level entitling them to be regarded as specialist physicians, surgeons, anaesthetists, psychiatrists or any of the other recognised specialties.  This is essential.  A person was employed as a house surgeon in an orthopaedic hospital not far from me a couple of years ago.  He produced documentation as to his qualifications and was registered by the Medical Registration Council.  Subsequently it was proved that he had no such qualifications for the appointment.  Fortunately he undertook no major operations in the hospital; I dread the consequences if he had.  I welcome this part of the Bill because I am sure it will ensure that there will not be a recurrence of this unfortunate happening.  I also welcome the part where the register will be open to the public for examination and that they will know who is registered, who is qualified and who is specialised in the different fields.  I conclude by welcoming the Bill and trust that it will benefit the public and the health of our country.</P>

      <P>I want, at the outset, to express my appreciation for the manner in which the Seanad has dealt with the Second Reading of this Bill.  Senator Molony, leading for his particular side of the House, set a tone for the debate that followed.  He welcomed the Bill and made some very useful comments.  His lead was followed on all sides of the House.  The contributions made by Senators were very helpful and very constructive and for that I am particularly grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure all the Senators who contributed that the points they made will be very carefully considered. I may not have the capacity to deal with them all by way of reply but I would like to assure the House that that should not be taken as any indication that they will not be carefully adverted to by me and by my advisers in our consideration of the Bill as it <Col N="400" /> proceeds on its way.  It will undoubtedly have to go back to the Dáil again because we will be making amendments here in the Seanad.  I am quite sure of that.  I will be proposing some and I welcome any amendments which the House may decide in its wisdom to accept.</P>
    <P>Senator Molony was concerned about dangerous drugs and the misuse of drugs.  I would like to point out to him that there is a National Drugs Advisory Board, which have the responsibility for disseminating objective information about drugs.  They test drugs and report on them to the profession.  I hope that this gives the profession a satisfactory service but if there are any ways in which they can be of greater service and assistance to the profession I have no doubt that they will carefully consider that aspect of their work.</P>
    <P>With regard to the newspaper article to which Senator Molony referred, I can only say that that sort of situation will fall in future to be dealt with under the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act.  As the House knows, that Act was passed by the last Oireachtas. It is a useful Act and I hope it will be effective in dealing with most, if not all, of the problems and difficulties which arise out of the misuse of drugs in our modern society.</P>
    <P>The present position about that Act is that a draft of disciplinary regulations under the Act is at present with the medical organisations for their observations.  I hope that that process of consultation will be completed within a month or so and then these regulations will be promulgated.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Keating, made some comments also which I would like to deal with.  He suggested that I should be very assiduous in selecting for the council persons who are not doctors.  It is obvious, from the text of the Bill, that in regard to the four ministerial appointees to the council, three of them must, by statute, not be doctors.  So, whether I wish to or not, the Bill will compel me to appoint at least three people who are not members of the medical profession.</P>
    <P>Senator Keating adverted to a fundamentally important matter when he <Col N="401" /> spoke about the intake of students into the medical profession.  That is something of very great significance to which attention will have to be directed.  I suggest that we have had enough discussion about it at this stage.  We should be talking now about what action we should take.  There is no doubt that in many areas the export market which existed for doctors has been closed in the US, Canada and other places.  In many European countries the situation is that there are too many doctors.  Of course, there are many new medical schools coming into being all over the world.  It is a situation which calls for careful and urgent attention.  It is fraught with difficulties and problems, it is a complex matter but it will have to be faced up to very soon.</P>
    <P>One aspect which we must keep in mind, and to which a number of Senators referred, is that we stand in a very special position in regard to the underdeveloped world in so far as medical education and training are concerned.  I see us having an important role to play in that regard. It is an area with which Senator Conroy, in particular, is very familiar and whose advice I will be very glad to take in dealing with it.</P>
    <P>Senator Keating also spoke about dentistry and pointed out that this Bill only deals with one aspect of dentistry, namely, post-graduate dentistry.  That is true, but we have on the stocks a new dentist Bill which will deal with the profession of dentistry, I hope in a comprehensive manner.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the total number of doctors in Ireland. For the information of the House, the number is about 4,000 and of those about 1,500 are general practitioners, 1,000 are consultants, 1,400 are junior hospital doctors and about 200 are public health doctors and community medical officers of one sort or another. Contrary to the general impression, general practitioners do not constitute an overwhelming majority of the profession.</P>
    <P>We are providing in the Bill a very adequate representation for the general practitioner sector of the profession on the new General Medical Council.  It <Col N="402" /> will also be my intention&mdash;I have given a firm undertaking to some of the medical organisations&mdash;to ensure that on the post-graduate training body, which is now being given statutory status, the general practising profession will have adequate representation. In regard to that particular body representation is of very great importance to the general practitioner section because, to a large extent, the post-graduate training will be most useful and most advantageous to the general practitioner.</P>
    <P>A number of matters were raised by different Senators which are more appropriate to other occasions.  For instance, Senator McGlinchey spoke about the failure of the hospital in which he is interested to procure a radiologist.  To some extent that is a matter for the new Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board.  It is more related to general health administration.</P>
    <P>I should like to make the point&mdash; perhaps it is more relevant to the remarks of Senator Hussey than others &mdash;that this Bill is pretty limited in its scope.  It basically sets out to provide a mechanism for the control, regulation, discipline and training of the medical profession.  Many of the points raised referred to health administration in general rather than to the actual control, discipline and regulation of the medical profession as such. Indeed, some of the remarks will have to be left over to be dealt with on another occasion, perhaps on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy made a number of points of that nature, I hope he will forgive me if I leave some of his more detailed points over for discussion on the appropriate sections when we come to them on the Committee and Report Stages.  He referred to a very important matter, that is, the question of co-operation between ourselves, the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. It is important to understand that the scope for continuing co-operation is adequate in the provisions of the Bill.  The education committees, which will be set up under the new Medical Council in this country and the new General Medical Council in the UK, <Col N="403" /> will both be able to have members in common.  In fact, the understanding is that they will.  That is where co-operation is of the utmost importance. The legislation in both countries is framed in such a way that these committees will be able to have members from each other on them.</P>
    <P>With regard to continuing links with Northern Ireland, the most satisfactory thing I can say about that is that the distinguished President of the Royal College of Physicians is Doctor Grant who practises with distinction in Belfast, so I have no fears about our ability to keep up the traditional contacts and friendships, professional and personal, which have always existed in this area.</P>
    <P>In so far as the EEC directives are concerned, this is something we will be talking about in much more detail as we go through the sections on Committee Stage.  I just want to point out that they are not concerned with the standardising of medicine and drugs throughout the Community.  They are more concerned with harmonising conditions for mutual recognition of qualifications and freedom of movement for doctors rather than medical standards.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps of some interest to recall what happened in the UK with regard to this vexed question of the retention fee.  We had considerable discussion about this in the Dáil.  It is interesting to note that once money and the payment of money enters into a situation the discussion can become quite intense.  What happened in Britain really was that the profession were not so much against the idea of a retention fee but rather against inadequate representation on a council which was going to impose retention fees.  Really what they were getting at was the old principle of rejecting taxation without representation.  I do not think that is going to apply in our situation because not alone have we our retention fee enshrined in the legislation but we also have a very adequate spread of representation on the council which will be imposing the collecting of these registration fees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" /> Senator Markey and Senator Conroy both spoke and, I think, Senator Keating, about section 69.  I fully agree with them that it is very important and a good thing in that context to emphasise good conduct or conduct as distinct from misconduct.</P>
    <P>I listened with very great interest to the points made by Senator Hussey and I am committed, as are most of my colleagues in Government, to ensuring that on the bodies for which we have ministerial responsibility we will endeavour to ensure that women play their appropriate part in the affairs of these bodies, these agencies or organisations.  I do not know whether any particular action is called for by me in regard to the Medical Council in this context.  What we want here is a council which will adequately reflect the membership of the profession as it stands at any given moment. Presumably then what we should aim at is roughly the same proportional women membership of the council as there are women members of the profession.  I would hope that, apart from what will happen when particular bodies are nominating members to the council, the election will enable women doctors to come on to the council in appropriate numbers.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to note in that regard that something like one-third of the medical students at the moment are women.  In one particular medical school more than half of the entrants into the medical school are women. Whatever about the immediate future, certainly in process of time there will be no doubt but that the new Medical Council, because of its representative character, will fairly adequately represent the women members of the medical profession.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey made many very other good points about the difficulties which women face both as members of the medical profession and, indeed, as patients or people coming to hospitals. I have taken a careful note of the points she made.  As I said about other contributions, these matters are more appropriate really to a general discussion on health administration than they are to this particular Bill. I assure the Senator, however, that <Col N="405" /> the points she has made of general application over the field of health administration will be carefully considered by me.</P>
    <P>Senator Martin made a point at the outset of his remarks which staggered me somewhat.  It is not strictly relevant to our discussion here but he used it as an illustration of something else he was talking about.  It seemed to me he suggested there is a process whereby people are being taken from nice well-established communities in the city centre and transplanted out into what he called &ldquo;jungles&rdquo; in the suburbs.  I do not know what his experience of these matters is but that is certainly not my understanding of what happens and I think it is a misguided way of looking at the situation. Most of us who in our time have had to represent centre city areas could not regard the old slum quarters of Dublin as desirable residential areas and certainly I do not think that, if the term &ldquo;jungle&rdquo; is to be used, it should be used in relation to splendid housing estates on the outskirts of the city but rather to the old slum areas of the former centre city.  We can go too far in eulogising the delights of living in centre city areas.  My experience in that regard differs from that of many of the people who speak about these matters today.  As far as I am concerned, the clearing of the slums in centre city areas and the transplanting of the people out into good, healthy and, in most cases, satisfactory housing estates was a very desirable and worth-while process.</P>
    <P>Senator Martin mentioned the expenses of the new Medical Council. The Medical Council will by and large provide its own finances.  It will finance itself.  I did give an undertaking in the Dáil, which I repeat here now, that if, at any time, I ask the Medical Council to carry out some specific function which is not within the normal ambit of their proceedings I will certainly consider making funds available for that particular purpose.  But that would be an exception.  In the normal course of events the Medical Council will look after its own expenses by means of the fees paid by the members of the profession.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> Senator Martin spoke about my nominating the membership of the post-graduate board.  He has a point there.  It would probably have been more desirable had we been able to devise some simple system whereby the various interests could nominate directly on to that board.  The House should understand the history of the establishment of that board.  It existed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and the Minister for Health nominated all the members of the <i>ad hoc</i> body and all I did in this Bill was confer statutory status on a board which up to then had existed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  I was anxious to do that because I was asked to do it by the bodies I mentioned in my opening remarks.  I did not feel there was any way in which I could accommodate all the different interests by granting them direct nomination to that board. Most Senators know that the medical profession is a very highly organised one in so far as practically every branch of every discipline has its own body or organisation.  There are the larger bodies and, when you come to the specialties, there are at least 40 different organisations representing them.  I recoiled really from attempting to devise some procedure whereby all the different interests who would legitimately seek direct nomination could be accommodated.  I think, as an experiment, what I am proposing is the best thing to do&mdash;to carry on&mdash; and that is all I am doing, carrying on the system whereby the Minister nominates this particular body, even though it now has statutory status, and see if it is possible by judicious selection to try to represent the broadest possible spectrum of interests.  Senators will realise in this context that, by a careful study of the situation, I could succeed by nominating a particular individual in giving representation to three or four different bodies and professional organisations whereas if each of them were given direct nomination I would be left with four or five people instead of one and the number of 25 just would not accommodate all those who would seek nomination.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there is some validity in the criticism Senator Martin made but, on the other hand, I have <Col N="407" /> succeeded in the course of the very mature and sensible discussions we have had with the various bodies and institutions concerned in satisfying them that, between undertakings I have given and amendments I hope to make in the Seanad, I will be able to meet all the fears the different bodies and institutions have expressed.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey surprised me by requesting that the procedure for making complaints should be simple. I do not think that they could be simpler.  Section 45 simply provides that any person may apply for an inquiry into the conduct of a registered medical practitioner.  It is intended&mdash; the provisions are clear&mdash;that the procedure whereby members of the public can lodge a complaint will be of the simplest possible nature.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey was also concerned whether 25 members on a medical council would be enough.  I think they will and, as I have said, at the moment they represent a reasonable balance and a reasonable spectrum of representation.  In any event, should that not prove to be the case, I have the power under section 9 (2) to vary the number.  As Senators will also understand, in the case of the committees the Bill provides specifically that the council can go outside its own membership for members of particular committees except, of course, in the Fitness to Practise Committee.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if there are any other points raised by Senators which call for general comment of a Second Stage nature.  On Committee Stage we will be able to pick up all the matters referred to.  Senator Cranitch dealt with the general concept of promoting positive good health and the dangers arising from various artificial aids and stimulants particularly in the agricultural industry and in farming.  I am glad he mentioned that.  It is not strictly relevant to a Bill regulating the medical profession but it is something which we will take note of now that he has raised it.</P>
    <P>Again, may I repeat that I am deeply appreciative of the manner in which the Seanad has dealt with this <Col N="408" /> Second Stage and I greatly value the important contributions Senators on both sides made.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking again on this motion concerning the various reports <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC.  I was speaking the last evening about the general position where the Community is concerned and the extent to which there is pessimism abroad.  Included in these four or five reports is the Tindemans report, the Belgian who composed an excellent report having had fundamental consultations in all of the EEC countries.  We must be very much in sympathy with Tindemans because his attitude to Europe is that of someone from a small country and we are a small country. He does not have the big power mentality like the French, the Germans or the British.  He is a committed European as are many people here.  In his report he attempted to deal with the very broad issues of possible economic and monetary union and the question of direct elections to the European Parliament.  He recognised what he termed the &ldquo;crisis in Europe&rdquo; and he saw his proposals as possibly helping in this crisis.  The proposals, in summary, were increased powers for the European Parliament, to start with, and an adequate regional policy which <Col N="409" /> effected a net transfer of resources from the wealthier parts of the Community to the poorer parts of Europe, something which has not even begun to happen to date.  He termed this the net transfer of resources.</P>
      <P>In general terms then, against a background of considering the Tindemans report, there is a great deal of room for pessimism when we look at what is happening within the EEC. I am glad that the speech of the Minister of State refers to this and adopts a really pessimistic tone.  The Minister of State refers to the economic and monetary position, states that it has been sluggish in recent times and that the objectives set of economic and monetary union by 1980 are now clearly unattainable.  I agree with that and, indeed, the language is not even sufficiently strong.  It is not only sluggish.  It has been practically non-existent because the major states do not see the European Community as we do.  They are still holding on to their own sovereignty to a much greater extent and they see the EEC as a tool to be used entirely in their own interests.  We saw all the problems of the economic recession caused by the oil crisis, the bilateral trading done by the various European nations with the Middle East and the practical breakdown of the sense of a unity within Europe so that economic and monetary union is an illusion.  I think it is very much in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was good to see the suggestions in the Tindemans report of increased power for the Parliament.  We are in complete agreement here because, presumably, when we reach the point of direct elections and have a directly elected Parliament in Europe, then with the increased democratic control and direct control by popular mandate from the people of Europe, it should help to get a Europe moving with more appeal for the people of these nine countries.  Again, even there we are running into all kinds of problems because a year or two years ago there should have been agreement among the nine countries on the date of elections for the EEC.  Due to the fact the British were not prepared, or did not have the will to be prepared, that decision, because of what might be described <Col N="410" /> effectively as a British veto, has meant a full extension of a year or 18 months before these elections take place.  Even today there is another mini-crisis over the siting of the proposed European Parliament. For many sensible reasons those involved in countries distant from the centre of Europe are not altogether happy about the position where the Parliament sits in venues such as Strasbourg and Luxembourg, which are not international airports and which cannot be reached in an adequate time.</P>
    <P>For many obvious practical reasons there is a consensus to a large extent that the headquarters should be Brussels but, despite that, we read in <i>The Times</i> today that the people of Luxembourg have suggested to the Government that their national interest is at stake and there is even a threat of a veto which would effectively put the European Parliament elections off for another year or two.  We have had a similar argument from the French where Strasbourg is concerned.  It seems to me the siting of the Parliament should be the interest of the various people who will be members of that Parliament and their convenience rather than the national interest of any one state.  I am merely giving the background to show the extent to which there is bickering and horse-trading and the extent to which the ideals of a decade ago are not being realised.</P>
    <P>Looking at the proposed extension of the Community&mdash;we are talking about a period covered by these reports during which both Greece and Portugal applied for membership&mdash; since the tenth and most recent report Spain has also applied for membership. There is a receptiveness among the Nine to the applications of the Greeks, the Portuguese and the Spanish and that receptiveness has been explained by the fact that there has been weak democracy in Greece, Portugal and Spain.  There have been Fascist regimes.  There have been many problems. In the long term it could be argued that the security of the Mediterranean and of Europe itself is at stake if these countries are not <Col N="411" /> shored up by the strong democracies of Europe.  But there are immense problems involved in the entrance of Greece, Portugal and Spain into the Community.  In matters such as economic and monetary union, such as the Common Market, the common argricultural policy, the regional policy and the need for the transfer of resources from the wealthier states to the poorer regions, there will be immense economic restraints and problems with countries such as Greece, Portugal and Spain, having regard to the poverty in those countries by comparison with the Nine.  Poverty in parts of these countries is much worse than it is here and we are the poorest of the Nine.</P>
    <P>The problems in economic terms for our country will be very great.  If, at this stage, we are dissatisfied with the slice of the cake we are getting in certain areas, such as regional policy, this will be compounded by the admission of these other countries.  Considering the pessimism there is <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC at the moment, it seems to me, if the larger states in the Nine were very serious and committed to economic and monetary union as a multiple of political union, there would be a greater reluctance to widen the net at this stage because the widening of the net would result more in a federal union rather than a closely knit unit and we would be getting further away from the closely-knit unit through the type of extension that is now happening, an extension welcome in political terms because of the weakness of those democracies.</P>
    <P>I would like to address myself now to the regional fund.  I am glad that the fund for the next two or three years will be at a higher level than it was for the three previous years.  We should not, however, get carried away by the extent of the fund.  In the three years, December 1974 until recently, we spoke about a figure of £540 millions but in the regional fund for the three years starting now we are talking about £1,200 millions.  It is slightly more than double what we were getting. We are talking about a fund three, four, five years after the earlier phase. If you allow the built-in factor for <Col N="412" /> inflation, what we are getting effectively is better but not greatly better than what we had been getting.</P>
    <P>Speaking as one who comes from the West, speaking of the kind of problems we have there, the single greatest disappointment where European involvement is concerned has been in this regional fund area.  We were a bit idealistic at the time of the referendum and we got this tremendously large vote in favour of entering Europe. This vote was largest of all in the western counties.  One of the strong cases in advocating that people should vote for membership of the EEC at the time was the fact that west of the Shannon we lived in that part of this country which has the poorest resources and the lowest <i>per capita</i> income. We knew, without being political about it, that successive Governments here simply did not have adequate funds to build the infrastructure to put in the industry necessary to stop the fantastic flood of emigration from which we suffered to a much greater extent than elsewhere in the country.</P>
    <P>We said Europe has this policy of what Tindemans calls &ldquo;the net transfer of resources&rdquo;, namely, a regional policy under which the generous Germans and the French and other countries were going to subsidise us to this very large extent and we would get this very large sum of money moving into places such as the west of Ireland and would help with infrastructure. People at that time were talking about a motorway from Galway to Dublin, which is as remote today as it ever was.  This was the kind of thing in the air.  The pittance that has emerged through this regional fund and the small extent to which it has helped has been a grave disappointment.</P>
    <P>To put it into perspective, the regional fund needed to be a good fund for the west of the country.  If we look at the extent to which we are a beneficiary of the EEC, the major area where we are a beneficiary is in the common agricultural policy, in which in 1977 we benefited through FEOGA to the extent of about £250 million. We benefited, indirectly, to the tune of <Col N="413" /> about £175 million for the higher prices for exports through EEC involvement and there is the enormous benefit to the agricultural sector of about £400 million.  But where agricultural policy was concerned, for European reasons and for broader reasons, we had all kinds of problems in the west <i>vis-à-vis</i> the status of the farmers, the development farm policies, and the categories into which many of our farmers could not place themselves because of the constraints of the size of their holdings.</P>
    <P>If we analyse the enormous wealth and benefits that came to this country through the common agricultural policy we find that, proportionately, a huge proportion went to the south and south-east and the other parts of the country where there is intensive dairying. A very large proportion of this subsidy went to pockets of the country which are now immensely rich and have an income beyond all comparison to what they had.  Where I live, our farmers are certainly much better off than they were, their income levels are better, their standards are better and their houses are better but in a relative sense the situation is incomparably different to that which obtains elsewhere in the island.  The appalling background of an inadequate infrastructure is there today as much as it ever was.</P>
    <P>Connacht in the west of Ireland, along with the Mezzogiorno in Italy, was the single poorest region within the entire Community and there has been no question of loosening the purse strings of the regional fund to get the money which should be moving into a region such as this.  I hope the Government in such an area will assume a fairly radical position.  We have been very idealistic in our approach, not altogether pragmatic at times.  It has been a good attitude for a small country to adopt but when we see the extent to which other nations go in to get what they can out of the fund in certain areas such as this we should be more vocal than we have been in the past.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that where the EEC regional policy is concerned the EEC state that they want to base <Col N="414" /> that policy on consultation with national governments, to knit their regional policy and their regional funds into the national government's policy in the area of the regional field.  I want to speak briefly again about a matter which concerns the west.  Presumably, we can expand on that in other debates here over the next year or two. As a Senator and as a member of a county council in the west, I regret very much that the Government made a decision to dispense with the establishment of a western development board which we sought.  It was tied into other matters.  It was apolitical in many areas, in that many people of all persuasions thought that this kind of autonomy, this kind of decision-making within the province, indeed within other provinces, was a means on which we should build the country in regional terms.  Additionally, had the seeds which were sown been developed and had that board been created it would have crystallised within the country the region of which we spoke and, in turn, could have led to the funding of much of its work by the EEC.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that where funds from the EEC regional policy area are concerned, it is in two sections. There is a section which contains 650 million UAs which is the normal section where we get the grants to the different states for different projects. But there is a second section of 100 million UAs which is roughly about one-seventh of the total kitty, which is about 13½ per cent.  That section of the fund is set aside for specific Community action, specific Europe-wide policies, as conceived by the Commission which could be allocated in specific areas.  It seems that the development of the board about which I have been speaking would have crystallised within the country a new pressure group for funds from this other source, for example, in Europe. I hope that if we speak in a rational manner about matters concerning regional policy over the next year or two the Government will listen to what many people will say, and, hopefully, there may be a rethink about that particular area.</P>
    <P>The other area in which there have <Col N="415" /> been decisions by the Government in the area of regional policy was the decision made to examine what we call the sub-national regional needs of the country, through the Department of the Public Service.  I understand that there has been some uncertainty about this aspect, of whether or not this analysis will go ahead.  I hope the Government will, at the very least, get this report moving to see what is needed in the country in terms of such development.  There are anomalies. Members were speaking about the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in the Dáil last week and, presumably, we will be speaking about it here next week.  Deputies, and no doubt Senators next week, have been paying tremendous compliments to SFADCo, its principal officers and the people working in it, for the great work which they say has been done in the mid-west region.  I go along with that view to a large extent.  They have done marvellous work and one of the reasons for this has been that annually the Government have given them a sum of money to spend within their particular region and, to a very large extent, they have been the masters of their own destiny within that region. Yet this process does not happen in any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, referring to SFADCo made a good point.  He said that these bodies, set up for specific purposes&mdash;SFADCo was set up initially to help Shannon Airport when it was in dire straits&mdash;should not necessarily be thought of to have the same function forever once they had done their job.  It could be usefully asked, if SFADCo had done their job and there was not another one, is it necessary to continue with SFADCo? Alternatively, it would seem logical that if SFADCo had done a good job in the interests of that region that the Government by this stage should have learned lessons from that experience and that that experience should give a pointer to what might be done in other parts of the country, that it would be logical to have a similar structure in, say, the south-east or <Col N="416" /> the south-west.  We have seen unwelcome extensions of this type of thing where SFADCo did an excellent job particularly in the tourist field.  Because of the lack of a similar structure in the west, we had situations where SFADCo were coming much farther north and beyond their brief to an extent to become involved in other areas in work which should have been carried out by a regional structure within our own part of the country. Presumably this is wider than the scope of the motion before the House. It is relevant to this extent, that the EEC regional policy will be interlocked with national regional policies.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Government have their priorities right in regional policy.  There are things we need to sort out in that particular area and I hope we will make some progress, even though the Government are acting in a manner in which I am disappointed in this respect, but at least we can discuss these matters over the next few years so that better things will happen.</P>
    <P>There is one particular omission in the Minister's speech.  It is a grave omission because we have had a lengthy speech of about 30 pages under a great many different headings.  The Minister has not, at any stage in the speech, dealt specifically with industry. He has dealt with economic and monetary matters, with trade, with regional policy and with fisheries, but there was nothing about industry. Industry is one of the most critical areas we need to watch in so far as the EEC policy is concerned.  We need a watchdog on that one for the next 12 to 18 months.  If we look over the very recent history of industrial policy, for some years there has been pressure of varying degrees on successive Irish Governments to dismantle the grant structure and the huge incentive of tax relief on export sales on the basis that we have been too successful in attracting industry to this country which is in competition with industries in Britain, Germany, France, Belgium or Holland.  There has been trade union reaction from the continent of Europe and we have been under pressure for all of these reasons.  They <Col N="417" /> are pressures we need to resist as strongly as possible.  When all is said and done, despite the relative wealth of this country in comparison with the Third World or other such areas, we are still by all the criteria which are used infinitely less well-off than the other eight members of the EEC.  We are living on the fringe of Europe with the transport costs involved in industry, in importing raw materials, and reexporting the finished product and in relative terms we have a poor industrial infrastructure.  If the incentives which we have been allowed to give to industry to come to this country and to native industries to start here were dismantled in the morning we would be in an extremely parlous and serious position.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that Commissioner Dick Burke some months ago got the wind of what was happening in Brussels and apparently immediately consulted the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  The battle is not by any means over because at a recent national conference of the Confederation of Irish Industry a speech was made on policy in the European Community by N. Davignon, Commissioner for Internal Policy and Industrial Affairs.  Again in that speech he adverted, despite the noises the Minister had made, to the policy that we cannot allow protectionism, grants or incentives for a limited period to continue forever.  It is an area that is fraught with danger and one in which, if the Government choose to show backbone, they will have all the support possible from this side of the House.  I regret that the Minister did not deal with it in his speech.  It is probably singly the most serious and critical matter facing us at present.  I hope that the Minister will deal to an extent with this question of industrial policy and the backbone we will need to have within this country to retain the incentives which we have been giving and which have been remarkably successful.</P>
    <P>Despite the remarkable success we know the limited extent to which they have been successful in solving the job situation.  Through the economic crisis, the downturn in the textile field, <Col N="418" /> in woollens and areas such as this, there was not all that great net increase in jobs even with all these incentives. If it is a question of retreating from this, we are in extremely dire circumstances and under no circumstances should such a move be tolerated.  That is all I want to say about that.</P>
    <P>I might mention also that the future in the area of competitiveness is gloomy. It is very difficult to be optimistic about the job position.  One's heart tells one that we should be.  It would be great if certain policies come off.  But, on analysis, one's head does not agree with the heart.  Looming in the future as well are the trade agreements with the Third World and the necessity to bring Africa and other countries into the mainstream of Europe.  We are facing an era where we are going to have very much more competition for markets from the Third World, where people are working at a much lower rate for the job than we are doing.  The future is not as bright as some people would like it to be.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to one or two aspects of foreign policy within the EEC.  I welcome the fact that they have become involved in the Middle East issue.  Despite the pessimism there has been for many of the reasons I pointed out earlier on and the gloom in the economic field, we have to be thankful for one or two things which we tend to take for granted to a very large extent.  The Common Market had its origins to a large extent in the will that existed in the mainland of Europe for future peace in Europe, having been decimated in two world wars in this century.  This matter of peace is always taken too much for granted because you only begin to value peace and freedom when you do not have them. The single most remarkable achievement of the EEC was this political dimension which got the French, British, Germans and others in the cockpit of Europe sitting around a table and agreeing initially on economic matters and, hopefully, at a later date on matters of a political nature.  This consultation and unity at root has had a tremendous <Col N="419" /> psychological effect in creating an environment within Europe for possibly continuing peace.  We can be more optimistic about peace in Europe today than we might ever have been post-World War I or World War II.</P>
    <P>By extension of that it has had other effects on world policy in the unity of the Nine and their adopting common policies in the foreign field. As an aside to this, it is interesting to know that the ambassadors of the Nine in the different capitals around the world as distant as Tokyo meet on a regular basis to consider the policy of the Nine in Europe <i>viv-à-vis</i> the world.  It is very healthy when you see them tackling in foreign policy matters such as the Middle East.  I was glad to see that the EEC in a statement in November 1973 adopted a very strong policy on the Middle East.  It was really a restatement of UN Resolution 242 in which they demanded an acknowledgement of the State of Israel and its right to exist in the Middle East.  They also sought the recognition of the establishment of a just and lasting peace which must take into account the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.  They also went on to refer to the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force.</P>
    <P>More recently Sadat seized an initiative to meet Begin in Jerusalem and people had hopes of the beginnings of peace resulting from their meeting.  I admire Sadat very much for his initiative despite the controversies created in the Middle East, but <i>vis-à-vis</i> the enlargement of territories I regret that Israel since then sought to start settlements in the Sinai desert which was a particularly sensitive issue and which has not won very much for them in terms of public opinion.  However, I am glad to see the EEC getting involved in this and the work which is being done.  Indeed there was an Irishman, Eamon Gallagher, who was involved at an earlier stage in many of these negotiations in the Middle East but this would not be widely known within this country.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the EEC Committee are meeting again.  They have not <Col N="420" /> met for a very long time and it is past time that they met.  With hindsight, and I was a member of that committee for four-and-a-half years, we were dealing with historical matter to too large an extent.  We were not acting as a sounding post sufficiently.  Whether the fault lay in the membership, the chairmanship or in the officers of that committee&mdash;I suppose it lay with all of us&mdash;it seemed to me that committee to a large extent should spend their time through liaison with the Irish Embassy to the EEC, in looking ahead towards imminent legislation to see what is under discussion at a particular time by the Commission, so that the discussions within our EEC committee can bring some influence to bear on results rather than be entirely historical. In my experience it was largely an historical matter.  For example, you get some EEC regulations coming out which are absurd.</P>
    <P>Recently I saw one that I am aware of through a business connection&mdash;a very simple matter of an egg grading machine.  The regulations in Ireland and Britain have been that you have three different grades of eggs and you have a machine which literally grades them into these different sizes and then you pack them into boxes.  There is a new EEC regulation on nine different grades of eggs.  It is monstrous, there is no commercial basis for it, there is no consumer demand and it is simply an entirely unnecessary and a bureaucratic notion.  Nobody knows why in Europe they might seek nine different grades of eggs.  The whole business is farcical because while you get goodwill of course from the people charged with implementing a regulation, such as those in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy or the Department of Agriculture, then again if we adhere to EEC regulations such officers have a duty to implement the regulations. If the committee were aware of regulations such as the egg-grading regulation before it got into legislation, before it got past the post, there would be some opportunity in such ludicrous areas such as this to influence events, whereas if you look at a regulation in an historical sense there is no possibility of doing anything about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" /> The social fund is very useful to us and I am glad to see that there is quite a bit of money coming from it. I think the figure was about £22 million last year&mdash;it was over £20 million which is about 8 per cent of the total fund, which is generous.  In this country I would like to compliment AnCO on the job which they have done.  They have done a remarkably good job in training people for industry, and I note that in 1977 about 12,500 people received training from them which was a very substantial increase on 1976.  In addition to that, there was training in other sectors as well.  There were private companies in co-operation with AnCO and there were 5,000 people involved in such training programmes.</P>
    <P>The social fund has been a tremendous fillip and a great deal of industrial training simply would not have happened had there not been this injection from the EEC.  It is a scheme of which I approve completely.  In the last few years with the emergence of free education to all levels and the over-reaction of people to this policy in the sense that it has been the ambition of most families to go through the arts and such disciplines, there has been a tendency to denigrate technical education and I am delighted to see the very strong contra-move in very practical terms in the field in which there will be a very good future for people who are involved.  As long as we are going to be an industrial nation, this is where there is tremendous scope in a very practical sense.  I am glad that that work is being carried out.</P>
    <P>I have a short note here about fisheries. I am not going to dwell at length on it as I presume we will have debates on fisheries here over the next year or two.  I note that a decision in the case against Ireland in the Court of Justice is fairly imminent.  I am tempted to make one or two political remarks on the fisheries matter without getting into the bones of it.  I remember four years in Government through an era in particular when our Foreign Minister, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, spent a tremendous amount of time looking after fishery interests, doing everything that he possibly could, <Col N="422" /> carrying out every manoeuvre that he could in the national interest.  We were vilified by all kinds of elements.  It seems to me that the position has turned full circle and that we see the immense problems that exist.  It is extremely difficult and I do not know where we are going to end up with regard to a solution but I hope that the fundamental interests of the country are furthered when the matter is finally agreed.  I have said what I want to say.  Finally, if I could ask the Minister for State&mdash;presumably the Minister will be in the House at some stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to welcome the decision of the Minister to bring the reports to both Houses at the earliest possible opportunity.  I hope that this is a policy which will be pursued in the future because I think it is wrong that important reports relating to such important administration should be left undebated as they have been over a number of years in our Parliament.  It affords an opportunity to Members, and through them, to the public to discuss and debate European decisions which are relevant to our development here.  I hope that such discussions in the future will tend to be the base from which future policies emerge and that the views expressed by Members in both Houses will be given serious consideration in relation to future European policy as it affects Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems about the enlarged Community is that the seat of power and decision-making tends to be very remote from the people here.  For this reason I think it is tremendously important that every available opportunity be used to enable discussions to take place and to keep our people involved. Since our entry we have on balance benefited considerably.  Also as a small nation we have contributed in many ways to the philosophy of European unity and our representatives&mdash;particularly our Ministers and indeed our Minister of State who is with us here this evening&mdash;have represented us in a very effective and <Col N="423" /> dignified way abroad.  We hope that the years ahead will see a more practical recognition of this philosophy and a greater commitment towards correcting the many regional imbalances.</P>
    <P>One of the great attractions of our entry was the existence and promised expansion of the regional fund to be used to develop the poor regions within the Community.  It is true to say that the fund so far is just a token recognition that there are regional imbalances and the council seems to lack the political will and the political courage to tackle this great Community problem in any effective way. I believe that if this particular aspect of Community policy is not seen to develop in a positive and generous way by the transfer of money from the richer to the poorer regions in the immediate years ahead then member countries like our own with serious regional deficiencies will have their confidence undermined and the principles of the Treaty of Rome to some extent will be suspect.  So serious are our regional problems here that we would need the entire allocation to make any real impact on them.</P>
    <P>The European Commission should be congratulated on its support over the years to provide an adequate regional fund which would give expression to the concept of transferring available resources to the areas of greatest need.  This is a phrase which to some extent has become a cliché.  Without such a policy there can be no monetary or economic union within the EEC.  As I see it, there are two great weaknesses in relation to the regional fund.  First, the size of the fund is completely inadequate and unless some kind of a realistic fund can be provided in the immediate future&mdash;and when I say immediate future I mean over the next three or four years&mdash;we are not going to make any impact on correcting the regional imbalances within the Community.</P>
    <P>Another weakness in the regional fund is its method of application.  You have seen and read that the situation within Europe at present is that the better-off countries continue to prosper and improve and the poor countries <Col N="424" /> are unable to keep in line.  An example of which I read recently will illustrate the point I am making.  When we joined the EEC Hamburg had a <i>per capita</i> income five times greater than we had and at present that <i>per capita</i> income is six times greater.  That bears out the point I was making, that the regional fund and the regional policy have not been effective in bringing about the up-grading of the economies of the poorer nations.  This House should welcome the EEC study on the Donegal-Derry region.  The report is an excellent example of the steps which can be taken to bring about regional development in an area that is both divided and deprived.  The removal of the poverty conditions of the area are a necessary step for the preservation of peace and unity.</P>
    <P>Regarding the use of the funds by member states&mdash;unfortunately this has applied to our country over the past four to five years&mdash;and in relation to the absence of any kind of an effective regional policy and what I would consider to be a great weakness, the fact that we have no separate regional fund, we have been using the money available from the EEC, little and all as it was, to supplement our on-going programme of development within the fund.  If we are to make any real impact, if we are to be seen to create any impression in correcting regional imbalances here, we should, in the first instance, set out as soon as possible a clearly defined plan for regional development and ensure that the money available from the EEC fund is put into a separate fund and administered separately to ensure the maximum return from it.  A thought which occurred to me in relation to this is that if we do not do this many of the donor countries who are better-off than us will not be as conducive to having the fund increased in the future as they might.  It is important at European level, as well as internally to have it seen as a reality that the regional fund is being spent to the fullest possible extent on real regional development.</P>
    <P>Senators and Deputies were critical of the present method of allocating the regional fund.  I share this view <Col N="425" /> with them.  At present the funds are allocated in relation to the contributions of the individual member states. If that trend continues the weak countries will continue to remain weak and we will receive something in the region of a 6 per cent increase.  There should be ample scope to have the purpose of the fund broadened to suit Irish conditions. I support the concept that regional aid should be available for the development of infrastructure like roads and water, particularly in relation to industrial development, and I feel strongly that member states should be allowed to determine their own priorities in relation to regional development. In Ireland the scope should be broadened to take into account large areas of undeveloped land needing drainage and reclamation.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that our economy is an agriculture based one and agriculture has made a tremendous contribution to the overall development of our nation down through the years.  However, we have a large percentage of undeveloped agricultural land which cannot be reclaimed within the resources of the present owners because it requires a large capital input by way of public funds.  Because this problem is peculiar to Ireland we should be able to expand the regional fund of the future to include arterial drainage and the reclamation of so much of the marginal land.  In the long term that would more than repay the investment by way of increased production and agricultural exports, something which we badly need.</P>
    <P>In relation to forestry, which seems to have been the cinderella of development here, we are now reaping the benefits of a very limited afforestation programme of 30 to 40 years ago. Had we invested more money down through the years in the expansion of our State forests our economy would now be benefiting considerably from the return from those forests.  It is never too late to start and from the point of view of regional development and development of the marginal land which perhaps can never be brought into production from an agricultural point of view, it should, at the earliest opportunity, be planted so that future <Col N="426" /> generations will reap the benefit of all of our national resources.</P>
    <P>As a farmer I can say that the agricultural sector has benefited considerably from membership of the EEC.  We benefited from the increased prices while enjoying comparatively low costs, particularly during the transitional period.  It is encouraging to note that the increased income from agriculture has been channelled back into the industry to gear it for future challenges in the free trade area.  From our point of view it is essential that agricultural prices keep abreast of price increases and I question whether the 2 per cent forecast at present will be adequate in the coming year to keep abreast of current day costs.  At the same time one has to recognise the wonderful job which our Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Gibbons, is doing and has been doing in Brussels since he was appointed.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Tenth Report and the reference in it to the farm modernisation scheme.  This scheme has enabled considerable agricultural expansion to take place within the country but many farmers and farming organisations feel that it is too restrictive because many farmers are excluded from it.  I am referring to the small farmers and we have a very high percentage of them, who are forced, because of their limited acreage, to seek off-farm employment.  It is because they are seeking off-farm employment and because their percentage of income is greater from their non-farming enterprises that they are denied admission to the farm modernisation scheme. That is a pity from the farmers' and the national point of view.  From the farmers' point of view it prevents them from getting the maximum input that they could get from their land resources and from the national point of view it is restricting agricultural output, eventually reducing agricultural exports, something we all need to promote and to encourage.</P>
    <P>One anomaly which emerged from the farm modernisation scheme is the classification of farmers within that scheme.  In my county quite a number of farmers are affected by this.  There were many progressive small farmers <Col N="427" /> who at the beginning of the farm modernisation scheme borrowed sizeable sums of money to enable them to expand their holdings and equip their farms in a modern way.  It was because they had high borrowings at the time of their assessment that the people who were classifying them decided that they could not meet the income target because of the high interest repayment. However, those farmers who had the courage to go to the banks to borrow the money to expand and develop their small holdings are the ones that are now being victimised under this scheme.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to bring this matter to the notice of the Minister for Agriculture and to anybody within the Government who can have it remedied.  We are victimising the people who are prepared to take the bull by the horns, so to speak, are prepared to go into the bank to borrow to expand their small holdings. This is an area which many farming organisations have overlooked.  I am bringing this to the notice of the House in the hope that even at this late stage something can be done about it.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the farm modernisation scheme which needs to be looked at from an internal point of view is that because of the advent of the scheme many farmers, in fact an encouraging number of them, are now working to a farm development plan, a plan which has been prepared by the agricultural advisory services and which enables the farmer to work to an income target.  This scheme has put tremendous strain on the advisory services in all counties.  What is more important is the question of servicing the farmers and the plan prepared by the advisory services.  We are talking about the importance of job creation and I cannot think of any better area where new jobs could be effectively created than in the farming advisory services.  Such people could be used to service the farmers and the plans prepared for them.  As a result of the services which they would provide the country and the farming community in general would benefit considerably.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> It is interesting to note from the report that we have benefited considerably&mdash;Senator Staunton referred to this earlier&mdash;from the EEC FEOGA grant scheme.  All one can say in relation to it is that we hope this scheme will be extended and expanded further in the future.  I cannot avoid saying that a great deal of the money which was put into disease eradication over the past four or five years has been squandered because the scheme almost collapsed.  We now have the highest incidence of TB and brucellosis we ever experienced.  It is important that when we get back on the rails again in relation to disease eradication that nothing will ever be allowed to come between the vets and the farmers and the carrying out of this effective service.</P>
    <P>The prime objective of the economic policy programmes from 1968 to 1980 was the creation of job opportunities within the Community.  Indeed, this is one of our main objectives at present. It is unfortunate that we have one of the highest unemployment rates within the Community.  On the other hand, all the other economic indicators, such as growth rate and our control of inflation, show that our economy is on the move again.  At long last our economy is again moving in the right direction and it is up to us to avail of all the schemes, aids and assistance the EEC can provide for us, to enable us continue with that job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>As I listened to the phrase of Senator Staunton, that in the past &ldquo;we were a bit idealistic about the EEC&rdquo;, I could not suppress a smile. Listening to Senator Hyland and some of his strictures on the regional policy, with which I am in entire agreement, it occurred to me to ask which side he was on.  If I refer to arguments which have been the currency of political debate for the last six years, it is not to reopen the question of joining the Community because we are in and we are irrevocably in.  Anyone who suggests that we could now leave it without terrible damage to our economy is simply wrong and urging a course that would be extremely dangerous.  But if I have to refer to many of these topics which, indeed, <Col N="429" /> are the stuff of these three reports, and have been the stuff of many of the speeches here, it is not to fight old battles, but it is precisely because the issues which were identified and discussed then are indeed the issues which are going to be crucial for us as a nation within the Community over the coming decade.</P>
      <P>I do not think anyone now would deny that the Community has lost momentum, perhaps in a way that delights those who wish to see it destroyed or lost in a way which certainly disappoints those who believed that the question of whether it is a good thing or a bad thing for participating countries is undecided.  That is a question which depends on the political work that is done within all member states and, indeed, within the Community as a whole.  Whether it will turn out to be a disaster for a country like Ireland, or whether it will turn out to be a very good thing is still in the womb of time because it depends on the political work of the people who want to reform it, and believe me it is reformable.  In order to carry cut that reform it is necessary to refer to the warts which were so obvious to those who wished to look on the countenance of the Community at the time when we were discussing it in the past. The loss of momentum is obvious and the dangers for us of that loss of momentum are very great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will go on later to talk about the question of the danger of two levels within the Community, because it has to be real, with countries like Spain, Greece, Portugal and, in the middle distance, Turkey, either having applied or getting ready to apply for membership. What is desparately serious is the loss of momentum itself.  We cannot simply say &ldquo;We got this far, it is not actually breaking down so it will be all right and may be in five or ten years the good things we hoped for will come and in the meantime we will survive&rdquo;.  I do not think that describes the situation.  The lack of evolution, the lack of momentum, the lack of development is itself a danger for an economy that is as small and as fragile as ours.  The stagnation is dangerous in precisely the way Senator Hyland <Col N="430" /> said.  He gave the figures for the comparison of GNP&mdash;I take it <i>per capita</i>&mdash;between Hamburg and Ireland.  He showed that the gap has opened since 1973.  It is true for Hamburg and it is true as between the most developed and least developed parts.  It is true everywhere.  There is not a tendency for convergence, there is a tendency for divergence.  Let me say in passing that that is not surprising.  Anyone who believed that market economies tended of their own nature to converge was either stupid or naive, or a bit of both.</P>
    <P>I want to try to diagnose the ills and see what is the path forward.  What the Community does is the most important single thing determining our future over the next decade and therefore this is, in a sense, the most important debate and it is the dimension we leave out so much from our discussions. For example, it is the dimension that was left out of discussions on the recent budget and White Paper. What the Community does is desparately important and one wants to try to diagnose reasons for the present situation and then to try to suggest a direction of evolution, a direction of work.</P>
    <P>I have always contended, and the last years of our membership and my experience as a member of the Council of Ministers and as a member of the European Parliament, has convinced me, that the original engine which actually brought the Community into existence was the engine of big business.  That is not to dismiss the noble, idealistic and visionary people who unselfishly worked to realise it and believed in it in an abstract sort of way.  Those forces that really brought a Common Market&mdash;I stress the words &ldquo;Common Market&rdquo;&mdash;into existence were the forces of big business, big industry, big banking, for the reason that they needed a common market of the sort and size that was given to them by putting together six and then nine member states.  They needed that in order to have a dimension, a scale of market, and therefore, a scale of volume of production which would enable both significant research and development <Col N="431" /> and significant economies of scale that would put them back into the league <i>vis-à-vis</i> the great economies of the Unites States, Japan and the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>It was an economic reason and the thrust was towards a common market. I emphasise the economic and the trading aspects of it.  Those people&mdash; I will not make any pejorative observations about when they first got to know each other or what their motives were&mdash;will achieve what they wanted as soon as there is free movement of goods, capital and labour. With all the barriers we see&mdash;we will talk about the CAP in a minute&mdash;and with floating exchange rates of course there is not a real common market; there is, let us say, industrial free trade.  There is pretty free movement of labour and there is very considerable freedom of movement of capital.  Those people now have got all they wanted and have dropped out of the forces, out of the team that is trying to have the Community evolve further.  They do not want any further evolution.  In fact, they want to see the individual member states being as different as possible and having options about their industrial incentives and their tax laws with each other to the benefit of these great companies. They have got all they want and, therefore, there is no further reason to evolve.</P>
    <P>What we have is a free trading area, in so far as floating exchange rates permit it, which is governed on the basis of market forces in a market economy. What happens in those circumstances? I am not saying this theoretically because if any one wants to look they can see over five, ten or 15 years, the forces that I now propose to list at work.  Firstly, inside an area like that the tendency is not towards the spread of industry but towards concentration, and that concentration is to be seen. Secondly, the tendency is towards regional ineqality.  That has happened in every industrialising country.  It has happened on a national scale.  The tremendous wealth of Manchester and Birmingham did not spread into parts of Scotland but rather the opposite. That accumulation of wealth sucked <Col N="432" /> the wealth out of Scotland and Ireland and even the west country of England. The tremendous industrial development, the greatest the world has ever seen, of the United States after the Civil War in America and on through almost a century did not spread wealth through the United States.  There is no reason to expect that a market economy produces regional equality. All the evidence is that it produces regional inequality and we can see&mdash; Senator Hyland on the other side of the House quoted one example&mdash;that all the figures are that way in the Community.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising, and everybody would have known that if he had read a bit of economic history.  I am not talking about human wickedness, but when one has very powerful industrial and financial commercial aggregations inside the same economic or trading area as very weak areas one dominates the other.  It is not a matter of wickedness; it is a matter of the nature of the system and the structure.  We have seen the development of colonial relationships.  When we were part of the United Kingdom &mdash;it was one of the reasons we wanted to end it&mdash;we took on a colonial relationship. It was not a colony by occupation only or of the settling of farmers or of garrisons in towns; it was colonial relationship economically.  We see the development of a colonial relationship between the disadvantaged areas of the Community <i>vis-à-vis</i> the strongest areas.  We see the re-establishment of spheres of influence by the dynamic industry of the Community, of its old relationships that very nearly perished during the war, of the old French and British and, indeed, from the First World War, German colonies in Africa and other places.</P>
    <P>We see the most ferocious sectoral competition eliminating whole sectors of industry.  Senator Myles Staunton spoke about industrial policy.  Did any of us think that in conditions of free trade sectors like furniture, footwear, clothing and textiles, without special rights or special protection, would be able to stand their ground not alone against Hong Kong, Taiwan or South Korea but against the vastly large units of a highly-capitalised kind which <Col N="433" /> exist inside Europe?  The Italian footwear industry and the French nationally re-organised footwear industry have been re-organised with tremendous thrust and money over a long period.  Did we think that sectoral competition would not be intensified and that the national sectors within the weaker member states, not just us but the others, would come through without having hell knocked out of them, exascerbated by a slump but likely anyway?</P>
    <P>The things that have been happening were almost a bit obvious.  It was a bit idealistic, to quote Senator Staunton's phrase again, not to have seen them.  If the market stops now at its common market phase without going further, without, if I can steal a phrase from somewhere else, taking on a human face, or, indeed, without the forces of what I consider to be social progress, then those tendencies of concentration of regional inequality, the colonial relationship of those poorer areas, the sucking of people out of those poorer areas, the tremendous shift of population, the whole flow of people into the industrial area, the uprooting of communities, the destruction of the sectors, will continue.</P>
    <P>The evolution of the CAP is crucial for us.  Let us talk about that, hopefully for the purpose of indicating a total national consensus to strengthen our Minister and our Government <i>vis-à-vis</i> the institutions of the Community.  It is politically true that in the sixties political decisions were taken in places like Germany and France, particularly those two, others as well, to pay vastly higher prices for food than the going rate on the world markets.  That was a political decision.  There was in those countries then an enormous&mdash;I do not use the word abusively&mdash;peasantry. They have diminished very dramatically. The figures of the reduction of the numbers of small farmers in Germany, for example, is extraordinary over a period of 20 odd years.  I do not think we can believe that in the long run the Community will maintain a price differential for food between it and the rest of the world.  I believe the industrial, commercial and, indeed, working class forces calling for a cheap <Col N="434" /> food policy will overcome the relatively high food prices within the Community.</P>
    <P>I will fight against that, and the Labour Party will, along with every other party in Ireland because of course we are beneficiaries and there was never any question of our being beneficiaries on the agricultural front. But the question is, with our best efforts, and our most resolute battle in defence of the CAP, how long can it be made to last?</P>
    <P>Senator Hyland said an interesting thing in relation to this when he was talking about the work of Minister Gibbons and about the price rises now being negotiated for farm produce in Brussels.  Some people say 2 per cent.  I believe Minister Gibbons is looking for 4 or 4½ per cent.  That is fine, but how much have the farmers' inputs gone up in the corresponding period, by 10 or 12 per cent? Therefore, the farmer's real income is descending.  If his volume is rising dramatically he, of course, has more money in his fist but his percentage return is shrinking.  It shrank last year and the year before.  If price rises for farm produce go on increasing by 2, 3, 4 and 5 per cent, it will go on shrinking.</P>
    <P>Another thing that I agree with Senator Hyland is happening in the agricultural sector, which is very interesting, is a differentation between big and little.  If you are big, if you can utilise the schemes, if you can get your production to rise fast and if you could capitalise rapidly that is fine, you can stay ahead of the game. Tremendous fortunes have been made by French grain growers in the Paris basin and very considerable fortunes have been made by Irish dairy farmers who were able to get their herds into the seventies, eighties and 100 and 200 cows.  They have done well and good luck to them.  They have put back most of it.</P>
    <P>The whole problem is differentiation and that the Community will say at a certain stage &ldquo;We can get all the food we want from the farm intensification of those who are commercially viable on our definition&rdquo;.  My party will fight that definition.  I have no <Col N="435" /> doubt that every voice in the Oireachtas will fight in Brussels to bring down the levels at which people are admitted to those schemes.  Do you think we are going to win it, taking it over one year with another, over half-a-decade?  I do not think they are going to make it tougher.  I believe they are going to feel that the balance of forces is such that the &ldquo;peasantry&rdquo; are now expendable. They have lost a lot of their political clout because they have become so few.</P>
    <P>One always makes a mistake in politics looking five, ten or 15 years ahead.  Nobody gives a damn about that, in elections or referenda.  They want to know about &ldquo;now&rdquo;, last year or six months ago.  They do not want a long view and are not interested in one.  It is the duty of people who aspire to political leadership sometimes to take a look down the half-decade and decade.  I think that the CAP&mdash; we will all fight to defend it&mdash;will have to be defended with the best vigour that we can encompass.  Erosions are going to take place.  Intensification is going to take place but this is only possible for people above a certain threshold.  The rest will be squeezed very hard.  The cosy answer will be given that you can move into industry. It is not a cosy answer when industrial growth is such as it is, not just in Ireland but elsewhere.  In all the Community countries there are not the sort of industrial jobs that soaked up people leaving the countryside in the fifties, sixties and in the very beginning of the seventies.</P>
    <P>We will have to look at a whole series of areas where we must expect a conflict between our national interest and what the Community tries to force us to do.  I am going to enumerate some of them.  They have to be enumerated because the Irish people do not believe that there are areas where our sovereignty has been diminished. The threats were glibly glossed over and we were told it would be all right on the day.</P>
    <P>I am going to say very little about fish.  I wish the negotiations well.  The little I will say is that the original presentation was altogether too optimistic <Col N="436" /> and there has been a genuine diminution of national sovereignty about fish. When people took decisions in the past they had no inkling that that sort of thing in the end could be forced down our throats.  Would that fish were the only example; that this was just a quirk of the evolving supranational powers of the Community.  We will find&mdash;I say this as a prediction and since it is on the record I will stand or fall by it&mdash;that the same sort of ferocious pressures that we have seen exerted on fish will be exerted in other areas.  I do not underestimate the wringer the Minister for Fisheries is being put through in Brussels.  I was disgusted by the cynicism of the Government's position when they were in Opposition because they had no right to be that simplistic or ignorant but they have stuck that hook on themselves and they are impaled on it now. I do not underestimate his difficulties.</P>
    <P>What about energy?  What about our sovereign rights over the oil and gas of the Continental Shelf?  I heard, at a seminar in the Burlington Hotel, a German <i>rapporteur</i>, a distinguished professor sent to us by the Commission, talking in 1974 about &ldquo;our Continental Shelf&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo; being the Community&mdash;not Ireland's, England's, Scotland's, France's or a little bit of Denmark's but &ldquo;our Community Continental Shelf&rdquo;.  If that turns out to be a very rich thing we may not have the clout a little further down the road than the British.</P>
    <P>The British renegotiation was about various things.  One was their sovereignty, which the Community tried to take away, over the North Sea oil. Since they discovered the North Sea oil in time and since it was an issue in the renegotiation, they got away with the sovereignty control of it.  I hope that we are strong enough when the time comes if we find hydrocarbons on the Continental Shelf to be sovereign in regard to them.  I predict that the battle about fish will be nothing to what the Community tries to instruct us to do about our energy policy.</P>
    <P>Let us go on to steel.  We have seen Mr. Davignon's little excursions into this, suggesting &ldquo;It is your sovereign power to proceed with steel if you <Col N="437" /> like&rdquo;.  The most significant regional instrument in the Community is not the fund, it is the bank.  Mr. Davignon and other people in Brussels were saying: &ldquo;Of course, you can go on with your steel but you must not think that you will get any help from the bank, and you must not think that we will try to pressure the other Community countries who have export credits for the purchase of the capital equipment&rdquo;. They are trying to tell us not that we may not have Cork but that we may not have a steel industry at all because that is our only steel industry.</P>
    <P>The next one around the corner is refining.  Communitywise there is a surplus and therefore we who came late on the scene may not have any.  They would say the same about shipbuilding and&mdash;I know the rows because I was in half of them&mdash;our textile development. I know what the Community thought about Asahi and Burlington and the other textile and fibre developments in the country, not because it was not good for us but because it was embarrassing to the people who had been on the scene industrially a century ago.  They said &ldquo;For the sake of protecting the people who were always there, you will have to forego your developments&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Regional policy in a sense is the core of it.  Perhaps, as Senator Staunton said, we were a little bit idealistic about the EEC.  Did people believe that in a market economy we would have wealth transferred across national boundaries on a scale large enough to make significant differences to the economic well-being of the recipients?</P>
    <P>I am glad there is a regional fund. I share the hope of those who say &ldquo;You have to start small; in due course it will grow bigger&rdquo;.  In real terms of real growth and how well off ordinary people are in the different parts of the country, it does not make any measurable difference.  There is the dilemma.  There is not industrial policy either.  What there is of industrial policy is not beneficial.  Commissioner Davignon again rattles the sabre about ending our export tax relief and diminishing our grants.  I must say I succeeded in keeping that <Col N="438" /> one under wraps for four-and-a-half years, because just having it talked about is damaging to the IDA's work let alone having any sort of implementation of it.</P>
    <P>What is to me such an irony and such an offence is the people who have not produced the replacement, namely a regional policy.  We have, without having produced a regional policy, what I call the effrontery to attack the system that has been producing some results.  It is not enough, but my God where would we be without it?</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that merely standing still is not adequate.  I said that in a whole series of ways processes are going on that are damaging to us.  Nobody denies the great benefit we have got from the CAP.  We have got a great benefit from industrial free trade, but in truth we could have got that without joining the Community. Industrial free trade is available to any peripheral country whether it is in or out.  For example, the investment strategy of the Ford Motor Company in Europe shows its main target as Spain, outside the Community, and not Ireland, inside it, for a most immense investment in the whole of the Fiesta programme of engines and bodies and everything else.  Industrial free trade could have been obtained without membership.  It was not a necessary condition.</P>
    <P>There we are.  Firstly, standing still means getting worse.  Secondly, we do not see the real progress of industrial policy and regional policy.  Thirdly, we see, in matters like refining, steel, energy and fish very real diminutions of our national sovereignty.</P>
    <P>We will make a political football out of fish in due course if we have to, but I am not doing that now.  Fish is a very classical example.  If you say &ldquo;Provided you do not overfish, then the same for everybody&rdquo; you are saying that those who arrive early on the scene and are big and highly capitalised can wipe out those who come late on the scene who are smaller and are not sufficiently capitalised. That is all you are saying.  When that was done to us 100 years ago we called it, rightly, colonialism or imperialism. <Col N="439" /> The economic essence of the process of our fish being taken would not be done under national flags.  It would be done under the banner of the large, rich, highly developed companies but we would be ripped off just as effectively as ever we were economically in the past.</P>
    <P>What do you do?  I threw away the card of suggesting that there is anything you can do but stay in and make it better.  There is not; you cannot louse it up now.  Therefore, it seems to me that since the engine that brought the Community this far is now switched off&mdash;that is the engine of big capital, big banking, big industry&mdash;another force has to come on the scene to give the Community a human face about industrial policy.  This concerns the survival of the weaker sectors in the weaker countries; it concerns people's livelihood.  This is about regional policy, to be sure, but it is also about social policy, about environmental policy, the up-rooting of peoples, about some sort of uniformity in health and education.  It concerns all the things we want to spend wealth on to make life better.</P>
    <P>The only force that I can see is the force that believes in a mixed economy.  It may seem irrelevant to say a mixed economy.  I was very interested in Senator Hyland's contribution. God knows I agree about the need for regional policy.  I am not going to talk about SFADCo now, but SFADCo seemed to me a beautiful example of a bit of good regional development.  I always in my time resisted efforts to diminish its role.  I greatly regret that diminution.  That was a regional thing that was working and was beginning to have skills, structures and knowledge and it was not centralised.</P>
    <P>If you were going to get a big flow of regional funds what would you do with them?  The whole thrust of the White Paper and the whole thrust of the budget&mdash;I am not arguing now whether they are right or wrong, I am just observing the thrust&mdash;is to say &ldquo;Take off the shackles and the private sector will do it&rdquo;.  It says &ldquo;The idea <Col N="440" /> of a mixed economy is nonsense, the idea of planning is nonsense, the idea of a national development corporation is nonsense, just let the private sector get on with it&rdquo;.  If that is your industrial and economic philosophy then are you simply going to expect that you will be given regional funds on a scale ten or 20 times the present and have no structures of regional planning, no structures of a mixed economy and simply say &ldquo;We will dollop it out to whatever private sector entrepreneur puts his hand out in whichever town he happens to live in&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Nobody will give you money on that basis.  You will not get regional funds from anybody.  You will probably not get them anyway, but you cannot even start the battle to get them if you do not have the structures of planning and the structures of a mixed economy.  You will not develop regions that need development without the structures of planning and without guidelines that violate the rules of the market.  I am tempted to illustrate that.  This is not radical, labour or anything else.  This is an idea at the very core of Fianna Fáil economic thinking in the past.  In the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, I am prompted to ask the question: What would have happened to our bogs if we had simply said &ldquo;Let the market do it&rdquo;?  The thing that we all applaud would not have happened.</P>
    <P>In the fisheries area we let the market do it and look what we have got. Again, I agree with Senator Hyland about trees that the State effort was very small.  What did the market do in trees?  A few old hedgerows, a few haggards, a few half acres here and there, nothing significant.  Had it been done by the State writing it off over a long period it could have been extremely profitable in actual money terms, given a sufficiently long time scale, and in jobs.  Essentially it comes to this.  The only thing that will rescue a small, peripheral, fragile economy in a Community context is the espousal of the mixed economy and of the sort of planning, in the context of a mixed economy, that particularly has been developed by the Swedes, whom it has raised from one of the poorest countries <Col N="441" /> in Europe at the beginning of this century to the richest country in the world.</P>
    <P>I am going to offer an opinion on the White Paper and on the budget.  I think they are crazy and that they will produce the defeat of the present Government in the next general election.  I thought until then maybe it would not be another 16 years but that it would be quite a long time.  Now I think that it is a disease that is called hubris and will produce its result.  Obviously, I could be wrong about that, as it is an opinion.  The thrust at least is wrong, whether the job targets are met, whether there is a retrenchment sharply in the budget of January/February 1980 or whether there is a real forced cooling.</P>
    <P>Why move when these are our problems in a Community context?  Why clobber SFADCo when there is a regional need?  Why move away from the traditional Fianna Fáil attitude of a mixed economy and a public sector to saying, &ldquo;We will simply let the private sector do it&rdquo;?  That might be fine if we were in Germany but for the long term for this island, for the realities of the economic and political evolution of the Community it is as silly and as wrong politically as the budget is in its way.  Only the democratic socialists with mixed economics, with planning, and with the attendant rational uses of the surplus generated to ameliorate in a planned way the lot of the weaker areas, will produce solutions.</P>
    <P>We will have the debate on the accession, the 1972 debate all over again in the run-up to the European Parliamentary Elections.  I welcome this very much for many reasons because the strengthening and democratisation of the central institution is crucial.  I hope it is a good debate.  I hope it is conducted according to the decencies of debate.  I hope that both sides are least less idealistic, in the sense of trying to see the facts as they are and express them.  I am convinced that in this on-going debate the people will see that the issues raised and argued did not go away when the referendum votes were counted.</P>
    <P>Further evolution, industrial policy, <Col N="442" /> regional policy, the social policy, democratisation, planning, power to the institutions as a countervailing force to the great nation states are all very real questions.  It may seem like a contradiction, but what the little nation states and the peripheral nation states need as a countervailing force to the Germans, French and British is, in fact, strong central institutions.  The Minister of State is entitled to say to me: &ldquo;What were you saying in 1972? What was the situation in 1971.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The situation is that we are in.  Since we are in and since we cannot get out, in fact, anyone who wants the sort of evolution I am talking about must accept and must work for the strengthening of the central institutions, that means, of course, the Commission as well as the Council of Ministers.  The Council of Ministers, in fact, acts as the extension, the long limb of each member state rather than the central institution.</P>
    <P>The Commission will only be able to function effectively, in an initiative and in a humanising way to the extent that it has an alliance with a valid democratic parliament.  I hope it will be a good and an interesting debate.  My conviction is, that the Irish people will have learned something in the last five years as to who correctly understands the situation, identifies the dangers and can offer them the policies to mitigate those dangers for the Irish people and the nation as a whole and to strengthen the aspects of the Community, which we need if we are to survive and prosper.</P>

      <P>I would like to speak briefly.  It was very interesting to hear Senator Keating extolling the virtues of the mixed economy.  I am sure one could agree with that.  We should cast our minds back a little to the reasons and principles behind our joining the EEC.  There were probably two basic reasons, the economic, bread and butter reasons and the political reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the whole, despite what Senator Keating has said, the economic arguments have been justified.  Basically, we have developed an export-oriented industry and this is, at least, likely to be successful.  There are grave difficulties <Col N="443" /> in the way, but the few countries which have succeeded economically in the post-war years and certainly the few smaller countries, which have developed successfully in the post-war years, have done so on the basis of export-oriented industry.  I would hope that this development in itself has been a very substantial, significant and worth-while basis for joining the EEC.</P>
    <P>It is true that export industries could approach other countries but the fact that we are within the EEC, in effect, guarantees a market rather than there being a situation in which we would have the possibility of a market.  I believe the major US concerns, to which Senator Keating has referred, which have gone to Spain, have done so for a number of reasons, undoubtedly.  I believe one of the reasons, quite naturally, is they assume that Spain is an integral part of Western Europe and will, in due course, become a partner in the EEC.</P>
    <P>I should not like to see this country in a situation in which we were relying upon the goodwill of other nations to open their markets to us.  As well as that, we have already seen the marked change in the balance of our exports. The extreme dependence on the UK has certainly not disappeared but it has lessened.  We now have a much healthier balance of trade with the mainland of Europe.  This has opened our eyes generally so that our international markets outside the UK have expanded considerably and will continue to do so.  One of the advantages of being a small country is that we can afford to increase our exports at an enormous rate, even greater than we have at present, without attracting the odium and the counter-measures to anywhere near the same extent that a major industrial nation, such as the Federal German Republic or Japan, will encounter under such circumstances. This is one of the few advantages of being small.</P>
    <P>I agree a great deal with what Senator Hyland and Senator Keating said.  It is, nonetheless, a fact that farm industry has benefited.  Its rate of increase <Col N="444" /> has been twice that of Denmark over the past year.  This is a great achievement.  Although, I have some experience of small farms and I have great sympathy for small farmers, I would not like to see the condition of deprivation which existed, socially under-privileged conditions, the economically poor conditions in the small farms being allowed to continue.  If it is necessary for us to have larger farms or to reorientate our farms towards other types of agri business, then we should do this.  I should hate to see the country continue in a permanent state of semi-poverty.  I still think, allowing for that, that perhaps a rather more vigorous attitude towards supports and towards the nature of the supports for farming within the EEC is something we should look at very carefully.  It is, indeed, a fact that small farmers in Germany, France and other countries are diminishing in numbers.  Certainly, their political clout is very small especially in Germany or in Britain compared with the importance of farmers in this country.</P>
    <P>There are these bread and butter reasons for joining the EEC.  They are valid and good reasons but they are not perhaps the main reasons.  I am quite sure that the main reason why we gave such an overwhelming decision in support of joining the EEC was on the political or national basis.  The EEC offers us the opportunity, politically, to break away from the stranglehold which, quite frankly, existed, not only economically but politically as well, in relation to the larger island next door to us.  We now have an effective, independent voice.  The long-standing traditions of our relationship with the continent can now once again go forward in a way which would not have been possible had we stayed out of the EEC.  I see this in many respects.  Our interests are much more akin in some ways, to those of some of the countries on the mainland of Europe than they are to Britain.  This is not in any way to diminish the very genuine natural and common interest which Britain and Ireland have.  Over and above that, is there not one reason why we must be very glad that the EEC exists, that is that it, in my eyes, at <Col N="445" /> any rate, offers us one of the few serious long-term hopes of the satisfactory, peaceful and just solution of the difficulties which exist between the two parts of this island?  Admittedly, we have not made the sort of progress in this direction which many people, I am sure, hoped for when we joined the EEC but it does offer hope and it does offer something on the horizon. Quite frankly, that horizon is so bleak and it is so hard to see any way of progress ahead that, in this respect, I am very glad we are members of the EEC and even, for that reason alone, I would be glad to see us part of the Community.</P>
    <P>In the Community itself the idea has been that as it is a common economic Community it would also have a common political output.  But, when the Community was set up, and I think this is still the position&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash;the Treaty of Rome related specifically to economic matters and the political meetings of the heads of Government are technically or officially carried on under some other convention. We do not yet have a political union in this part of Europe. Indeed, the traditions of Britain and France make it unlikely that we will make a great deal of progress in that direction in the near future, but I hope that progress we will make, and that the economic and political achievement in transforming the Yaoundé Convention into the Lomé Convention will be followed up by similar achievements.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I do not share the optimism of those who speak as though the EEC was likely to have a unified, positive and important voice on matters such as the Middle East.  I am delighted we made an early response to the Sadat-Begin talks but I am not just quite sure how far that unity will persist were there, for example, to be a further conflict there, which perhaps there will not be, or to what extent there is any unity in regard to the problems in the Horn of Africa at the moment, any common political EEC policy.  It is very difficult <Col N="446" /> to see the possibility of such a policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of this opportunity to raise what I believe is a bad, retrograde and ill-considered decision in the area of child care.  I refer to the recent decision by the Minister for Justice to convert Loughan House, County Cavan, into a temporary closed unit detention centre for 12- to 16-years-old boys who are in trouble, and who have been refused admission to existing special schools and residential homes which are under the general jurisdiction of the Department of Education.  The decision, in my view, is not just a step backwards&mdash;it is a giant leap back to an attitude which prevailed over 100 years ago when it was acceptable that children could be kept in prison and could be held under the general care and custody of prison officers.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to try to trace the origin and motivation behind the Minister's decision and to note the widespread confusion, alarm and general despondency it has caused among those involved in the whole field of child care.  Whatever else the Minister did, he did not consult those who have professional and practical experience in working with children who have problems, children in need of care.  He did not consult with those with academic and research knowledge.  He did not consult with those who are dedicated and committed to the care of children, either institutional care in the existing residential homes or care generally in the community.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the background.  First of all, it is only fair to look at what might have been considered to be a brief but encouraging reference in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, where it was conceded that there was a need for new concepts in the area of family law and the law relating to children.  At page 37 of the manifesto it stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New informal and less institutionalised procedures and tribunals <Col N="447" /> will be established in relation to family law and child offenders which will have expert remedial and social back-up services at their disposal.</P>
    <P>However, out of the blue, on 1 October last, the Minister for Justice announced that he proposed to set up a temporary detention centre in St. Patrick's to cater for boys between 12 and 16.  I quote a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 1 October 1977 as follows:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Mr. Collins, will use part of St. Patrick's Young Offenders' Centre in Dublin to house difficult boys&mdash;under 16 years old&mdash;who would not be accepted in other institutions.  This is a short term measure pending the building of a special new security centre for convicted children in north County Dublin.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the report includes a quote from the Minister as follows:</P>
    <P>We want to see the St. Patrick's unit opened as soon as possible.  If the courts decide that young children who appear before them should be taken away, we will provide the centres but while they are in those centres every effort will be made to rehabilitate them and to try to give them a proper place in society when they are finished their term.</P>
    <P>I would say that quote epitomises a frightening ignorance of the necessary basic approach to child care in our society.  I hope it was more an &ldquo;off the cuff&rdquo; remark by the Minister than an indication of his real approach and intentions in the matter.</P>
    <P>The decision itself roused widespread concern.  CARE, at a meeting on Sunday, 23 October, considered the Press reports of the Minister's decision and could find no evidence of prior consultation leading up to it, or even a Press release of 1 October from the Government Information Services. Nevertheless, CARE responded in a statement on the situation, and asked various questions in a Press release which summarised what is wrong with the Minister's whole approach as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> The argument that the detention centre is a last resort since everything else has been tried does not stand up.  When we look at the young people whom it is proposed to lock up, it is quite clear in most, if not in all cases, that there are many positive things which need to be done for them but which we are not doing.  The conditions in which they live, the facilities for leisure which they enjoy, and their lack of prospects for the future are an indictment of our society and a challenge to us to do something constructive.</P>
    <P>We cannot just blame the parents; all parents need help at times of crises, in their own and in their children's lives, and some parents need special help on a sustained basis.  There are many ways to help such families which have not been tried.  Since we have not tried all the positive things we are not justified in choosing the most negative&mdash;the proposed children's prison.</P>
    <P>CARE goes on to admit that there are cases where security, as opposed to detention, is a necessary first step to helping resolve particularly difficult cases, involving some incorrigible and difficult children.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that locking up large numbers of young people helps them to become better citizens or reduces the juvenile crime rate. On the contrary, available evidence indicates that drastic and primative intervention in a young person's life limits his chances of keeping out of trouble and of establishing himself in the community.  If we are going to lock up young people let us see this measure for what it is&mdash;an interference in young lives which is primitive and vengeful&mdash;and let us not fool ourselves with the unfounded consolation that we are rehabilitating them.  If we had found a way of rehabilitating young offenders in large numbers we would be the most successful social engineers in the world.</P>
    <P>CARE, therefore, came out in a very critical way against the proposal to use <Col N="449" /> St. Patrick's.  Probably in response to reaction of this kind the decision was subsequently modified.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to analyse this change of mind by the Minister for Justice I would like to refer to an apparent lack of overall co-ordination in relation to the care of children.  Nine days after the Minister had had this rush of blood to the head, and had announced that he was going to use part of Saint Patrick's for 12- to 16-years-old, the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Jim Tunney&mdash;who has special responsibility for special schools and residential homes&mdash;announced that he was establishing a special project team. I quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 10 October 1977 as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to provide two secure units for tough delinquents who cannot be catered for in the existing child care institutions, the parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Education, Mr. Jim Tunney, confirmed yesterday.</P>
    <P>He told the inaugural meeting of a specialist Project Team set up to plan these centres that it was the Government's concern that the new facilities be made available with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>The problem about this special project team established by Deputy Tunney is that its approach seems to run counter to the recommendations of the task force on child care services. These recommendations accept the need at times for secure residential care.  I refer the Minister to paragraphs 6.5.6. to 6.5.9., and in particular to 6.5.8. where it is provided:</P>
    <P>Accordingly, we recommend that a special school should be established in the Dublin area to cater for boys in the 12 to 16 age group who cannot be coped with in the existing residential institutions or the centres already recommended in this Report. This school should accommodate 25 to 30 boys and should be organised on the basis of three units&mdash;secure, intermediate and open, respectively.</P>
    <P>This recommendation runs quite contrary both to the Minister's modified proposal to adapt Loughan House and <Col N="450" /> even to the apparent thinking of the Minister of State at the Department of Education who seems to be ignoring the collective wisdom of the Government task force on child care in the approach that appears to be about to be adopted by his Department.  Meanwhile the Minister for Justice appears to have changed his plans in the light of the criticisms which they encountered. By 24 November it was reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> that:</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice&mdash; stated in the Dáil on Tuesday to have dropped its plan to house 12- to 16-years-old offenders in Saint Patrick's institution in Dublin&mdash;now intends to place them in Loughan House, Co. Cavan, but faces a new storm of protest, this time from prison officers.</P>
    <P>There was a sharp reaction from the prison officers because they were going to have to assume responsibility for these boys.  It is interesting to note that the prison officers who are going to look after these children if this project goes ahead are recruited under the general recruitment advertisement for prison officers.  I have an example of that advertisement here, dated the 26 October 1977.  It advertises for prison officers (male) and it includes that they could be appointed to various places such as Portlaoise, Arbour Hill, or Loughan House, <i>et cetera.</i>  Included in this advertisement are requirements about special physical attributes:</P>
    <P>At the time of the medical examination referred to in regulation 3, candidates must be of good physique, with satisfactory chest development, and be not less than 5' 7&rdquo; in height (barefooted).</P>
    <P>It also requires that they must not have any eyesight defects.  What is wanted are big burly prison officers with good eyes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from the general advertisement in the newspaper of 26 October 1977 for prison officers.  I gather that apparently these prison officers are getting three <Col N="451" /> months instruction in child care.  The Minister thinks that that is somehow going to transform them into people who have an understanding of the deep problems of the most difficult children who need care, whereas those who are professionally trained with a great practical experience are finding difficulty and in particular those involved in the residential homes and the special schools.  These people need to be encouraged to take on more of these difficult boys.  They are people with long practical experience and also with specialist knowledge and dedication. You cannot convert a prison officer in a period of three months into an expert in child care and a proper person to have care of children in this way.</P>
      <P>The most important factor is not so much the training but the selection of personnel in the first place.  These people are not selected at all.  They are just responding to a general advertisement for prison officers.  I think their use in Loughan House is a deplorable situation.  However, as I say, the Minister managed to reconcile the difficulties and the objections of prison officers and he has established this instant training process in the Mountjoy Training Centre.</P>
      <P>In case it might be thought that I exaggerate my concern and alarm at the decision, let us have a look at some of the responses by various interested and specialists groups to the Minister's approach.  I have referred already to the Press release by CARE.  I would like also to refer to a subsequent statement by the Chairman of CARE, reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 25 November 1977 as follows:</P>
      <P>The Chairman of CARE, Mr. Andrew Logue, said yesterday that his organisation was confused and disturbed by announcements from Government Ministers on a child detention centre.  They seem to be made without reference to each other and not within the context of an overall plan for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal was severely criticised by the Irish Association for Social Workers in a long letter on their behalf by Mary Harding which objected <Col N="452" /> to the use of Saint Patrick's Institution. Subsequently, on 10 February last, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>, the association was critical of the proposal for Loughan House:</P>
    <P>Calling for a review of the situation, the body says that the proposal is not in keeping with the Interim Report of the Task Force Committee which recommended the establishment of secure accommodation as part of or attached to open residential facilities, under the authority of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>The Committee at the time also stressed that the matter of &ldquo;secure accommodation&rdquo; should be approached with caution &ldquo;lest the provision of a facility of this type might encourage people to attempt to solve the problem of the difficult boy simply by putting him away&rdquo;.  The Association of Social Workers says that these discussions point to a lack of the planning and co-operation necessary in any caring programme for deprived children.</P>
    <P>Similarly, using almost identical language and expressing the same concern, the Association of Workers for Children in Care, AWCC, are reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 15 February last as having criticised this policy, criticised it in very strong terms.  That association stated that: &ldquo;What is needed is a nationally based programme of research which would be a base for a realistic and professional approach to this problem on which could be based a dynamic scheme of quality care for such difficult children&rdquo;.  One of the most outspoken individual critics of the proposal is Mr. Tom Clancy, lecturer in residential child care in the School of Social Education in Sion Road, who has written a number of letters.</P>
    <P>In one of these letters he asked questions which I would be grateful if the Minister would deal with in his reply on this motion.  I will paraphrase his questions:</P>
    <P>1.  Can the Minister assure us that the secure unit planned for Lusk will in fact be built and opened?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> 2.  Can the Minister guarantee that this unit will be staffed by trained and experienced child care workers?</P>
    <P>3.  Can the Minister give details about how he proposes to assess the needs of those deprived and disturbed boys, and how he will set about providing for those needs?</P>
    <P>4.  What sort of outside consultants will be available to Loughan House to help with the clarification, implementation and monitoring of the task there?</P>
    <P>5.  Will there be anybody responsible for helping the staff to analyse and make sense of their day-to-day experience with these boys?</P>
    <P>These questions relate to the interim nature of Loughan House as a method of coping with these boys.  I should like to add to that list.  I would ask the Minister in his reply to give details of the cost of conversion of Loughan House at present?  What is the cost of that elaborate perimeter fence to make it a closed unit?  How many thousands of pounds are being spent at the moment on converting it into a closed unit to hold boys?  What is the maximum number of boys that are going to be sent there?  Originally, when he was talking about Saint Patrick's, the Minister mentioned 100 boys.  On what basis is that number reached?  What research was gone into this?  How are these boys going to be identified and what is the maximum number that can be sent there?  Does the Minister, know what the maximum number is likely to be?  Is he prepared&mdash;on the record&mdash;to fix an absolute ceiling at least, and then to see what may happen?  What kind of research will there be?  What kind of co-ordination?</P>
    <P>In being critical, as I have been, both of the original proposal for the use of Saint Patrick's and then of the modified proposal for Loughan House, it is necessary to suggest what the alternative approach should be.  The alternative is very much summarised as an alternative approach, because this is not a simple problem.  The basic difficulty about the Loughan House proposal is that it is a simplistic political response to a complex <Col N="454" /> human problem of need, of deprivation, and possibly involving severe health and social problems.  It is the sort of simplistic political response which may probably gain the Minister support at the grassroots at the moment.  People may feel that something is at least being done.  But I think the Minister has a responsibility neither to delude himself not to delude people who are feeling threatened and under pressure&mdash;who are perhaps panicing or deeply concerned about increasing crime and vandalism among young people&mdash;that this is the proper approach.</P>
    <P>The only valid response is to adopt a co-ordinated approach to child care under the overall jurisdiction of one Minister.  As I understood it, certainly under the Coalition, the Minister for Health has overall co-ordination and jurisdiction in child care, and the Minister for Education clearly has a role to play.  Indeed, I would remind the Minister that his responsibility in the matter largely stems from the fact that the age of criminal responsibility in Ireland is still seven years old.  That is why the Minister has jurisdiction.  If the age of criminal responsibility was to be 14 I do not think the Minister would even presume to intervene in this way.</P>
    <P>I would plead with him to change his mind even at this stage and not to go ahead with his proposal because it would have such a devastating effect on the existing approach to child care. It will not be good for the morale of those involved in the existing special schools and residential centres.  It will be a disincentive to these special schools to take on the more difficult children.  The people working in them need better resources and help, and they need recognition of their dedication. Above all, they need to be encouraged to deal with the more difficult boys and not to refuse to cope with them.  What is needed is the implementation of the task force recommendations on this problem.  I would therefore plead with the Minister not to go ahead with this decision.  If he chooses to go ahead with it, I think I must issue a warning, and the warning is that if an order is made transferring <Col N="455" /> a child under 16 to Loughan House, then, in my view it is quite possible that that order would be challenged on constitutional grounds because&mdash;no matter what the Minister may say in his reply about Loughan House&mdash;it is intended to be a place for the custody and control of these children.  It is intended to be a prison.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will not in his reply&mdash;which I am now going to allow him to make&mdash;start to give a tourist brochure discription of Loughan House.  I do not want to know how many acres there are, or about the lakeside there.  I know what it is to be.  It is to be a prison staffed by prison officers having the control of children who are in need of special care and special support, who will be far away from their own community and their own families, with no possibility of leading a normal integrated life.  It is more likely to be a breeding ground for hardened criminals than a deterrent and it will not solve the problems either for the youngsters or society itself.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Senator.  It is a pity that the Senator did not preserve her political independence if she wants to adopt that holier-than-thou attitude she would like to have us believe she can afford to adopt here tonight.  It is just not good enough. With regard to the first allegation she made about the lack of consultation, because of the fact that I have only <Col N="456" /> eight or nine minutes at my disposal to deal with what she said, I can describe that allegation in one word and that is &ldquo;rubbish&rdquo;.  If the Senator went to the trouble of asking, before she seemingly made up her mind, as to what the situation is, perhaps then, if she had a case to make, she might have made it in a far less emotive and harmful way.  It is very easy for people to stand up and say that what has happened, that the step taken was a step back and, not alone a step back, she said, but a giant retrograde step.  It reminds me of the Pontius Pilate attitude. She forgets that for a long time she and her new party were in a position to do something to deal with this very serious problem and they did nothing about it.</P>
      <P>It is also very interesting to note from what the Senator said that she has no worry, anxiety or concern at all for the old people, the people who have suffered the muggings, the people who have had their rooms broken into and the people who have been kicked all over the place.</P>

      <P>It was the Senator who raised the hares.  I will state the facts, not chase the hares.  For a considerable time the activities of young boys and young girls in certain parts of the country, including Dublin, have been attracting the headlines.  Accounts of muggings and assaults, acts of serious vandalism carried out by boys and girls in the age group up to 16, have become commonplace and it is a known fact that the Garda are powerless to deal with this problem, since the courts have nowhere to send boys at that age, who either will not be accepted in the special schools for delinquents maintained on behalf of <Col N="457" /> the Department of Education or, indeed, if accepted, can and do easily abscond and commit further offences. The Government, on assuming office, decided that the problem was an extremely serious one and one that should be tackled without delay.  The Department of Education had traditionally been charged with the responsibility for the provision of accommodation for the residential care of delinquents in the under 16 age group.  That Department intended to provide secure schools for the unruly boys referred to but they had not made any progress with their plans, none whatever, at the time of the change of Government.  Might I say to the Senator that, if she wants to give a lesson to anybody, she should give it to those who are sitting near her, because when they had the opportunity in Government of doing something, they did nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the problem which I am trying to tackle here is due to delay.  It is in part due to a decision of the former Government to entrust in 1974 to a task force the problem of devising a new charter for children involving, among other things, the drafting of legislation to replace the Children's Act 1908.  That decision involved a clamp-down on the plans of the Department of Education at that time. The public were led to believe that the work entrusted to the task force could be done in three months, though anyone who really knew the problems involved would have known that the time scale was ludicrous.  When the task force did make its short interim report in September 1975, money was not made available for a variety of services recommended.  The Government of the day, part of which were the Labour Party, to which Senator Robinson now belongs, refused to make money available to deal with the problem.  Yet she takes it upon herself to lecture us here this evening.  One of the recommendations of the task force was a reiteration of the Henchy Committee recommendation for the provision of a new special school for troublesome boys under 16 years.  On the change of Government, the Department of Education had no premises <Col N="458" /> that could be adapted for use even as an interim measure as a secure custodial facility, and they failed to find such premises.  It was against this background that I, as Minister for Justice, was asked by my colleagues to find a place and to provide staff for it in order to deal with the problem on an <i>ad interim</i> basis.</P>
    <P>Concomitantly the Department of Education have established a project team, on which my Department and I are represented, despite what the Senator would like to think, and this project team is planning a new permanent facility for the boys in question. The planning of the new institution is well under way&mdash;so far under way that we have recently, I believe, appointed a firm of architects to get the necessary architectural work done.  The projected time scale for this new project is three to four years.  Might I say to the Senator that the suggestion being made that I and my Department are taking over from the Department of Education in the matter of residential care of young offenders is without any foundation whatsoever?  The fact is that the Government are faced with an urgent problem which she and her party failed to face up to for a long period of time and refused to give the money to implement recommendations that were put to them.  The stark reality of the situation now is that only the Department of Justice can provide an immediate temporary solution.</P>
    <P>Having considered the options, Loughan House was chosen as the interim residential care facility.  The premises there are excellent.  The whole property compares very favourably with many first-class boarding schools. Anything less like the conventional idea of a prison would be hard to imagine.  But it has to be adapted to cater for disruptive youngsters.  The total cost of the adaptations and other improvements which, for various reasons, including long-term economic reasons, are being carried out simultaneously with the adaptations, is estimated to be somewhere in the region of £600,000.</P>
    <P>The strongest criticisms of the Loughan House project that have been voiced, not alone here tonight but in <Col N="459" /> recent weeks, relate to the staff who will be running it.  The term &ldquo;jailers&rdquo; has been used and we have had a description of &ldquo;big brawny-chested warders&rdquo; by Senator Robinson.  The facts need to be considered here.  Nobody will take up duty in Loughan who has not had a full training course as a prison officer, plus a special, carefully planned course of 12 weeks duration which has been tailormade for the job they will be doing.</P>

      <P>I refrained during the course of the Senator's 20-minute diatribe from interrupting her in any way, because I believed it was mannerly to do so.  I have one minute left. Please let me try to deal with some of the rubbish voiced by the Senator in her 20 minutes.  The training period involves a period in residence in one or other of the special schools and a variety of lectures, tutorials and project exercises.  If time permitted, more comprehensive training for the officers concerned would have been provided and it is hoped that it will be possible to arrange for on-going training after they take up duty.  Comparisons are invidious and one ought not be critical of services provided by other agencies, but those who have recently been suggesting <Col N="460" /> that nobody should be involved in the custodial care of young persons, who has not got the Department of Education Certificate in Child Care, or the certificate from the British Central Council for Education and Training in Social Sciences, or the equivalent, should remember that, out of a total of 54 child care workers in the three special schools being managed on behalf of the Department of Education, only 15 have such a qualification.</P>
      <P>The allegations made by Senator Robinson are extremely dangerous. They are headline-seeking allegations. She is willing to knock the whole scheme, irrespective of the consequences, to get the headlines.  If Senator Keating, who is sitting beside her, feels that I am hitting the nail on the head, then let Senator Keating at some stage or other tell his colleagues in the Seanad why he, as a member of the Government up to July 5&mdash;&mdash;</P>
