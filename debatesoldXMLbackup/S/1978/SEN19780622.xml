      <P>On the Order of Business, I understand that the House may be adjourning for the summer recess within the next two or three weeks and I wonder whether it is intended to give any time for the discussion on Item No. 19 on the Order Paper, the motion calling on the Government to introduce, as a matter of urgency, the comprehensive scheme of civil legal aid and advice. Since we last discussed that matter in the House there have been two developments. One was the publication of the Pringle Report and the other was the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the Mrs. Early case.  I think it is a matter of considerable urgency and I would like to know whether it is intended to give some time to discuss that motion before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator Molony, we endeavour to take one motion each month and the motion we hoped to take for June was a Labour Party motion.  We had hoped to take that last week but the Labour Party were not ready to take it and this week the Minister was not available to take the motion.  As regards this motion&mdash;a Fine <Col N="1000" /> Gael motion&mdash;at this stage I cannot say whether it will be taken before the recess or not.  I will speak to the Minister for Justice about it when he returns from Copenhagen.  We hope to have a debate on the Green Paper either in the first or second week in July.  We have not finally decided a date yet but it will be either of those two weeks, not next week.</P>

      <P>May I just say that it is an indication of the difficult job that we have in trying to deal with a Bill like this when we get it within 24 hours of being asked to put it through the House, when the Government amendments stretch to the extent they do stretch to?

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 4, line 37, to delete &ldquo;100&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;80&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a lot of discussion yesterday in the House as to the level of alcohol content in the blood and what level was acceptable and we have tabled an amendment to reduce the proposed limit of 100 to 80 and I think, in fairness, we should make it quite clear that we do not in any way want to adopt a &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; attitude about this.  We tabled the amendment because of the reports that have appeared which indicate, certainly from the United States and the United <Col N="1002" /> Kingdom, that people with an alcoholic content in their blood in excess of 50 milligrammes per 100 millilitres are likely to have their driving ability impaired. Studies from Indiana University suggest that somebody who has an alcoholic blood content of 100, the proposed level in the Bill, is six or seven times more likely to have an accident than somebody who has not taken any drink at all.  I accept that drink in that context is only one of many factors that cause accidents and I am quite prepared to withdraw the amendment if I am satisfied that 100 is an acceptable level. There was an argument against that yesterday in the sense that Senators said that they knew of cases where motorists had been found to be over the limit in a technical way and in fact were convinced they were quite capable of driving. I have personal experience of cases where the Garda were satisfied that somebody was capable of driving but nevertheless he was technically over the limit and consequently was convicted of the offence.  That is the dilemma.</P>
    <P>We tabled the amendment to have a discussion on this in an open way rather than any sort of an arrogant or dogmatic way but, having thought about it overnight.  I wonder whether we could have some system whereby, for example, up to a level of 80 a person is quite clear: over a level of, say, 120 if somebody were found to have such an alcoholic content in his blood the evidence against him would be conclusive evidence; and in the case of somebody found to have between 80 and 120 that evidence would be <i>prima facie</i> evidence against him.  If he could discharge the onus of proof we thrust upon him that he was capable of driving despite the fact that he had this level of alcohol in his blood he could not be convicted.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that is a practicable system.  I understand that it is in operation in some states in the United States of America and perhaps the Minister would like to comment on that. If I thought there was room for negotiation on that in the Dáil, I would be quite happy to withdrawn this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Senator is suggesting is that we might consider a two-their <Col N="1003" /> type of structure which they have in other countries and in the North of Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Germany and Sweden also have this system.  They vary from 50-150, 80-120.  We had 125 in the previous Act.  The average of those who were caught and convicted under that Act was around 200.  We have lowered it now to 100 in an effort to create a balance between the deterrent effect&mdash;which is very important and we hope it will be the major effect of this Bill&mdash;and the convictions.  Rather than introduce a two-tier type of structure which the Senator has suggested we think it will be more effective to lower it from 125 to 100 for those who are to be deterred and those who are convicted. We did consider this system and saw where it was operating in other countries where you have a less serious offence and a more serious offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what I am talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that but this is the way they operate it in some countries where the penalties vary between the lower and the higher.  But after a lot of discussion at all levels it was decided that the lowering of the existing figure would be more beneficial with a view to making the legislation more effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I think 100 is the highest level anywhere in Europe.  I am not sure of that but I do not know of any other country that has a higher level or a similar level to that.  It seems unreasonable that in Great Britain it should be 80, or on the Continent it should be 80 and considerably lower in some countries, and that here we can tolerate it at 100.  I accept that it should be brought down from 125 to 100 but I see that there are circumstances in which somebody with an alcoholic content in his blood of, say, between 80 and 100 might have his driving ability impaired and really that is what we are talking about.  We are not concerned in any absolute sense about the alcoholic content in somebody's blood.  We are concerned about the critical impairment so far as a person's driving is concerned and I am simply suggesting that we have 100 as <Col N="1004" /> the limit.  If you are over 100 it is conclusive evidence that you are incapable of driving consistent with safety standards and must be convicted.  I suggest, in order to keep it somewhat in line with Great Britain and with views that are definitely held right throughout the EEC countries, that where somebody is found to be between the level of 80 milligrammes and 100 milligrammes, that be <i>prima facie</i> evidence against him of his incapability of driving consistent with safety standards and that the onus of proof would be thrown on to him to prove that he was capable of driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything absolutely scientific involved in either the figure of 100 or 80. One is trying here to reach a reasonable level and, quite frankly, if you are going to discuss it purely on the basis of an impairment of driving ability you might equally ask: why not make it 60?  There might be a very logical argument in fact for making it a very low level indeed.  We are trying to reach a reasonable compromise and I think that we are going to find that the level of 100 is, in fact, a very severe level.  It will no longer be possible to go out and have more than a very few moderate drinks.  If we were to lower it below 100 what we would really be saying would be: no drinking at all. This is a slightly different situation.  I think that the figure of 100 is a very reasonable compromise in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not disagree with the proposition no drinking at all when it is put in the context of driving a motor car, particularly in modern traffic conditions.  The ultimate objective of this legislation is to diminish, and hopefully totally end, the awful casualties that are taking place on the roads today.  I do not think we could be too severe nor would the public object if we seem to be unduly severe or draconian in the limits that we provide.  When we consider what we are trying to prevent, when we consider what is happening and, as everybody here has experienced&mdash;hopefully not at first hand but at second or third hand&mdash;the tragedy that drink and driving can bring to individual households.  I <Col N="1005" /> do not think there is any argument about reducing the blood alcohol level to 80 and have it at least in line with our peers in the rest of Europe.  Why should we announce to the rest of Europe that we are prepared to tolerate a higher level of alcohol in the blood of our drivers? What justification is there for that? Senator Conroy says the whole thing is a myth but at least let us be on the same level as Europe if for no other reason than our reputation, but I submit that is not the only reason.  A far better reason is that the lower the level of permitted alcohol in the blood the less likelihood there is of damage being done to some unfortunate Irish citizen.</P>

      <P>Taking existing levels in Europe, 80 is the more common one now.  Denmark varies from 80 to 120, Finland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a two-tier system. The maximum is 150 for the more serious offence; Germany, 80 to 130, Sweden, 50 to 150.  The country that has one level only is the United States, 100. We are not the highest of the known countries: we are level with the US.  If you reduce it to 80 you are going to have a greater problem of enforcement of the law.  You will have to have far more gardai involved to enforce than you would at 100.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Because naturally, many more people will be caught under the 80.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>But, with respect&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not follow that they are incapable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am trying to provide for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is said this morning in some papers that if you drink three pints you will be incapable under the 100 level.  I did not relate it to the number of pints or &ldquo;half-ones&rdquo; at any stage but this <Col N="1006" /> is the way it seems to be coming over.  If you lower it to 80, you will limit the person possibly to one-and-a-half pints. If you do, in my opinion, that amount of drink would not make a man incapable. That is my personal opinion now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It might not, but it might in the special case that we want to avoid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We know it varies from person to person.  But we think that 100 is reasonable from both the deterrent point of view and the viewpoint of getting those who are incapable caught.  We are not the lowest nor the highest; as I have said we are on a level with the US. We are lower than some European countries for the higher offence.  We are lower than four of those for the more serious offence, much lower&mdash;in some cases 50 lower.  In our opinion 100 is about right.  It is worth a trial to see how we get on with this legislation.  We cannot guarantee it will be any more successful than the previous legislation but it is something that can be amended again if it is not working properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not try first to operate from the conservative point of view and try on the lower level and if that does not work successfully or produces any administrative difficulties then consider going back up?  Should our approach not be one of strictness having regard to the evil that we are trying to combat?  Should we not approach it from a strictness point?  That is the first point I have to make.  The second point is that I do not take the Minister's argument that lowering it to 80 will put strains on the personnel enforcing it. Initially, it might mean that the courts will be busy.  That is all.  But as soon as the message gets across that 80 is being enforced and that 80 means very little if any drinking, I think the business the courts will have to do would become very small indeed and what the Minister wants to secure&mdash;the deterrent effect &mdash;will be secured much more speedily and effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, obviously, a certain amount to be said for the limit of 80 and indeed many other <Col N="1007" /> countries have adopted it, but we should be clear in our minds as to what has been suggested.  Do we want to say that you cannot take a drink at all and drive? There is a great deal of logic for that suggestion.  But if so, the limit of 80 does not really satisfy us.  But if you are going to say that somebody can take a drink with a meal&mdash;I mean a drink, not several drinks; that will not be possible&mdash;and that seems a reasonable proposition, then you have to decide on some level and 100 will satisfy that level but will still be extremely severe.  If we are going to go much below the 100 I think the real logic is that we should say in no way are you allowed to drive if you have got alcohol.  If one wants to be that severe, then I think one really needs to go below the 80.  The 80 would not be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I would thank Senator Conroy and the Minister for making the case for the suggestion I made.  I am not for a moment suggesting anything about graded penalties so far as penalties or sanctions are concerned.  We are talking here about&mdash;I shall accept the level of 100&mdash;anybody above 100 is incapable of driving.  That is the proof of evidence in that regard.  The Minister has accepted, Senator Conroy has accepted, that it is severe but there is a case to be made&mdash;and clearly I am not an expert in this.  I assume that the Senator would know a lot more about it than I do.  But taking them at their face value, and nobody has contradicted them, people have said: let us not be too harsh on ourselves.  All I say is: is it not worth while considering providing in the measure that if somebody is between 60 and 100 or 80 and 100, whatever drink he has had, that is <i>prima facie</i> evidence against him but if, after that he can show that despite being between 60 and 100 he was capable of driving a car consistent with safety standards it shall be a defence?  Surely that will solve the problem because the reality is that what we are concerned with is not simply in an absolute sense, as I have already said, the alcoholic content of somebody's blood; that means nothing.  In its own way it is an indicator but of itself it is nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> I am suggesting that if it is going to be designed between 60 and 80 or 100, whatever it is to be, let us have some room to manoeuvre and let us say to somebody: &ldquo;The position is that we take a blood sample and if we are satisfied that the alcoholic content in your blood is 84 or whatever it is you must then satisfy the court that you were capable of driving a car on the occasion in question&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, perhaps, the point of all this idea of having measurements of the alcohol level in the blood is surely so that we can have some objective standard and get away from the idea of a general debate as to whether or not the person is intoxicated and unable to drive and control a vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>But yesterday you made the point of this absolute technicality about it and I agree with that.  I think there is room for manoeuvre there somewhere and that is why I am suggesting this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that once you go much below the 100 you are really getting into the situation in which you certainly would have, I think, a very logical case to say: we will not have anyone taking any alcohol at all and driving.  Perhaps we shall have to bring in some such measure in due course.  But if you are going to allow this drink programme you must have some sort of standard.  It seems to me that 100 is a reasonable standard to set, as the Minister has suggested.  Perhaps we will have to become even more severe in due course.  Let us try this because it is a major change from 125 to 100 and at 125 by and large most lay people will probably agree that a person was drunk, that he was incapable of driving a car. We are now coming down to a level at which in relative terms many people will not consider that that person was drunk although at the suggested measure of the level of alcohol in his blood he will be convicted.  This is very severe.  I think we are really going towards the stage of saying &ldquo;any alcohol at all&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that this Bill will be a lawyers' paradise.  The situation in relation to this is limited; there is no defined limit at which you can say a person is incapable.  If there were we would all agree that that is the limit that should be in the Bill.  Yesterday we spoke about habitual drugs and social drinkers and the difference in approach and the difference in the tolerance of both sections of people.  So, there are various levels and there is no perfect level.  When we speak about people being incapable, there are people incapable of driving at the moment driving around the city and there is no drink at all involved.  There are more factors in question in regard to incapability in driving than were indicated by the Senator.  I think that the limit laid down in the Bill is reasonable and must get a reasonable chance.  It would be no harm to get an assurance from the Minister that if the limit is considered at some stage to be too high then he would seriously consider at the earliest possible moment rectifying the situation or reducing the limit. If the Minister is asked to give that assurance, it might satisfy the Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it was the purpose of this Bill in the first instance to catch anybody out or inflict penalties on anybody.  One of the main objects, I imagine, is to train people to see the disastrous consequences of overdrinking, but in order to make the idea workable certain limits must be indicated. As it is, according to my information the reduction from 125 to 100 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood has come as a great shock and it would be desirable that this legislation would be accepted in good grace by everybody concerned.  If the figure was reduced to 80&mdash;and I am not against reducing it to 80 or even less&mdash;I can foresee great disquiet and a certain amount of antagonism toward this legislation.  People will say: 100 was enough; why crucify us completely?  That is a very important consideration in any Bill: it must be made acceptable.  If a Bill is not acceptable to the public it will be very difficult to enforce it.  All things taken into consideration, especially the figures given by the Minister himself which <Col N="1010" /> showed the tolerance in the case of Sweden between 50 at the lower level to 150 at the upper level, I think the figure of 100 is quite reasonable.</P>

      <P>You can argue theories here until tomorrow morning and you would not have the perfect answer.  I think that practicability if implementing the law is the criterion should be foremost in mind when you are thinking about setting levels.  I totally disagree with Senator Molony when he said that we should leave more room for manoeuvre.  We realise who would be doing the manoeuvring; it would be actually the biggest culprit who would be doing the most manoeuvring.  If you leave room for manoeuvring and if you do not make throughly clear your intention to set a sensible, practical limit to which you can apply the rigour of the law and which is generally accepted, you can go overboard.  I certainly think that you have to be practical here and if you have a reasonable, sensible basis for it, you will get more people to accept the law when it is passed.  There will be situations where people will be convicted and representations will be made on hardships of the family and the hardships of a man losing his driving job, and all of this will be part of the whole follow-up to the new Bill. Therefore, as my friend Senator Cranitch says, it is very important that the public understand that there is a reasonable approach from the Minister, the Department and from everybody concerned.  I think that you could add difficulty to the Bill if you go down to 80 as suggested.  You can certainly accept that in some cases 80 would be too much and you could go lower, but you must strike a fair balance that is accepted by the general public.  I think that the Bill is an improvement and that the limit of 100 is a reasonable level.</P>

Under section 49 of the 1968 Act, now re-enacted in section 10, if the gardaí believe that a person is incapable of driving&mdash;even though he does not register the required 100&mdash;he can be charged and brought to court on the clinical evidence that existed under the previous Act.

It would not arise where what is known as the &ldquo;bag&rdquo; is concerned.

      <P>This is the problem.  As I read the Bill, unless I have misread it, if somebody is breath analysed and the print-out is produced, there is no obligation on the gardaí to have a urine or blood sample or even look for one.  A person can be convicted on the result of the breath analysis test alone, as I read the Bill.  If somebody who believes he is quite sober is stopped by the gardaí and undergoes the breath analysis test and if the print-out shows he is above the limit, the gardaí have no obligation to take a blood test or to call a doctor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>At 11 p.m. it might be extremely difficult to do that.  This is a very serious charge against somebody and I accept that we have to deal with this in a severe way but I do not regard that as a practical way out at all.  Even if the person goes to a doctor there can be no evidence whatever as to the continuity of events&mdash;a very important matter when it comes before the court. There is only one way out of it, as I would see it, and that is on taking a breath analysis test where somebody is found to be over the limit, then a doctor must be called by the gardaí and a blood or urine sample must be taken.  We are taking the right of decision-making from our courts.  There is only one defence a motorist has and that is to give his sample so that it can be analysed independently and there can be a contest about it subsequently in court if it transpires that there is a difference between the two results.  As I read the Bill, there is no provision made at all for somebody who on the breath analysis test is found to be over the limit.  That is intolerable.</P>

      <P>In the North of Ireland people are being convicted on the print-out alone.  The Senator probably realises that if a person is brought in at 11 p.m. and believed to be incapable because of excess alcohol, it may not be very easy to find a doctor, as experience has taught us.  We are out to make this Bill effective and to get rid of a lot of the prescribed procedures which existed in the last Act which led to the fact that it became ineffective and had to be suspended.  This is working successfully where the alcometer is used in the North of Ireland.  That is the nearest example I can give the Senator.  The alcometer is not in use here yet.  It could have been in use long before this new Bill because the provision was made for that type of apparatus in the 1968 Act but it has not been used as yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is now telling the House is that for a person to have a defence, he is going to have to refuse some of the requirements under the Bill.

      <P>That would not be conclusive evidence.  It would not even be reasonable evidence because, first he must go and find a doctor and he would have to do it within a reasonable time.  I do not know what sort of time limit would be acceptable.  We are putting a person in a very invidious position.  I think that the fair way to deal with this is where somebody is found to be over the level as a result of the breath analysis machine, a doctor should be called.  The gardai should call a doctor and take a blood sample which the person could have independently examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>There are all sorts of possibilities.  This is the whole problem. When the onus of proof is on the State, they would have to show that the machine was in order.  I accept that in the vast majority of cases the machine would be correct.  I am not suggesting for a moment that anybody is going to abuse this.  But remember that an individual is being put in a position where he cannot defend himself except by refusing to follow the requirements of the legislation.  If the onus of proof were on the State to show that the machine was all right, I would accept that.  I would sit down here quite happily.  But where the onus of proof is put on to a defendant to show that the machine was incorrect, that is an impossible onus to discharge.  How would he know what is wrong with the machine in question?  It is because of this shift of onus of proof that I am sticking to this so hard.</P>

      <P>Surely there is a totally different situation here.  In one you have an apparatus from which you get an immediate print-out.  If the person concerned believes he is not drunk he can take steps to contest the matter.  In the question of taking a blood sample, there your have something which is not going to be analysed immediately and it is only correct and proper that two samples be provided so as to make certain that no error or confusion has occurred during the prolonged procedure between the sample being obtained and the actual result coming back to the interested parties. <Col N="1017" /> With the print-out you are immediately in a position to take steps to contest it if you so wish but you are not in that situation with a blood or urine sample.

That is not a valid argument, because it is not true to say that a person has time to do it.  There is a limitation on it.  If I were to go out and an hour and a half later get a doctor&mdash;it is extremely difficult to get a doctor at that hour at night&mdash;the State's case immediately is that I had sobered up two hours later, that I went off and had a meal before I saw the doctor.  It is worn out.  It is a very serious matter when you shift the onus of proof on to people.  You must allow for some independent way of enabling such persons to defend their case and they are being denied that in this instance. It might end up in the High Court on a constitutional basis and that would be worth a lot more to the lawyers.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  One has to prove on a technical basis &mdash; and it is on the technical basis that one is asked to do it &mdash; that the alcoholic content in the blood was less than 100 milligrammes. If I went in and said I had 25 pints or one pint or no pint it would be no indication at all of what the alcoholic content in my blood was on a technical basis.</P>

      <P>Presumably the main purpose of this is to prevent any avoidance.  It does genuinely happen that people are perhaps sometimes mistakenly given brandy at the scene of a road accident and if that person subsequently had a blood sample taken and it was agreed that the level in that sample was, shall we say, 102 milligrammes per 100 millilitres that would be above the 100 milligrammes.  However, that person would be able to produce lay or medical evidence that, in fact, he had taken brandy and I do not think it would be beyond the powers of an analyst to suggest that such and such quantity of alcohol would be capable of increasing the blood level by that 2 milligrammes: <Col N="1021" /> in other words, that there was some evidence that but for the drinking of that brandy he would have been below the 100 milligrammes per 100 millilitres.  He would certainly be able to put forward some case, I would imagine, on technical grounds.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately the commission on drunken driving which sat some years ago have an entire chapter on how unreliable it is to rely on the evidence suggested by Senator Conroy simply because of the fact that everybody is affected in different ways depending on his condition and on how he feels.</P>

      <P>We are talking of something else.  We are talking about something very specific here, evidence that there has been consumption of a certain amount of alcohol at a given time and whether or not it is possible that that would move to a level above the 100, granted that one knows the exact level already.  Clearly if the level was, shall we say, 150 there is no way that one could indicate that it could possibly have risen, but if you have a marginal case in which a person is just about at the limit and if you have evidence that that person has been given alcohol, it is certainly more than reasonable that he should have a case to present.  What the Senator is referring to regarding the commission is just in general terms and is quite irrelevant to this.</P>

      <P>The problem as I see it is that this is a matter to be judged by a court and, unfortunately, the way the section is worded it would not enable a court, in my view, to have the discretion that Senator Conroy suggests.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the blackguard who has a half bottle in his pocket to knock back when the guard comes should be protected.  There is always the situation where someone is given brandy, or indeed where a drug is administered to somebody, that might have the effect of driving the alcohol content in his blood up above the limit.</P>

The opportunities that solicitors or barristers got in the past to go through the regulations item by item are being denied them in the future, and properly so.  I have no doubt about that. I would hope that the Minister or the Department of Justice have within the Garda force very definite and stringent regulations as to how this procedure is to take place.  I know this is not a matter which will be open to question in open court from now on unless a defendant can show that an improper procedure was adopted and prove it himself.  Where such responsibility is being given to the Garda I have no doubt that they will discharge their responsibilities to the best of their ability as they have always done in the past.  They have a very heavy responsibility and every effort should be made to ensure that there will be no room for mistakes or errors of judgement in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one question I want to ask.  I am concerned that subsection (3) has the effect of treating the person with 30 per cent of the shares in a private company as having control of that company.  It is certain that this is not true.  In the vast majority of cases the control of the private company is only exercised by the holder of the majority of shares in the company. A minority may stipulate on taking shares particular rights which would attach to the shares he had which, if they are in excess of 25 per cent, will be protected by provisions of the articles.  I am concerned that legislation might suggest that the Houses of the Oireachtas mistakenly thought that in the normal case within a private company majority control can be exercised by the holder of 30 per cent.  The 30 per cent figure comes from what is known as the take-over panel positions where persons getting 30 per cent of the shares of a quoted company are then, by virtue of the provisions of the take-over panel, under obligation to bid for the rest of the shares of the company.  It is not a control position; it is an obligation which arises from their taking 30 per cent though, it arises because in a public company if they have 30 per cent factually, in most cases we give control and that is the reason for the provision. Would the Minister assist the House and the people who have to study this legislation afterwards by giving the reason for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Senator FitzGerald has said that in the case of private companies the 30 per cent shareholding would not normally give control because normally it requires a 51 per cent shareholding.  One reason for the retention of the 30 per cent in the <Col N="1027" /> case of private companies is to prevent the possibility of circumventing the Bill. It should be remembered that in the 1974 Bill it was 20 per cent and it was then raised to 25 per cent and as a result of a Government amendment in the Dáil it now stands at 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is not desirable to have different standards for different classes of enterprises and I am sure Senator FitzGerald would agree with that. Furthermore, I believe that the vast majority of private companies would have assets and turnovers below the threshold and would, therefore, be outside the scope of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make one point on this section, having spoken at length in objection to the gross assets figure and the turnover figure.  I do not want to dwell on this aspect, however inadequately we may have dealt with it on Second Reading.  I have already made my point there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention, through the Chair, to subsection (4) and to ask if the Minister is able to give us an understanding that this is not going to be understood as a policy decision that, for the future, we are only going to adjust the gross asset figures of £1¼ million or the turnover figure of £2½ million by the cost of living increase or if the cost of property increases; that if in the operation of this Bill, it is found, as I and everybody who has spoken on this Bill have said, that these figures are inadequately low, and they will create a great burden of administrative work which will do nobody any good, this subsection will be availed of to get us out of these limitations.  In 1978 terms that £1¼ million may be made £5 million or, as they are proposing to make it in the United Kingdom, £8 million.  In other words the Minister will at least allow the policy option that the figures could be very greatly increased and that this will not be another <i>Parkinson</i> giving rise to an extension <Col N="1028" /> of staff to cope forever with figures that are, in administration, found to be wrong.  If the critics of these figures are right, adjustments will be made and the full power contained in this subsection will be used and it will not merely be a question of adjusting annually or biannually for cost of living increases and for property value increases.  The subsection seems to be a way of getting out of this trap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>

      <P>Senator FitzGerald is right in assuming that these would not just be adjusted because, as he said, of increases in the cost of living and so on.  It is important, however, that the provision, as Senator Conroy said, must be there.  These figures may be reviewed from time to time and, in practice, it might be found that the figures are too low.  The Senator would agree though that in the 1974 Bill the Minister had the power to decrease or increase.  It is most desirable now to remember that the powers now are to increase these limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like it to be thought that Senator Alexis FitzGerald is the only one who thinks the specified limits are too low.  I do not go along with the rather extreme position he took up last week when he said that the Bill is unnecessary. Even though we have joined the EEC and there is EEC legislation on the way, we still need some residual, national provision or precaution against abuse.  I recall vividly going into a lion's den some years ago of take-over gentlemen where the notorious Jim slater enjoyed the company of some prominent Irish financial enterpreneurs.  I pointed out to rather reluctant listeners that there could well be, at least in relation to the kind of operations they were engaged in, shell companies and conglomerate building, a conflict between the objective <Col N="1029" /> of private gain and social good.  I made the point there that, unless there was a commitment to much improved management in relation to the take-over, there was a presumption that private gain was the predominant consideration.  Indeed, some of the events that have taken place since in relation to shell companies and conglomerates have proved that point.</P>
      <P>There was another point that I made on that occasion which is still valid, namely, that a great deal of damage could be caused to Irish output and employment if foreign enterprises were able to achieve a completely dominant position in the distributive trades.  I have in mind in particular the importance of the orders placed by the major supermarkets with Irish industry.</P>
      <P>This is something which we will not be able to influence very much longer.  The retention, in so far as we can, of control over distribution outlets in Irish hands is a way of ensuring greater loyalty towards Irish suppliers than if we had to allow the control of distribution outlets to pass entirely into foreign hands. When I consider that aspect I find the figure for turnover mentioned in this Bill absolutely absurd.  Two-and-a-half million pounds is very small fry indeed in this business, because most of the major supermarkets and chainstores and so on are now enjoying turnovers which are a multiple of 20 to 40 times this £2½ million. If I take that as a measure it seems to me that these levels from which we are starting are much too low.  This carries with it the real risk that a considerable amount of Ministerial and departmental time and effort will be engaged in dealing with small cases out of proportion to the national interest.  It also carries the risk that local and secondary considerations may be brought to bear in trying to influence decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, in subsection (5), an over-riding power to the Minister to intervene irrespective of any specified limits in relation to any proposed class of merger or take-over.  Although the word &ldquo;classes&rdquo; is used there, my experience is that a class can always be defined so as to include the particular case or cases one has in mind.  I would like the Minister to reconsider <Col N="1030" /> the specified thresholds with a view to raising them substantially, bearing in mind the over-riding power, in subsection (5), to ignore the limits where a particular case warrants it in the national interest.</P>

A condition would probably be, however, that the enterprise concerned should divest itself of any shares above the 30 per cent limit it had acquired.

      <P>This is a section <Col N="1033" /> on which I will only say a few words.  It is unfortunate, and I would like to be on record as saying so, that there is no provision for what, in EEC language, is called a negative clearance.  This is where somebody about to make a substantial investment is in an apparent monopoly position and is afraid of incurring substantial investment &mdash; I am talking about at least one particular case &mdash; because by doing so he may be creating a potential competitor for himself where he extends his monopoly and, because he has done so, that monopoly can be divided up and that plant can go into competition with him. This induces a degree of uncertainty for him in that operation.  It could also affect more modest investments where there are monopolies in smaller situations which could be backed up by big investments. The Minister should have taken the power to give an undertaking that during the normal investment life of a particular investment that, provided the recipient of the undertaking behaved himself and complied with the conditions which were laid down before he got his clearance, that his monopoly could not be broken up.  It cannot be broken up at the moment but it can be broken up from the time this Bill is enacted.  It is recognised already in the definition section that not all monopolies are necessarily bad because it has exempted particular institutions.  There may be, in the developing economy that we have, and hopefully much greater growth and progress will take place, many more such situations where people will hesitate.  It is no good saying that the Minister of the day says it is OK because the Minister of the day has only such power as the Oireachtas gives him, unless it derives from his position as Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, whatever that may infer.  In the normal way he will only have such powers as the Statute gives him and it is unfortunate that the Statute does not empower him, in effect, to extend the exemption in particular cases under control, subject to the condition, the extension of the exclusion which is already in the Bill in relation to export-oriented industries. I want to place my views on that matter on record.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be wise to accept Senator FitzGerald's point that negative gains should be given because I can envisage a situation where many monopolies would make a protest to the Minister to get negative clearance and these would probably have to be investigated by the examiner and in turn by the Restrictive Practices Commission.  It is not the intention of the Minister &mdash; and I think we made this clear on the Second Stage &mdash; to investigate all monopolies, only such monopolies as he may be worried about.</P>
      <P>As well, during the period of clearance the monopolies would have the way cleared for them or would be free to indulge in mischief without the threat of being broken up.  Therefore it is wise to keep the threat of being broken up, not that I would hope that any monopolies would be broken up &mdash; the Minister would hope that in fact none would be, that the situation would not arise where that became necessary.  But if conditions were attached to such clearances, and obviously there would have to be, these could be onerous and lengthy and I feel the provision should stand.</P>

      <P>I want to make a point on this section which I should have made earlier &mdash; it still remains orderly for me to make it on section 17.  I believe I am right in thinking that this is casting some shadow or creating some uncertainty in business from the point of view of how it will be operated, how people will be affected by it.  It would be very useful, to eliminate uncertainty, if the Minister would say now what the policy will be in the great majority of cases and how she will so organise her Department that the what I will call the very-quickly-indeed people in planning mergers and take-overs will get notification in writing from the <Col N="1035" /> Minister that it is all right, and that we will be talking about, not months or weeks, but days, in the communication of that.  If we made a statement to this effect I think confidence would be increased, which would be a desirable thing to have.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for this Bill arises from Mr. W. Garfield Weston's very generous gift to the State of his property &mdash; Barretstown Castle and adjoining land of some 520 acres at Ballymore Eustace, County Kildare. The gift includes the contents of the castle and a sum of £100,000 by way of permanent endowment for the purpose of discharging the outgoings on the property.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in the other House on behalf of the present Government, I should again like to endorse the expression of thanks made to Mr. Garfield Weston by the then Taoiseach when acknowledging acceptance of the gift in March 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangements for the processing of the gift which is being funded by the Garfield Weston Charitable Foundation include the setting up of Barretstown Castle Trust and it is proposed that the <Col N="1036" /> Commissioners of Public Works will be the trustees of this trust.  The legal advice which was obtained was to the effect that the commissioners have no statutory power to act as trustees or to nominate trustees in a case such as this.</P>
    <P>Legislation to enable the commissioners to act as trustees is accordingly necessary, and the Bill provides for this. The Bill also contains a clause enabling the commissioners in general terms to accept the trusteeship of any other trust with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  It seems appropriate to take the present opportunity to give them this power which they have not had up to now.</P>
    <P>The Barretstown Castle Trust is being administered by the trustees of the Garfield Weston Irish Foundation until the commissioners can undertake the trust. The Irish National Stud Company are using the land and farm buildings on a rental basis and the question of the future of the house is being examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">

      <P>We take pleasure in supporting the Bill and welcoming this generous gift from Mr. Weston.  The value of the property is substantial.  The gift also includes the contents and a substantial sum of money towards maintenance. We recognise the legislative necessity to enable the commissioners to act as trustees, and the Bill obviously is for this reason.</P>
      <P>On a wider plane there have been suggestions &mdash; indeed the Taoiseach was one of those who suggested it &mdash; let us say in fairness to him that he said it from the distance of the Opposition benches so that obviously there is no personal issue involved as far as he is concerned; speaking for myself, because we have not discussed it as a party, I support his views completely &mdash; that there is an obvious necessity for some type of official residence for the Taoiseach of the day, and though a definitive decision may not have been made by the Government concerning this property, it would seem entirely appropriate that the property might be used for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have certain anomalies in these matters.  For instance, we have a magnificent residence for the President in Aras an Uachtaráin.  Yet the <Col N="1037" /> Taoiseach, in his extremely difficult and prestigious position has not an equivalent premises.  This creates many problems because although official hosting of certain events &mdash; people visiting from other countries or possibly complimenting people within our own country for certain achievements &mdash; may take place in Aras an Uachtaráin, they would be guests of the President, but in so far as they may be guests of the Taoiseach, or guests of the Government, or in so far as there are other initiatives which the Taoiseach might wish to pursue, which might, perhaps, have social connotations, he should have an official residence.  For example, not so very long ago we had the generous offer of Lord Iveagh of his property to the Government to host a major EEC conference.  It was most generous of Lord Iveagh to have lent his property for this purpose but in the long-term it is a very unsatisfactory position for the Government to find itself in.</P>
    <P>Additionally there are obviously security problems where the Taoiseach is concerned and it would seem to me that the security authorities would welcome the possibility of a property such as this being used by the Taoiseach, thereby giving them the opportunity to carry out the necessary screening.</P>
    <P>We welcome this Bill, which is enabling the commissioners to act as trustees but on a broader plane the country would be receptive to the use of this property as an official residence for the Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Government side I should like to join in welcoming Mr. Weston's extremely generous gift to the State.  It is a very fine residence and property and perhaps as Senator Staunton has suggested it could be used for the purposes mentioned by the then Leader of the Opposition.  I would certainly agree with Senator Staunton that there is a need for some such property, some such place, where guests can be appropriately welcomed when they come to this country.  We are <Col N="1038" /> very lacking in this respect and we have, indeed, been very much in the debt of private individuals on a very <i>ad hoc</i> basis so far.  It is a simple fact of the EEC relationship and, indeed, of other developing relationships, that more and more visits by heads of State, by Government delegations, by various bodies and so on, are likely to take place and that in effect we do need to have some suitable place.  Whether or not Barretstown Castle would be suitable or not is, of course, another question.</P>
      <P>I do not think it does in many ways set an excellent precedent in the giving of this property to the State and also, one should add as well, the sum of £100,000 which is being given as a permanent endowment for the purpose of maintaining the estate.  There is, however, an even greater principle &mdash; and I am delighted to see the Government has taken note of this &mdash; and that is that it is not to be regarded as a one-off matter but that the Commissioners of Public Works who are given authority for this one particular property, are also being given a wider power which hopefully will be of considerable benefit in future.  Certainly it is very necessary.  Again I welcome the Bill and Mr. Weston's gift.</P>
